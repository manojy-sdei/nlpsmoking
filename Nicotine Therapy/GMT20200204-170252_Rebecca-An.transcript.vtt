Paul Johnson: Charger similar um

231
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.310

232
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was the older

233
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.670

236
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

237
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.720
Paul Johnson: And, you know, kind of weird, but

238
00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.980
Paul Johnson: You close by anyway.

239
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.220
Paul Johnson: While I knew what I know now.

240
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.450
Yeah.

241
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.820
Paul Johnson: I would have cut a lot more school

242
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:15.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is there anything that we didn't touch base on that you think is important. We know about you.

243
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:20.700
Paul Johnson: Um, do you think there's ever going to be another lady.

244
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know what

245
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.730
Paul Johnson: Another moon landing

246
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know.

247
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.750
Paul Johnson: Rather, that no I can't really think game.

248
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So, um, what do you want to work on while you're in treatment. What are some of the things you think you need to work on.

249
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.870
Paul Johnson: Oh, thinking about when turbans as

250
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.660
Paul Johnson: Well pump some Maria Village and we're pumping water up

251
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:55.620
Paul Johnson: I don't know, I, oh, you mean for my rehabilitation. I don't know. I'm pretty much just a straight and saying that a prison.

252
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: relapse prevention.

253
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.460
Paul Johnson: Uh, yeah, that one. Yeah.

254
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

255
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.470
Paul Johnson: I didn't, I didn't see that box to check. But yeah, that's the one I would have checked in.

256
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.550
Paul Johnson: Prevention. The third one down on the right.

257
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:18.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, so, uh, you know, that I think what makes it really tough is that you're the environment that you live in, you know, is is

258
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:18.990
Paul Johnson: You know,

259
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:37.140
Paul Johnson: What it is, it's like, I mean, when I get out. I mean, when I get off parole or probation or whatever, I'm still going to be in the same place. You know, if I really plan on staying clean, which I wasn't my goal at first, but I'm like, I like this boxing thing and it definitely definitely works.

260
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:48.780
Paul Johnson: But, um, you know, it's like I'm still gonna be around the same people. I'm not giving up my friends. You know who killed and died for me and everything else, you know, the years to

261
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:58.440
Paul Johnson: Oh, I'm quitting getting high. So you know I want them to. That's not me. You know, like they're my friends till I die. And I'm not going to quit hanging around them just because I

262
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.060
Paul Johnson: And I get loaded. I mean, you're gonna have to learn to say no and just go with the flow or

263
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.850
Paul Johnson: Playing on and never having a

264
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.550
Paul Johnson: sober living

265
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.500
Paul Johnson: Anything.

266
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you're doing a great job. I just want to tell you that

267
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:27.390
Paul Johnson: It then toboggan. You're doing a great job. That's just a mom. I'm like, trying to talk to friends into it that are thinking about

268
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:36.060
Paul Johnson: Swapping to the other side. And I'm actually trying to help. It's like, oh no, and I hope they don't hang me with the rest of the day.

269
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

270
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.630
Paul Johnson: Just keep it never know.

271
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.630
Paul Johnson: What anti druggie hanging on the

272
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.370
Paul Johnson: Street and people on everyone.

273
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So bad on the side that's

274
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.780
Paul Johnson: Not all the way here yet I still got a foot in design over here on the marijuana thing.

275
00:24:55.170 --> 00:25:03.750
Paul Johnson: Yeah, I'm not really going to try to quit that one anytime soon. Like when when they quit making anxiety up but need marijuana children.

276
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.370
Paul Johnson: Probably

277
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.010
Paul Johnson: Tested that one, but other than I'm still trying really hard to say no to using the crank and all that.

278
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.840
Paul Johnson: Good, thank you. It's like

279
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:20.010
Paul Johnson: That was like the last two times I've done it was more like just to have it is like having a hairy recognition and

280
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:21.780
Paul Johnson: At first,

281
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.920
Paul Johnson: You know, just like it was I did it 15 minutes ago or something. Yeah.

282
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.550
Yeah.

283
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.170
Paul Johnson: Yeah, it definitely is a really if you don't forget

284
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.920
Paul Johnson: Just because you haven't been around it. You don't forget what it's like as a dancer.

285
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like sugar and

286
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.050
Paul Johnson: always kind of felt me my fingers, even if I do quit smoking.

287
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.650
Paul Johnson: To take the place in my smoke.

288
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.560
Paul Johnson: Understandable.

289
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.410
To

290
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

291
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We are officially done with this file site so you

292
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the next time you and I see each other. I want you to think about besides relapse prevention. Are there anything else that you want to work on with me while you're in treatment, I can certainly teach you. You know how to identify how to put barriers in place.

293
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:24.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For relapse. I can teach you all the things that there is to learn about that, you know, but you know as well as I do. Ultimately, you're going to have to apply them right

294
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:25.620
Right.

295
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.270
Paul Johnson: Okay.

296
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.280
Paul Johnson: So that's where

297
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I still have this

298
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:44.220
Paul Johnson: IS SAYING ON THIS JUST SAYING DON'T GO don't go. I got a little angel over here on his shoulder and the one with the horns over here and it's, it can be whipping it at that time, but yet it dragged him all the way up on my shoulder yet.

299
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

300
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.110
Paul Johnson: Dental battle going on but

301
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.160
Paul Johnson: It is a battle and yeah I mean like

302
00:26:54.330 --> 00:27:00.510
Paul Johnson: It's like, yeah, I'd like I'd like to be clean, but I'm not. I haven't ever been clean and it's like

303
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:20.790
Paul Johnson: Only reason I'm trying to get clean and probation, but it same kind of I'm I feel good. Yeah. I enjoy it very much feeling of being clean but it'd be nice if all the money and make cars and job and let's just all came right in place with it, trying to do it.

304
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.580
Paul Johnson: Oh, well, maybe the next

305
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.580
Paul Johnson: Who knows, I don't know.

306
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

307
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:34.080
Paul Johnson: One of these days, maybe the other side to to hire old people, and I'll get jobs like you're going out of style again.

308
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.620
Paul Johnson: Really, I don't really. I don't want to work at 711 or Burger King.

309
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:50.610
Paul Johnson: I don't know. It's getting harder and harder to find jobs. I really feel like applying myself to like dry walling let's find a time. No problem. Nowadays,

310
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.340
Paul Johnson: Many of us up now.
