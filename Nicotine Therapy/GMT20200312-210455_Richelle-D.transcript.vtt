00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.110
Angel G: Hi, Michelle.

2
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.900
Richelle Direny: Hi, how are you

3
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.520
Angel G: I'm doing okay. How about you.

4
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.970
Richelle Direny: I'm doing good. Doing good. You're saying

5
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.320
Richelle Direny: Before excitement that we have going on the world around us.

6
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.490
Yeah.

7
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.850
Angel G: I read a few things I wasn't like worried about it at first, until I read this thing about Italy.

8
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.230
Richelle Direny: And how it's

9
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.500
Angel G: Like really affecting over there and everything and then they're supposed to be shutting down Ohio schools starting Monday for like three weeks.

10
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.140
Richelle Direny: You said in the Ohio schools.

11
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
Angel G: Yeah, they said they were going to shut them down Monday for like three weeks. So that's pretty scary.

12
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.240
Richelle Direny: What, what do you mean the colleges are just the regular

13
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:25.740
Angel G: I think just the regular schools. That's like all I heard so far. But that's just like one of my friends posted on Facebook. So it's pretty scary and my sister. She's in prison and they're not letting anybody visit them either. So

14
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.230
Richelle Direny: Wow. Well, it is a little scary around the world because it's um

15
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.930
Richelle Direny: It is

16
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.730
Richelle Direny: You know, there's so much shutting down everything around this. Only thing I mean some jobs they're making the allowing people to work from home and I'm sure those people are not really arguing with that but

17
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.630
Richelle Direny: You know, it is really scary, but you're keeping yourself.

18
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.360
Richelle Direny: Protected for the most part.

19
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.810
Angel G: I'm trying. I already washed my hands a lot. So it's been doing. Same thing, you know, have been too worried, but it's been hard to find toilet paper it's

20
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.670
Richelle Direny: Crazy. That's really crazy, but you know what, you also have, and that's something that they don't really, you have to be careful.

21
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.890
Richelle Direny: With the washing of the hands too much because then you somewhat open up yourself to

22
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:33.930
Richelle Direny: What was it that they said, and I remember this from years ago they can't really like your natural bacteria is lucky that you love your natural bacteria, because your body is really made up of bacteria.

23
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:46.080
Richelle Direny: So you're you kill off the natural bacteria that there really to protect you and if you Washington you kill it, then you leave yourself open acceptable to getting anything so

24
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.770
Angel G: Right.

25
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.180
Angel G: Yeah, see I washed my hands a lot. Anyways, because like with my anxiety.

26
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.980
Angel G: My hands. Sweat a ton. So I've always been really weird about my hands and I wash a lot

27
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.770
Angel G: Just because I don't like the way it feels and stuff so

28
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.780
Angel G: I've always been like that.

29
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.210
Richelle Direny: Wow, but I'm going to try to open up this

30
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.580
Richelle Direny: Oh,

31
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.050
Angel G: I like your hair.

32
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.030
Richelle Direny: Thank you. Thank

33
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.130
You really pretty. Thank you.

34
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.330
Richelle Direny: I was gonna walk out. It's been such a long time since we've met angel.

35
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.820
Richelle Direny: So you got you have to catch me up. I felt like I haven't seen you in, like, since you started the program. I think I met you, one time.

36
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.100
Angel G: You met me one time. Yeah. So I really, I really am sorry about that. Like, I started my job. I had a bunch of family stuff going on.

37
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.590
Angel G: You know, and it was, it was really hard when I started my job. Just because I hadn't worked in so long. And I

38
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.870
Angel G: Kind of need. I kind of needed to get out my mom's place and I got my own place. And I just had a bunch of anxiety going on, and I know it probably would have been good to talk to somebody

39
00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:03.480
Angel G: And then like one of my best friends died. And then my sisters dad just died like a week and a half ago, which doesn't have to do with that. But like, it was just a bunch of stuff going on with me.

40
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.650
Richelle Direny: That is a lot because I remember when we met meet you have someone had passed away like friends or something like that.

41
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.550
Angel G: It was

42
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:22.260
Angel G: Yeah, I was one of my best friends, and it really messed me up. You know, I was in shock for a long time because the only person I've lost like really close to me was my grandma.

43
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.230
Angel G: And then losing my friend. It just, you know, it really messed me up, just because

44
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:43.260
Angel G: You don't really understand like how dangerous stuff is until it happens close to you or like even with when I was in my addiction. I didn't think that whatever happened to me. You know, it's just it just made me question a lot of things in life, everything you know

45
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.360
Richelle Direny: And, you know, and it's funny that you said like when you're in your addiction and

46
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.330
Richelle Direny: It was just this conversation.

47
00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:01.350
Richelle Direny: So I think I we talked about it in one of my groups. I think on thurs because I do groups on Thursday nights, but I'm

48
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:12.930
Richelle Direny: In one of my groups, someone had said something that triggered a thought like I was speaking to two of my kids and I kind of gave them this scenario.

49
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.170
Richelle Direny: Or I wouldn't say scenario, you know, when parents are talking to kids, it becomes like a full on full blown lecture. So it was one of those things where

50
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.720
Richelle Direny: I spoke to them. It was a concept of being mindful of who your friends are because often times

51
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:45.120
Richelle Direny: They you think that their friends and you think that they're good for you. And you think, based on the presentation that, you know, everything is great and wonderful and they got your back. But you have to be mindful.

52
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.600
Richelle Direny: And know who they are because there are people who come in your life that

53
00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:02.400
Richelle Direny: The time that you're very low and you tend to gravitate more to them because they come in your life when you're really low in their meeting that need at that time.

54
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.170
Richelle Direny: But a lot of them who

55
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:14.370
Richelle Direny: Comes in, come in your life when you are in a moment of real need they often are getting are coming in your life to set you up to

56
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.620
Richelle Direny: Your ultimate destruction, but you don't know because you're so clouded with

57
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.910
Richelle Direny: The different things that's going on in your life, your different circumstances, your different stressors. Your her everything that's going on in your life.

58
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:44.250
Richelle Direny: When you're going through. So like you're hurt you talk about you lose your grandma, your friend and you're having to move out of your home, you're having to be somewhat of a support for your sister. You have all these things that is going on. So oftentimes your situation clouds, your judgment.

59
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:53.250
Richelle Direny: Ultimately shore and so people will come in your life and they will fabricate that oh, I'm going to be fair for you and for you.

60
00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.200
Richelle Direny: Because that meant that immediate need we tend to kind of gravitate to them and we hold on to them because we're like, oh, they were there when I need it. But guess what,

61
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:12.240
Richelle Direny: I'm going to be that friend for you. But in my mind. I really have ulterior motive of what I'm ultimately the path. I'm ultimately going to lead you down. You know what I mean.

62
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:22.500
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, in talking to them. I said, you know, you have to be careful because these people who come in your life. They have a plan for you don't know that.

63
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.710
Richelle Direny: You can't see that because you're in a different headspace so you can't necessarily see that

64
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:40.530
Richelle Direny: And then the Picture that they paint is so wonderful that when you start heading down that road of destruction. You don't see it until it's become too late.

65
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:51.000
Richelle Direny: You're almost at that point of no return. And so, you know, it's kind of bringing that thought into awareness to say, you know, we have to be vigilant.

66
00:07:51.390 --> 00:08:01.890
Richelle Direny: Of the things around us and what's going on around us and being able to identify it and say, okay, is this really like I know I'm hurting. I know that this is all going on.

67
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:14.130
Richelle Direny: But is this really the path that I need to go, am I allowing my emotions to lead me or am I allowing logics to make me see things clearly. You know, I mean,

68
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.530
Angel G: Yeah I know exactly what you mean.

69
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.470
Richelle Direny: So, that is, you know,

70
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.920
Richelle Direny: You know, in the past, I used to always say

71
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.920
Richelle Direny: You don't really see a whole lot of nerds getting into a whole lot of trouble.

72
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.100
Richelle Direny: You're really

73
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.210
Richelle Direny: Nerdy, they look boring. They look well you know see them getting into a whole lot of trouble. Do you

74
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.840
Angel G: Hey, sometimes boring can be better better at times.

75
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.360
Richelle Direny: It's not even sometimes

76
00:08:48.660 --> 00:09:04.440
Richelle Direny: The reality of an angel is boring 95% of the times it's really better boring is relatively boring is all about perspective, because you can take what I see as Lauren and make it fun. It's all about how is your mind.

77
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.120
Richelle Direny: Making you look at this current situation because think about it.

78
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.850
Richelle Direny: You and your girlfriend could just be like, hey, what do you want to do today. You know what, let's sit down and binge watch something on lifetime.

79
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:28.260
Richelle Direny: You know something silly like that, but you can you can make it fun get popcorn, you can make that moment fun. It's all relative. It's all about what you make of it.

80
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:45.060
Richelle Direny: If someone if if I say, oh, that's boring. Let's go out here and go meet some guys and this that and the other. And I paint a good picture for you in your mind you're like oh yeah that's fine. But guess what I'm actually leading you into a track.

81
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.530
Richelle Direny: And when I got you in that track that. That's what I'm telling you you on your own.

82
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.710
Richelle Direny: You got to figure out what you see what I'm saying.

83
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.780
Richelle Direny: So remember the

84
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.360
Richelle Direny: A nerd. Don't ever look boring.

85
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:06.780
Angel G: I know exactly, exactly what you're talking about, you know, like, a while ago. A couple years ago, you know, my mom would always tell me you know

86
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:15.810
Angel G: Your, your friends really do impact how you are and stuff. And I was like, no way. You know, I'm myself, you know, really confident in myself, you know, I'm who I am and

87
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.490
Angel G: And honestly, I started to notice that I was kind of being like them. And sometimes, you know, I mean, I wasn't really being myself because it was all around me.

88
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:32.190
Angel G: And I had, I had chosen the kind of people. I kind of really thought who I was. You know what I mean, who I deserved to be around, and I didn't think I deserve to be around.

89
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:41.490
Angel G: People that, you know, I thought were more higher class than me or something, you know, and you you you are really supposed to like pick your friends, you know, and I was letting them pick me

90
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.570
Angel G: And it does it really does impact you know who you are, who you have around you and your environment and

91
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:58.800
Angel G: The people you know and like I said I love my mom and stuff, but I had to get away from her because she's always negative. And, you know, like a lot of my. A lot of my friends. You know, I still have love for them and everything, but I had to

92
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:10.770
Angel G: Be I've kind of had to be by myself a lot and it's been lonely but it's better, you know, and I'm making better decisions. And like I said it, it really does get lonely and it drives me crazy sometimes but

93
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.080
Angel G: It's, you know, I'm not doing what I was doing and hopefully I can find better friends, you know,

94
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.590
Angel G: And I will still have love for those people. You know what I mean. But it's just

95
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:28.980
Angel G: And even if they don't understand. It's just, I have to be a little bit selfish sometimes because I was just caring about other people too much to where

96
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.210
Richelle Direny: You know,

97
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:42.780
Angel G: I wasn't thinking about myself at all. And I was kind of being like them, like you said, you know, it really does matter. You know, even though the music you listen to everything packs you you know like just does

98
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.260
Angel G: And it took me a while to really know what that meant.

99
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.400
Angel G: You know, like I knew what it meant. But it really like to grasp it. You know what I mean.

100
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:58.560
Richelle Direny: And it's still a lot to grass. It's still a lot to really comprehend the vastness of it. It is a lot to cover many you have to kind of

101
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:08.160
Richelle Direny: take it in stride, like in small pieces and you know just learn from it master it before you move on to the next understanding of it, um,

102
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:19.560
Richelle Direny: It's that saying birds of a feather flock together. And if you're in a situation where you talk about having anxiety.

103
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:30.750
Richelle Direny: I mean, truth be told, all of us have some degree of unsettling within ourselves you one will call it anxiety one will call it something as well. It's something that

104
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:42.240
Richelle Direny: If you're, if you're hanging out with me. And there's something that i doing that, just the very being of you is just really feeling on steady and you're not really liking it.

105
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.580
Richelle Direny: And you're like, You know what, Rochelle I'm not really feeling good about whatever angel at just not being this it

106
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:55.230
Richelle Direny: The minute a person start saying that to you. They're not respecting how you're feeling in that moment and a true friend.

107
00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:08.370
Richelle Direny: A person who is truly there for you and have your best interests at heart is not willing to put you or allow you to be in a situation where you don't feel that. And that's kind of how you can start setting people apart.

108
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.680
Richelle Direny: Having one good friend means more than having 10 friends that is ultimately going to be your destruction.

109
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.760
Angel G: For sure.

110
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:24.210
Richelle Direny: You understand so and you know even like when you talk about, like, you know, in addiction.

111
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:31.560
Richelle Direny: Addiction at the time he makes you feel good, like the first time you try. Oh, I feel nice. It's a false sense of high

112
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:40.050
Richelle Direny: Oh, I feel so good. I feel like I'm on top of the world and this that and the other, but it doesn't tell you the consequence on the other side.

113
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:50.970
Richelle Direny: Is somewhat of a lifelong thing that you're going to be going through. So like that immediate high in that immediate feel good in the moment.

114
00:13:51.750 --> 00:14:04.740
Richelle Direny: Doesn't tell you this is what its gonna look like it really doesn't tell you that it just tells you it's all about right now. How do I feel right now. How do you yeah I feel good. But what's going to become international

115
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:14.730
Angel G: It's always the consequences. It is. You know what I mean. And it's not worth that and it doesn't even last that long. You know, I mean there's just so many things about it.

116
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:22.260
Angel G: And and i know that at a certain time, you know, I, when I picked to do this program I had trouble at first, you know, and

117
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:33.840
Angel G: And I did start doing I supposed to do, again, but like I had trouble, and I, I just, you know, I had no money. I was basically kind of homeless and like everything was falling apart. But it was just like

118
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:43.170
Angel G: You know when I did it, it was just, I felt so much better. And it's just allies to you. You know what I mean, like you're saying it lies to us that it's the devil and

119
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:52.590
Angel G: Because for the longest time I thought I had control you know i i i knew what it did to people because, you know, I grew up around some people. My family were addicts and stuff like

120
00:14:52.950 --> 00:15:02.130
Angel G: I grew up around. I know what it did people, but I was always like it would never, it would never happen to me like I was a kind of person that didn't like taking Tylenol. When I was younger I hated pills.

121
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:15.540
Angel G: Frogs any, you know, I mean, I hated it. And I just, it would be like a weekend thing, you know, I mean like I can, I can do this. And I did it for a while for like a year so i i was able to do it just like that and then out of nowhere.

122
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:23.130
Angel G: It was like I would make excuses. And that's what that's what happened to me was excuses because thinking I deserved it or something, you know, like it's a

123
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:31.740
Angel G: Monday. Everybody hates Mondays or Wednesday. It's almost the weekend and then weekend. I'm good. You know, and it just got to where it was out of control and

124
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.710
Angel G: It was crazy, you know, and I just

125
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.840
Angel G: woke up one day and I was like, and it was like one of those things woke up one day and I was like,

126
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:49.500
Angel G: I'm an addict. You know, I mean, like, and it was really hard to say because I was just like, I always like to party, you know, I mean, and it wasn't like

127
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.360
Angel G: I was

128
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.640
Angel G: I really it was

131
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.400
Angel G: Sorry, did you hear most of it.

132
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.890
Richelle Direny: You know, I heard all of it but towards the end, it started crackling. But you're good. Now I'm

133
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:27.690
Richelle Direny: Until you were saying that the, the, the last one on what you were saying was that you recognize that you were an addict. Can you woke up one day you woke up one day and saying like, I'm an addict and that's when you you said there's something has to change.

134
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.560
Angel G: I just

135
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.230
Richelle Direny: Okay, you're there.

136
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.050
Richelle Direny: You're frozen.

137
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.450
Me.

138
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.370
Richelle Direny: Your internet keeps dropping

139
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.600
Angel G: So, um, let me just go check it real quick, real quick.

140
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.700
Angel G: I have my thing right here, tried to get in like five times.

141
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.000
Angel G: It says it's good. Let me, let me reconnect it

142
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:37.920
Richelle Direny: Okay.

143
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.510
Angel G: Can hear me.

144
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:17.820
Angel G: Yes. Okay, it's connected to my Wi Fi. I was using my phone internet because I just updated my things. I don't understand why it wasn't working, but

145
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.130
Richelle Direny: That's okay.

146
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.430
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so you said that most of the time using you say home alone.

147
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:36.780
Angel G: Yeah, I mean I have like my cats and I talked to my nephew sometimes and stuff and I have like one friend that's really supportive and it's a good friend that I talked to and

148
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:53.220
Angel G: But I've kind of I've kind of been, you know, a hermit, you know, for a while and I just haven't really felt like going out and doing anything. It's just, I guess it's just because of the drastic change. And I just, I feel really different, you know, and it's

149
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:57.960
Angel G: All the emotions that I wasn't dealing with, they are all just come in and you know head on.

150
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.740
Angel G: And sometimes it's just hard to deal with it.

151
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.870
Angel G: You know and I stay home. Most the time I go to work, just come back and you know

152
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:18.960
Angel G: I'm really proud of myself to be able to work and stuff. Honestly, I didn't think I was going to be able to do it, you know, just because I had not worked for so long. And I was just nervous and but it's been really good for me.

153
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:27.150
Angel G: And I work with one of my friends named Brandon. I've known him since I was like a kid and he's, he's a really good person and you know he's really supportive and

154
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.400
Angel G: You know, so

155
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:41.550
Richelle Direny: He don't like I said, having one solid friend is good. And I think that naturally. Sometimes we have to

156
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.140
Richelle Direny: Friend.

157
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:54.180
Richelle Direny: Um, it's hard. So here it is. I'm telling you that right but my personality is not one that I don't know. I don't know how

158
00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:01.230
Richelle Direny: To do that because I just like I'm just like the bubbly type like I like to talk to everyone or what have you.

159
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:15.480
Richelle Direny: So it would be very hard for me. So sometimes yes it is like I do understand like, Oh, it feels lonely. You want someone to talk to this. And then the third. So, but you have to identify what what is your personality type, are you one.

160
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.680
Richelle Direny: They like to have company, but having

161
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.340
Richelle Direny: But again, it's all

162
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.130
The kids keeps

163
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.830
Angel G: It keeps freezing

164
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.440
Angel G: Why is my internet not working in

169
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.890
Richelle Direny: That's fine. It's okay, we're dealing with, I find, maybe it's a whole lot of traffic going on in your area.

170
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:46.920

Angel G: I'm not lately. I used to a lot, but I've kind of started thinking about it again, I've been writing down like some thoughts and stuff like that or like if the poem pops in my head. I've been doing that, but

183
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.310
Angel G: That's about it. I think journaling would help me. So I've been thinking about doing that.

184
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.430
Richelle Direny: What and in in journaling. What about your journaling helps you

185
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:04.650
Angel G: I'm just, just kind of like, you know, planning and stuff, too, because I like to just sometimes I write my emotions down, but I like to

186
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:15.750
Angel G: Plan more like because I can remember what everything I need to do and what I did together day and everything that's mostly what I did was, you know, I mean, it just helps me stay more organized. I guess with my life.

187
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.520
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you said that you'd like to write down your emotion, so

188
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:25.950
Richelle Direny: When you write that down. Do you ever go back and kind of read what you've written

189
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:37.020
Angel G: Yeah, I do. And sometimes I don't like to sometimes it can kind of depressed me. It was depressing. But when I do write it down. It just kind of feels like I've gotten it off you know off my chest. You know, I mean,

190
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.620
Angel G: kind of feels like talking to someone, sometimes, you know,

191
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.410
Richelle Direny: Yes, it's talking to someone. Sometimes, sometimes, like when you're writing it down.

192
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.730
Richelle Direny: And you get back

193
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.810
Angel G: It keeps freezing them.

194
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.800

Richelle Direny: Oh,

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.610
Richelle Direny: Well, let me see if this works. Hold on one second.

Richelle Direny: Okay, you can hear me on my cell freezing

219
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.440
Angel G: No. All right now.

220
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.760
Richelle Direny: Okay, so maybe it's because I was using my phone.

221
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.340
Richelle Direny: Okay. Hopefully the stable for the next 20 minutes

222
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.000
Yes.

223
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:16.620
Richelle Direny: No, I was asking when you read when you journal in the past, one who have journal. Um, do you find that when you read the emotions that you have kind of how you were feeling in the moment.

224
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:29.340
Richelle Direny: Do your journal. This was the circumstances. This is what caused the emotion. This is how I felt in the moment. And this is how I felt after that moment past. Is that how you journal

225
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:41.880
Angel G: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean, honestly, it's just kind of different for me. Like I said, I just a job a lot and it just, it just helps me to release honestly writing does. That's like the only thing way I can explain it just feels that

226
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.690
Richelle Direny: You really

227
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:47.820
Angel G: Just because I feel like sometimes I'm more of a person that like write things down to

228
00:29:48.270 --> 00:30:01.440
Angel G: To communicate. You know what I mean better and I just or I for to remember things even like I said about myself or even when I got to do is just when I write something down. You know, I, it's just the way I process it, you know, it helps me

229
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:10.440
Richelle Direny: And what are some you. Okay, so one of the things you said you like the outdoors, like what music do you like go to the well you're in Ohio. So there's no real meat right so

230
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:22.440
Angel G: Um, well, there's like little beaches, like man made ones, and they're not too bad. But you know, I love the ocean, that's for sure. It's my favorite but i i like to hike a lot, you know, there's a lot of hiking Ohio and stuff. I like to hike.

231
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.510
Angel G: On a chair.

232
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.610
Angel G: In my house and

233
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.420
Richelle Direny: They have mountain lions.

234
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.300
Angel G: No here. Fortunately,

235
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:35.340
Richelle Direny: Okay.

236
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:47.220
Richelle Direny: So, um, so, so being one with nature being there and enjoying nature and kind of just breathing in the air or whatever, just kind of what it is. It feels like being outdoors.

237
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:56.070
Richelle Direny: And so in this time. Like, even while you're, you're kind of on this road of recovery. Do you find that you enjoy those things a little bit more

238
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:03.030
Angel G: I'm definitely being outdoors. When it's been nice. I enjoy it more just because I'm not

239
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:12.690
Angel G: Thinking about when they get a pill constantly. You know what I mean, that just that took up. That was a full time job. You know what I mean. I just had no time to enjoy anything

240
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:21.360
Angel G: Or really even look around, you know what I mean anything like any of the beauty of anything. You know what I mean. So I definitely enjoy that more. There's a lot of days where

241
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:32.100
Angel G: Things just look gloomy to me, even if it's a nice day, you know, and I expected going through that, after what I was doing, you know, you're you go through that afterwards and

242
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:44.250
Angel G: With the writing it helps me, but I have had a lot of work like writer's block and that's bothered me a lot because it's the only thing I'm really good at, you know what I mean. And

243
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.520
Angel G: And it's just it has really messed with me, but I've gotten a little bit to where I'm wanting to write again. So it feels really good. And hopefully I can get back to that they still like

244
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.230
Angel G: Write a couple poems, a day or which is popped my head and they were really good homes. I thought, you know, and

245
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:03.480
Angel G: And I would read all the time, which I'm I've been reading a lot and I can get into books. Again, you know,

246
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:14.940
Angel G: Even when I'm in my diction. I tried reading books that I couldn't just because my eyes would slick and it just you couldn't concentrate. You know what I mean. And I just, it's definitely nice to get back into that.

247
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:24.330
Richelle Direny: You know, I like to do things for me how things work for me. I mean, you can tell me if you kind of understand the concept. I like to make

248
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:36.030
Richelle Direny: You think that things that by using metaphors kind of draw examples. Take a situation and apply it to something so you can see it a little bit better, a process and a little bit better. But think of it like this.

249
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.220
Richelle Direny: Think about if you've ever gotten like a really deep scar cut or something like that.

250
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:53.970
Richelle Direny: You have so like you have, you know, let's say your, your arm right here. It's fine. It's smooth, it's fine. Everything something happening. You got like a really big gash

251
00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:05.370
Richelle Direny: It's going to go through the healing process. Right. It's going to need to do its thing. And it's going to go through different phases of the healing process. Right.

252
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:20.730
Richelle Direny: It's going to hurt. It's going to age it's going to everything is going to go through the process. It's going to say, all we need this. Okay, I need Ben. Ben know I need this. But it's going to go through the process once. Can you rush the healing process.

253
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.340
Richelle Direny: As it's healing as your cut as you. And can you rush the process.

254
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.860
Richelle Direny: Or do you have to slowly just make it go take its course and take it's time to get there.

255
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:38.010
Angel G: It gets course you know i mean there's things you can do to help it Hill, you know, like I guess with what I'm doing but you know

256
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:50.880
Richelle Direny: There are things you could do to help it, but you can't rush it. It takes a little time. Once it's heal. Will a scar be there to remind you off the path of what you've had, will the scar be there.

257
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:57.780
Richelle Direny: So the scar will always be a reminder. And every time you look at that scar. You're going to know

258
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:08.970
Richelle Direny: This is what happened. This is what caused this cut or this wound. This is what I went through and as I'm going through it. I'm going to learn along the way.

259
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:22.440
Richelle Direny: Because what I'm learning is saying, I don't want to have to pull back through what I went through and this scar is a constant reminder of him. So once I am now healed.

260
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:31.500
Richelle Direny: Every time I look at this scar. I'm going to say, Oh, no, no. I am not going to do whatever I did to get the scar because I remember

261
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:45.570
Richelle Direny: All that I went through to get this and I like what everything that I've gone through has led me to where I am now as why as I as I am today. Though the scar.

262
00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:58.860
Richelle Direny: put me through a lot. I've experienced a lot, but I've also learned from it and it's made me who I am today. And so I like where I am today. And I want to continue on that path.

263
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:08.940
Richelle Direny: So even though there are things that you did in the past and enjoyed or what have you. You kind of went through this period of time where

264
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:17.850
Richelle Direny: Life happen. You got introduced to whatever it was, whether it was pain pills or what have you. And I remember you said that

265
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:28.410
Richelle Direny: A lot of what kind of got you started was kind of being a part of the inner crime and the friends you had, and all of that. What was, what kind of got you in it and you kind of like, Oh, I like this life. It seems cool, it seems fun

266
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.130
Richelle Direny: Tell you, they weren't nerds right there were none of them were nerds.

267
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.790
Richelle Direny: No, they didn't have five 5.0 GPA is like

268
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.920
Richelle Direny: But

269
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:46.620
Richelle Direny: So you you recognize the friends, the company I had is what made me get this scar.

270
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:56.580
Richelle Direny: And by myself. I had to go through the healing process and the healing process was no joke.

271
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:09.480
Richelle Direny: I have to go through counseling. I had to be a part of a Suboxone program. I had to share parts of me that I might not necessarily have a light sharing with people that I really didn't know

272
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:19.590
Richelle Direny: So I went through some some things with this scar and I had to do it by myself. The emotions. I went through the thoughts. I went through.

273
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:29.610
Richelle Direny: Every single thing the embarrassment. Maybe at times that I had to deal with when I had to go get my medication and the questions I had to answer.

274
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:45.990
Richelle Direny: You have to take every single thing that you had to go through while you were in this healing process. The moments of feeling lonely feeling segregated feeling what ever you felt during this healing process.

275
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:59.040
Richelle Direny: It will end because there's always a light at the end of the tunnel, we have to remember, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. The question is, do you want to get to the other side of where that light is

276
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:07.950
Richelle Direny: Once you get there, you're going to say, Man, I went through some crap. I went through some ish

277
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.060
Angel G: You understand

278
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:16.650
Richelle Direny: And I went through that ish by myself. Yeah. Wouldn't be or what meet because you don't want your bailed on

279
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.100
Richelle Direny: So guess what I don't want to go through that anymore.

280
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:38.760
Richelle Direny: Because I remember every time I look at this car. This is a self inflicted wound self in all of this is self inflicted I wasn't born with it. It was self inflicted because of the choices I made

281
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:49.680
Richelle Direny: And why you're going through this healing process during this time it's for you to get to know who is really angel.

282
00:37:50.610 --> 00:38:01.470
Richelle Direny: What makes angel feels happy or sad, lonely or cry. What is angels purpose in life. Could this car this wound

283
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:16.200
Richelle Direny: Did angel have to go through this in order to get to ultimately where she needs to go in life. Because when we look at people that are great in life. We don't ever really stop and say, I wonder what their story is

284
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.190
Richelle Direny: Because I'm sure their story is what made them where they are and who they are. But remember,

285
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:37.860
Richelle Direny: While you're while you're wound is closing because this is right now. This is where you are your wound is closing and you're going through all of the distant mixed emotions.

286
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:49.260
Richelle Direny: And sometimes the wound is so painful that you want to be, you want to reach for the big guns. Right. Sometimes the pain while the wound is closing

287
00:38:49.710 --> 00:39:03.450
Richelle Direny: Says, oh no, I can't do with this no more. Let me go back and get me some feel good because I can't, I can't deal with this. This is too much, it's too much. I need to go back, because if I go back to my feel goods. I ain't gonna feel all of this right here.

288
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:05.880
Richelle Direny: But

289
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:16.050
Richelle Direny: When the wound is really getting ready to close for good. That's the time you go through the most pain.

290
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:24.300
Richelle Direny: Have you ever gotten like a little scratch and like right when it's almost heal it keeps itching. It's like, it's just, it's so irritating.

291
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:32.730
Richelle Direny: And that's when it's going through its final stage is doing all the cells and everything is working. It starts pitching. You're like, oh my god, I can't get rid of this.

292
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:55.890
Richelle Direny: Remember, you still have to go through the pain of it all and all of that. Because after it's close. You're going to realize I made I DID YOU SAID I DIDN'T. So everything is about perspective, how do I look at this, I want to be on this road of recovery.

293
00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.730
Richelle Direny: I want to close this world.

294
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.990
Richelle Direny: It's the scars going to be there, which means that I can't forget what I've done.

295
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:15.210
Richelle Direny: But I can remember what I had to go through to get where I'm going, or where I've come

296
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:16.920
Richelle Direny: To understand

297
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:23.010
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And so that's how you look at it in this time period.

298
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.550
Richelle Direny: It's for you to do a little self reflecting

299
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:35.880
Richelle Direny: It's for you. It's really for you to do some deep true self, reflecting and just think

300
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.220
Richelle Direny: Who am I

301
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.170
Richelle Direny: Who is angel.

302
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.970
Richelle Direny: Pending on who you believe in what did God create angel to do

303
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:54.810
Richelle Direny: He created a new something. What is that, and is this the path I have to travel to ultimately get to where I need to

304
00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:01.410
Richelle Direny: Because you're always going to have distractors will we all have distractors you're saying

305
00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.110
Richelle Direny: There's always going to be distractions, but

306
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.160
Richelle Direny: If you want to find your purpose.

307
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.940
Richelle Direny: Maybe at this time being alone is where you do your best cooking.

308
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:23.670
Richelle Direny: It's where you do your best soul searching. If I'm all up in your face all the time. Yeah, go ahead. No time thing.

309
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:33.570
Richelle Direny: You can't hear the voices in your head. And granted, I mean I know we're in the world of mental health and hearing. Somebody says, I can't hear the voices, you know, and kind of like, no, no, no.

310
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.220
Richelle Direny: Need to hear the voices in my

311
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.860
Richelle Direny: I need a little peace and quiet to hear two voices in my head, please.

312
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.200
Angel G: You know, to me,

313
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:47.730
Richelle Direny: What I need, I need, I need to hear the voices become too much be like Tom, I can only hear one at a time.

314
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:50.400
Angel G: But

315
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:57.810
Richelle Direny: I need some peace and quiet to hear the voices in my head to make sense of my life. I need to find my purpose.

316
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.600
Richelle Direny: But a part of your purpose.

317
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.180
Richelle Direny: Is the road you're on.

318
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.840
Richelle Direny: To be successful in this role, it means you have to be fully aware

319
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.120
Richelle Direny: Your past is your paths. There's nothing you could do about it.

320
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.110
Richelle Direny: You can't change it, which could definitely learn

321
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:30.960
Richelle Direny: As you go through this on the journey. There are times. Like sometimes you say look I feel really anxious and all of that.

322
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:37.860
Richelle Direny: That is as you're going through the healing process, anxiety, sometimes

323
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:43.050
Richelle Direny: Is caused by fear. Fear of the unknown.

324
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.620
Richelle Direny: Fear of my abilities fear of my own shrink and what is that going to look like.

325
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:58.980
Richelle Direny: And fear of I've accomplished something. But I don't know how I should feel. Should I tell somebody should I keep myself.

326
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:08.790
Richelle Direny: All of that happens. And so sometimes when we don't know what to do with these emotions. This is when you go back

327
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:21.960
Richelle Direny: Because you're so fearful of these emotions, we go back instead of Allow it to run its course allowed to do what it needs to do, because this too shall pass.

328
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:33.660
Richelle Direny: It's hard. It's really hard to comprehend it. Honestly, when you say this too shall. It's kind of like you're in some serious pain. Don't worry Angeles. Okay, you're going to get through what you mean I'm gonna get through it. I'm feeling it right now.

329
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:46.620
Richelle Direny: You will get through it. You understand I'm saying it's kind of like, Oh, I never think. Let me get out of high school boy oh boy, and then tell me that in four years was gonna go on just that quick.

330
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:47.820
Uh huh.

331
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:54.630
Richelle Direny: So it's kind of everything is a matter of perspective, how am I looking at life.

332
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.730
Angel G: How my table.

333
00:43:59.280 --> 00:43:59.580
Richelle Direny: My

334
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:05.430
Richelle Direny: Your wound is your room. Your scar your healing world is yours.

335
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:16.080
Richelle Direny: What are you doing to help you manage the pain as your room.

336
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.510
That's the question.

337
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:33.810
Richelle Direny: You go to groups you're on the Suboxone maintenance. You're going to start doing therapy, you're working everything you're engaged in right now.

338
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.690
Richelle Direny: Do you find it to be.

339
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.750
Richelle Direny: A healthy state for you right now.

340
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:48.930
Angel G: I do. Yeah, I do. And you know there's with, like I said, the working and getting my own place. Honestly, I'm kind of surprised at myself.

341
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:55.890
Angel G: Because I didn't think I could do it again. You know, just, it was just the fear. You know what I mean. And, and I still carry fear because

342
00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:02.100
Angel G: I want. Of course I want a better job. I want a career, you know, I worked at a bank for a couple of years, and I was happy with that. But

343
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:08.310
Angel G: I want you know I want a career and I want to be happy. And it just, I have a lot of fear towards failing.

344
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:17.400
Angel G: Or relapsing or you know what I mean, like, there's definitely a lot of fear there because sometimes it does get hard. You know, I've stuck with it, but there's definitely fear.

345
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:24.780
Angel G: For that for the future. A lot of that, you know, but, um, you know, in just me. Like I said,

346
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.980
Angel G: I feel like I've been kind of selfish because my friends are like everyday. Want me to hang out and stuff, you know, do all this stuff and I just

347
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:41.310
Angel G: In it, sometimes they may not even be like a bad thing like not always go to the bar or something. I mean, it might just be just to go hang out or something. But I just had been like, no, I

348
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:48.420
Angel G: Ally, or if they have something going on or something, sometimes don't hurt their feelings, but I just kind of sit at home and read and, you know,

349
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:59.520
Angel G: It's just, it's honestly been therapeutic for me because I just I know my body like I knew what I needed. And it was some alone time, you know, just, I just needed it.

350
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.970
Angel G: And I do feel like that's been really helpful for me.

351
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:14.790
Richelle Direny: Respect that I said the voices respect what it's saying your inner man is saying angel, we need some time alone, girl. We really need some time alone.

352
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:30.360
Richelle Direny: All but Rochelle. So we go angel, we need some time alone. Can we have a little time alone. Can we sit on this glass of water. Real slow, you said, I'm saying, Can we watch a movie together. I just want to spend a little time with you don't

353
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:44.310
Richelle Direny: Let me ask you, because I hear a lot. What you're saying is more feeling guilty to not being able to be there with your friends into like is it. Is that what you feel guilt.

354
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.670
Angel G: Or not. No, it's, it's a little bit of that.

355
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:58.170
Angel G: You know, it's a little bit of that. But it's more, it's honestly more fear of losing all of my friends because how can I be unavailable for this long. You know what I mean like everybody's always like, well,

356
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:06.210
Angel G: If they can't hang out with you, even like once a month or something. You know what I mean, like, I've just been like a hermit, but they don't understand, like, and I've tried to explain it.

357
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:18.150
Angel G: And there's times where I get kind of mad at them for not understanding to, you know what I mean. But it's more of the fear of losing all my friends, you know, just because I don't have any time for anyone. It doesn't seem, you know,

358
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.910
Richelle Direny: What is your definition of are really, really good friend.

359
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:29.970
Angel G: Just someone that's there for you. Someone tells you when you're doing wrong you know someone's that's that's there for you for the good in the bad times.

360
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:40.590
Angel G: Someone that says good things about you when you're out of the room, you know, someone you can trust you know and i really don't feel like I had a lot of friends like that in my life, you know,

361
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.800
Richelle Direny: So why why fear losing the ones that you have. If you feel like you don't have a lot

362
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:56.580
Angel G: I don't know, it's just the loneliness. You know what I mean. And I i've always wanted a girlfriend to hang out with the boys been like around guys and something that's cool. Sometimes guys are

363
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:04.200
Angel G: Easier to hang out with you know what I mean. But I've always wanted a girlfriend. And then whenever I get one. They're kind of toxic usually

364
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:10.050
Angel G: And I don't know, I just always wanted that so bad. You know what I mean. And it's just

365
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:16.980
Angel G: It just, you know, it's just something I want really bad and I kind of, even if it's kind of been bad it's kind of been for it. Sometimes I mean

366
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.300
Angel G: I'm learning. Now you know what I mean. Like I said, I haven't really talked to anybody. Just because I'm

367
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:34.350
Angel G: Trying to really figure out if it's worth it or if they're actually good for me. You know what I mean. Because sometimes it's not all playing out there like they're bad for you. You know, I mean, it's just like, because not everybody's perfect, you know, but

368
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.070
Angel G: I don't know, but

369
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:46.170
Richelle Direny: Again, remember what I said earlier, go back to that inner voice that inner voice is just saying, hey, that's just not good for us right now that really isn't

370
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:56.610
Richelle Direny: Everything that you said describes a really good friend and I'm gonna let you in on something, just like you. I feel the same way you kind of like want that one good solid girlfriend.

371
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:04.860
Richelle Direny: Well, you know what I find sometimes that one good solid girlfriend is already there. You just haven't recognized that person is yet.

372
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:16.050
Richelle Direny: You just haven't recognized and I think because like our mind has created what that one good solid girlfriend looks like.

373
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:26.430
Richelle Direny: Which is sometimes a false interpretation of what it really should look like. Because our expert and this is another the expectations. A lot of times, lead us down a wrong path.

374
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:38.040
Richelle Direny: I think I forgot how long it took me to find that I have like maybe a handful of really good solid girlfriends, and it took me a long time to realize that they were

375
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.470
Richelle Direny: It took me a very long time because I really true. Good solid friend.

376
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:56.910
Richelle Direny: Even if you go off the radar for a year or two or three when you come back on the radar. They're not going to make you feel like, Where have you been for so long. Oh, life has gone on and they're going to act like they just saw you yesterday.

377
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:03.090
Richelle Direny: And we just playing catch up from yesterday when we spoke, you were saying.

378
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.580
Richelle Direny: Who do you think is important right now.

379
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:10.440
Angel G: Well,

380
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.140
Angel G: Myself.

381
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:19.200
Angel G: One of my one really good friends, you know, that is really good for me that I talked to a lot and

382
00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:26.700
Angel G: My mom, of course, and my sister and, you know, but like I said, I haven't focused on myself. Number one,

383
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:27.480
Richelle Direny: That's the

384
00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.810
Richelle Direny: Only person that's important right now you

385
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:44.760
Richelle Direny: When you're wounded closing off. You don't really hope you don't need a whole lot of people because you know what, when that one just close it up, you don't need. It's just you, it needs time

386
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.840
Richelle Direny: It needs it needs time

387
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:51.570
Richelle Direny: Anytime.

388
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.200
Richelle Direny: I need to focus on everything I'm doing

389
00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.440
Richelle Direny: I need to get the right tools.

390
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.710
Richelle Direny: And I need to be one myself.

391
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.020
Richelle Direny: Along the way,

392
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:09.540
Richelle Direny: There is a saying.

393
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.800
Richelle Direny: Tomorrow has its own troubles, so don't worry about it.

394
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:20.040
Richelle Direny: Yesterday is gone, but tomorrow has its own set of troubles. Stay focused on today.

395
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:31.470
Richelle Direny: I hear you. I want you want to. And those are goals. Those are goals that you have. And I think when your journaling and I really truly encourage you to just go back into journaling, write down

396
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:41.940
Richelle Direny: Maybe the next time we meet, write down your long term goals and your short term goals, your long term goals you've named them. You want to be able to get a career. What is that career.

397
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:52.140
Richelle Direny: What is it that you need to do to attain that that career. And once you've identified that you will now know what kind of jobs, you need to go after that will help to

398
00:51:52.770 --> 00:52:01.110
Richelle Direny: ultimately bring you into that career because we can't just hop into any of them. We have to kind of get there, where are you today.

399
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:18.330
Richelle Direny: And all of the different steps, you want to write down every little tiny details of how you get to that long term goal and it starts with your short term goal your short term goal. I think you're kind of working in it right now getting yourself to a place of stability.

400
00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.850
Richelle Direny: That's what you're doing right now.

401
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.510
Richelle Direny: So like writing down your short term goal.

402
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.080
Richelle Direny: Which will include changes that you need to make

403
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.120
Richelle Direny: Because how old are you,

404
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.770
I'm 26

405
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:50.820
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you're young. So you've got a long way to go. So you're where you are right now, just think about where you are right now what you're doing right now. You just said your surprise of yourself. You got your you worked enough. You got your own place kind of doing your own thing, right.

406
00:52:52.650 --> 00:53:02.370
Richelle Direny: So with that, that's part of your short term goal and you have accomplished some of those things. So every time you have accomplished a goal, check it off.

407
00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:04.500
Richelle Direny: Good job. I've made.

408
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:12.990
Richelle Direny: That goal. Did that goal every day. You said one goal that you're going to achieve.

409
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:23.160
Richelle Direny: If you didn't achieve it in that just one if you didn't achieve it in that day, at the end of the day, I want you to reevaluate what was it,

410
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:32.730
Richelle Direny: That you're stumbling blocks that made you not achieve that goal today, then you're going to apply it somewhere else, maybe in the next day or what have you.

411
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:44.880
Richelle Direny: Because sometimes when we think, oh, I didn't achieve and you see you work up your exact note because the reality is, maybe I couldn't really achieve that goal today because something else came up, but I really truly couldn't handle control over it.

412
00:53:47.430 --> 00:54:00.390
Richelle Direny: And that's kind of just how you look at it, so I honestly, I'm going to encourage you to the next time we meet, we just talk about what are some long term goals you came up with. What are some short term goals and what are

413
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.200
Richelle Direny: The steps you have taken thus far.

414
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:11.280
Richelle Direny: To get to some of those short term goals. If you haven't already. Okay.

415
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.840
Angel G: That's all we can do

416
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:25.890
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. It's just, it's start because that's, that's another thing where your anxiety comes from. It's, it's the fear, it's because you want so much, but you can't get it right all now.

417
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:36.930
Richelle Direny: You have to take little steps. That's my long term goal. This is the short term goal that leads to the long term goal. I just need to re evaluate it.

418
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:49.320
Richelle Direny: And in control. Sometimes we have no control over certain things are really sure we don't. And we just have to reevaluate and say, Hey, why didn't I get to that goal today.

419
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:59.670
Richelle Direny: Oh, well. It was because of this. Okay, so then maybe I can try to do. I could tweak it and tomorrow. I can do something I can you know I can get to it tomorrow. It's not a problem.

420
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:06.690
Richelle Direny: And I think once you start looking at things that way. It starts with lowering your anxiety, just one match at a time.

421
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:12.030
Angel G: One day, because I always have all this anxiety over all this stuff. I didn't do too, because

422
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:20.970
Angel G: I procrastinate to, you know what I mean. And then if I if I start on the thing, too. I get into it too much. Sometimes too you know what i mean i and then I take too long to do it and

423
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:30.780
Angel G: You know what I mean. I just sometimes I do that kind of stuff, too. And it messes. The goals up that I have, even if it's something small for the day, you know, we all do it.

424
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.460
Richelle Direny: And so that's, I

425
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:46.200
Richelle Direny: Definitely just at the end, put them all on paper, if that's what helps you put it all on paper, long term, short term steps to get to the long term.

426
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:55.500
Richelle Direny: There are some there are steps to get to the short term, some long term goal your short term usually falls into your long term and it leads up to the long term.

427
00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:03.300
Richelle Direny: But like the steps that you're going to take and you have to identify every detail of it. And when we talk about it during the next time we meet

428
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:13.050
Richelle Direny: You know, maybe at that point as you go over it. Maybe I can give you a pointer or idea or a thought that maybe you didn't even think about, like, Oh yeah, I forgot that maybe I need to add that in there.

429
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:15.030
Angel G: That would be really helpful.

430
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:23.340
Richelle Direny: But again, it is that you didn't achieve a goal for that day really just say okay

431
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:34.590
Richelle Direny: What let me do an inventory of the day so I can see why didn't I achieve the goal for that day. And if you really do an inventory and you say,

432
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:44.010
Richelle Direny: Your inner your inner girl says, you know, he was you're procrastinating today. You know, you're really surely procrastinating. Okay. Well, how was I procrastinate.

433
00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:57.450
Richelle Direny: Maybe you even you talk to, homeboy, over there for that long. And so then you can say, all right, now I know this is what I did. And maybe if I stay on task and be

434
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:04.380
Richelle Direny: vigilant and be intentional about what I do.

435
00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.990
Richelle Direny: I won't have so much anxiety when I don't accomplish something

436
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.730
Richelle Direny: Always looking back

437
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.610
Richelle Direny: Always look at that because

438
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.060
Richelle Direny: Ultimately when you become what do you want to do when you say you want a career. What do you want to do.

439
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:27.870
Angel G: Um, well, I really want to get into real. It's real tea. You know, I kind of thing get real estate.

440
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:35.130
Angel G: Or I've always wanted to get into, like, as a veterinary tech or something like that. But it's between those two.

441
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:43.500
Angel G: You know, even reality or, you know, real estate could be like a plan B to do something I can do on the side. Sometimes or something. But it's definitely like two things I want to get into

442
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:48.630
Richelle Direny: You really like animals ruin. Yep. Do you like snakes to

443
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:55.980
Angel G: I'm not really, but I can be around them. They just, they kind of scare me. I've always been scared of snakes, but

444
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:01.080
Richelle Direny: They want to work with back in the back office. I'm like,

445
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:07.920
Angel G: Yeah, I'm scared of snakes. So that might be a little problem. I'm good with all other animals.

446
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:16.680
Angel G: froze up there for

447
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:18.900

Okay.

481
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:42.240
Richelle Direny: So you talked about a lot. What is what something. What is a takeaway that you can what time you go to group 12 o'clock or 1031 3130

482
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:47.550
Richelle Direny: Yes, what is something that you can take away

483
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:56.610
Angel G: I'm honestly you just made me feel better about me being alone. You know what I mean. I just like I said that has been something that's kind of bothered me a little bit.

484
01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:07.260
Angel G: With a tad bit of guilt and, you know, just being, you know, afraid of losing my friends. You know, it's just, it's nice to hear someone telling me that it's actually that's good that I'm doing that. You know what I mean.

485
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:14.400
Angel G: Because I've had some people tell me that it's not. But I'm like, I think I know you know what i mean i just. That's the hope you feel better.

486
01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:32.310
Richelle Direny: Your life. It's your history, you know you and if it's good for you, then that's what's important. It's, you know, under different depends on the circumstance of each person, but for you if you know alone time is what you need to help your mood.

487
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.450
Richelle Direny: To give your own time to heal.

488
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.030
Richelle Direny: To repair itself.

489
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:57.690
Richelle Direny: Just kind of to reset. So basically that's what you're doing. You're resetting your phone battery dies, you need to charge it right and you don't need to be in a bunch of crowd the charge you to put it by itself to do what it needs to do so, um,

490
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:02.760
Richelle Direny: It's okay, it's okay to do what you're doing.

491
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:04.950
Richelle Direny: And

492
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.990
Richelle Direny: Like I said do

493
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:16.500
Richelle Direny: Just do like the long term, short term and then we'll talk about it when we meet in two weeks time

494
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:21.330
Richelle Direny: Okay, and that will really truly allow you to do some reflecting

495
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.300
Angel G: Car. I think so too.

496
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:29.160
Richelle Direny: Alright, Angel and hopefully have internet issues.

497
