Dianna Jaramillo: I'm kind of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Getting

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.600
Dominique Pozo: A little frustrated. I don't know why the virtual connected and give you the number right away. I'm sorry that we're starting late

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.250
Dianna Jaramillo: And yeah, it's okay, he actually told me this is the same guy dealt with yesterday, and he was supposed to

7
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.610
Dianna Jaramillo: Send me my my weekly survey and he never sent it yesterday. So today, he's talking to me like like as if I'm in trouble for not doing my survey and they told him well.

8
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.030
Dianna Jaramillo: You never you never sent it. And he was like, well, you need to do it every time you get it like kind of argumentative

9
00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:06.180
Dianna Jaramillo: And I was like, well, send it and I'll do it because I always do. He was like, well, we could impede you from getting your prescription if you don't do it right away. And I'm like, yeah, dude. No shit, you know, I'm not like five I do it every time. And then he was like, so I guess Dominique Is

10
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.330
Dianna Jaramillo: She stuck in another appointment with another patient. She's running. Nice.

11
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.860
Dominique Pozo: That's not sure

12
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.480
Dianna Jaramillo: That's exactly what he said, He that you're running late that you're still stuck with the patient ahead of me and that he'll text me the meeting room ID when you're done when you send it to him.

13
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:35.100
Dominique Pozo: That's the lie, I'm gonna talk to Helena, because that's not okay, that if he's messing up he's putting it one on me and then whatever he was doing with your survey thing. Yeah.

14
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that was his name was Tony Tony you Anthony

15
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
Dominique Pozo: I saw he responded and said, Where's your ID number, and

16
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.860
Dominique Pozo: I said I sent it half an hour ago. Why didn't you give it to her.

17
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.220
So,

18
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.050
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know if he's

19
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.450
Dianna Jaramillo: New or if he's just learning or whatever. But yeah, he, he needs to get on it.

20
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.640
Dominique Pozo: For sure good feedback for me so that I can let him. No, no, because

21
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.570
Dominique Pozo: It's not

22
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.130
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's not okay to to

23
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.410
Dominique Pozo: To jump you on your time for your

24
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.830
Question.

25
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.930
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

26
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay, okay. Yeah, anyway. Yeah.

27
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.260
Dominique Pozo: So I'm glad we're meeting they. I'm just wondering how it's going. And

28
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.430
Dominique Pozo: It's been, it's been a few weeks since we met individually.

29
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, you know, um, well, these are

30
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Calm, I guess right now. I feel, I feel pretty

31
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.840
Dianna Jaramillo: I feel okay feel better than, than I did a few weeks ago, for sure. I think everything was just kind of

32
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.720
Dianna Jaramillo: You know everything's just kind of crazy. A few weeks ago with everything. Everything you know and

33
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.960
Dianna Jaramillo: And I don't know, for some reason, I don't really know why. Nothing really changed, but things do feel a little bit more

34
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.150
Dianna Jaramillo: More calm.

35
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.300
Dianna Jaramillo: And settled down. I don't know, it's weird. I just feel it.

36
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.060
Dominique Pozo: Great. That's good.

37
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.330
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm glad I yeah yeah

38
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:34.290
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah definitely have me too. Yeah, I don't, I don't feel I felt like I was kind of depressed. A few weeks ago and like that was happening. I felt that way for a couple weeks solid like just depressed.

39
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Is known and just dark and

40
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.670
Dianna Jaramillo: Unhappy and you know and i and i really don't feel like that anymore, it's been it's been at least a few days since I felt like that.

41
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.580
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think just in the future if you're feeling that please reach out, because that's the time that support is

42
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.030
Dominique Pozo: Helpful because even just just naming and and getting off the chest, sometimes can make a shift, you know,

43
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.180
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah. That's totally true. And, but it's like that's the hardest time to actually reach out and ask for help to

44
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:16.560
Dominique Pozo: Totally. Totally. And I wonder, you know, I actually, you know, I don't shine like a negative light on depression. I, I do believe it is our spirits.

45
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.400
Dominique Pozo: Speaking to us.

46
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.360
Dominique Pozo: You know,

47
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.840
Dominique Pozo: As well. So I wonder when you reflect on what went on for you, you know, during that time.

48
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.630
Dominique Pozo: Did anything. Were there any reoccurring kind of thoughts or themes that had you down that you can think of that we could address now that you're you know up like above water.

49
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.690
Dianna Jaramillo: Um,

50
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

51
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.220
Dominique Pozo: Oh, is it not a good time to

52
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:57.480
Dominique Pozo: Talk. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a good sign, actually what you just did. When you look to the side in the future that will help me to realize, Oh, this isn't a good time.

53
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Cool. Perfect.

54
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.880
Dianna Jaramillo: Thank you.

55
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.600
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

56
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.800
Dianna Jaramillo: You're so. But yeah, it was, it was that you know that that kind of stuff.

57
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.570
Dominique Pozo: Got it, okay.

58
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, it was just really bad at that at that time.

59
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.620
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

60
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.080
Dianna Jaramillo: Not like not like physically or anything. Just say

61
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.600
Dianna Jaramillo: That

62
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.950
Dominique Pozo: You know, just, yeah. The, the, just the that kind of tension and not having Herman you in your home.

63
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.300
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

64
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.950
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I get it.

65
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.540
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly.

66
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.010
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's take a deep breath and let's just acknowledge where you're at now every, you know, things are always moving always shifting and

67
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.870
Dominique Pozo: Nothing stays the same.

68
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.720
Dominique Pozo: You can count on that. Yeah.

69
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.530
Exactly.

70
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:52.140
Dominique Pozo: It's kind of a, it's a tricky one because it also goes for the good times. It's like okay you can appreciate

71
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.360
Dominique Pozo: The toilets here because nothing stays the same.

72
00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:08.640
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, exactly. I know I think about that. I think about that too so much. It's like, it really does. I feel like it makes me more appreciative for sure of when the good like when it's good when everything's

73
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.830
Dianna Jaramillo: Good when something really awesome is happening. It's like it just really makes you appreciate it more for sure.

74
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely.

75
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.380
Yeah.

76
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.660
Dominique Pozo: Cool.

77
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.880
Dominique Pozo: Day and I wanted to check in. So they do you know they do the routine us with you all the urine analysis and I

78
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:38.940
Dominique Pozo: Pretty sure I need to double check with john but she checked in with me, she's like Oh, Diana came up positive for cocaine and we just wanted to check in with you and you know you don't get in trouble. You're not like kicked out of the program. But I just wanted to

79
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.950
Dominique Pozo: See what yeah going

80
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.610
Dianna Jaramillo: So yeah, that was kind of during that time, like that. Couple of weeks where everything was just like, I really

81
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Felt like

82
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.220
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, like, the next step is to just give up.

83
00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:07.260
Dianna Jaramillo: Really, I was in, I just felt like a really dark place and someone showed up and you know and it and and I was just in that really shitty vulnerable place. And so I just kind of went with it.

84
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:18.360
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and and it was awful. It felt it felt awful. I wasn't, I did not feel good about it. You know, I didn't, it wasn't like an enjoyable thing like how I remember it.

85
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Because I wasn't drinking or

86
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.270
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, doing anything else. So it wasn't like fun. And like the

87
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.220
Dianna Jaramillo: Situation. It was like

88
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.710
Dianna Jaramillo: Escape just escape, escape.

89
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:36.330
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, you know, and so it really was not enjoyable. It really wasn't. I did not. I felt so shitty and cruelty.

90
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Mentally, you know, physically, I just know

91
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:55.440
Dianna Jaramillo: Like shit and and I was like, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do this. I don't want to be doing this. That's just I'm opening doorways, you know, for myself, because it's like, once that first time. Once you get that first time out of the way. It just gets easier.

92
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.280
Dominique Pozo: To do it. Yeah.

93
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Anytime after that. And I know that better than anyone you know so

94
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.860
Dianna Jaramillo: So yeah, I

95
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.150
Dianna Jaramillo: Came to the situation.

96
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.130
Dianna Jaramillo: Or what happened.

97
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.230
Dominique Pozo: But so I mean I'm

98
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.590
Dominique Pozo: I'm happy for you that you recognized. Wow. This doesn't feel good. It's not what I want. I think that's what the

99
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Lets

100
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:24.810
Dominique Pozo: You know, whether it's a slip with alcohol or whatever, whatever it is. It's just an I think sometimes ideally it helps to kind of bring someone back to center of

101
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.350
Dominique Pozo: Like yeah, this is what I want. What I don't want you know

102
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I, I

103
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Felt that I feel like you know like that was stronger for me.

104
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:47.850
Dianna Jaramillo: Than ever when that happened, like in the next few days. I mean, I definitely felt shitty about it, but it really did kind of help bring me back to

105
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:58.140
Dianna Jaramillo: You know where where I want to be and what what i want to be, you know, and I don't want to be. I don't want to be that I don't want to be that person at all anymore ever again.

106
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.230
Dianna Jaramillo: So it's, it really was like a good reminder

107
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.290
Dianna Jaramillo: So I tried to not beat myself up for it, you know.

108
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.730
Dominique Pozo: Totally, yeah. Good.

109
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.230
Dominique Pozo: I'm glad. Yeah.

110
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes.

111
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.870
Dominique Pozo: That's not good either to go and do this.

112
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.940
Dominique Pozo: At viral and and guilt and then feel bad and and be like, oh, you know, effort and

113
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.440
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly.

114
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.850
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. Great.

115
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.760
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. So yeah, that's kind of what happened and

116
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.030
Dianna Jaramillo: And that was that. And it's what's that

117
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.380
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Good. Well, I just wanted to check in with you and I think

118
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:42.660
Dominique Pozo: What maybe was a bit alarming for Joan and then kind of turned me on to, to ask about it was that that was the time when we weren't hearing from you. I don't think and and so I was just wondering. Oh no, like, I wonder what's going on so

119
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, just

120
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.060
Dominique Pozo: I just wanted to follow up with it.

121
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:53.070
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I wasn't, I was not on it as as much as I usually am doing that, that couple of weeks there. It was like I just

122
00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:06.630
Dianna Jaramillo: Was spiraling kind of like, now that I look at it, then it didn't really feel like that. It just felt like I just felt really sad and and down and dark, kind of, but I'm not going to look at it.

123
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:16.170
Dianna Jaramillo: Look back at that just, you know, a week ago for that two or three weeks there. It was like spiraling I really felt like I was I was getting ready to just

124
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.820
Dianna Jaramillo: Crash and Burn

125
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:18.780
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

126
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Like I was getting pretty close to that. But really didn't want to

127
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.470
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, like I was really fighting it at the same time.

128
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.810
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, so

129
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.380
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know how mean I can

130
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.330
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm pretty good at fighting that that kind of stuff, you know, like

131
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:46.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Falling really super deep into depression and stuff like that. Um, I am. I'm actually really good at fighting off fighting off that kind of stuff.

132
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:55.110
Dominique Pozo: Well, this is when I think about your, your chart and all the fire that you have in it. And I think it's really helpful. You know that you've got

133
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.890
Dianna Jaramillo: So many

134
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.200
Dominique Pozo: Fire inside that even if you

135
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.200
Dominique Pozo: sink down you know how to light yourself back up and

136
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.540
Dominique Pozo: Re come back up. So, yeah.

137
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. That's really true for me.

138
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.310
For sure.

139
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.120
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and then like another kind of weird thing.

140
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.260
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm like, I've been waking up crying.

141
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.930
Dianna Jaramillo: Huh. It's like on

142
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.620
Dianna Jaramillo: This. The last time it happened was, like, about, I don't know, maybe three nights ago

143
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:36.210
Dianna Jaramillo: But I'm like I'm, I'm just like having this horrible dream and

144
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:47.190
Dianna Jaramillo: And I'm all I really remember is that most time. It's about my mom like my mom's there and I'm crying And I'm like really crying begging her

145
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.740
Dianna Jaramillo: Just I don't know really what I can't really remember details. I just know that like I'm crying for her.

146
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.110
Dianna Jaramillo: For something like I'm talking to her.

147
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.650
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm trying really, really hard. And then I wake up and I'm like,

148
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.660
Dianna Jaramillo: Like I can't

149
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.650
Dianna Jaramillo: I can't breathe because I'm crying so hard in my dream.

150
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.430
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

151
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.600
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's happened actually that's happened like three times in the last couple weeks.

152
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.770
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's take a moment with that because that

153
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.790
Dominique Pozo: That I I am so

154
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.260
Dominique Pozo: I so respect our dreams you know I

155
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.810
Dominique Pozo: Just know the parts of our psyche that either don't have the space or it's too scary to look at in

156
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.580
Dominique Pozo: Yet consciously so

157
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:44.550
Dominique Pozo: Let's take a moment and just be with what your psyche is allowing to come through. I think it, it sounds really positive that some emotion is moving through even if it's while you're sleeping and

158
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.690
Yeah.

159
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.350
Dominique Pozo: So maybe if you can

160
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.990
Dominique Pozo: Just contact that that space in yourself and notice where in your body.

161
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:06.420
Dominique Pozo: You like if your body has a memory of waking up with that. Where, where is that in your body and

162
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.420
Dominique Pozo: Maybe warm your hands up together and then just place your hands on, you know, wherever that

163
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.860
Dominique Pozo: That emotion is

164
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.970
Dominique Pozo: Moving through you.

165
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.820
Dianna Jaramillo: may tell me, for sure.

166
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.820
Dominique Pozo: your tummy. Okay, great. So let's take a moment and just hold your tummy.

167
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.140
Dominique Pozo: And really giving that a little more more space, you know, just

168
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.780
Dominique Pozo: Letting the tummy know hey I'm listening and I

169
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.130
Dominique Pozo: See you, I hear you.

170
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:54.390
Dominique Pozo: Your voice is important. You know, the voice of emotion that's coming through.

171
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:08.850
Dominique Pozo: And then just if you can, if you could say anything to your tummy or ask it anything, what would you say or ask

172
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.960
Dominique Pozo: And really speak it through your hands as you're making contact

173
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.210
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't really. I don't know. I don't know what I would say.

174
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.550
Dominique Pozo: What would you tell me say to your hands.

175
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:41.040
Dominique Pozo: If you can imagine that your hands are like this extension of your heart that are listening, what would your tummy say to them.

176
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.850
Dianna Jaramillo: So I don't know. It's like, it feels like a little kid vibe.

177
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Like

178
00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Make a little kid get scared and or sad. In the end, it makes their stomach hurt. It feels like that.

179
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:01.320
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

180
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:18.450
Dominique Pozo: So if that scared little kid could say something or asked for something from your hands. This extension of your heart, would it couldn't ask for anything.

181
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.180
Dianna Jaramillo: Just worms probably just the one thing that healing energy

182
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.180
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

183
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.730
Dominique Pozo: And how can your hands. Imagine that they could offer that to this part of you.

184
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.670
Dianna Jaramillo: Through here.

185
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.460
Dominique Pozo: They're here. Okay.

186
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.830
Dominique Pozo: What kind of heat.

187
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Like energy, the

188
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.340
Dianna Jaramillo: Energy that builds up in the pits already happening, the palms of my hands are turning super red

189
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.930
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

190
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.330
Dianna Jaramillo: That's happened. My whole life.

191
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.410
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

192
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.450
Dianna Jaramillo: That energy that builds up in it turns hopped in my

193
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.970
Dianna Jaramillo: In my palms. It's like

194
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.700
Dianna Jaramillo: That's like a healing energy, I think.

195
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.730
Dominique Pozo: So what is your belly. Think about that. Is that what your belly would like

196
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:31.320
Dominique Pozo: Does that feel like it. Yeah, okay. Okay, sounds like there's maybe some consent and an agreement here that

197
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.620
Dominique Pozo: Your hands will offer heat and your belly would like that.

198
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:35.520
Yep.

199
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.460
Dianna Jaramillo: Yep, definitely.

200
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes. Oh good right away.

201
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.090
Dominique Pozo: So let's stick with that good feeling just for a little longer here.

202
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.510
Dominique Pozo: So the belly is like

203
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:08.820
Dominique Pozo: The second brain it's or you could say the first brain. It's the it. There's a whole plexus of nerves in our belly that take in

204
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:18.120
Dominique Pozo: You know, the environment. That's why little kids often if they're having a hard time their belly hurts first because all the nervous system has its reaction through the belly, so

205
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:29.250
Dominique Pozo: This is a really great. I think it'll be a really great practice to keep soothing yourself from this part of you because there are so many nerves here and it was calming for the whole nervous system.

206
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.660
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, cool. Yeah, that's interesting.

207
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:44.220
Dominique Pozo: Here in Hawaii. They call it the night owl and a little Akina a you and this is like

208
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.840
Dominique Pozo: When I've been around Hawaiian families and I listened to the elders, talk to the little ones, they tell them what is your house, say, you know, move

209
00:17:52.380 --> 00:18:03.180
Dominique Pozo: Out and they really they. This is where they move from this is like their. That's the first brain for them. They don't say move from what you think they're like, move from here, so there's

210
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:03.780
Dominique Pozo: You know,

211
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:10.020
Dominique Pozo: Different cultures they really trust this part. So I just really want to honor, you're not out and

212
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.630
Dominique Pozo: And

213
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, yeah.

214
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:24.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Well that's, that's awesome. And that's, that's, like, I, I've always kind of felt like it just non that like instinctual really like it's typing.

215
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:36.360
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, yeah, like people are or more tapped into to that in that that energy than then we give ourselves credit for. Right. I feel like I've always known that

216
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.330
Dominique Pozo: For sure there's we all have this like real primitive part that

217
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.680
Dianna Jaramillo: That no yeah and you know

218
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:51.510
Dominique Pozo: Maybe some of these cultures that have remained a little more earth based they they just remember, and they still move and operate from here, but

219
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.550
Dominique Pozo: You know, our culture. We're so in our head and

220
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.430
Dominique Pozo: Yet, figuring things out. So yep

221
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:11.640
Dominique Pozo: Let's, um, let's see, we still have we still have about half an hour. I'm wondering, do you want to stick with this and deepen with it with some art or writing or music or do you want to switch to something else. Where, where would you like to go in a session.

222
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.350
Um,

223
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:27.210
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't, I don't know, we could. What else would we switch to I don't really have anything

224
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:36.540
Dominique Pozo: Wherever your, you want to take me. Yeah. So it's kind of like, you know, I think I'm asking. I'm just thinking, Okay. Is there anything else that's up for you that

225
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:51.090
Dominique Pozo: That you want to address or talk about maybe it's not a good space or time because you've got someone else there. Yeah, I feel I do sense there's a lot more that we could talk about yet. It's not maybe the safest space to do that right now.

226
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:51.840
Right.

227
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.730
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

228
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.560
Dominique Pozo: I have an idea. How about

229
00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:02.760
Dominique Pozo: How about if you can get some pen and a paper or some art supplies. Anything that you can actually

230
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.350
Dominique Pozo: Let's

231
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.390
Dominique Pozo: Let's talk about it, but not verbally.

232
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:14.670
Dominique Pozo: So I'm going to ask you some questions and then you can either respond with your own writing or with an image or

233
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:16.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay.

234
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay.

235
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.560
Okay.

236
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.870
Dominique Pozo: So,

237
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:39.870
Let's see.

238
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.930
Dominique Pozo: What could a question be

239
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.420
Dominique Pozo: Why don't you show me with a drawing.

240
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.520
Dominique Pozo: Anything, anything that you want to show me through a drawing around this topic, so

241
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.010
Dominique Pozo: I don't, I just, I don't really know where to begin with it. So I want you to show me.

242
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:20.790
Dominique Pozo: Through an image.

243
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.980
Dominique Pozo: What where

244
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.680
Dominique Pozo: Where shall we begin

245
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:26.820
Okay.

246
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Simple

247
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.820
Dianna Jaramillo: fast and simple and basic

248
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.980
Dianna Jaramillo: But I can see if you can see this one on your left.

249
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.550
Dianna Jaramillo: Side, can you can you see it.

250
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:35.790
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, the so it looks like like a something spiky and a hand moving towards it with a little drip.

251
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:41.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, like having like something like one of those little, um,

252
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.320
Dianna Jaramillo: They're like

253
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.670
Dianna Jaramillo: Really like poisonous. The little ones in the sea.

254
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.590
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, like a zero action.

255
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

256
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:55.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Those are like pending pending one of those like like loving in wanting to pet it

257
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.150
Dominique Pozo: Oh, they hurt.

258
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.590
Dianna Jaramillo: They hurt. No much

259
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.700
Dominique Pozo: When they when they go when they penetrate it hurts. Yeah.

260
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.300
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly. And then the other. I made another real quick.

261
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.040
Dianna Jaramillo: Quickly, it's stroke.

262
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.720
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

263
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:18.390
Dianna Jaramillo: It's like the lips are gonna kiss a, like a venomous snake.

264
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.490
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Well, interesting what okay so so

265
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:30.900
Dominique Pozo: The first thing that comes to my mind is will you write a list of words that describe the sea urchin, and then a list of words that described the

266
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.290
Snake.

267
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.810
Dianna Jaramillo: It's kinda like the same words are coming up for both of them.

268
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:40.590
Okay.

269
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.170
Dianna Jaramillo: To describe both of them.

270
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.210
Dianna Jaramillo: So,

271
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.610
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to show me or do you want to read them.

272
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:54.510
Dianna Jaramillo: And beautiful and poisonous and on the snake deadly

273
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.220
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

274
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.140
Dianna Jaramillo: The

275
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.980
Dianna Jaramillo: Lake rare. They're both like rare.

276
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.280
Dianna Jaramillo: To see or to be in contact with

277
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.300
Mm hmm.

278
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:13.500
Dominique Pozo: Sounds to me, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like there's there's like an enchanting quality about them like

279
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.150
Dominique Pozo: Something in you like just

280
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:22.350
Dominique Pozo: Towards the thing. And then, but part of you knows this might not be in my best interest, but you're still reaching for it.

281
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes, yeah.

282
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.240
Dominique Pozo: What is it that you're reaching towards

283
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.820
Dominique Pozo: So what is the enchanting so you said beautiful

284
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.650
Dominique Pozo: You said rare what let's expand on that a little more

285
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Um,

286
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.290
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes, just like being

287
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Almost like like wanting something you can't have
