00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.440
ethant: Hello.

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey,

3
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.820
ethant: I feel like I've been like, I don't know if it's tired or depressed or what. And I've been

4
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.530
ethant: Sort of spinning my wheels at work. So I'm like running up on this big deadline that's happening on Friday.

5
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

6
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.260
ethant: I'm and I'm late, or I'm I feel like I'm behind and I'm sort of scrambling to get all this work done.

7
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:52.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, probably a little overworked. Are you taking breaks, like you're supposed to and eating lunch like you're supposed to do and eating dinner or breakfast, like you're supposed to

8
00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:02.370
ethant: Yeah, I think I'm taking pretty good care of myself. So it just occurred to me when I was thinking about meeting with you. I was like, maybe I'm overmedicated

9
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.660
ethant: I don't really. I never looked into it, but I'm

10
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.370
ethant: Like, I don't know about the dosing of the the Suboxone and I don't know, so maybe I'm on a perfectly appropriate.

11
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:27.330
ethant: Those and this isn't related at all. But I don't know. Just this week, I kind of slumped into this again, I've been journaling, a year and kind of seeing my journal. I just kind of

12
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.250
ethant: Burned out and started getting depressed about this and that and

13
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.680
ethant: And I started

14
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.100
ethant: I work every day but i i

15
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.160
ethant: Haven't been real focused at work. And so I'm kind of I've had this big deadline looming.

16
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.010
ethant: And I kind of thought. This week I was just going to work consistently enough throughout the week that it wouldn't really be a big deal. But I don't know. It's like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday have gone by, and I've gotten very little done

17
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, so

18
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.850
ethant: Yeah i don't know i like i worked over the weekend to

19
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.690
ethant: Me, I actually did make a little progress over the weekend.

20
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you just tired or

21
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.690
ethant: Tired. And I feel like I'm

22
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.380
ethant: procrastinating, a little bit, but I can't tell if it's you know it's

23
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.480
ethant: It's like, is it specific. Is it just that I'm tired or is it because I'm depressed or it's just sort of a

24
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.640
ethant: Whole

25
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any other issues, besides being tired, but you've noticed

26
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:44.040
ethant: Um, no. So I was complaining, like the or I was bringing up the, the, I was having like the sex drive problems that seems to be getting a little bit better.

27
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:58.230
ethant: My appetites pretty normal actually just this week. I started using the bathroom. It's been like a pretty regular week for constipation. It's all that other stuff is like actually getting more stable.

28
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.760
ethant: And then I actually last week. Um, I had a big anxiety week so I actually took the anxiety medication like

29
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.440
ethant: Three times in a week, which is kind of, that's a lot for me.

30
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.430
ethant: This week I haven't taken any but I'm

31
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.080
ethant: But I'm kind of experiencing this

32
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:38.730
ethant: Like I'm I feel D motivated and tired all the time. And so if there's a lot of things going on. It's like, as you know, like my jobs wrapping up and the sky that

33
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:53.670
ethant: I've had on my team for three or four years now is leaving on Friday. And so I have to start doing all of his work and there's a lot of. There's a lot of like emotions about the whole thing right everything from lots of different perspectives like

34
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.330
ethant: Money feelings are kind of heard that.

35
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:12.690
ethant: Like Connor is so good that he even though he's on my team he kind of built up this reputation is the guy that can like do anything which is that used to be me kind of right now, but I kind of like

36
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.040
ethant: It partially it's he's very talented, but it was partially because I mentored him and I like put them in that position.

37
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:35.970
ethant: But I keep I'm very studious I keep track of everything that he does. And so it's just it hurts my feelings, a little bit that everybody feels like when he leaves like nobody can do all this stuff that and I'm like, I can you know I built all this stuff. What do you guys worrying about

38
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

39
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:50.760
ethant: But it, you know. And some of that comes back to like I've had been really flake, you know, because of I was hiding, you know, getting high for like three or four months there. I was like, really flaky and unavailable and Connor is really consistent. So

40
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.700
Um,

41
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.800
So,

42
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're sleeping. Okay.

43
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.210
ethant: Yeah.

44
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.580
ethant: I have trouble. I've always it's been a lifelong thing where I have trouble falling asleep early

45
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.860
ethant: So,

46
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:27.150
ethant: Recently I sleep pretty well i'd like fall asleep and I sleep. Okay, but I tend to not go to sleep until one in the morning and then I have all these meetings that are kind of on the early side like

47
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:39.450
ethant: starting as early as like 730 or eight. So I get. I get to call in from home, which is nice, but so I tend to not get like a full eight hours of sleep. I get six hours or something like that.

48
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That might be a part of it.

49
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it might be catching up to you.

50
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

51
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.850
ethant: Yeah, I, I certainly noticed on the weekends, when I don't have a reason to get up early in the morning I sleep until, like, two o'clock.

52
00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.730
ethant: Or not every day, but it's often not unusual for me to sleep like to feel like I have a lot of sleep to catch up on the weekend.

53
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But and the weekends. What time are you going to bed.

54
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.270
ethant: Pretty much the same like

55
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:21.690
ethant: Usually kind of wind down and get in bed at like 11 or 1130 and then either watch TV or read or something and I just always ends up being 1230 or one before. And really actually going to sleep.

56
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I could be a part of it. You could be coming down with something

57
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's Blues going around colds going around sign is cold going around, um,

58
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

59
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.570
ethant: Yeah, that's another thing that I've been a little panic about is the whole

60
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.480
ethant: Code 19 like we've been

61
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.400
ethant: Trying to clean the apartment like so that it's a little bit more

62
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:59.910
ethant: Like for the first time ever, like oh my god that door knobs are so grows in our apartment like we never even thought about clean so that takes a little bit of my

63
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.180
ethant: Thinking, or my attention every day.

64
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:15.420
ethant: And then like my things are very sweet with my wife, but at the same time she's, she's going through this thing where she's like super and absorbed in this video game.

65
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.250
ethant: So she has kind of a, I can tell it's sort of like an addictive thing.

66
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He

67
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.350
ethant: She does it to escape, and she just disappears. You know, into this thing for like

68
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.920
ethant: for hours and hours and hours, and most of you know a lot of the time that she's at home. And so I feel like I'm kind of losing her off into that world. And so

69
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.910
ethant: So that was one topic that I know like I journaled about

70
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.460
ethant: And then, yeah, there's like the various reasons to be emotional in that work like

71
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.960
ethant: It's getting hard and at the same time I'm about to leave. And I kind of don't want to leave. And I kind of do want to leave and I've got this

72
00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:08.130
ethant: Potential next job that I started talking to these guys who I'd really like to work for. And then I realized like, shoot. Maybe I started that conversation too early because I don't know when I can get out of my obligations at my current place and

73
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:23.250
ethant: One thing that is cool is like I looked up today, I sort of have this golden handcuffs thing where like they there that I have to stick around because

74
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.370
ethant: They're trying that.

75
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:36.870
ethant: I have a retention package, basically. So I can't leave before the company or I could, but I'd be giving up a lot of money. And today I found out, it's even more money than I thought it was

76
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that made you feel good.

77
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:54.210
ethant: Yeah. Well, yeah. So I was like, whoa, that's so that maybe i and then I realized like, oh, maybe that's why they're not worrying that I'm going to leave because I've kind of my feelings get hurt, but they're not

78
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:04.290
ethant: I've sent them on several my you know my superior several emails about like extending my contract and all this stuff and it's just like nothing's happening. So

79
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Response

80
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.160
ethant: Yeah, so I interpret that is like

81
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:18.060
ethant: They definitely don't want to extend me they maybe even want to let me go early they have that option. That's why I started talking to the

82
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.420
ethant: This other company.

83
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can't go in and have a face to face conversation with you see

84
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.810
ethant: My boss is in Berlin. Oh.

85
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.340
FaceTime

86
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.980
ethant: Yeah, I

87
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.370
ethant: I used to meet with him more regularly and I haven't been I think part of it is that he

88
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:53.670
ethant: Like I talked to these other people that aren't my boss. They're more like my peers and I've brought up these issues, sort of, you know, I don't know what's going on with my contract and

89
00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:02.430
ethant: They all say, oh, been so busy ventures too busy to like deal with it right now, but he'll get it back to you and maybe that's true, maybe

90
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:14.580
ethant: It doesn't quite make sense to me. But maybe he's just so busy and he just doesn't have time to like figure out if He probably thinks of it like three months away so like no big deal. Right, right.

91
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're kind of like walking on eggshells, not knowing when it's gonna happen.

92
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.930
ethant: A little bit, yeah.

93
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:33.270
ethant: Right. So there's all that uncertainty. Like, am I definitely here for three more months and my hair for longer am I going to be out the door sooner and

94
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.950
ethant: Lots of like sensitivity around that stuff.

95
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.840
ethant: Yeah, even

96
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any food from the other day.

97
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.700
ethant: I forget how much did I tell you about all about them. I forget.

98
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:59.190
ethant: Yeah, yeah. So they I emailed with them. And they're like, they sent me this really nice email back where I told them, like I don't have my resume ready. I'm not really sure we're going to be free from

99
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:17.220
ethant: This current job but um let me find out more, as soon as I can. And I'll you know I'll get back to you soon. And they sort of replied, and they. It's sort of like poking the bear, or whatever. It's like once you get the process started. And they want to make it happen as soon as possible.

100
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.300
ethant: You know,

101
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:28.080
ethant: So the CEO said you don't even need a resume, just come and meet the team and we want you to start as soon as possible, and you can have any title you want and all this, like so.

102
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:41.460
ethant: So obviously I don't know if it's just these doing everything you can do like make me comfortable and make you know

103
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me. Make it happen. But

104
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.360
ethant: So yeah, like there's definitely things that I can feel good about there. But then there's also a little stressful because

105
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.620
ethant: I don't want to

106
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:09.900
ethant: Put them in a situation where I'm like, leveraging one job, you know, till I get more money out of the other or anything like that. I just want to set things up. So my current gig gets what they want and they're happy, and I can leave. And then I can you know have a job to go to you.

107
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense in a perfect very

108
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bad, you know, and this is just my suggestion that you, you know, ask for a FaceTime meeting with your current boss and really kind of nail down you know what's going to happen.

109
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And ask him direct questions, you know, and get the information and the clarity that you need so that you're not walking on eggshells anymore and we have the information

110
00:12:43.230 --> 00:13:00.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And and you can. I mean, I would just be completely honest with them. Honestly, you know, and let them know you know you you do have an opportunity, but this is what you want would rather see, you know, but if that's not a possibility, you know, yeah, I'm just asking, you know,

111
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:15.330
ethant: Yeah, I think, yeah, you're right. I should do that. I think I kind of got frustrated because I sent several emails to him, where I was very enthusiastic about the this because it sounded like it was kind of going to happen for a while and then suddenly became like

112
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.910
ethant: This you know black hole where I wasn't getting any answers about anything.

113
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:38.010
ethant: And I used to. So first it was my boss and then he stopped responding to emails and then I used to talk about it. Pretty much every time I talked to my peers and then they sort of stopped like we all collectively just sort of stopped bringing it up and it's like weeks are going by.

114
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.110
ethant: And

115
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.550
ethant: So, and I've, I feel weird.

116
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.970
ethant: And I don't know, maybe I'm proud or something like that. It's like, I don't want. They don't want to

117
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:52.560
ethant: Do that.

118
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.340
ethant: I don't want to force them to do they know what I mean.

119
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's a little passage because you're talking about your life you're talking about your career, you're talking about your future and what is to come back and you know if you're not your own advocate, who's going to advocate for you.

120
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.910
ethant: Yes.

121
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.630
ethant: So I should just send a message to Ben and say, like,

122
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:37.050
ethant: You know I'm honestly I'm interpreting, you know, the, the lack of communication recently that we're probably not going to do this.

123
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:49.440
ethant: Which is ok but i i'm and I'll tell them I have other opportunities and I really need some clarity about or I need to talk to you about what the realistic like timeline. If

124
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: there's anything wrong with that. I mean, I feel like that when companies do that to their employees. It's not fair to them.

125
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because they go in every day, wondering if it's their last day there or, you know, what's it going to look like they have no idea. You know, and it's kind of a stretch makes work 10 times more stressful than it needs to be, you know,

126
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:20.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that would be my suggestion that you just have a conversation or trying to have a conversation with them. Yep.

127
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.580
ethant: Yeah, and I think that's, that's a good idea.

128
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.280
ethant: That's definitely one thing I couldn't do.

129
00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.290
ethant: I gotta get

130
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.030
ethant: Past this like procrastination and like whatever is going on with me.

131
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:48.570
ethant: I just, I got to the point where, like, I have to basically work every hour from now till Friday to get this done. So I spent like even in the minutes when I was, I was like, setting up our call tonight. I was like starting to sort of

132
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.000
Get into it again.

133
00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you got to rest and you have to eat dinner and make sure that you're, you know, honing in on that piece, too, because without that, you know, you will be tired all the time, you won't feel good, your headaches.

134
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:17.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't know. So you really gotta pay attention, all those things to it could just be the stress of your work because last week you want depressed.

135
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.050
ethant: Yeah, I think I felt good last week. That's my memory of it.

136
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And are you on a depression medicine.

137
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.520
ethant: So I take a really small dose of Prozac. It's such a small dose that it's like

138
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:40.620
ethant: Out of the range that the doctors thing has any effect. But in my experience, it does have a little. It helps me a little bit, so

139
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:57.150
ethant: I always have the option of increasing that which, over the years, I've taken it for many, many years. And over the years. Occasionally I'll get kind of depressed and I try, increasing the dose and then there's that causes me to either be even sleepier or, you know,

140
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.330
ethant: Have other side effects or whatever. So then I invariably I end up go in

141
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.110
ethant: Yeah, back on this low dose that I'm on

142
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you been going to the gym and

143
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting some exercise.

144
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.190
ethant: No. So I that I've even thought about it, to be perfectly honest.

145
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.680
ethant: I know I talked about that in our last year and it hasn't even occurred to me.

146
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you getting any saying

147
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.100
ethant: Yeah, I get out a little bit like

148
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:45.300
ethant: I've been working from home and like going for walks. At noon to get groceries or a sandwich or something like last night, I walked up to my sister's place and had dinner up there with the family. So I get out. Maybe I could stand out a little more, but

149
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.970
I get out of it.

150
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. So

151
00:17:51.660 --> 00:18:08.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I you know you're married or being in group on Monday. So if you're still feeling, you know, the way that you're feeling right now. I definitely have a conversation with her about it and see if it could be your doses and increase. So, you know, it shouldn't be.

152
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know, yes.

153
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

154
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that doesn't make any sense. You know why all of a sudden, you would have a slump like this if it was the medication related anything new added in.

155
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:40.200
ethant: No. Well, so this is my I'm just looking one to this is my I'm in the middle of my fourth week and I think we increased my dose and my second week, so in another way. Another possibility is my, my whole system is just still adjusting to the

156
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.080
To the medication. Right.

157
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:58.890
ethant: I mean, I just like I was saying I just sort of got my sex drive. It's not exactly normal, but it's like seems like it's getting normal and my appetite and my digestion and all that stuff is just just recently kind of seems to be

158
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Normal. Yeah, yeah.

159
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

160
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what kind of are you eating healthy

161
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.320
ethant: Or you think are you pretty well I'm

162
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.610
ethant: I tend to have sort of high starch dinners or like protein and

163
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:29.790
ethant: Bread. But I like, I don't know, often make salads, for myself, but because I like, I don't know, I always have a smoothie in the morning and then I'll have like a sandwich for lunch and then

164
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.300
ethant: Steak or wouldn't be whatever is in the fridge for dinner.

165
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That shouldn't be it.

166
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm trying to dissect what it might be.

167
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I just kind of think that it's stress.

168
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.020
ethant: I think it's a combination like

169
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.590
ethant: Now that I'm saying all these things out loud. It's a combination of situational

170
00:19:51.750 --> 00:20:03.270
ethant: Where I'm kind of on what you said, I'm on eggshells with is one thing, but that's just one out of 2015 you know 10 things I have going on between that and my wife and my sobriety and my

171
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.960
ethant: You know this job and the next job in this project and Connor, leaving

172
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.410
ethant: The code virus and Paul, you know, the election. And there's a lot of stuff. This is happening this week.

173
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so it's going to be really important that you take time try to take time to get to the gym know even just for a little bit, that definitely boost your energy and

174
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.130
ethant: I have this thing called the seven minute workout, which is like

175
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.550
ethant: Pretty hard. Actually, I mean it's

176
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:52.140
ethant: It's the I'm sure someone is in shaping do more in seven minutes, but it's like this thing and then some health writer at the New York Times designed. It's like a whole body workout with no no equipment in seven minutes.

177
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice. No.

178
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:55.650
ethant: I'm

179
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.750
ethant: Which I that and it's easy, and I could just do it at home. So at least I could try that tonight.

180
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:14.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's what I would do and make sure that you you know are getting enough rest and that you're drinking enough water, and that you're putting you know some

181
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:26.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Semi healthy food in your system. Yep. You know, just in case if you are getting ready to come down with something that you know will help fight it out, you know,

182
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:35.730
ethant: He's like, it's interesting that you think I'm coming down with something as I'm so worried about the virus that's going around.

183
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:43.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I know that there's other things besides that I know that there's sinus stuff that's going around, you know,

184
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:43.830
Yeah.

185
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you just gotta pay attention to what your body says, you know, yes. You know that

186
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.670
ethant: Yeah.

187
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And kind of like, pay attention to.

188
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:08.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your Depression level over the next couple days until you see Mary and see if you can average it or not, see if it's if it's consistently low or if it fluctuate up and down.

189
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But then you can kind of get a better idea on what's going on.

190
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.720
ethant: Yeah, I'll write about it more carefully in my journal, um,

191
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.590
ethant: Yeah, it's funny, like this procrastination thing like yesterday I

192
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:36.780
ethant: Got up and I did all my like the morning is always totally hectic because it's the end of the day in Germany, where the most there's all bunch of people

193
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:49.620
ethant: Working it's I always wake up in the minute that I wake up, there's like 50 things to catch up on. And there's calls and more in meeting in the morning and everything. So, and then there's stand ups that are for the San Francisco team and

194
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.670
ethant: So I kind of get through all that and then I

195
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.060
ethant: Do some other stuff. And then it's lunchtime and then

196
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:10.050
ethant: The last couple days. It's like I get through all that and then the work kind of stopped or that all the other the meeting and everything stopped and I'm like home. It's nice and hot at home and I get sleepy. So I'm like, oh, I'm tired. Now, yesterday I just got in bed and slept.

197
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.350
ethant: In the middle of the afternoon slept for three hours.

198
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.990
ethant: Which felt great. But then I felt guilty and I didn't get anything done. And, you know,

199
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, again, you know, you gotta listen to what your body's telling you, you know, if you can get little cat naps in between, you know, I don't think that there's anything wrong with that right now.

200
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, no.

201
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.040
ethant: Yeah, as long as I make the deadline.

202
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:43.350
ethant: I think ever but everybody's kind of giving me a pass on lots of other things that I kind of supposed to be doing, because they know that I have this big deadline.

203
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.700
ethant: But then if I don't make

204
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.270
ethant: Make this deadline. They're like, they're gonna be like, What have you been doing like

205
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.180
You know, getting this at least

206
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got it. Yeah, probably. I hope so.

207
00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.730
ethant: Just today and tomorrow. And that's all that I have

208
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:08.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you got to work after you get done with me and then go to bed at a decent time get up in the morning and start again.

209
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.650
ethant: Pretty much you

210
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.380
ethant: Don't have to be at the office because like for the next two days. I actually have to go in

211
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well make sure that while you're going through this and you're

212
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Under pressure that you're taking good care of yourself. And again, pay attention to, you know what your depressions doing if it's fluctuating or if it's, you know, study, you know, or if it goes away.

213
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:48.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just pay attention to it and make sure that you're, you know, eating good. And you're sleeping well you know

214
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.120
ethant: Yes. Yeah, I'll do my best.

215
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

216
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

217
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So from now until the next time I see you the next time that I see you

218
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're going to have that information logged. Right. Yeah.

219
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. And I'm glad everything else is starting to get better and normalize. You know what I mean.

220
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good definitely a good sign. Your body's getting used to what you're on. You're starting to work with it, instead of against it.

221
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so that's important.

222
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.240
ethant: Yeah, like for example I used to have a runny nose, like all day every day. And that just went away.

223
00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:43.470
ethant: Like I still do blow my nose. Occasionally, but it's not like it was bad. This is this idea that that was the symptom that because Mary took one look at me on my second appointment with her and she's like, okay, we're increasing the diversity.

224
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.180
ethant: I think it was because I was like

225
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.320
blowing my nose Bolton.

226
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's definitely a sign of detox.

227
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.130
ethant: Perspective to that like I have a lot of things to feel good about

228
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:26.460
ethant: Like I have to the one job that's going to pay me all this money and the potential for my next job. It's like, these aren't things that should make me feel bad, necessarily, but just the lens that I look at it right now. It's like it's just all stress.

229
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:37.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is right now and it does kind of level out but anybody that's in your situation that you are in right now would be stressed out, it would definitely play a factor.

230
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's the unknown. Not sure if anything, and in this area and then the pressure from this other company that once you right now. You know, so that's kind of a big deal. Yeah, it really is.

231
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, I get that.

232
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.100
ethant: But it's like a luxury problem in the way

233
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.700
ethant: Of luxury problems right word, but it's like I've had worse problems for sure.

234
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is. It's definitely a luxury problem, but it still can be majorly stressful.

235
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:15.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know definitely in any kind of change when we get in a routine and get into this whole

236
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: System of how we do things any kind of change can really add stress and anxiety, you know, just can. So, and then, you know, not getting a response.

237
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that would that would put me put me on edge to

238
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so I get

239
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.910
ethant: Pretty clear like I understand what the business is

240
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.280
ethant: Thinking. It's like the whole point of buying our company.

241
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:48.090
ethant: And moving into Germany was they want to save money by employing people in Germany who make less money than people do in San Francisco.

242
00:27:48.540 --> 00:28:03.060
ethant: This is exactly from a boardroom level. This is exactly what they don't want to do is, it was pay people these high rates in San Francisco, right. Mm hmm. So I totally, like, I understand that from a business perspective.

243
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:16.410
ethant: However, it looks like a train wreck and slow motion because I know for a fact that if I left next week or in two weeks. The whole company would the wheels come off and they don't know what they're doing.

244
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.330
ethant: And so that

245
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.160
ethant: There.

246
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.160
ethant: It's not my problem. I guess but

247
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But there's also this point where Connor, the one that you train is getting ready to leave. And so once he's out of the picture, and you're doing what you do best and they see. Oh, yeah.

248
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, we're not just left hanging and we do have, you know,

249
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:54.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We do have even he is the one that you know what i mean i think that they'll be they'll become more appreciative to to your position and where you're at, to and glad that you're there, you know what I mean, I think that that plays a factor of it to that you're, you're kind of

250
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe a little hurt.

251
00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.310
Right and

252
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:14.610
ethant: I think you're probably right. And then also, I always have to keep remembering like when I'm insulted that they're not like jumping through hoops to hire me like I was so flake. I was like a mess. I was working in a blackout for two months, basically. So, yeah.

253
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.400
ethant: And that was, like, you know, not very long ago.

254
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

255
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.370
ethant: So I don't. It's not exactly doesn't make sense for me to

256
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.340
ethant: Expect them to like

257
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:41.850
ethant: To just be like, oh, even healthy now everything's you know they don't even know, normal for me because they've only known me for a year and I've been like slowly getting worse and worse and worse throughout that year, to be honest.

258
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they're gonna be able to see that here before long after, Congressman.

259
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:51.060
Yep.

260
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.850
ethant: Yeah, then I'll have you like, not that I'm not complaining. But if

261
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.640
ethant: If they did give me an amazing offer

262
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.310
ethant: Then I would have to

263
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:18.300
ethant: Decide between them and like taking it, or I could pressure them to go. If I came. If I went to them and said I really want to take this job, they would probably go along with it. You know what I mean.

264
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:24.630
ethant: Even though I think they'd be shooting themselves in the foot because they don't know what they're doing, but whatever. That's their decision to make.

265
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it really is.

266
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:33.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've just got to kind of give them the information and

267
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.990
ethant: Well, I have to decide what I want is what I realized like, if I'm not clear.

268
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.880
If I'm just totally flexible.

269
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.850
ethant: Okay, I don't know. I'll stay if you guys want me or I have this job. I can go to it, you know.

270
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.760
ethant: So it might be

271
00:30:54.810 --> 00:31:06.480
ethant: It might be better if I knew what I was shooting for like Connor I'm sad to see him. We've but he kind of looked at the situation that we're in an agent just decided that his best path was to get a new job as soon as possible.

272
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.950
ethant: And because he was the first one to do it or he was early on, then.

273
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.930
ethant: It was scary. But like, at least. There's still other people around you know so

274
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

275
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.530
ethant: So he gets still even then I'm but so I don't know.

276
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.500
Yeah, I don't know how they're gonna react. I have to talk to the boss.

277
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm sure that that's a stressful.

278
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thought to

279
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.840
ethant: Talking to the boss.

280
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:34.710
Yeah.

281
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:40.890
ethant: He's like he could, he calls himself an open book and he is pretty transparent.

282
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.100
ethant: He's not like scheming behind the scenes or anything.

283
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Too much

284
00:31:47.820 --> 00:32:02.850
ethant: But the other thing is like I've told his like number two operations person that I have this other this potential either job. You know what I mean. So that message was very clear to her. And so they didn't scramble behind the scenes to, like, make sure that I stay

285
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.140
ethant: You know if he wanted to make if she if

286
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.240
ethant: She's the one that

287
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:18.840
ethant: Probably if anybody should panic if I was going to leave sooner rather than later to be the one that should do it. And so she didn't really do it.

288
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:21.480
Right.

289
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I think you should just have a conversation with your boss, get some clarity.

290
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

291
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have that hard conversation, get it over with.

292
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that way you know what direction you know at least don't know what direction that company's going you know

293
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'll help you determine whether or not what direction you're going.

294
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.590
ethant: Yep. Alright, so I'll try to send an email to my boss like tonight.

295
00:32:53.700 --> 00:33:07.140
ethant: Or maybe I might put it off until this this week what I should do, though, because I left the other company hanging. So I'll respond to them. And I'll say, like, I really appreciate all your guys interest and I'm very interested, as you know, but I

296
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:16.680
ethant: But I still have to, I need to get more clarity for my boss, etc, etc. So

297
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.570
ethant: I'll just try to put them like hold them up for a week. If I can wait for a week. Right.

298
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, we can wait a week.

299
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.970
ethant: Or I don't know maybe

300
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:36.840
ethant: They might have the perfect candidate other candidate for the because they only have a handful of physicians, the ways that the CEO is talking. He was like, we're gonna make a position for you.

301
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it seems like they want you in no matter what. So I don't think that they would have a problem, waiting.

302
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Long as you're communicating with them, you know,

303
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:09.210
ethant: Yeah. The other thing is, we haven't talked about like salary, so maybe like I'm making really good money. I think in my current place.

304
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That they

305
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:18.300
ethant: Are trying to pay me way more than they think I could get in any other place so that I won't leave well

306
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:25.410
ethant: In these months. These last month's that I'm there. So I'm not even expecting that I'll make this exactly the same amount, but um

307
00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.350
ethant: But I do have like a

308
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:34.980
ethant: A sort of high expectation. I think for this other company. So we'll see how that goes.

309
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And maybe ask that you know the new company. You know what

310
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What the jobs gonna pay

311
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:56.580
ethant: Yeah, it might be a little premature like you normally you do a little bit of or, you know, I guess maybe in the job description. They give you a range.

312
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.650
So yeah, some some point on the early side, I should

313
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bring it up. Yeah, it's vital information on whether or not you want a job. Yeah.

314
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:11.850
ethant: I

315
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.250
ethant: Have a feeling like they raised money this year. And so they probably have plenty of money in the bank and

316
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:25.080
ethant: So I think, and they're in, they do security stuff. And so I think good security people tend to make pretty good money.

317
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.010
Mm hmm.

318
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

319
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so this week, you're gonna

320
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Continue on self care monitor your depression.

321
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to be able to

322
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:51.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Take a look at whether it's stress related or is a is the side effects of the most medicine leveling out so that you can discuss it with Mary on Monday. Yeah.

323
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.250
ethant: Okay. Oh, and I'm so I'm not going to see you on Monday. Remember, I'm gonna have a

324
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.430
ethant: You know, it's really likely that I could just show up at 15 or 20 minutes into the group.

325
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.710
ethant: So if I'm 20 minutes late, should I join or should I just not doing

326
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um no I say join and I'll yeah I'll let

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mary know that you're going to be late. But you're going to be in, um,

328
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.110
ethant: I have this appointment, which normally is pretty quick. And it's like,

329
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:36.450
ethant: Um, let me see. So the group starts at four, but I think my appointment. Is it, like, three. So if I like rush back to the apartment. I can probably
