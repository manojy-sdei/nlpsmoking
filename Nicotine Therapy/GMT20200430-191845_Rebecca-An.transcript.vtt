5
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.230
Sherrie Martinez: Okay, okay.

6
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, so the first question on the bio site wants to know what brings you the bright heart and why now.

7
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:57.090
Sherrie Martinez: And I came, I was trying to find somewhere to get help for my for Suboxone and I looked you guys up on nine and I found you. And it seemed like I'd liked it and why now because

8
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.770
Sherrie Martinez: I need it.

9
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

10
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Perfect.

11
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.340
Sherrie Martinez: I wasn't doing it. So I was looking at all your reviews and you guys have five stars. So I figured, go to the best

12
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome. Thank you very much. Do we have five stars.

13
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.160
Sherrie Martinez: I think four or five stars. I had a couple of all the stars are all gold size that I like this one, I'm going to check this with now.

14
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome. I didn't even know that. That's awesome. Um, can you tell me a little bit about your you're using history.

15
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like a

16
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Substance and just kind of the progression to

17
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:50.610
Sherrie Martinez: Started when I started using I was out, I got an accident and probably 2007 and I started going to a doctor.

18
00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.920
Sherrie Martinez: And he get he would give me a shot to my back because I really messed myself up. I couldn't even walk for a while and everything. And so he started getting the shot to my back. And then he started prescribing me really really strong.

19
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.560
Sherrie Martinez: OxyContin Oxycodone and then he got shot down

20
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:20.640
Sherrie Martinez: A friend, a shot showed me. I was really, really sick and in pain, and I had a friend. She showed me it heroin and she told me to try it, that it would help.

21
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:35.100
Sherrie Martinez: It was just like that. But then I wouldn't shoot it in my arm up shoe to actually apply notes first and then it wasn't worth doing the job. So I started actually shooting it in my arm and my feet in my arms.

22
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.660
Sherrie Martinez: And then I got an abscess not scared me so I got off of it. Yes, and I was sick. And then someone had shown me some Suboxone

23
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:59.220
Sherrie Martinez: And what am I said, you don't have to shoot it up. Nothing. You know, you just put it in your mouth. It worked. It was like a miracle. And I wasn't sick. I was fine. So then that's pretty much how it started.

24
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just answered. Another question without me asking gives the next question was, you know, what is your pain level. And what was the precipitating event.

25
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: around it. And so you just answered that question.

26
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's awesome.

27
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past treatment for you.

28
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.550
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, I had been I had gone into

29
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:33.750
Sherrie Martinez: Into Las Cruces, New Mexico, a treatment center there cuz i had i didn't know about Suboxone so they put me on methadone. I didn't like it. So I got, I went on to treatment center to get off that and I did.

30
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:43.140
Sherrie Martinez: But then I still having pain and the cravings and I started doing a little bit of heroin. Again, I don't want to. I didn't like that. I don't like it just filling up the sickness.

31
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.340
Sherrie Martinez: So then

32
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.710
Sherrie Martinez: That's when one of my friends showed me this box and seems to be working fine.

33
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. So today. What would, what would you rate your pain level as 00
