Cynthia We: Me figuring out the budget, maybe

6
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.020
Cynthia We: Messy.

7
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.660
Messy.

8
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.950
Cynthia We: Because if you turn the light. It's in the background and it will make us, it will make us appear to have no

9
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No face. Yeah.

10
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.070

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so are we.

14
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the plan today to have a short term. So what do we do now before the regular income comes in, or is there something bigger going on.

15
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.670
That would be a great idea.

16
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Help. What short term.

17
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.200
Cynthia We: Plan. Yeah, I mean, it's just the short term plan is

18
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.980
Cynthia We: You know, don't spend any money and hold on for dear life.

19
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.520
Cynthia We: Make it through the three weeks until I start working so

20
00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but unfortunately, right, that actually has to materialize into prioritizing what little bit of resources you have into something right, so what's the actual liquid that you guys have to work with until when's your start date.

21
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.670
Cynthia We: March 16 but I

22
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.390
Cynthia We: IT'S MARCH 16 I might work. Some preparatory days before that and then I will repay the week after. So yeah, I would say.

23
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
Cynthia We: The second or third week of March is when I'll have a paycheck at all. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.

24
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, and I can't remember if it was like three or $4,000 that has to hold you over until then.

25
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.900
Cynthia We: Um,

26
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.800
Cynthia We: Yeah, well whatever unemployment is and then whatever we have left plus whatever Ali. Okay, I'll figure real quick. Okay. Okay. Good. Well, I looked for a pen.

27
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds good to

28
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.180
Cynthia We: Get a plan together like your calendar here. Oh, goodness.

29
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.660
Cynthia We: Oh, there's my pen.

30
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.040
Cynthia We: My brake light just went on.

31
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:36.960
Cynthia We: Break, Break like some yeah the one that said it, it says parking my parking brake is on and it says check brake system. Okay. So you're thinking

32
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.740
Maybe that

33
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you want to take it in Cabot looked at. Is that what the thought is

34
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.890
Yeah.

35
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotcha.

36
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.260
I don't know 2400 2400

37
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.630
Cynthia We: What Oliver OSU.

38
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.620
Cynthia We: Plus what's there. Plus 1500

39
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.800
Cynthia We: That's that's assuming you don't work for all in

40
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: 15 is left over from tax.

41
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.720
Cynthia We: That's what's their six or for Ali was 1000 plus four weeks or three weeks of

42
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:23.190
Cynthia We: Live 20 404 weeks of unemployment, you well you said you're stating three weeks, one there, one there, one there, one is a four weeks.

43
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.290
Cynthia We: And then I'm assuming something awesome. Oh, okay.

44
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.040
Cynthia We: I'm sorry, I don't know how you have that I have

45
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.440
Cynthia We: Because I was counting three weeks of unemployment and it wasn't counting any work from home.

46
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.350
Cynthia We: And I was guessing it was in the accountant.

47
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.840
Cynthia We: You probably writer.

48
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:58.470
Cynthia We: So Scott Oh 29. So do you think you're working a week. I'm sure with more profitable or not paid on planet.

49
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.800
Cynthia We: Why don't you just do it this way and not anything we get from him will be a bonus

50
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, why don't we start there. Since there was a lot of stress that came from that unknown.

51
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he he eventually pays right it's just like

52
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.280
Cynthia We: Promise for a week and a half before

53
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. So just what you have right now.

54
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What's liquid

55
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To

56
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.870
2900

57
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.960
Cynthia We: SO CONCERNED liquid. If we don't actually have it yet. It's, um, what is

58
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Predictable

59
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a variable me unemployment, is that what you're saying like has unemployment not been submitted on time.

60
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.940
Cynthia We: No, it's good it's right. It comes every week.

61
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So just the plus or minus some asteroid hitting the planet.

62
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.180
Cynthia We: Like 2900 okay

63
00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so that reasonably we can expect that. But though the thing without all of our A just based on what you told me before. There's a little delay.

64
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may not be counted on so. Okay, so what's today. Today is you've already paid

65
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.380
Cynthia We: We've already paid rent. We've already paid school

66
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.850
Cynthia We: We have already paid all the credit cards right

67
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.560
And

68
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.470
Cynthia We: I knew my phone before

69
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.480
Cynthia We: But

70
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.950
It coconut. Yeah, no worries.

71
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.480
So,

72
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.540
No.

73
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.270
Cynthia We: I don't know where my when you

74
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.340
Hear you

75
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.200
Cynthia We: Lola's on the phone with her friend.

76
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.300
Cynthia We: She has a friend from from New York who that opera her parents work for the opera.

77
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:04.770
Cynthia We: Um, he's a conductor in New York and a teacher at Columbia and he they come here during the summer. And then he just plays in the opera band.

78
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:15.720
Cynthia We: And her mom's an opera singer, but she's kind of hangs out. And so, Olivia and Lola become friends and they play they FaceTime each other and then they play together on the video game.

79
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

80
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so

81
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.700
Cynthia We: Yeah, this is the first year, they've done that they haven't really

82
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.310
Cynthia We: They haven't really played together like they've just seen each other during summer.

83
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.350
Cynthia We: We're gonna figure

84
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.530
Cynthia We: Well, we actually all these places are we going to figure in how much we can delete.

85
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Any combination right

86
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So why don't we just, um, so I I pulled up now. I don't know if you looked over the one I sent you. I had to do a I don't remember what it was anymore. I had to shuffle something so Atlanta did it exactly 12,000

87
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.070
Cynthia We: I know

88
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I did a little tiny shuffle somewhere like pets. I turned by $1 offer. I did some, some, something. It wasn't a huge change, but it wasn't intentional like I wasn't some some clandestine I was just wanted to send, send you something.

89
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.190
Cynthia We: So yeah, so Scott, the point of it being 12,000

90
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.570
Cynthia We: Is so that it accounts for every bit of money.

91
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's all that is

92
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:48.720
Cynthia We: Ignoring saving. Well, not a 12 I know that it is. I know the savings. Is the savings, it's included in this. That's why we're like,

93
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.980
Cynthia We: Okay, so

94
00:08:50.220 --> 00:09:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Many different things here. Yeah. So here's where I see it. I see it. I've reduced 401k by by 50 I plugged in 50 there. I put Ross at 100 um there's you're going to have your

95
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: College and then I don't know if you could see you, Scott. Your it to 2000. It was at 2200, I think, and that it just didn't work.

96
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can certainly add another time. Maybe we can go look at

97
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.940
Cynthia We: It. Well, we can do it.

98
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.380
Cynthia We: Too. I mean, we were going to go and reduce it and make even more savings.

99
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.550
Cynthia We: Because

100
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.590
Cynthia We: He does not work all year.

101
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.070
Cynthia We: It would be great if he worked all year and

102
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but that's that's what it takes, is you guys gradually realistically saying something else needs to go on there. Here we go.

103
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.250
Okay.

104
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.660
Cynthia We: No.

105
00:09:46.500 --> 00:10:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: manically already knew organically. You knew you know what's urgent, you just found it, you paid. We got and have shelter you found it right you guys you know what to do, you paid your you paid rent you pay tuition. Now let's look into.

106
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: When I see. Let's go through. Why don't we all I'm going to highlight in some sort of color here another urgent one. Let's go through is eating.

107
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.620
Cynthia We: The current budget, we're doing what we can do right now.

108
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I would say eating is pretty important. Don't think

109
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. So groceries.

110
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And reduce how much, how much do you have right now for next week. What do you have as far as liquid liquid like well

111
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.010
Cynthia We: Okay, well, so actually the all the 400 that you put there. That's actually not

112
00:10:54.030 --> 00:11:02.040
Cynthia We: That okay easily a meteor hitting the Earth, but okay. So we have yet. So at the very least we like this is so embarrassing. We got like

113
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.790
Cynthia We: Five or six

114
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.340
Cynthia We: Five or 600 of the bank.

115
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:16.380
Cynthia We: Coming next week 500 will have on Tuesday morning. Okay. And I've been promised to get a $400 check on Monday, from all but

116
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

117
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is five Monday, I think I heard for you find on Tuesday. No. Okay. And

118
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I don't hold any judgment. I promise you I'm with you. I'm feeling okay I am not judging you. I don't equate I don't have that worship thing I don't equate

119
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Value with someone in their money. I really, they take a crap. The same way I do I don't get hung up on that. So I'm here we go.

120
00:11:51.780 --> 00:12:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This is real time. Okay, this is, this is the either an opportunity where you guys really come together and you do this process and enjoy it. Or it's just this horrific nightmare. So let's see if we can find find some safety.

121
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.020
Should I

122
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.480
Cynthia We: Should I tell you what, we haven't paid yet this month that I have

123
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but let's start with the most critical. The ones where it's going to damage credit if you don't ones that you can't afford a fine. You see what I'm saying.

124
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Which ones we can push off a little bit, but let's at least brace for. So let me hear the ones that are popping up for you. Scott really need your attention.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:40.260
Cynthia We: We tried to leave. So, you know, to let you know before that you said it before, I don't know, but it's the dentist. It's a we may ask them last time. But I asked them the day it was coming out and they said you can't ask us today. You have to ask us in advance.

148
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

149
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of we're going to come right back to where the wiggle room is to 10

150
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Plus three

151
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Plus 214 and you'll have to correct me plus 116. Is that right,

152
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.140
Cynthia We: Mm hmm. To 14 yeah

153
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I put 210 33 to 14 116 I get 573

154
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.300
Cynthia We: Yeah.

155
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.540
Cynthia We: Okay, no, but then you have to add your other stuff your gas and your groceries.

156
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is

157
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All do. Let's see. Right now we have five. We've got enough right now basically

158
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost sort of like the 73 but on Monday. Now, always the variable with this 400 is there is there, like, you know, he has some cash flow and he hasn't been delayed over the last few weeks has even more on time, which is I

159
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

160
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.700
Cynthia We: He's been delayed every week.

161
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if, what is happening on Tuesday, is that the same

162
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.740
Cynthia We: That's unemployment.

163
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a, that's a more sure thing.

164
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a little more Sure thing. So what if we rely on that one, which is 18 that's February 18 or any of these do February 18 forward. I know that's getting into minutiae here.

165
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:18.000
Cynthia We: I'm just, yeah. A avant loan is due on the 16th.

166
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

167
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:23.460
Cynthia We: Goodness is doing the 18th chickens braces, if we do it is due on the 19th

168
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.230
Cynthia We: And venture. The 116 is doing the 19

169
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.730
Oh,

170
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I felt a little relief just now. Did you did you notice a tiny smidge of relief. All of a sudden, because it's on the 19th. Now when I know is that like direct deposit that 500 will be sitting in there and that if you ever watched it to see how it lands.

171
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.220
Cynthia We: Usually there.

172
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.680
Cynthia We: By early, mid morning

173
00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning. Okay. And how comfortable, would you be sending brace payment on that day, as well as that credit card payment.

174
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to. It sounds like they'll have to do the event one to 10 for sure. It sounds like 33 for sure, but if you could pull off making that braces payment on to 19 and the 116 payment. I didn't write down the name of it. I apologize. How would that feel

175
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.850
Cynthia We: Oh, but it feels great. I mean, we have enough to do that.

176
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.920
Cynthia We: Okay, so, yeah.

177
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So if, like, we still have a lot of talking to do. But let's just imagine that we do what we just did over these last five minutes. We continue to do it and that the execution plan is you leave me and you put those payments date them in

178
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: In your checking account. They're already set there are any data to go out on the 19th. How did, how does that feel, I gotta check in, because this is this is tender stuff here. Well,

179
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.810
Cynthia We: That feels great to me. But what do you mean put them in the checking account like

180
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what I mean by putting in me you log in the payment set to be sent out on the 19th

181
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.780
Cynthia We: I don't think I don't think he knows how to do that.

182
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What so sorry I'm sorry I do all my banking.

183
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I I do my banking online. I made that assumption that was an error on my part.

184
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:25.890
Cynthia We: Will not walk a fine line to. But, um, oh, you're saying with the bank account set up auto payments with the bank account.

185
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it isn't quite auto. This is what I do. So like, I'm like, Okay, this is pretty it's tight. It's tight management. Right, so I don't want it to be sent out on the 18th, because the funds are unlikely to be there.

186
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to have the date set into the future. Like I would right now if I knew which days if I knew there'd be money there I go in and I make my I would make avant I

187
00:18:48.660 --> 00:19:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Make that payment, right, because it's on the 16th, I would do Planet Fitness dated on the 18th and on for the braces, I would date it the payment will be occur. It'll leave my account on the 19th. It's already set up like

188
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.610
Cynthia We: Yeah, so they're already there. All those are already there automatically coming out.

189
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Great. Okay. And you're sure they're not set for a prior day

190
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.360
Exactly.

191
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. You already have this set up for success. That's great. Okay, um,

192
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.140
Cynthia We: I think we should put tickets braces off let's wait and see what we're

193
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing. Okay, I've got it circled. That's one of the ones I

194
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:32.400
Cynthia We: Oh, OK.

195
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: For like a variable. Let me just back up here. One more time, my paper so little messy. So right now I think we're working with $1,000 really to at least moving

196
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: With some degree of confidence, obviously, this all he pulls it together. That'd be awesome. But we have 1000 and now we are taking out

197
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about just take a week by week

198
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you do to have a nourishing enjoyable week of family eating, possibly, I guess at home. This week, what can we pull off.

199
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.020
Cynthia We: I think what you're good at 150 probably

200
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't one. Well, let's take, let's take how much it was like, if you take a meat right you take, let's say you were going to have a chicken or we're going to have

201
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that tends to be the price your piece of the meal. Is that what you do, like you kind of think, Okay, I'm going to have a hamburger. I'm going to have pork or I'm going to handle. If you guys are vegetarian.

202
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

203
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that's tends to be the price of your piece. Have you done some meal planning to kind of think, well, what am I going to do for these these five days. No. Okay. Maybe that's that's kind of maybe where to start. Yeah, yeah.

204
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.700
Cynthia We: I don't

205
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:04.830
Cynthia We: I don't eat me. So I kind of throw that together for them. Okay.

206
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.150
Like

207
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a sense of how much each meal costs drink during meal. Okay. All right. That might be sort of a learning point are you are you assuming the role of shopper. This week, sending

208
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.200
Cynthia We: Out well

209
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.190

210
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott, do you want to take on that role this week. Do you have the time and interest.

211
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.420
Cynthia We: Well, I don't have the time, but I'll do it.

212
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.650
Cynthia We: There's a big monkey wrench that just got thrown into our life here.

213
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let me hear

214
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:48.210
Cynthia We: Cindy's sister's son or nephew is coming to stay with us.

215
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that okay yeah and

216
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:59.280
Cynthia We: He's had a lot of issues, a lot of problems, um, with the law with drugs. Okay, I'm

217
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.860
Cynthia We: Bad people and whatever he wants to get away from everything and just

218
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.560
Cynthia We: Come here and click start fresh. And, you know,

219
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.850
Cynthia We: A like a Hollywood movie.

220
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.080
Cynthia We: Fixed by coming out here. Oh.

221
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You let me know how that works.

222
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:21.150
Out.

223
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:33.330
Cynthia We: We have to really clean and organized a lot of the house and we set up tear out Lola's room and set it up for him because we don't have a spare room and

224
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:41.580
Cynthia We: Okay, so we have a lot of stuff to do that. I'm stressed about and we also have to consider. We don't know exactly where he is.

225
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:56.250
Cynthia We: He's got medication issues and yes I we got to worry about, you know, leaving money and valuables out that kind of situation. We're not sure what we assume because we've been there were trying

226
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Might as well just assume that you take

227
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, until he earned your trust me, sorry. It's broken. Some promises with other family members. That's what this is, this is all about.

228
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're describing it as a monkey wrench and it couldn't get a monkey wrench in this session to where we don't get done what you want. So let's really take a look and make sure if at the end of this because we can go wherever you want. If you guys already know these pieces about

229
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay with being this person that shops, but if you don't want to keep doing it. Scott, what you may decide to do is really get a handle on how much the meat portion costs and teach her

230
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How much it really costs.

231
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I mean, it's just real world stuff like if there's we you guys are kind of different

232
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's like I'm here. I've already made my decision. I'm here, I'm shopping, Cindy. That's kind of like you're like, I'm already here. I'm shopping. This is what I'm getting there's not right. This

233
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Oh, you know what, I'm only getting at this many ounces. It'll be a smaller portion. Now, you make embarrassment or whatever may come up, but we're going to have to work through that because the reality is

234
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's a set amount of money and you guys are still going to eat and everything's going to be okay.

235
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's not add to it. Any kind of shame or embarrassment to it'll just really get in the way. So I say let's just dive into it and it'll be a new adventure. You guys get to find out talking about how good of

236
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you enjoy teaching Cindy about what you the skills you have because you're a shopper. And you'll find a really good bargain, you've got that neat thing going on. Not everybody has that

237
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you may really be able in a tangible way be able to say

238
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: organic meat over here is this much. Did you know that. And this is how much we can get a little last us for two meals. Maybe we'll do some chicken and pasta.

239
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what and black and chicken BBQ BBQ with with corn on this day.

240
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And we've got two meals and oh my gosh. Now we even have a little leftovers. And you're also may think you're going to have someone coming in a little later on. So that's another mouth.

241
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Baba, so just now as I'm talking about this, is it okay that you take the information you have. And you kind of show her

242
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How much it's going to cost for this week and Cindy, are you offended by it.

243
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.840
Cynthia We: No, I'm not offended.

244
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:38.460
Have you been offended by it in the past when I try to break down the the food.

245
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.530
Cynthia We: I mean, I have an idea of what meals cost and I have an idea of what my goals are for

246
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:57.300
Cynthia We: For per meal you know a person kind of thing. Okay, depending on the meals. Yeah, falls anywhere from super cheap to to like to, like, you know, $7 for a whole meal, all the way up to, you know, $18 for a whole meal.

247
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.700
Cynthia We: Person no ha

248
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.340
Cynthia We: Per person. Oh no, not necessarily.

249
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know. I'd love to know dollar meal for

250
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:16.170
Cynthia We: Well, like you're having my daddy. If you your spaghetti. If you had to buy it off so you get you got your rigatoni for a buck.

251
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:38.910
Cynthia We: Or you're totally need to do that for two bucks you got a pound of ground beef for 499 if we even do ground beef or a bag of meatballs for about the same. Okay, and you have pasta sauce from basically $1 $52 99 or jar. It's $1 19 traded. Well, that's no timeline United

252
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.540
Cynthia We: I look at Trader Joe's. It was a

253
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:54.000
Cynthia We: joke was priceless. I went to Albuquerque Trader Joe's this week to see if it was cheaper every night was is 40 to 80 cents cheaper than I seriously I should take a

254
00:26:54.030 --> 00:27:02.370
Cynthia We: Picture. Okay, so anyway that's, you know, a couple, a couple of murder sauces. So yeah right there and then maybe a baguette right

255
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.640

Cynthia We: Ok so hamburgers.

353
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:41.490

354
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.140
Cynthia We: 12 bucks at the most.

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I met I met 46 bucks here at this point.

357
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And it

358
00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:04.680
Cynthia We: Looks Mexican yeah okay and then she's already. Yes. So we have cheese new tortillas kanji

359
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.540
Beef for

360
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.140
Cynthia We: Your picnic. We've got enough

361
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.020
Okay.

362
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.220
Cynthia We: The tomatoes already purchased as part of the hamburgers.

363
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.520
Cynthia We: The onions already purchased as part of the chili.

364
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And you haven't used them all your

365
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:34.980
Cynthia We: Well I, I actually have one and a half left. Okay. And so, so, so it's just the cost of the 20th, but for sour cream, we have, I have a package in there.

366
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Any salsa going there.

367
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:37.860
You go

368
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:52.320
Cynthia We: Okay. Um, and then if you want to buy if you want to do, beans and rice homicide someone does not always like to have the seven cream that is used from the previous one. So we could get another package because

369
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys have this little passive aggressive behavior in here.

370
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Like someone I wonder is it whenever

371
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:15.360
Cynthia We: I believe that we can all use a certain amount of sour cream and that it's okay if it's been opened, but I believe that you were upset about this frequently. No, I think when I opened it up. Okay, so I'll get sometimes right

372
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And sour cream. So far, we already have the cheapest can be kind of an expensive one. So it's nice. You already happened.

373
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.590
Cynthia We: You sure you have enough

374
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:30.480
Cynthia We: Enough of what cheese you like your lunches your lunches. No, no, we've got enough poorly.

375
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.350
Okay.

376
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So it does look like. Although you haven't given me a number for the tortilla. It does kind of look like when you guys are budgeting. I don't know if you noticed that a number kind of kept surfacing

377
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, notice that

378
00:37:46.260 --> 00:38:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, right, I mean, I'm not. It's not absolute. But when you're just sort of saying we've got to have this rough estimate of stuff maybe just saying $13 gets it done and and then it

379
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.120
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

380
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.220
Cynthia We: That makes sense, right, are you

381
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.030
Cynthia We: I said meal for for for that.

382
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.190

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.230
Cynthia We: Was better $7 well

384
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, well, if you, you know, come on it a red sauce. If you're not going to put you say you already have the meatballs. It can be pretty pretty cheap you boil the water you put the pasta in it. People are fed, you've got the again. You said it can be quite cheap. Yeah.

385
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.830
Cynthia We: hamburger meat and bones. You know, it's like okay

386
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but I will tell you there is this backstory of veggie, veggie meat happening. So there is this undercurrent back here, as if like that doesn't cost money. Is there a little magic meet ferry to trust system.

387
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.010
Cynthia We: No, no, no.

388
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.730

Cynthia We: It's like a pound of ground beef for three days.

393
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to include that that's part of your part of this fan.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:40:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's let's do, let's do some assessment of what we just did. Scott did this feel different having broken it down like this, what we just did all together, or was this basically how it goes in real life. No, this is not how

406
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.240
Cynthia We: I mean, this is how I think it kind of goes in my head.

407
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but

408
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.920

410
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.760
Cynthia We: Yeah, totally. Okay.

411
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: In a positive way like

412
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: They got past the silliness of it.

413
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, well, then great then then. Let's, um, now is it is it. So now, maybe a comfortable that you could do lunch and breakfast on your own or too risky and let's do it together.

414
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I do too risky alone. Oh. Oh.

415
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:50.040
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think there's some unrealistic things that come out from Scott and I think that I get really frustrated with that.

416
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's get into it. Let's see what happens at lunch. Let's go for it.

417
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

418
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.070
Cynthia We: Again, I'm

419
00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.250
Cynthia We: Not he does not like TURKEY SANDWICHES anymore.

420
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay taste buds are changing those darn those children. He told

421
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:12.600
Cynthia We: He yelled at me for giving them turkey sandwich. I told you I don't like them. You don't make them with love, you know,

422
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta know what that means. What does that mean,

423
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't

424
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:31.170
Cynthia We: Oh, I am making it in five minutes in the morning. So I put it together quickly.

425
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:38.850
Cynthia We: Okay, yes, because I am making the lunches and I'm making the breakfast. So, and then I'm driving when I'm home for lunch. I will make them.

426
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:53.340
Cynthia We: A turkey sandwich and I will post the bread, and I will put the mail and I put salt and pepper on and I will put Swiss cheese and the turkey in a place called tomatoes. They didn't enjoy that. It's different. Different than throwing something together for their lunch.

427
00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so some some interesting. So we have Turkey, we have mail Swiss tomato Swiss tomato and mail will certainly need to be around the Turkey will need to be around it are those. I know you mentioned tomatoes coming in for hamburger and for Mexican zero

428
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: For turkey sandwich.

429
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.420
Cynthia We: Yep, there's enough for packages to me.

430
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then, may I was still around. And there's Swiss

431
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.880
Cynthia We: Swiss Swiss okay

432
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Give me, give me some number.

433
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:33.540
Cynthia We: 399 for the Swiss maybe turkeys. What's your name, is it. Yeah.

434
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.500
Cynthia We: Some box. Okay, read

435
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And that'll last how long oh yeah I bounce bread.

436
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:42.600
Cynthia We: $5

437
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:54.720
Cynthia We: Well, if you go to the other store. Yeah. Um, yeah, there's this thing also like she'll go to Trader Joe's okay and and not okay. This

438
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.110
This is

439
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting into whole grain versus the cheaper bread so

440
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Less about that. What was happening.

441
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:18.030
Cynthia We: Well, no, I think Cindy's conflicted about, um, the whole grain thing nowadays we used to go whole grain and try to, you know, eat that way. But then she read a couple studies where it really doesn't freakin matter as much as she thought, um, however, I just, I cannot just by white bread and

442
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:34.560
Cynthia We: No, no. So so bad. So what do you buy right all the time at Trader Joe's. It's sourdough sorry. That's okay. So anyways, social buy something at Trader Joe's in the piano Trader Joe's. You know, the bread has like a laptop shelf date of two days.

443
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:41.370
Cynthia We: Yeah, put it in the fridge and it's usually yeah and not well it's still has you might extend it.

444
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about the elephants in the room.

445
00:43:45.150 --> 00:44:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to feel like a good mom by making sure that you're putting wholesome food in the house. And notice how you registered it to Scott with make food in a loving way both of you have that in in in you. Okay. It just shows up in different ways. You both have it have it so so

446
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's find that compassion for each other, you will do have a shared value, you do see

447
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're wanting to provide for your children. And in a way, now how we accomplish this, this piece in here.

448
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever seen an in between that can work for both of you that sandwich can be made with love and there can be some some nourishment in it. Cindy is there. Have you seen something that could work is white bread.

449
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Bread and that the kid will eat because then, good grief and we're working with.

450
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.320
Cynthia We: A day or two a week because you can't overload them with TURKEY SANDWICHES, so you have other ideas for lunches. Right.

451
00:44:50.430 --> 00:45:04.920
Cynthia We: Now, so the what we end up doing with the bread usually unfortunately involves a different trip, which I don't mind doing is Dave's white bread, it's organic, go whole grain.

452
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.010
Cynthia We: For white bread done right.

453
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

454
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.800
Cynthia We: Another store if it is 599 low saying

455
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.820
Cynthia We: But it lasts. And so you get

456
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so it

457
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: costs more than a couple of days at least.

458
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.800
Cynthia We: Really, yeah.

459
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That does that feel like like a good investment Scott for you that 599 bread that it's both going to be made with love last longer. Cindy gets to also feel like she's nourishing the kids too.

460
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:49.560
Cynthia We: Yeah, I mean, I'm I've, I've agreed. I've got. She's taught me and drawing me into all this organic and healthier stuff to buy in the most important things to buy that organic as opposed to, once we can get away with. So I'm

461
00:45:50.010 --> 00:46:06.240
Cynthia We: I'm sold on a lot of it. Sometimes I'm like, when we're this broke, though. I'm like, oh, you know, we might have to just get you know country white bread for tonight but but you can get the Trader Joe's stuff that is will grade for tonight, but the kids hate it. Okay.

462
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That's important.

463
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Cardboard. Yeah. So Cindy, you gotta, you gotta take that in. If this is if this whole thing this piece about food and it's not an uncommon one

464
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If we say this is just this month. Remember how we're kind of working out, this, this, this is a little different. Sometimes we're really, really good at and other times are focused on somewhere else. What if it's just a

465
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit tight right now. Um, is there something that you could sort of say to yourself.

466
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a fun week it's going to be more fun food as if we're on a vacation and maybe we're eating Doritos here and there. Are you just doing I'm saying, like,

467
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we go back to a lifestyle and you'll get back to lifestyle but right now it's a pinch, is that completely just overwhelming that idea.

468
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.240
Cynthia We: For me that's what comes natural.

469
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but for you, Cindy. Is this seem like if I do it once, it will be this way.

470
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.520
Cynthia We: Once, then they'll

471
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.480
Cynthia We: It'll never end because that's what they'll want all the time.

472
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so they do yeah that white bread stuff they all kind of want that that's true. But here's the piece anywhere you show up as parent

473
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Food isn't always fun food right it's supposed to be nutrition and it's supposed to be fueling the body and and being good fuel. The difficult part comes in your ability to manage the fact that there's going to be confrontation. That's where this

474
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.170
Cynthia We: Food. No, I can't manage it. So,

475
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's where you come into this this story I'm

476
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:52.650
Cynthia We: With you. I just think that they'll stop eating their lunches and then I'll be where I was before. I can't, if I if I go to the fun bread and I

477
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:57.030
Cynthia We: Got from the fun but don't stop eating and just and then I'll be like, all

478
00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:07.080
Cynthia We: But we're I think we're it's getting a little bit. I think we're talking about a different brand of bread, and I think sliding from one brand of read the other is so much more subtle than

479
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:15.090
Cynthia We: Buying Doritos and snickers and having that kind of fun week. A week. Oh no, I don't. I don't think we make those things a habit.

480
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, let's go to the bread wealthy kids eat Dave's white bread. Yes.

481
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:26.610
Cynthia We: Oh, totally. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you meant we should take, we should go to the dollar, bro.

482
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:27.840
Cynthia We: Well, I was

483
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.850
Cynthia We: I was telling them so

484
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I was throwing it out there, but maybe that that just may not be a possibility. So I don't know, let's just see what happens. We've got 599 and that'll last all week if they decide they want to

485
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Use some of it for a French toast in the morning or something like there's a way to use it elsewhere. Right.

486
00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:48.750
Cynthia We: Yep. Okay.

487
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you are you okay with that does, it's

488
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.060
Cynthia We: Yeah.

489
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's doable, Scott. Yep. Okay.

490
00:48:54.990 --> 00:49:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And the other piece that we just dipped into right that's ongoing discussion that's working on navigating confrontation in a family and what are our family system norms and

491
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And who takes this on those are much, those are bigger. And we could be spending our time doing that, but that's not what we're doing right now.

492
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, persevering. What else we got, we've got a $7 I first I had $7 for Swiss and for Turkey. Now, I also have at least when you go shopping 599 right. Am I, am I on

493
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:34.920
Um,

494
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.840
What else do you give them for lunch. I give Teague and allow the leftovers.

495
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:47.880
Cynthia We: Doesn't like sandwiches. So what else like I always make an extra burrito when I

496
00:49:49.260 --> 00:50:03.090
Cynthia We: Okay, or the day we are spaghetti. I'll be able to give them in right at the next day the chilly day I can give back. So it's really low, low, is there anything else you need to buy through main course one maybe um

497
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.160
Cynthia We: No, no, a seaweed.

498
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.460
Cynthia We: Seaweed okay bars.

499
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:12.780
So, yeah.

500
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Snacks. But let's just cover.

501
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.740
Cynthia We: I was just thinking lunches for lunches.

502
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:28.290
Cynthia We: A piece of fruit in a lunch organs. So you got to buy some oranges are gone, Judy, Judy. Yes. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got fruit. We've got ours and CDs. Yes, get a sense of the price of that, guys.

504
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:53.160
Cynthia We: Two packages, the bars will be $1 90 $94 and us kind of straddling snacks and lunch. So I'm just thinking about lunch. So yeah, so don't use the phone to the snap carriers will she sticks up those money. Yeah.

505
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.990
Cynthia We: And then those service sex. Just stop the violence was going on.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.860
Cynthia We: cuties is like a big bag of time.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.510
Cynthia We: What a big bag is 599

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.750
Cynthia We: So you have to get a box vanilla wafers or something like that.

513
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.180
Cynthia We: For us.

514
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So you guys have written down. Wait, let me just see. You've written down, you know, ironically, the healthy stuff. It's more expensive right so fruit you've written down a number that will get you through the week.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard 50 plus 27

548
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.390
Last night.

549
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What was, what was that

550
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:58.920
Cynthia We: Well, I guess you covered all the vegetables and I was no eggs and vegetable salad or bag of spinach in general, that's all.

551
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right now, right.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch right at six. Now, how comfortable are you saying 100 a week gets you guys said

554
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we're at 100. That's a nice round number

555
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:20.280
Cynthia We: You're the one grocery shopping, so I don't have to stick to anything.

556
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And stuff on them at the grocery store.

557
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We got

558
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:32.970
Them will need the miscellaneous stuff like spinach and milk and

559
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.800
Cynthia We: That's why. Yeah. Oh, and almond milk. But that's why

560
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.540
Cynthia We: You added

561
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.770
Cynthia We: An extra $14 that's fine like to do it $100

562
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we found it and you're both

563
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What tell me

564
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:55.260
Cynthia We: Um, I haven't accounted for food for myself, except for dinner.

565
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Cookie. That's right. And we covered a tiny bit somewhere with a

566
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.720
Cynthia We: With just I'm included in the dinners, but I don't

567
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:05.280
Cynthia We: Well,

568
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a 399 peace with this meat. I don't think it got wrapped in

569
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:15.000
Cynthia We: So you just want to add tofurky or something.

570
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:29.580
Cynthia We: Yeah, and cottage cheese. I would just add like 20,000 your staples that you get your cottage cheese your smoothie meet you give me regularly like tofurky

571
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:37.980
Cynthia We: Sometimes what do you tell them the damn I'm a cottage cheese do in a day or yogurt.

572
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:42.270
Cynthia We: Um, no excuse or

573
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:43.980
Cynthia We: Something just

574
00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for this week. Just be thinking right now. What you're doing is Scott needs a list of what you need in a dance for this week. It's going to stay within $100

575
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

576
00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.030
Cynthia We: I don't have to eat it. Okay.

577
00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not it what it is, is you know it's some

578
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Not as many cookies or it's pulling back on, you know, this is where you can you navigate you say, do I pull back on this kind of bread. You already did it with the egg CC to sort of play with that a little bit, maybe there are places where there's no wiggle room.

579
00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But go do it and see if you can pull this off and I'm hundred dollars and Scott if it goes up to 110 i don't know that that has to be a catastrophic thing. Yeah, see, so there's the yogurt. There's that cottage cheese that just came in, there's plenty of room in there. I think for

580
00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Almond milk cottage cheese, yogurt, and to get the kind of bread.

581
00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's a buy in from the whole family because I know it's complicated to make everybody happy with bread. Nobody kind of wants that whole grains.

582
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's like hungry to torture me I'm

583
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so, okay, how we doing

584
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:13.680
Cynthia We: Good.

585
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We need an actual list, though.

586
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to be right, you're gonna write down what you're going to buy, and I think we have, let's see, I just gotta run. I want to run down. Just see

587
00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: World. Yeah.

588
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:29.850
Plus, and you

589
00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:31.770
Know,

590
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:34.320
Well,

591
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's included, you're going to have yogurt, you're going to have cottage cheese are going to have cookies, you're going to have that bread is in there.

592
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.230
Cynthia We: You know, and if I go to 110 ish. It's okay. Right.

593
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:54.750
Okay, I just want to see what we actually wrote this one plus one looks

594
00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.370
Like us to go to coffee and that's it.

595
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:06.030
Yeah. Is there anything else going on this week that used to cost money.

596
00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:13.170
Cynthia We: Chickens dance tonight.

597
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So the way I'm seeing so

598
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: If it starts at 500 you take out 100 for food. You're at 400, you have to pay

599
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A Fanta.

600
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:37.620
Right.

601
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:43.620
Cynthia We: Yeah, I have 574 for all those bills and $100 for food.

602
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:46.860
Cynthia We: That's 674

603
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.500
Literally

604
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:59.250
Cynthia We: Start out with all the bills. Now, I mean number, how much my 900 guaranteed by Tuesday. If Ali comes through will have 14

605
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:10.620
Cynthia We: I'm sorry 1000 guaranteed by Tuesday. If all he comes through. I have 14 so we're trying to do as 1000 okay yeah and

606
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the Absolutes are at least for the week. Right. We've got 100

607
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To two to 10

608
01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: For sure.

609
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got 33 and I was hearing. Um, that's about gas and coffee.

610
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:35.700
Cynthia We: Gas coffee and Cynthia's cigarettes that she's about to quit.

611
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So what number is that, can you put that together.

612
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:46.350
Cynthia We: You can give you a $20 card or juice you need more Starbucks. You already have it in the car.

613
01:00:49.170 --> 01:01:02.430
Cynthia We: I have it I can, I can. Should we put a $20 thing a week for Starbucks. A week or this week, or this week. I think we're okay. This week because we have coffee at home.

614
01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how would that be if you made just for this week coffee at home until this this money comes in. Maybe from

615
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.220
Cynthia We: Or I'll use my stars.

616
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, for a mom.

617
01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Ali.

618
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:16.170
Cynthia We: Yeah.

619
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, guys, let's have a number hundred dollar food Yvonne take to 10 Jim. We got to pay that $33 thing. And what are we at for gas.

620
01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.840
Cynthia We: Gas 50 bucks. Okay.

621
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there another urgent thing before this other money comes in.

622
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The cigarettes. How much of this cigarettes. Again, or is that included

623
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.470
Cynthia We: What 10 bucks. Let's say for the week or the week you already have a pack.

624
01:01:55.830 --> 01:02:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, let me just look on here really quick as fuel groceries, so not you said cells not doing electrics not doing Waterside two cables. Not do Internet's not do car maintenance. I am thinking about that.

625
01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:10.470
Cynthia We: Grateful, we do have

626
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.330
Cynthia We: If it matters in this conversation, we can still push it off a little but we do have an overdue phone bill.

627
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.100
Cynthia We: Well, we have an overdue phone bill.

628
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How much is it

629
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:25.320
Like

630
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.710
Cynthia We: It was able to go

631
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:30.600
Cynthia We: Hang on.

632
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:37.500
Cynthia We: What we did not pay when we were supposed to pay it two weeks ago is rising to 59

633
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:46.920
Cynthia We: But you can schedule that I can schedule it. We don't have to do it this week, but at the only going to be something we have to do another week.

634
01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:58.470
Cynthia We: So let's braces off from what. Wait a minute. What we don't have to do this. We don't know if we don't have to. I don't think we should put things off, because then they're more straightforward.

635
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now what you guys are talking about there seems to be $697 to

636
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay for what you're talking about. Right now I see $1,000 sitting here hundred dollar food two to 10 of on $33 Jim $50 gas $10 cigarettes.

637
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Way. Remember, it's going to get better.

638
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this more. So it does this is just short term just really feeling, you know how important it is for us. Nowadays, to have our phones, we want to take that

639
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got, what do you see the 697 there to Scotty.

640
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.630
Cynthia We: I got 1134

641
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.800
Cynthia We: Okay, well,

642
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:48.630
Cynthia We: For really quick. For most of the bills. I have to 1033 to 14 and 116 credit card forgot the food.

643
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.740
Cynthia We: I have 100 food.

644
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.610
Cynthia We: 50 gas my 10 six

645
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I was starting with 1000 were you

646
01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.910
Cynthia We: Yeah, you mean subtracting from 1000 Uh huh. Yeah, sure.

647
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here I got minus 100 for food minus, you said it's not to 10 it's actually two, he said, or

648
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:23.850
Cynthia We: Not there's a to 10 to 14 so sorry. Okay. Okay, that's what that's what was going on there. It was over and you have the 116

649
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.770
Cynthia We: Credit card.

650
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.860
I did not. Okay. Okay. I paid to sit in my seat.

651
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.440
Minus

652
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:37.740
Three.

653
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:40.980
Three.

654
01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.450
Cynthia We: You're doing it one way and another way, but it's it's

655
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.670
The same thing

656
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To 67. What are you getting

657
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.260
Cynthia We: To 66 yeah we're good.

658
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, pretty good.

659
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So the difference is you're

660
01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to be having Starbucks, you're going to be making coffee at home. So that means sugars going to get us. That means creamer or however you take it. There's going to be coffee filters, it still takes money to do things. And now it comes into play.

661
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, does this Verizon or horizon. I'm not sure what you got to still get paid or. Can it wait till you feel more comfortable.

662
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I want 19th or 20th. I don't know.

663
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:58.440
Cynthia We: I guess so. Um, well, as long as nothing else would come up towards the end of week and we still had this $260 left. Okay. There's no reason not to pay it. Right. Well,

664
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I tripped and mechanics. That sounds like

665
01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:04.680
Cynthia We: Yes, so it's one or the other, probably, if we have to

666
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.850
Cynthia We: Hopefully that's not over, you know, few bucks.

667
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:19.050
Cynthia We: So we'll go to the mechanics early in the week and see what's up with that maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a fuel adjustment. I mean, a liquid adjustment.

668
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be brake fluid that's true.

669
01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.030
Cynthia We: You something easy, who knows.

670
01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You got somebody that you kind of trust that you know will take down

671
01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.590
Cynthia We: On your go to guy, Bob.

672
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I got to get real world here.

673
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're holding the money.

674
01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're Scott you're holding the this hundred dollars to go shopping. Whatever it is, whatever you come up with, I would really invite you to show it to Cindy, so she can see it. I don't know. Let's see what happens with that.

675
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And

676
01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How much do you want to include the kids in in this because it can all go can put if one kid says well you know I took the whole box and took it to school and gave it to my friends. I mean, I have no idea how things go.

677
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.650
Cynthia We: Yeah, um, I mean,

678
01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:38.370
Cynthia We: I think, first we we like to not say much of anything and not let them worry or stress about these kind of things, but I also, I mean, obviously, some of it leaks out and it is worst thing in the world for kids to know, hey, this is live in tight and this is not i'm not terrible.

679
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A this is a family value system thing.

680
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: If

681
01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: They're responsible for making a decision about it. No, that's not so healthy if they're the ones that are kind of like, oh, I'm participating in a family project here that can

682
01:07:54.870 --> 01:08:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Be kind of fun, they can learn some accountability. Let's, let's, we're going to be following a budget today. Let's see how we do. This is how much

683
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got if you're going to be grabbing it and we're going to need to know about it. You know what, let's really stick. I'm not going to be going to Starbucks this week and

684
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I hate it but it feels good to be sacrificing for your family this this month has been a been a little tight.

685
01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: inherently bad. No, it's but I'm not there to see how you deliver the information, the kids response. I'm not there to manage how they're taking it in, whether you're

686
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: decompressing from it and in shame. Right. It's, it's, there's no way to say it. Um, but, in and of itself things cost money for them to appreciate that. It's not just magically growing on a tree. Yeah, I think it's nice to kind of have some personal accountability.

687
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:58.140
Cynthia We: Idea. I've been told, Well, and know to modern grocery all week. Modern gross wise and you know the she wants a spinach, kale and lemon smoothie. This is what you create this is what you create

688
01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:05.790
Cynthia We: That's our treat. I think that's an awesome treat. In fact, we go get smoothies that are made of kale is just great.

689
01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

690
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.170
Cynthia We: I have to say no is already hard

691
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome. But notice that it didn't get included in here. It's not fair. I remember I was telling you this, this thing going on in the back, it will kale, we can buy kale, we can say, well, what we're going to have this one smoothie will will enjoy making it together and we make it

692
01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:27.660
Cynthia We: We didn't put any other fruits

693
01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't say it. You keep this undercurrent back here. Cindy of all it's already there. No, it doesn't just

694
01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Magically there.

695
01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what I'm trying to we've got to buy it and write it. This is where the meat of the challenge comes in. I don't want to deprive my daughter of this special treat. I'm giving her something healthy

696
01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you know you're giving stability to your children right now because you're giving, believe me. Right. It's not just about this.

697
01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Depriving her of a sweet treat you are in a financial challenge right now. This is real. You love her, just the same. Your Love comes from more than just ability to say yes to this this nutritious thing it's

698
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Your creating stability and safety for her to you're a good mom show up in a lot of other ways, but I don't know what you're saying to yourself about that.

699
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.360
Sometimes it's no

700
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:33.420
Cynthia We: You know,

701
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And we've got to sit with the discomfort of

702
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have it to give right now. And what do I do with the meaning of that. Do I go to shame. Do I go to. How can this be happening. I gotta

703
01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: NOT FEEL THIS AND BY in this movie anyway because I don't want to feel it, or do you to look to each other and you you you off load some of the distress and say,

704
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you try this movie. I hate it but I don't know that you guys are talking to each other to say that was hard.

705
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so used to being able to spoil even, you know, I like it. I like spoiling i mean

706
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I show her and love her, you know, this is this is a different kind of parenting it's asking you to really take a look at what you've been doing

707
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Where it is love. Get display and communicate in other ways. It's still love you guys are not buying a condo, you know, you're not doing some lack of do thing with this, you're not going to this is, this is what love looks like right now.

708
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't know who you really have buy in on that, Cindy. It's just, it's awful for you.

709
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it and get dying inside right now.

710
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.640
Cynthia We: No, no, but it is the term said no.

711
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't say no, all the time.

712
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.030
Cynthia We: I do this, I do say no.

713
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: All the time didn't

714
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:18.390
Cynthia We: But you did what I did when you were working. No, I didn't say no. Ever. You didn't last week, you got smoothies, I did not. What are you talking about the juice.

715
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:30.600
Cynthia We: Oh, OK. We went to Cuba juice, but we have not gone to modern question she wants a lot of fucking smoothly. I don't care if you ever, like, Hey, let's have one day where we get a smoothie. That's what I was thinking was

716
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:38.760
Cynthia We: That just Lola has been trained know say, oh, it's Wednesday. It's my smoothie day. Oh breakdancing it's my sweet, we always start first movie after breakdancing

717
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:45.360
Cynthia We: He's trained to do. Oh, this is a natural grocers all the time. Yeah.

718
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what

719
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.890
Cynthia We: I'm glad she she wants healthy stuff. And that's a good habit.

720
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your wife. She said, it's hard. Let that and she's owning it is hard to say no and just understand that I am saying

721
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.360
Cynthia We: She got me after break dancing when I took her last week. She got me to go to Cuba juicy.

722
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.890
To go

723
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys it is. It's hard to say oh two markets. We love them. We always want them to have everything we didn't have. We want to always have that

724
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to have to hold on to yours truth to right now.

725
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you're the adult, you're not friend, you're, you're not trying to shape behavior, not trying to do something with the kid, what you're doing is you're trying to hold on to yourselves here and say,

726
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't do it this week. It's not a reflection of you. We've been doing it recently, um, let's take a look at that in a couple weeks we'll see if we can get back in the groove. But I'll tell you what we can do. We can go home and we can have

727
01:13:43.380 --> 01:14:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Eggs or French toast for dinner, we could do something wild and fun. It'll be breakfast for dinner on Friday we'll do something kind of kooky like that, you know, but it's the it's not okay for each of you to say no because it's mine. It's like, well, what am I am I broke

728
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.370
Cynthia We: I told Lola that she'd have to ask, Daddy about that. Yeah, that's

729
01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Chicken.

730
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.760
Cynthia We: He always says no.

731
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Chicken.

732
01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Sandy. He chickened out.

733
01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:27.540
Cynthia We: Oh, but I said no all over. I said no. Alisha she knows I'm saying no, she's playing too though because

734
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you guys

735
01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How to talk to her.

736
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.260
Cynthia We: No.

737
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:44.790
Cynthia We: I mean, I don't know, probably, but she's playing that game too because Daddy doesn't always say, No, daddy just went the key with us. She taught me to go to boba tea for Christ's sake.

738
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:56.640
Cynthia We: When we were all saying so not even help and me and hurt you are little things we stop and get our slushies once in a blue moon because it's I don't, I'm not around all the time. And when I'm running around town. It's nice to

739
01:14:57.090 --> 01:15:03.360
Cynthia We: To temper their mood with all the errands with the freaking hey we're gonna get a blueberry slush. You know,

740
01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: He does the same thing.

741
01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:09.060
Cynthia We: Well, I do it too. I like to do it and and

742
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:16.410
Cynthia We: You know, cheaply economically and in certain places, but I do say no when she asked every time. Yeah.

743
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How about in advance. This is a new way of going about things you go out in advance. You say listen you Rugrats.

744
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how it's going to go. I know you're used to asking for treats out there and you're probably going to ask for it again. But I'm going to be saying no, we're not going to have any of that. Just this week.

745
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can maybe do it in a couple weeks or something. But for now, you're going to hear know a kid is going to test and push. It's not their job.

746
01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To take care of you, emotionally, you know, no one likes to hear that.

747
01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: They're just going to ask. That's what kids do. We're greedy little creatures. They're good little kids, but that's just what we do. We just asking.

748
01:15:56.910 --> 01:16:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We've been reinforced because we've been hearing our. Yes. And we're going to split when we don't get it from one parent. We're going to go over to the next one. We're good kids, but that's just what we do.

749
01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job is to hold on to your truth us chest you guys love them so much. It doesn't go away.

750
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Plan. Now something else that you can redirect the conversation to if it's not a quick slushy as you were saying just sort of quell the intensity of whatever's going on. We need to have a plan of what else to do besides

751
01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting a sweet treat

752
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to plan. What else can you do. All right. Well, you know what, I don't know what you're saying is let's go hit tennis balls like it's kind of

753
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't do that something in the house, whatever it is. Some enjoyment together. But that has to be okay well you guys hang out together. They're used to doing this the eating thing as a way of connecting with you. But there's other ways to enjoy each other.

754
01:16:56.430 --> 01:17:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It, but ultimately it's you being okay with the know is if you're depriving them somehow. It's depriving you but that's the adult battle is

755
01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This is real. I'm not going to put my little on my home and jeopardy right or my relationship so much tension happens. We've got to be able to just say that's not happening. I love you to death, kid. But any happening today.

756
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not today. It's a grown up thing. You got nothing to worry about. But TODAY. No. Can't do it. Can't do it but listening about what do we have at home.

757
01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm saying, okay, but let me hear this. This was getting more into the emotional stuff around the know

758
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we, what are we, what are we talking about here. Cindy, let's start with you.

759
01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this possible for you to do this.

760
01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.660
Cynthia We: Yes, yes it is.

761
01:17:52.410 --> 01:18:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And and it's, it may be sometimes you have been saying no, and other times, there have been yeses over the last month or so right now. Always okay and Scott for you. There have been some guesses where you've caved to the pressure of a little cutie and

762
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:12.780
Cynthia We: Yeah, so I'm cool doing a know and come up with something else or the

763
01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:24.810
Cynthia We: Way I did. I guess my rationale is I don't. I'm the one that says no, most of the time. So whenever I do say yes, it's totally justified. That's the way I think. And it's not right either.

764
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.590
Cynthia We: But that's probably why I'm okay. I'm stopping it, you know, Baskin Robbins.

765
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I want two weeks. That was really generous of you to say that. Do you see that send me that he just took he just gave something important to you, which was

766
01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: gave away some of that that righteousness and all of that, like, because I'm always, you know, he gave it away and just share that didn't have to do that was really generous Scott, just to say that out loud.

767
01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but do you guys see how hard it is for us, parents and adults to say no, it's like it would just be nice if the kids, which is not ask

768
01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:01.470
Cynthia We: Yeah.

769
01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to ask. It's up to us to hold our little backbone.

770
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And be like, I don't want to say no to you because I want to spoil with every little thing on this planet, but you can say those things you can say, I want to give you everything I've got and more

771
01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't can't give that to you today though love. Yeah, let's go for a little drive in the mountain. Let's go a little bike ride. Come on, let's go.

772
01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got to be okay with that. No, it's not, meaning you know you loves a less still an amazing provider, you see, you're going to have to sit with that discomfort.

773
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.950
Okay.

774
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, do we have a list or you're going to, you're going to have a

775
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: List just

776
01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:51.930
Cynthia We: A couple things to it for this movie things

777
01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:56.460
Cynthia We: Going to add smoothie stuff to the list. So the girl show

778
01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.490
Cynthia We: Me stuff so we can make them at home. Yes.

779
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, a kale, a banana or whatever it is that goes in it. But let's be specific, because he's going to go out and need to get it and manage that budget. He's burdened with it so

780
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a conversation, maybe with the kids to like it's this is going to look a little different.

781
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It might all let go of some of the pressure for you because you've already set set the precedent for what

782
01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's still going to be conversations coming up. Then there's the next week or there's the second half of the week, or there's a oh my gosh this break right this mechanic may come back with a piece of information.

783
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If you guys don't come away with new skills, then you're not able to sort of navigate these things.

784
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: In a new way in the future. So why don't we reinforce what each of you did a little differently that you may be committed to to do the next time you you navigate another discussion.

785
01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, what did you notice you did that was really generous of spirit. What did you do, you either took some ownership and you did something different.

786
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:07.950
Cynthia We: I wouldn't along with figuring out how much each thing comes

787
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so turn turn towards him and tell him how it felt to sit, having to talk about the price of each little item.

788
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:25.110
Cynthia We: It was excruciating for me talk about the price of each item and just

789
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:29.040
Cynthia We: Just go with the flow. Like, not just go with

790
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:33.030
Cynthia We: What I felt when I was there at the grocery store.

791
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you sat with that is excruciating. Is it, I felt uncomfortable. I felt what

792
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.340
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's just

793
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:46.440
It's just don't

794
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:50.460
Like it it takes time.

795
01:21:55.410 --> 01:22:01.020
Cynthia We: It takes time and it just is uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable. They have talked about price of every single little thing do you

796
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what that emotion is

797
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.690
Cynthia We: I don't know.

798
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.970
Cynthia We: Well, and annoying is not emotion.

799
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.450
Cynthia We: On shame, I'm sure.

800
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think that's what makes it hard to say no to

801
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.340
Cynthia We: Think it's it's normal.

802
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.530
So,

803
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe say it like this. I felt shame, as we talked about each item and just say that to him. And let's mirror that back and then we're going to do another an exchange the other way around. But do look at each other, this, this is where

804
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.710
Cynthia We: I felt shame. As we talked

805
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A mirror that back, Scott. Look at you. Look at me. Hang in there felt

806
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:45.570
Shame.

807
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.630
To discuss the person

808
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:50.820
Didn't. Did I get that right.

809
01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:52.350
Away.

810
01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Let's flip this around and you're going to mirror what this has been like for Scotto play, Cindy. Can you hold that space to

811
01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Scott, look at her and now find your truth. Take your time.

812
01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt something when body, blah.

813
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:23.820
Cynthia We: Well I, I feel good about the whole thing. I know what I like to do. I'm

814
01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell her

815
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.280
Cynthia We: What I feel a

816
01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:31.890
Cynthia We: Little relief, a little

817
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:34.020
Cynthia We: reassured that

818
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:35.730
Cynthia We: That I'm

819
01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.970
Cynthia We: More might be more serious about

820
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:41.460
That we might be more

821
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.000
Cynthia We: Okay, you stop so that

822
01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling where you're going with is, I guess.

823
01:23:51.030 --> 01:24:03.120
Cynthia We: In relief you felt good and you felt really ensure reassured that we might go forward and take this more seriously. So I get that right. Yes, because I've never felt them.

824
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

825
01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:08.550
Cynthia We: I just feel always contentious.

826
01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on, I feel that we know we're storytelling. As soon as that pops up. So just this one last piece. And I just go a little power spot.

827
01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel I know it's contrived. But, see if you can find an actual emotion word to plug in there.

828
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: In reflecting back that this

829
01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Discussion happened. See if you know what the actual feeling radios.

830
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Good isn't one, by the way.

831
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Releases but go a little deeper.

832
01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:01.560
Cynthia We: I don't know what the word is for less stressed, I feel

833
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:09.450
Cynthia We: Hopeful

834
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How much of that is true. Do you have some increased hope.

835
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:21.360
Cynthia We: I haven't been so it's I I feel tentatively hopeful.

836
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: About somewhat helpful.

837

838
01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:38.520
Cynthia We: History has is still scarred, you know, with on us having trouble with this, but I feel more hopeful.

839
01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see if you can mirror that back. Do you need help. Cindy was a too much.

840
01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:51.210
Cynthia We: You can do you feel hopeful your back. Lucky, lucky like that.

01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:59.250
Cynthia We: You feel somewhat hopeful history is still scarred with

843
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Mirror is sarcastic, you're

844
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: A little nervous.

845
01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:11.430
Cynthia We: Hey, he's associated about the history being scarred with

846
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:11.940
Okay.

847
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:13.740
Cynthia We: I'm

848
01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So take a deep breath. That was hard for you to hear because Shane's in

849
01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:21.210
Cynthia We: Here. Yeah, I don't. I don't.

850
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:30.090
Cynthia We: I know he's helpful. Great. I'm excited, but the timing thriller. Honestly, I don't want to say that I want to say I'm hopeful.

851
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:47.880
Cynthia We: And this is great. And it is and it's not. I don't believe it or do you want my part of my honest total everything I'm feeling. Yes, it is. I am hopeful. We've gone forward and it is definitely a step in the hopeful direction, but I am

852
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.210
Cynthia We: Down tentative not doubtful. I think we're going to do this. I don't think we're going to fail.

853
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.610
Cynthia We: Um, but

854
01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:04.410
Cynthia We: I guess the contentions we've had in the past with this make me feel like it's not going to be smooth as butter.

855
01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on, since it's a steroid like try this on, see if there's anything close to find your own word

856
01:27:12.210 --> 01:27:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We got something, this will be the last one. And then I got to go try this on Scott, but you can find your own wording for it. I'm Cindy, I feel worried that we won't stick to the budget.

857
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Truth my mind.

858
01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:41.070
Cynthia We: So I I'm hopeful and I feel positive I feel hopeful about this.

859
01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:42.600
Um,

860
01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:47.070
But I do I feel worried or concerns.

861
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That we might not stick to 100% and is that the truth.

862
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:57.210
Cynthia We: No, no, it's nice that I will but

863
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyways, you might as well get to it.

864
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:07.440
Cynthia We: That you might not stick to it in certain places cause issues.

865
01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:09.120
Period. Period.

866
01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:18.690
Cynthia We: When I don't like is what happens when that happens, because then I am like God. Do I say anything. Do I raised the point that she did something she said she wasn't gonna do

867
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:29.340
Cynthia We: It's going to cause a fight. So sometimes I don't. Sometimes you and then it causes an issue. So that's what I, that's what I'm concerned about is that can do argument about students don't

868
01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Think we're going to get them. So are you are you doing okay. Cindy yeah you know that he has a right in his own opinion he's ready. No, no, no. He has a right to his own experience. You have a right to yours too.

869
01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not there is no out our way of power. Here it is, you have access to write your experience is just as valid.

870
01:28:58.590 --> 01:29:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that to be true. I could spend plenty of time explaining how your experiences valid Cindy, you need to believe that you're never going to be able to hold his truth. You can't hold your own

871
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family like to, they don't negate each other.

872
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.660
They don't. Okay.

873
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott, nice and easy. Here I am concerned that you won't stick to this budget.

874
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.980
I have I'm

875
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: slightly concerned that you might not stick to this budget. Okay, period. Now Marin that back. So you're slightly concerned that I won't stick to this budget, take it. Yes. Is there more last one is there one

876
01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no. Okay. And you heard the hopeful Part two right felt different. Yeah.

877
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff that you're going through Cindy around the shame that needs all that attention that you and I have worked on that needs lots of attention but sitting with it, fueling it like I'm a shit no good.

878
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work. It serves zero, it serves zero and you can just enjoy what today has to offer, enjoy the fact that you sat

879
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: With that discomfort that you could hear your husband that you did something that you were really uncomfortable doing and you did it anyway. Remember

880
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that list, we did with all of those beliefs and how how money has this meaning you're having to smack right up in front of it and it is uncomfortable.

881
01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it would be uncomfortable for anybody but you're doing it anyway. And it's because I believe that you value this marriage and the functioning of this family.

882
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And that you can see the value in taking meticulous care, even though it's just butting up against this image of the self. Just slamming in there, hard. Okay.

883
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not making you a bad person. This is a normal phenomenon. People have to come, they do the butt up against this image of themselves. And it's like, what, this isn't how I thought it was going to be. I don't like this feeling, you are a good person.

884
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

885
01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you don't your feet should tell your face that you're you're more of a

886
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad or you're feeling

887
01:31:41.130 --> 01:31:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, baby.

888
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you put your arms around him. Scott and just let her know just let her know

889
01:31:53.580 --> 01:32:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So we all act out and we oftentimes do it in the funniest ways, you know, and money's money is the way we do it. We just do how do you think I'm able to talk about this so comfortably right this is human.

890
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, your relationship with it is is different than his relationship with it you attach it somehow to value to you and he just can't quite for late to it's just not quite the same.

891
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:25.140
Right.

892
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going to happen when we end this session.

893
01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you guys gonna do. Can you do something kind to each other with each other. What can you do

894
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:39.180
Cynthia We: We have all kinds of

895
01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:41.730
Cynthia We: The house.

896
01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:45.870
Cynthia We: Making bedroom.

897
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you

898
01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.680
Cynthia We: went for a walk around the block.

899
01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. Can you guys do that. Can you hold on Hold space and you literally Cindy, this one. You've seen me do this.

900
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You just push the shame off to the side and only thing you do is, what am I going to do today that's consistent with with what I believe in.

901
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a different phenomenon. You don't sit there and fuel that that ugly thought about you. You just go well what am I going to do

902
01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna make me some golfing I'm going to make it. You don't go to a bad person detox from the shame and just go to the

903
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Next action that represents what you really believe in what you care about, it'll feel good.

904
01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And frankly, going for a walk together. That's a great investment. Once you go do that, don't let anything get in the way, not a snotty little teenager, not a needy little eight year old just go give to this marriage just it needs some energy

905
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Give to each other. Can you do that. That was a great idea.

906
01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll be refueled and you go conquer those rooms. You got lots of reorganizing

907
01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know when you want to meet again. Okay, good. All right. Be good to you. Thank you. You're welcome.
