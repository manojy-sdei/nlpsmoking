00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:05.879
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, how are you

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.620
Michelle: I'm good, how are you

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. How are things going

4
00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.870
Michelle: Yeah, we just had a an inspection.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.330
Michelle: The pre Ashley.

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.700
And

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.310
Michelle: How was a nightmare.

9
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happened.

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.140
Michelle: Well, the, the owners, the landlord's she just, I mean, she just acted like we've just destroyed and trash this place and

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.340
Michelle: We've been here for a little over a year and it's just normal common wear and tear. You know, I mean,

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.380
Michelle: She just, I mean just extremely rude.

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.260
Michelle: And when I confronted her because I was just over her attitude and over her, her, her voice sounds like, Why are you being so rude.

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.900
Michelle: And she just

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.940
Michelle: trashed my

16
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.800
Michelle: God

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was it that she said you trashed. I don't get it.

18
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.280
Michelle: So should we just agree to her. We trashed her entire unit her whole the whole place which I feel is nonsense.

19
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:30.060
Michelle: We've been here a little over a year and all, they're all there is is some blinds need to be replaced. There's two holes in the walls downstairs and

20
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.370
Michelle: I think that's it.

21
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And on her report. What does she say you need to

22
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Change.

23
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:56.010
Michelle: Well, I mean, it kind of backfired in our face because HUD came in and did their inspection and she's required to Repair and Replace everything except for the bottom downstairs living on blinds were required to replace those

24
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.760
Michelle: So it kind of backfired interface.

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.740
Michelle: So funny. Oh.

26
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.920
Michelle: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thankfully, yes, cuz I don't know. I don't have the money to replace me and repair everything

27
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.660
Michelle: Was just no way

28
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they contributed to normal wear and tear and and

29
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.800
Michelle: He's not. Yeah.

30
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's a good thing.

31
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anyway, so you don't have any extra hat, you know, extra cost to moving out. How's things going with what you are

32
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: what your plans are.

33
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.740
Michelle: Well,

34
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:53.190
Michelle: Plans are the plans as of right now. Our plan is to have our housing authority or HUD voucher transported to Cruz County and that takes like 30 days or whatever.

35
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.970
Michelle: And so we're planning to do that here in March, sometime. We're going to try and work it out to where

36
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:13.920
Michelle: Because we don't want to do it too soon, because if we get an interview, we have to be up in Coos Bay and if there's no way for us to get up to speed, to do the interview, then we're just, you know, we're out of that. So the plan is to do it to where

37
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.650
Michelle: We spend probably the last two weeks here. Yeah, we're up and pay

38
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.030
Michelle: For the remainder of that 30 days for it to transport and then I mean as of right now.

39
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.100
Michelle: Our plan is to just kind of camp out somewhere in a camping ground or on the beach or something somewhere just kind of, I mean, cuz

40
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:45.000
Michelle: You know, I've thought about it. We've talked about it and I feel like living in the van sleeping in the van and parking lots, you know, eventually, someone's going to call CPS right

41
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.140
Michelle: If you week if we're camping. How you gonna call CPS on someone that's camping. I mean, regardless of how long were camping. We're camping.

42
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.580
Michelle: Yeah, you know, and most campgrounds have shower facilities and

43
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.560
Michelle: You know, so the plan as of right now is to just find a campground that's decent and has showers and

44
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.450
Michelle: go camping for a while and we're either going to wait and I mean I just honestly feel like

45
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:27.240
Michelle: If we just raised around and sit around for HUD to find a place for us to find a place to prove to get into a place I just feel like that's going to just be a long drawn out process where I feel like if I get a job and I save up money, we could get in sooner rather than later.

46
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:36.360
Michelle: Mm hmm. So that's kind of the plan, plan is just on a campground or camping for a while, get a job, save up money getting to a place

47
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, and

48
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just know that there's a lot of really nice.

49
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: camper campgrounds out there.

50
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there really is that are safe and

51
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And a lot of people do it, especially now with it, how much it cost to rent a place you know

52
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.540
Michelle: Because I've looked in, like, even just renting a room that's

53
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:14.880
Michelle: Just outrageous. I mean, I've looked, I looked it up, I've looked like several outlets of like it's a rent a room, you know, Craigslist, Facebook, you know, all over the place. I mean, they still want anywhere between six and $900 just for a

54
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Room. Yeah.

55
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.970
Michelle: Like, that's just not feasible that there's no way we're going to be able to save money doing it that way.

56
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.270
Michelle: We're a hotel room for that matter, it's just not

57
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:33.900
Michelle: It's not smart. It's not feasible. It's not financially smart. Yeah, I feel like you know it's going to be rough for a little while, but we're just camping for the summer.

58
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.060
Michelle: Yeah, and is

59
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.280
Michelle: Going to be a little rough, but I mean, we'll have a vehicle so that'll be an extreme positive and

60
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:59.160
Michelle: My dad's supposed to hopefully he'll hold up his end of, you know, his the agreement and whatnot. And the plan, but he's supposed to help me out with like an ice chest and, you know, a camp stove and just a tire and stuff like that.

61
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.230
Michelle: So,

62
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

63
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Has your communication with haven't gotten better.

64
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:19.470
Michelle: A little bit. A little bit. I just, you know, I'm just really wary because I get paid on the third and the plan is, is to get my driver's license.

65
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.390
Michelle: Need to get my driver's license and as soon as I get that driver's license.

66
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.750
Michelle: There should be no reason why he doesn't give me the van.

67
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.550
Michelle: Mm hmm. So

68
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.130
Michelle: If he doesn't give me that van. Then I really don't know what the book, we're going to

69
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.840
Michelle: A huge relying we're really relying on having that vehicle.

70
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

71
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you've stress to him how important it is that he goes

72
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.580
Michelle: Oh, yeah, yeah. He knows and my grandmother. I mean, we went and visited my grandmother

73
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.160
Michelle: About a week ago.

74
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.390
Michelle: Europe Brookings isn't my great grandmother and

75
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:08.550
Michelle: She was like, I heard you're almost done with your diploma and I heard your dad was going to give you the van for getting your diploma, so

76
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:16.800
Michelle: I'm really, you know, I'm really hoping like it's it's real this time, you know, I mean, cuz

77
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.070
Michelle: I mean my grandma was like, you know,

78
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.510
Michelle: It kind of, you know, kind of made it like you know a little bit more real, you know, like, yeah, I'm not done with my diploma and

79
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.570
Michelle: He told me he gave me that man.

80
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.790
Michelle: Know,

81
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did you tell her, did you tell her how important it was that you

82
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah. Okay, good.

83
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good.

84
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important that you know the urgency and

85
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The importance of it. You know what I mean is known by everybody, so

86
00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:06.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so that way. She can kind of reiterate that with your dad. And so you know that hopefully might help your dad solidify the agreement, you know, within himself to follow through with it. Yeah. You know, you know,

87
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's things been going with your neighbors.

88
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:23.430
Michelle: Um, you know, I haven't heard anything but that's, I mean that's that's typical. You know, and we only really hear or see them, you know, once in a blue moon when they come out of their caves and and

89
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:42.000
Michelle: I try to just ignore them and you know sometimes the last time that there was an altercation. It's one of them overheard me talking to my father, you know, just venting and talking about what's going on and whatnot. And that's when the altercation happened, you know,

90
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.490
Michelle: But I've been trying to like really watch myself and not

91
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:58.710
Michelle: Talk with like the windows open talk loudly with the windows open or talk in the kitchen when the screen is, you know, open and in trying to really make sure that I'm

92
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.630
Michelle: Watching my

93
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.930
Michelle: Loudness level and

94
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.700
Michelle: What I say, and who's around, but for the most part, like

95
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.480
Michelle: There hasn't been anything other than Christian, the landlord here, the day before yesterday and

96
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.110
Michelle: Was just

97
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:34.200
Michelle: Me, it's just, it's crazy how people, people are just cutthroat, man. People are called these days. And it's really sad. It's really, really sad. I mean, because she like she was like, oh, we used to be friends and house like

98
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:49.920
Michelle: No, we've never been friends ever, ever, and for her to just have the audacity to sit there and call herself a friend that's what blew my mind. I'm like, How can you sit there and call yourself a friend.

99
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.840
Michelle: And the things that you've said and done to me and my family. I mean,

100
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.140
Michelle: That's not a friend. I'm sorry.

101
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.560
Michelle: That's not my definition of a friend.

102
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.390
Michelle: You know,

103
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

104
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'm glad that you know, things have kind of mellowed out for your last little bit there, so that way you know you can kind of get some peace through this whole process while you're

105
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Moving out. What do you get what's your plans as far as doing, what are you going to do with all your stuff.

106
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.830
Michelle: Um, yeah.

107
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.010
Michelle: There's a lot like a lot a lot just

108
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:38.640
Michelle: Relying on my father. The plan is to put everything in storage and Tuesday and he's supposed to pay first month

109
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:48.720
Michelle: Of rent for the storage unit and first month of insurance on the van and then the rest is up to me.

110
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

111
00:10:50.070 --> 00:11:01.710
Michelle: So, but I feel like because I'm sure he's going to end up using the storage unit. So I feel like if he's going to be using it to, then I should only be paying half of the fee for it, but

112
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:02.790
Michelle: We're not there yet.

113
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:11.760
Michelle: You know, but that's the plan, the plan is to put everything in storage and just take the basic necessities that we need to survive. And, you know,

114
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you going to get it to Coos Bay.

115
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.020
Michelle: My Dad's going to rent a U Haul and we're just going to take it all up. And once you

116
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.870
Michelle: Pick one.

117
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good. I was wondering about that piece to, you know, how many, how long of a drive. Is it from where you're at.

118
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.970
Michelle: From where we are. We're here in Crescent City, it's

119
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:50.070
Michelle: Three hours. Two and a half, three hours because it's a half an hour 45 minutes from here to Brookings and from Brookings. It's a two hour drive so about three hours hour, two hours 45 minutes give or take, you know,

120
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not bad.

121
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:51.930
Yeah.

122
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:53.430
Michelle: Yeah.

123
00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not bad at all. And so are you planning on getting an Oregon driver's license or uh yeah yeah

124
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:06.000
Michelle: That's the plan. I'm hoping because when I made a bunch of phone calls. I had a $50

125
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:19.590
Michelle: Stop sign ticket from Arizona that I didn't finish paying off. And when I called they said that I owed over $200 and I'm just like, Oh, man.

126
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:31.500
Michelle: So I'm really hoping I don't have to pay that because if I if I don't have to pay that then we'll just be super simple and easy for me to just take the test. Get the driver's license. Whereas if I hadn't paid and I'm going to have to pay

127
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:38.370
Michelle: That plus the fees to get the driver's license, which isn't very expensive. Actually, I was looking

128
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You froze.

129
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey there, he

130
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.320

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Michelle frozen got kicked off.

132
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:33.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

133
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My origin shirkers

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay, my dears to I'm right. Yeah, I can. We can be in the middle of a session and all of a sudden my internet goes down on like, what, what, and it's searching, you know, for it is it's annoying.

138
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:04.110
Michelle: You know, on my phone. It has like an exclamation mark next to the Wi Fi bars there. So it lets me know otherwise I'm like, what's

139
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.860
Michelle: Going on.

140
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:15.720
Michelle: Group yesterday because I was just super, super sick and I could like it was hard to talk, but yeah.

Good.

147
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.020
Michelle: Yeah, she told me that she would let the doctor know so that that's not a no show

148
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: keeping yourself secure, but your daughter's does she go to school.

155
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:30.510
Michelle: No, no, we just took her to the park and when the, when she woke up for her nap that day, she had a really bad sore throat. I almost thought it was like poop or something because it was like, I mean it was just

156
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:41.040
Michelle: Really like it just, it sounded kind of, you know, really bad. But as the night went on and the next day. It didn't sound so much like that bark, you know, kind of

157
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

158
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:50.880
Michelle: So it was like, well, and she wasn't she wasn't she didn't have a fever either was like, we'll see. See how it goes. If we need to take her in or not.

159
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And she's gotten better.

160
00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:00.870
Michelle: Yeah, it's now I'm going to just miss me it's just kind of like a runny nose, kind of thing going on. Yeah.

161
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: God because you know there's schools that are being shut down over this.

162
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:06.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cold

163
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.650
Michelle: Yeah.

164
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it's bad.

165
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:24.750
Michelle: I know they have a all this coronavirus crap that's going on. And I know there's a confirmed case in Sacramento in Sacramento is not that far from here, actually, like, maybe like two, three hour drive maybe six hours. No, no.

166
00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.270
Michelle: I don't know, but it's not that far from here.

167
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.170
Michelle: Because first goes first, because not that far.

168
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.140
Michelle: And it's just a little bit north of Frisco

169
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

170
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:50.790
Michelle: Yeah I know they're there. So that, but we really don't go out very much like we go to the grocery store. We go to the park. Once a while. But other than that, we really don't venture out and talk to people and

171
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good.

172
00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good. I just sent a message to Dr. Jamison letting her know that you came in for your individual today.

173
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that they know that you're engaging and that you're here, you know, so that there's no interruption with your. How are you doing with your medication.

174
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:27.720
Michelle: I'm doing good. I'm doing really good. I feel like it's it's doing its job, said she raised my dosage. I feel like it's a lot better now. I just wish I could get my anxiety under control, and I wish I could get prescribed something for anxiety, but

175
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:37.590
Michelle: Nobody wants to prescribe which is which is really weird for me too. Because last time I was in group. There was a guy in there, who was talking about his prescriptions.

176
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:46.380
Michelle: And I'm sure we're not allowed to talk really about our prescriptions, because everybody is described different things, but he was said, and he was prescribed el presidente

177
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:59.640
Michelle: And I'm like, Well, why can't I get back on my El Paso em. The 0.5 milligrams small dose that I was on that helps or when I'm like having a panic attack and my anxieties through the roof and

178
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:10.770
Michelle: I just figured. I'm not even gonna bother you know and ask about it or argue about it because I just, you know, they just look at me as just a junkie, trying to get that high or whatever and

179
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you, have you voiced your, your anxiety issues.

180
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.260
Michelle: Oh yeah, very much so. Yes, it's very well known.

181
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:23.790
Michelle: Okay.

182
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what, what was the response when you did.

183
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.730
Michelle: She tried to put me on

184
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.580
Michelle: Oh, man.

185
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.570
Michelle: Like hydro chloride or something like that.

186
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are like hydroxide Zane or something. I'm like, I'm visceral

187
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:47.310
Michelle: I'm not, I can't really remember exactly what it was called, but it was just this little green pill and

188
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:59.670
Michelle: That didn't do anything for my anxiety. What it did was make me super Josie and want to go to sleep. So I quit taking them and I would I would take them at night. So it would help me fall asleep better

189
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:11.670
Michelle: And that helped helped me fall asleep, but I don't really have a problem falling asleep, it's more or less staying asleep really more some Nia of like

190
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:22.140
Michelle: It's two three in the morning, I need to go to bed. But my anxiety and everything, all the stress and everything in my head is just not able to like relax to close my eyes to fall asleep.

191
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you do when that happens, what do you do

192
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:38.760
Michelle: I just kind of sit here and play on my phone, or I go downstairs and I smoke a cigarette. I get something to munch on and then I come back upstairs and I try to lay back down and close my eyes.

193
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.250
Michelle: But I mean, for the most part, it just kind of, I just kind of stay up

194
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.180
Michelle: When I'm like looking at the clock. It's four in the morning.

195
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:52.860
But

196
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There.

197
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:06.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are different types of coping skills to help with anxiety that you can try when you're up like that and taking it, you know, you're not going to

198
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:21.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you might be able to. I don't know it a cabin campground. If the showers close at all during the nights. But, you know, taking a hot shower, making sure you're in a dark room and trying to put on some soothing music

199
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of those things can help with falling asleep.

200
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially when your anxieties really high.

201
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When your anxiety raises is it when tell me what goes through your mind.

202
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:45.360
Michelle: Just everything that's going on everything. Not, not just with everything that's going on, just everything my entire life. I mean everything, everything

203
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You start ruminating about the past and worrying about the future and

204
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of that. So, so you've got to pull yourself out of that thought process to in focus on what you can do today.

205
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:08.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because if you work out. You know what's already happened. That doesn't do you any good. The past is done. It's written. It's over. You can't change anything. It is what it is.

206
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:21.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you worry about the future that you have no control over right in this moment, then that can put you in a tailspin too. And so you kind of want to bring yourself back into right now.

207
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's going on right in this moment and really pay attention to what you do have control over in this moment.

208
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which really kind of helps and makes a difference.

209
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's kind of

210
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh God, what do you call it.

211
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thinking forward or thinking backward and is anxiety producing. And so you want to get out of both of those and focus in on right now today.

212
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because

213
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you focus in on today and you are focused on what you're doing in the moment.

214
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:06.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't even say that that being on your phone is a bad thing, but it does stimulate the brain.

215
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, but it does take you out of that way of thinking as well. So, you know, it's kind of two fisted in that area.

216
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.250
Right.

217
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:29.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I would. That's what I will try. Are you put your earphones in your data you have had your phone in and try to find some calming soothing you know music that you can listen to, to help

218
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: watch a video.

219
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:33.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On your phone.

220
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Find some positivity that you can feed your brain.

221
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pay attention to what it is in this moment that you have control over.

222
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you want to learn these things and how to deal with these things.

223
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For now, and for later on to

224
00:22:53.790 --> 00:23:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't always want to be dependent on a medication to calm down your anxiety. You want to be able to do it yourself, you know,

225
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:16.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that for me when I'm in that you know when I'm stressed out and I'm worried about something I have to like really do this like check in, in my head, how much control do I have over the situation right now. What can I change in this moment.

226
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how can I help myself right now.

227
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:35.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'll take whatever it is that I'm stressing out and I'll kind of compartmentalize it in my head and focus on the things that I'm hearing and the things that I'm feeling right here in this moment.

228
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So by doing that kind of brings you back into the present and allows your anxiety to to lesson and that this is little tools mental tools that you can try to use to help right now to help bring down your anxiety, a little bit. Does that make sense.

229
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.750
Michelle: Yeah yeah

230
00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Up, where'd you go

231
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I lost you again.

232
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hello.

233
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Michelle.

234
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And she froze.

235
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You there.

236
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.530
Michelle: Yeah, sorry, I don't know why it's doing this.

237
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. Usually it's mine. So we can say okay I get it. Not a big deal.

238
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.900
Michelle: It's a pain in the butt really is.

239
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

240
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we will you try that for me and see if that doesn't

241
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:24.360
Michelle: Yeah, I will definitely try that. Um, do you by chance to know if they've gotten to where they cover Oregon like Oregon insurances is

242
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

243
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that they're working on

244
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that they're working on it. And I know that

245
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's some things that are in the works for it. I can definitely check and see how far we are progressed in it because I'm actually certified in Oregon.

246
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My credentials. Most of my credentials are from Oregon.

247
00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good. So, um, I'll find out my supervisor is out of town at a convention right now and and I'll shoot her an email and see if I can't get some information.

248
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:13.050
Michelle: Because I'm really worried about that too, you know. Because, because I, it does help a lot. The group and the medication and therapy and

249
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:26.490
Michelle: And helps a lot. And I am I'm concerned and I'm worried about you know when that when that's gone. If you know when that's gone and and I no longer am able to get the medication or

250
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You want to

251
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:43.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that there are programs in Oregon. So you want to make sure that as soon as you get there you get connected with a program there get an appointment set up and and let them know you know that you're in transition.

252
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that you can get started, where you left off.

253
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just to let you know that Oregon is really working with

254
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Different providers with the map program. It's really vitally important.

255
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're definitely good in that aspect. So you want to find one in your area.

256
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And connect with them as soon as possible.

257
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, get an appointment ASAP.

259
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:29.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah, that'll give you a time for the transition and to get an appointment and be able to stay connected, no matter what until you get that appointment. Okay, my

260
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:47.580
Michelle: My I guess I should probably ask Dr. Jamison this but will they be able to give me at least, like a couple weeks or a month supply of medication until like I get situated and get an appointment and get, you know, find a doctor, whatever.

261
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

262
00:27:50.160 --> 00:28:01.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will that is something for you to discuss with Dr. Jamison, I don't know how they work. When people are transitioning like that. And that is something to ask her. When you see her. Okay.

263
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't have that information to give you right now so

264
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want to give you false information.

265

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if for some reason you're unable, make sure that you call in and let them know. Okay, okay. We do that yeah and then try the

270
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:42.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working with the skills that you and I just talked about, and see if that doesn't help with lowering your anxiety and allowing you to to get in the headspace to be able to get some rest right

271
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.210
Michelle: Yeah, I will. I will definitely work on trying to do that.
