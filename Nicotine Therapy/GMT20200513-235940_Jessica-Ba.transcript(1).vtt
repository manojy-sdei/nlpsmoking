00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or a cat in the background. Do you have a cat.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.620
Brian Kern: Yeah, we have.

104
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.900
Brian Kern: Two cats. And we also have a pet rat we hadn't. We actually had to pet RAS.

105
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.570
Brian Kern: One of them died like a week ago.

106
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.300
Brian Kern: So,

107
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.680
Brian Kern: But yeah

108
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.990
Brian Kern: Yeah, you're gonna dog because our casket, along with dogs.

109
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.180
Brian Kern: And we've been

110
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.020
Brian Kern: We've been just wanting a dog for a while. So we're like keep our eye out for dogs.

111
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.870
Brian Kern: You know, dogs that just would be good for our little apartment, you know. Yeah.

112
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have a particular breed in mind.

113
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.500
Brian Kern: No, not really. I'm the one we were looking at

114
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:21.000
Brian Kern: That ended up getting adopted was a miniature schnauzer which is like a German dog.

115
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.870
Brian Kern: Actually, the one that the kind of dog that I grew up with.

116
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.070
Brian Kern: An A. And there's another one we were looking at it was

117
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.020
Brian Kern: It was like a golden retriever mix or something.

118
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.140
Brian Kern: I'm not sure we're not trying to get a dog. It's like too big, only because we live in such a small place.

119
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:40.890
Yeah.

120
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:51.900
Brian Kern: Yeah. And then there's another dog or thinking about, but that dollar was like 11 years old and has like behavioral problems of some sort.

121
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

122
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:05.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean it's sad because then you know you hear that tie that in a lot of people probably have the same natural response you know know so i mean you definitely have to

123
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have one. The, the patience to tolerate the skills and the space to accommodate

124
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:24.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That type of dog, and for that to be something that you like interested in kind of like the behavior modification of head because the older daughter has behavior issues if you're

125
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:34.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going into it because you want it to nurture a pet, you know, and to be a pet owner, then you're going to have a different mindset, since I could be a little frustrating.

126
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.540
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean I there's actually a neighborhood dog. Then I walk

127
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.560
Brian Kern: You know, I don't know if you say it has behavioral issues, but it definitely has

128
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:57.510
Brian Kern: It's like a really big dog, and he has, like, kind of like anxiety issues. I guess he said like, he freaks out a lot. And he'll start barking like nothing

129
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.430
Brian Kern: You know, but

130
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:07.290
Brian Kern: You know, I still, I wouldn't even mind having a dog like that. Like, I don't want to like behaviorally street dog.

131
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.640
Brian Kern: Were like he like he or she starts like you know

132
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.260
Brian Kern: Eating the French are like trying to attack or cats are solving, you know,

133
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:27.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm interested in your observation of the dog. You said that you observed that he may have anxiety.

134
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.480
Brian Kern: Yeah. Yes. Something like those

135
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.140
Brian Kern: You know, he knows he knows both being my wife.

136
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:54.960
Brian Kern: And like every time we go to walk on. You still acts like scared. You know, like you can. He's like, visibly scared, even though, as soon as we like get his leash. Then he gets all happy. But before then. He looks kind of like scared, but I think that's because his owner

137
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.050
Brian Kern: Like his owners this couple we know in the neighborhood, and that the guy.

138
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.770
Brian Kern: Moved out like suddenly

139
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.830
Brian Kern: I don't know, like, something happened there.

140
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.870
Brian Kern: And I think he's still kind of freaked out about that, whatever, whatever happened but

141
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.710
Brian Kern: I'm not sure what

142
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It is

143
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.060
Brian Kern: So I think it has something to do with that maybe

144
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.340
Brian Kern: So,

145
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.010
Brian Kern: I don't know, but

146
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:35.460
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean, he's like visibly scared, whenever we come, you know, we kind of have to like approach of slowly, you know, I mean, and kind of like let them sniff our hand and then we

147
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Pay them a little bit and then we grabbed a leash nice happy and

148
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.320
Brian Kern: Peaceful yeah that's like those first few minutes

149
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He said, when you're out and about to his responses when people want to buy

150
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.320
Brian Kern: Yeah, he wants to play with, like everybody and like say it everybody and

151
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.990
Brian Kern: You know, once he's out of the house. He's fun. I think it's just when

152
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.740
Brian Kern: People come into the house. It's like as soon as he leaves the house, he's fine you know

153
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.100
Brian Kern: Yeah.

154
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.000
So,

155
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:21.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What you've learned about your anxiety. How has that assisted you and how you deal with this dog that you want.

156
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.400
Brian Kern: Oh, whoa, yeah. Like I'll approach them slowly and like kind of like

157
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.890
Brian Kern: Sweet talk a little bit and like

158
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:39.960
Brian Kern: You know, make sure he knows. Everything's okay. Like, I'm not gonna like attack or something.

159
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.030
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, I really feel like it has something to do with the guy that

160
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:53.220
Brian Kern: Cuz like I guess her his owners like ex boyfriend or whatever, like I feel like it really has something to do with that.

161
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.800
Brian Kern: You know, like, I don't know, it's like

162
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.290
Brian Kern: He's just like

163
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.850
Brian Kern: Anxious anxious. You know, I think I might just be like,

164
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.840
Brian Kern: Yeah, something, something that has to do is really, he's not like that with my wife either like he's only

165
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.110
Brian Kern: Only like that with me. So I think

166
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.890
Brian Kern: It's like kind of like

167
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: mail saying

168
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.370
Brian Kern: I could be wrong. Yeah.

169
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:33.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's go good that you're curious and you're assessing the situation and says, like you're, you may be more aware of what anxiety and how it presents itself because of your own different emotional responses. Someone else may not have noticed

170
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:33.840
Yeah.

171
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:48.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, one thing I wanted to mention to you is, and I never shared it was discussed it with you is that I'm licensed in the state of Florida and Mexico.

172
00:13:48.870 --> 00:14:06.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I know we see each other on a weekly basis in the event that your background looks a little different on my X. Hey, where are you located. I'm in as because of the tele health. I have to verify your location. And so that means if you go outside of the state of New Mexico because

173
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'll hold a license there. I wouldn't be able to see

174
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For that session, but

175
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:18.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's like an emergency situation, then, of course, I wouldn't turn you away. But I just want you to be aware of.

176
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.690
Brian Kern: Order.

177
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:28.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I see your background look different. My axe. Where are you, and it's more so because I'm trying to make sure that I'm within a mile to make the nature of my license in the next

178
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.070
Brian Kern: Okay, there's only one point which I

179
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:40.350
Brian Kern: may leave New Mexico, and that's the first week first week of August, because I had my court date to get off probation, but

180
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.110
Brian Kern: I'm not even sure that I have to go.

181
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

182
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.080
Brian Kern: I'm still trying to figure out

183
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.210
Brian Kern: Is actually going to be like a pain in the ass.

184
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.630
Brian Kern: It's kind of stupid.

185
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where, where would that be, where's that court date located

186
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.420
Brian Kern: Virginia

187
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me know what's hot closer to that time. And like you said you don't even know if you have to do or not.

188
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.790
Brian Kern: Yeah, I'm not even sure why I'm on probation anymore. Really, cuz

189
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:29.070
Brian Kern: The rest of my probation has been kind of cancelled because it coven 19 like they told me that, like, basically, I mean it's not cancelled, but it's like my all my appointments. I have appointments once a month, and they're over the phone and literally just like

190
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.380
Brian Kern: She asked me, have you committed any crimes and I'm just saying no.

191
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.550
Yeah.

192
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

193
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.010
Brian Kern: It's kind of weird, but

194
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.310
Brian Kern: Yeah, as you know, still

195
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.550
Brian Kern: Still going to do with these people tell me. Yeah.

196
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.360
Yeah.

197
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.800
Brian Kern: Yeah.

198
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.130
Brian Kern: Yeah, it's kinda like stupid that I have to go back for

199
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:06.810
Brian Kern: To be off from Beijing to because there. I think it's only because they're dropping my charge from felony, because I don't. I didn't have any felony felony on my record before this.

200
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.720
Brian Kern: And part of the fee agreement was invited and violate my probation, they would drop into a

201
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.510
Brian Kern: misdemeanor. So I think that's why I have to go back to the core.

202
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.780
Brian Kern: I'm not sure. Yeah, but I'm

203
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.680
Brian Kern: Gonna try not to like, I'm going to try to see if like

204
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.180
Brian Kern: My lawyer can go for me like I have like a quarter point a lawyer.

205
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.840
Brian Kern: Or something, because that's going to be like a pain in the ass.

206
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.830
Brian Kern: You know, like

207
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.750
Brian Kern: flying back just to go to like a 20 minute coordinate

208
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As Joe

209
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:45.270
Brian Kern: Yeah, I'm not too worried about. It's like in three months so

210
00:16:49.980 --> 00:17:03.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I wanted to play this video that talks about anxiety because I know what the PTSD. Once we assimilate back into going out and about some of those stressors might be triggered again.

211
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any triggers that you've identified since we last spoke

212
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.780
Brian Kern: No. Yes. So it's been

213
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.830
Brian Kern: Really an eventful yeah um

214
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:25.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well with things. I sometimes that's a good thing to just go to Korea just you know nothing, no waves or anything like that.

215
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.300
Brian Kern: I was actually, I was really anxious before

216
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:43.650
Brian Kern: My probation meeting because I didn't know that it was. I didn't know. Like I always get nervous, like, not because like I violated, but just because it's like I have to go talk to police. It just makes me nervous.

217
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.520
Brian Kern: And I didn't know it was going to be over the phone.

218
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:56.070
Brian Kern: When I call her to make sure that I had to go in because I didn't know. So that was the only time I got a really anxious

219
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.610
Brian Kern: You know, like I wouldn't call it a trigger. Is this more like a

220
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.110
Brian Kern: Situational type thing.

221
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's a natural occurrence like anyone that has to

222
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Speak with one enforcement those happen situation for do some level of a ride.

223
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: share my screen.

224
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.860
Hey, parents, would you like to help boost your child's confidence.

225
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:42.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So here's the amazing thing about your brain. It's made to rewire itself, all the time. This is called Neuro plasticity.

226
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:55.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Scientists used to think that after childhood our brain was pretty much locked in place. But now that we have better imaging technology. We can literally see how the brain changes depending on how we use it.

227
00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:02.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in this video I'm going to talk about one very simple thing you can do to rewire your brain to be less anxious

228
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:13.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it is simple but it's not easy. So I'm also going to share three steps you can take to make it happen and share 10 extra skills that you can develop on your own.

229
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or with the therapist to build up your ability to take control of your anxiety.

230
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:29.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if you'd like to learn more in depth information about how to treat your anxiety. I've got a course on you to me that I'm working on. It's called rewiring the anxious brain so you can also check out that link in the description.

231
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:51.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's start off with one example of Neuro plasticity in London. The taxi drivers have this super difficult exam where they have to prepare by memorizing all the streets and events and locations in this huge city.

232
00:19:52.530 --> 00:20:03.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Researchers took images of their brain before they started studying and after this two year process and they were literally able to see the new neural connections, the wiring the changed in the brain.

233
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:14.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's good evidence that changing how you think like going to therapy can actually change the structure of your brain and the types of chemicals that it's pumping out

234
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:22.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our brain has an amazing ability to rewire itself to learn grow and heal. So let's talk about how to do that with anxiety.

235
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:30.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If we want to change how our brain processes, anxiety, we understand three principles of anxiety. Number one,

236
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:40.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Understand what is anxiety. Now, this may sound dumb because you already know what anxiety feels like. But what you need to do is understand that your perspective on anxiety.

237
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:50.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You need to let go of the idea that anxiety is bad anxiety is not inherently bad anxiety is uncomfortable sometimes anxiety is disordered.

238
00:20:50.580 --> 00:21:00.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sometimes anxiety gets in the way, but we all experience anxiety because it's supposed to serve a really important function to motivate us to avoid real danger.

239
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:12.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're supposed to feel anxious when standing on a cliff edge, it helps us be safe. We're supposed to feel anxious when we know we have an important test coming up, because that should motivate us to study.

240
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:20.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anxiety tells us that something is important to us, anxiety and excitement are basically the same chemical reaction in your body.

241
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With adrenaline it triggering that sympathetic activation and prepping you for action.

242
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:35.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We look at anxiety as being uncomfortable but acceptable and a normal part of life. Suddenly we develop new tools to work with it.

243
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:47.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that includes working with the other type of anxiety. So the second thing we need to understand is, we need to understand disordered anxiety and this is when anxiety seems to take over your life.

244
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:58.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is anxiety that makes it hard to go to work to school or to enjoy life at all and the harder you try to make it go away, the stronger and stronger it gets

245
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:08.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now contrary to popular belief that anxiety disorder when it's more severe anxiety is actually disordered when one of two things happened.

246
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:19.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When number one. When you feel in danger when you're actually safe and I made a video on this. It's called perceived versus actual safety, for example, I worked with a client who was afraid of radiators.

247
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:25.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She would feel anxious and sweaty around them and she couldn't make herself and go into a room with a radio in it.

248
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:35.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now radiators are not actually dangerous, but she was having a real physiological response to something that was actually safe.

249
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:47.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So anxiety can be disordered when you have a danger response in your body, but you're actually safe. The second way anxiety can be disordered is when your anxiety interferes with your ability to function.

250
00:22:48.540 --> 00:23:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is essentially what determines if you meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. When your anxiety or your attempts to avoid anxiety stop you from effectively facing life.

251
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:13.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When this happens, you start avoiding school or calling in sick to work, you stop leaving the house or spending time with friends, pretty senior anxiety is taking over your life and stopping you from doing the things you love

252
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:21.840
So let's talk about what causes anxiety to spiral out of control. This is called the anxiety cycle.

253
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:29.580
Every day throughout our day. We have experiences and we interpret these experiences as either being safe or dangerous.

254
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:40.050
So let's say for example you see a dog. Now, each person interprets and experienced differently for some people, this would be exciting and fun but for some reason you think that dog is going to bite me

255
00:23:40.590 --> 00:24:00.630
This leads to feelings of fear, anxiety, maybe even panic. These are uncomfortable feelings and you may even take them as a sign that your thoughts are true. So you escape you run away you get out of there and nothing bad happens. So your brain releases this surge of relief.

256
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:19.740
That was close. The only way I survived was because I ran away. I could have died and your brain thinks I better do that again. I'm going to motivate my human to avoid that situation by increasing their anxiety about it. And voila, your anxiety goes up.

257
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:32.460
Every single time that we avoid a threat and survive our brain thinks. Let's do that again so it lays down neural pathways this wiring that reinforces that behavior.

258
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:40.080
And the whole function of emotions is to motivate us to action. But that's all of the video. So our brain.

259
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:47.760
Because we convinced it the dogs threat takes action into its own hands and it increases your anxiety level around dogs.

260
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:59.610
Every time you feel anxiety and then avoid the situation or anxiety level will go up a notch. So this is, principle number three avoidance shields disordered anxiety.

261
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:10.200
Literally creates overwhelming anxiety. Now, there are lots of ways to avoid there's running away and physically avoiding but there's also emotional avoidance.

262
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.870
So if you have social anxiety, you might still go to the party, but only if you get drunk ahead of time.

263
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:23.220
Or you might be in a relationship but scared of getting hurt so you don't allow yourself to let the other person into your heart.

264
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:34.080
You stay emotionally distant or you protect yourself fine not committing social media anger blame distraction and even coping skills can be avoided.

265
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:41.250
Regardless of the type of avoidance, it increases your anxiety and even worse, it shrinks down your world.

266
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:51.570
So with the dog example you might start avoiding situations where a dog might be present, by not going to friends homes or skipping the park.

267
00:25:51.990 --> 00:26:00.840
And your world shrinks you miss out on good relationships or you stop going to parties and your world gets more and more constrained

268
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:13.440
Avoidance can make your world small and scary and unhappy. But every time you get anxious and avoid something and survive your brain increases your anxiety in that area.

269
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:21.990
Now looking at this cycle, we have two places where we can intervene, where we can stop that anxiety from spiraling out of control.

270
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:38.100
The first place is with our actions when we feel anxiety, but we're actually safe. If we stick with it if we stay there. We experience our emotions and sensations without running away. And again, if you do this, and you don't die, then your brain learns

271
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:47.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What a relief. I guess that not all dogs are dangerous. Let's do that again and it sends out a surge a relief.

272
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:59.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This leads to a gradual decrease in anxiety over time and a gradual increase in your emotional muscles, your ability to feel emotions and sensations that are uncomfortable.

273
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Without needing to escape them all the time. So you get better at feeling

274
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:13.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As you do this, your brain literally lays down new neural pathways, saying, not all dogs are dangerous. I don't need to be anxious around dogs.

275
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:25.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it literally changes your brain chemistry releasing less cortisol and adrenaline and other stress hormones. This is the most straightforward way to rewire your brain to have less anxiety.

276
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:34.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I get it. This is super hard if it were easy, he would have already done it. So I'm going to break it down into three big steps for you.

277
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know. On a side note, the second place in the cycle to intervene is with your thoughts, changing how you think about the dog.

278
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:50.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And this can be a powerful and effective treatment to but it can also get really complicated and it works best before you're anxious, rather than during

279
00:27:50.910 --> 00:28:01.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now I talked about some of the ways you can change your thinking in other videos. But in this video we're going to talk about the most straightforward way to rewire the anxious brain. And that's through action.

280
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:13.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, how to do it. There are three steps. So step one, make an exposure hierarchy. I've made an entire video about this, but basically you take one thing that scares you.

281
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:27.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you break it down into teeny tiny steps and you start by courageously facing the easiest one first. Now this is the part that most people miss the jump into fast and then they panic or they escape and they never do it again and then that

282
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:31.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On

283
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The video so

284
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what did you get from watching the video.

285
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.770
Brian Kern: Well basically I got it like

286
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.240
Brian Kern: It takes a change in the weeds think

287
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.030
Brian Kern: You know i mean to like

288
00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:01.830
Brian Kern: Really get rid of anxiety and that's like before you're anxious, you know, I mean,

289
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.420
Brian Kern: I feel like that would be like really hard to do the, you know,

290
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The most difficult part

291
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:16.890
Brian Kern: Is like

292
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.420
Brian Kern: You know, like let's say I'm anxious about like leaving the house.

293
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.840
Brian Kern: You know, I guess I'll have to end like

294
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.140
Brian Kern: You know, I've gotten better about like

295
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:36.780
Brian Kern: Thinking that I'm safe, like when I'm walking around outside so

296
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:52.350
Brian Kern: You know, there's always like a lingering fear of like what could happen. You know, I mean, so it's like I feel like that would be like the hardest thing to get rid of. It's like, you know, because like anything can happen you know and i mean

297
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like I almost feel like I'd have to convince myself that

298
00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.130
Brian Kern: It would be impossible.

299
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For something bad, not to happen. You know, I, man.

300
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So already implementing

301
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:23.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just that realistic perspective. And in that sphere like the world that we live in. Anything can happen, but giving yourself to the place of not allowing this anxiety to be the type that in pair of shoes from everyday functioning.

302
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:29.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, it's already diagnosis. So clearly, there have been some aspects of your function that has been impaired.

303
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:37.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now how do we work through that. And so the identity. The identification of the realness of this

304
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:52.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But also not looking through that filter lens of just everything that could go wrong, but look into that bigger picture. Okay, but what are all the things that can go right so not limiting your view to the next.

305
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's why

306
00:30:54.750 --> 00:31:02.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Aside from the emotions. I've noticed patterns when our X emotion charts motion checked in.

307
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:16.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You'll give me kind of like the emotions that are not so good but very rarely do I hear like, you know what, actually, you know, I had some happy moments you know so I pay more attention to those moments that are pleasurable.

308
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: pleasurable emotions, fear, anxiety, allows you to see it through that filter.

309
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:31.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And black or white type of thinking words always are the Nevers things that aren't working well. But now through that bigger frame, the big picture.

310
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:44.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thinking about the next time your brain tells you all the things that could go wrong. You think I'm wrong on this, I can go right yesterday. I did a, b, and c. And I will say return home sick.

311
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Today can be just like yesterday.

312
00:31:48.240 --> 00:32:02.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something as simple as that. Because again, the more you avoid situations, the more your brain protects you as hey okay avoidance is working well. So we'll just continue to do that.

313
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:20.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Break up the anxiety, you know, another notch. But whenever you go into present to the situation anxiety lessons. Just a little less. So, you know, speaking to law enforcement, probably the first time that you did it for anxiety was maybe at a 10

314
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:34.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Time you do it. Yeah. Yeah. And then it continues, because now you kind of know what to expect but some of the unknown is already taken out of the situation and now you can go back to what's familiar

315
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:36.240
Brian Kern: Yeah.

316
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:48.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that familiarity. What it does is it it compartmentalize in the brain and then allows the brain to go back to home. Okay. The last time we went. This is what we could expect a, b, and c

317
00:32:49.320 --> 00:33:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So Amendola. We don't have to do the fight, flight, or freeze because we already know that this isn't a threatening situation. We don't need to activate in survival mode for Brian because he was able to get out of that.

318
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make sense

319
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:18.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I'm thinking, even though that sweet little dog that you're walking to I'm pretty sure the more he sees you. The more you present to him in that calming nature and and you know meeting with him first seeing him at it for

320
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:33.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A pulling on his leash that over time, you know, his defense me go down because now he even the dog's brain. This is being able to source and filter out like every time. Brian has came I returned back safe.

321
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:53.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And he hasn't done you know he's a male like that other guy in the event that happened. I've always returned back saying so over time, even his brain will be able to source and filter out that Brian is a safe space. My threat. My threat mechanisms don't need to come back on.

322
00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.490
Brian Kern: It's kind of like with my pet rat to my

323
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:17.190
Brian Kern: She you know bites me or she used to buy me a lot. But ever since, you know, I'm the one that gives her food and like cleans their cages up and now she like looks forward to make coming over to her and give her food like

324
00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.870
Brian Kern: Manner. So

325
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.760
Brian Kern: Yeah. Makes sense.

326
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:26.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, your brain that that alternative situation right in there that for the point

327
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:40.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: there been any other changes that you notice in your brain. We talked about the example with on and that will not force and what other ways that you notice that you know there's been some thought diffusion and matters.

328
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.200
Brian Kern: To me is more like, Sure, yeah.

329
00:34:52.290 --> 00:35:03.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you as a sprayer game probably create that filter where it doesn't allow you to notice. So what I would want you to do is notice those things.

330
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:14.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it gives your brain that the new compartment to to create the about, you know, the brain, like the store. It's had maybe about two aisles within the store.

331
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:27.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And those hours happen related to trauma and anxiety. But if you create a new I'll bet. Okay, now there's other places to go other places to venture in your brain to

332
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:36.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Create a new pathway. These were my successes. These were situations where I have pleasurable motion for

333
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Trauma is not my everyday situation.

334
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.300
Brian Kern: Hmm, the

335
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:51.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Trauma is a part of mine. My life. You know, it's part of my life story, but it doesn't have to be part of everyday function.

336
00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:12.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, allowing allowing the brain the hippocampus. Does that that processing for you. So in doing that creates that new channel that new pathway so that whenever your senses, you know, gets activated, it doesn't immediately go down to the amygdala.

337
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:24.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By doing the fight identification and the process and it creates a new channel now for the brain to now say, Hey, let's let's call them.

338
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the Department for Brian

339
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are ways or events that you could think that would help.

340
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Activate that new channel in your brain that we're talking about.

341
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.600
Brian Kern: Oh,

342
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.980
Brian Kern: Like, new, new things I can do.

343
00:36:50.730 --> 00:37:00.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, or just everyday occurrences that maybe like you, Richard and haven't thought of, but now in this moment kind of thinking about, okay, maybe there was a time when

344
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I activated that

345
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.630
Brian Kern: Sure, say,

346
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:18.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was it like for you when you first started the program and had to go to group there. Was there any insights

347
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.530
Brian Kern: From

348
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.140
Brian Kern: Not really. I mean, maybe the first group but like

349
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:35.460
Brian Kern: I feel like I'm so used to it. Only because like at first to act in jail. I had

350
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:56.280
Brian Kern: I went to already have and I feel like I've been in programs for the last few years. So there's not really a whole lot of anxiety that's tied to it, you know, especially not in this group because it's like I feel like there's there's new people like every week, almost. So it's like

351
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:56.610
There's

352
00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.660
Brian Kern: You know there's there's like Mary

353
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:12.150
Brian Kern: Yeah, there's always like new people and this always changing and stuff, you know, I mean, so like no matter what, there's going to be a new person or two in there. You know what I mean.

354
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's critically important.

355
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

356
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: there been any emotions that perhaps you have avoided.

357
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just for the sake of not trying to deal with anxiety.

358
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.260
Brian Kern: No, I don't think so. I mean,

359
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.880
Brian Kern: There are things in the past I've tried to avoid

360
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.940
Brian Kern: Thinking about like

361
00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.850
Brian Kern: Not recently but like

362
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:12.150
Brian Kern: You know, like before I got sentence for my charge like I'll avoid thinking about that so I don't get anxious or like all avoid

363
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.950
Brian Kern: You know, things like that, not nothing really really recently the

364
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Situation.

365
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.640
Brian Kern: Yeah.

366
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be effective to help you accomplish that goal.

367
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:36.690
Brian Kern: Yeah, I think the biggest thing is like

368
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:42.060
Brian Kern: The biggest thing they'll say, reduce in his time. Honestly, like just

369
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:42.720
Time.

370
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.060
Brian Kern: From, like,

371
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.950
Brian Kern: Feeling like my life is threatened or feeling just

372
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:58.710
Brian Kern: Out of control. You know, like the furthest I the furthest I feel away from an event where I feel out of control.

373
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.320
Brian Kern: About something and it's like the less

374
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.690
Brian Kern: Anxious. I get, you know, like I still like anxious, but

375
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.000
Brian Kern: It's more like

376
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:22.800
Brian Kern: You know, just kind of like high like cortisol levels in the more you know like high cortisol levels and like stress hormones in the morning and stuff like that that like won't be attached to anything.

377
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fun like

378
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:32.070
Brian Kern: You know, eventually that goes away and then like, you know, sometimes I'll sit and just

379
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:40.050
Brian Kern: You know, think about their like I'm saved. I literally have nothing to be anxious about right now. You know, I mean, things like that.

380
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Might be permitted statements work really well for you.

381
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:50.340
Brian Kern: Yeah, that's

382
00:40:54.390 --> 00:41:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just allowing yourself that in the present moment. If you are experiencing that is designed to do the grounding activities will be

383
00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:15.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Three things you see things you can touch freakin chicken here and then the deep breathing. That also helps moment to bring you back to present

384
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.120
Brian Kern: Yeah.

385
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:25.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How would you know enough time has passed because you said that time is be a big indicator for you. Three.

386
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:26.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Things.

387
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How do you

388
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How do you decide for when that time has been enough

389
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.410
Not sure.

390
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.790
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, like, a lot of times past since the machete attack.

391
00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:58.980
Brian Kern: And since then, you know, I feel like I feel way less anxious, leaving the house now than I did like three years ago, you know, I mean, or six years ago, you know,

392
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:13.920
Brian Kern: I don't know that the lever be a time where I like always feel completely safe, you know, I mean, which might be a good thing really because you know because like I don't want to be caught off guard or something.

393
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:14.730
You know,

394
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.900
Brian Kern: Yeah, I don't think it's

395
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:30.210
Brian Kern: You know, it's not like I mean. There has been times when I've had like crippling anxiety, you know, but if

396
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:39.690
Brian Kern: I FEEL. I EVEN. That's like not tight anything. It's just all like all feel anxious for like no reason you know i mean

397
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:49.470
Brian Kern: Like as far as like anxiety tied to like violence, you know, I feel like

398
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:55.890
Brian Kern: You know, I'm like a lot of time has passed since like violence happens

399
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.660
Brian Kern: And

400
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.680
Brian Kern: You know, like now I can like leave the house.

401
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:09.960
Brian Kern: Feeling relatively safe, you know. And like I said, I still keep waking vigilant and I around and I still like

402
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.130
Brian Kern: I mean where I'm all i surroundings and the people around me and

403
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.260
Brian Kern: And stuff like that.

404
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.900
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, so as far as like

405
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:31.020
Brian Kern: Anxiety to where like, I feel threatened and I feel like that's like a all time low. You know, I mean,

406
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.510
Brian Kern: You know, I still, you know, as I said, I still keep my head on a swivel but it's like

407
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.570
Brian Kern: You know, like I can leave the house and feel

408
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.670
Brian Kern: Confident that I'm not. No one's going to try to attack me for no reason.

409
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.430
Brian Kern: You know, oh

410
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That sounds like a good place to be because

411
00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:09.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We all need a certain level of anxiety to protect us from dangers to be aware and conscious that is also meant to protect us anxiety isn't always negative.

412
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:26.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So where I would want you to explore more of those moments where you said the inside just comes out of nowhere and I would venture to say that it's not out of nowhere. Something underlying either certain stressors that are in the subconscious.

413
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:32.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Certain environments. It's certain senses that's been activated.

414
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For the anxiety.

415
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:50.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that's just the way the brain operates. It's not independent. It works. It works in conjunction with other things. So there's definitely something going on and into to get curious about that.

416
00:44:50.940 --> 00:45:01.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: During this time to just be more curious about different things. I know with with the pandemic, even though I'm, you know, still actively employed definitely gets me those downtime.

417
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:11.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To think more about things like more things because I'm not out running errands as before. So using that time.

418
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.900
