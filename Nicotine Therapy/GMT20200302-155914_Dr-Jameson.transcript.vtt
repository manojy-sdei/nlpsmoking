00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.779
Dr Jameson: Hi.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.490
Nicki Cummings: Well,

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.360
Dr Jameson: I like your

4
00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.960
Dr Jameson: Your screen shot or whatever.

5
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.490
Nicki Cummings: Starts with the camera turned off. Sorry.

6
00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.720
Dr Jameson: I think that it might. I don't know. I mean, sometimes it starts automatically with people muted. So I'm not really sure.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.290
Nicki Cummings: My cameras always off. Oh, no.

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.790
Dr Jameson: No, no, it's fine. I'm okay. So did you end up getting medicine or

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.020
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.920
Okay, and

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.470
Nicki Cummings: I am coming off of my Xanax okay and

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.540
Nicki Cummings: Adderall.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.810
Nicki Cummings: And I also found out that impression

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.210
Nicki Cummings: But I think

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.780
Dr Jameson: Wow.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.320
Dr Jameson: Congratulations.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.840
Nicki Cummings: Oh, I think that might be all those combined is why I've

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.630
Nicki Cummings: Had you know cravings and yeah wanted more. Oh.

19
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.030
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so sorry. So you wanted to take the test.

20
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:30.030
Nicki Cummings: I took one, two days ago and I took another one yesterday. Okay, and you're done. I mean their fate line. But I mean, it'd be no line if I wasn't right.

21
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.980
Dr Jameson: No.

22
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.820
Nicki Cummings: Accounts.

23
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.070
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, you're on subjects anyway because we usually switch people over

24
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.990
Dr Jameson: Why are you coming off those other minutes

25
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.350
Nicki Cummings: Well, the Xanax, I wanted to get off of anyway. But now, since I'm pregnant. I'm not gonna be able to take

26
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.360
Nicki Cummings: I don't even

27
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.350
Nicki Cummings: Think anything

28
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.800
Nicki Cummings: Like my seizure medication. I don't think I could take that

29
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.120
Dr Jameson: Well, you'll have to call

30
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.810
Dr Jameson: Who

31
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.820
Nicki Cummings: Have you call them right

32
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.570
Okay.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.690
Dr Jameson: Well, you could still

34
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.250
Dr Jameson: Give them a call and just even for the heads up like is sure to be stopping something

35
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.540
Nicki Cummings: Right.

36
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.700
Dr Jameson: I'll just look up a motor gene for you anyway.

37
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.740
Again,

38
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
Dr Jameson: Okay, so how long, how long will go, do you think, when was your last period.

39
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.160
Nicki Cummings: I think it was January 24

40
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.070
Nicki Cummings: But I'm not 100%

41
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.160
Dr Jameson: OK, but so pretty.

42
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.870
Nicki Cummings: Early

43
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.430
Dr Jameson: Pretty early. Okay.

44
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.620
Nicki Cummings: It just be like,

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.980
Nicki Cummings: Four to six weeks, I think. Yeah.

46
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.960
Nicki Cummings: Which is probably why the line because they don't have that much.

47
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

48
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.600
Your

49
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.460
Nicki Cummings: Hormone

50
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.130
Dr Jameson: HCG

51
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.700
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, it says that

52
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:33.300
Dr Jameson: It crosses the human placenta can be measured in the plasma of exposed newborns an overall increase in the risk of four major congenital malformation has not been observed in available studies, however, an increased risk for cleft lip cleft palate has not been ruled out.

53
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.180
Nicki Cummings: Yeah, I'd rather

54
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.420
Dr Jameson: An increased risk of malformations may be associated with larger doses.

55
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.930
Dr Jameson: So,

56
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.580
Dr Jameson: You are

57
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.190
Dr Jameson: I don't think you're on a large dose.

58
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.980
Nicki Cummings: 200 milligrams a day.

59
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.950
Dr Jameson: I mean, the thing is is we don't want you just stop. I mean having a seizure, when you're pregnant is also very dangerous to a baby so

60
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.310
Dr Jameson: You know it's most important that you don't have a seizure, and then

61
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.580
Dr Jameson: Like sometimes we have to anyway the neurology you the OB and the neurologist.

62
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.940
Dr Jameson: And should work together to see

63
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.070
Dr Jameson: Up to 400 you say sorry, how much you take 200 a day.

64
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.570
Nicki Cummings: Today,

65
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.260
Yeah.

66
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.620
Dr Jameson: Maintenance is less than or equal to 400 for this is for bipolar. But still,

67
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.970
Dr Jameson: So you're not at the highest dose. Anyway, so that's good.

68
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.850
Dr Jameson: And then the Adderall. You started taking stopping that because you will these tests are you were doing it anyway.

69
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.790
Nicki Cummings: Because of these tests.

70
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.690
Dr Jameson: Are you still taking Tim as a Pam.

71
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.560
Nicki Cummings: I haven't taken it in a while though.

72
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.120
Dr Jameson: Those

73
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.640
Nicki Cummings: Are some I have some like if I can't

74
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.450
Nicki Cummings: Yes, firstly, if I can't, if I haven't slept in the wild. And I think I've been overly tired lately so

75
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.160
Dr Jameson: And then. So when's the last time you took, are you still taking some Santa. So you're completely. Oh.

76
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.210
Nicki Cummings: I'm I didn't really can't. I didn't. I haven't just stopped it. I'm still taking some but

77
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.800
Dr Jameson: Tapering

78
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.480
Nicki Cummings: So how many gave me a

79
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.100
Nicki Cummings: Wing down though.

80
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.140
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. I mean,

81
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.720
Yeah, you shouldn't stop someone

82
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.250
Nicki Cummings: Okay.

83
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.920
Dr Jameson: Alright, so you're down

84
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.400
Dr Jameson: And then do you still take to intelligence or is that

85
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.980
Nicki Cummings: Yeah, that's the antidepressant and I don't think that's a baby. There's

86
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.990
Dr Jameson: This newer so there's probably less information about it.

87
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.520
Nicki Cummings: Right every

88
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.610
Nicki Cummings: New drugs. So, yeah.

89
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.890
There's something specific.

90
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.750
Dr Jameson: There can be a withdrawal syndrome in the babies after they're born, if

91
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.130
Dr Jameson: Me for your on that's just a generic thing about NTT the serotonin drugs.

92
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.170
Dr Jameson: I mean,

93
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah we what they say. Now, certain drugs have like known and, you know, bad effects.

94
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.650
Dr Jameson: I don't think this is one of them. But again, it's it's newer

95
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:11.430
Dr Jameson: And the way that be, I was at a conference a couple years ago about psychiatric stuff. And this is what he was saying to which is what they kind of say in this little review thing I'm looking at

96
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:27.360
Dr Jameson: You kind of have to take it on a case to case basis because a woman who is profoundly depressed doesn't care for herself properly doesn't you know doesn't follow up appointments doesn't take their meds doesn't exercise doesn't

97
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.700
Dr Jameson: You know, potentially overuses or abuses substances and so it's not necessarily

98
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.010
Dr Jameson: Sometimes you have to just do the benefits and you know what I mean, it's a risk benefit.

99
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.910
Nicki Cummings: Pros and cons.

100
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:50.520
Dr Jameson: So, so, you know, it's not. Same thing with seizures, like, okay, we even when we know that it's not great for the baby or could cause harm.

101
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.050
Dr Jameson: If you have uncontrolled i don't know i don't think your seizure disorders as severe or somebody you know there's some women that have seven seizures a day.

102
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:11.700
Dr Jameson: Right, potentially, dropping the blood pressure and the oxygen levels and that's where we're going. You don't mean so we sometimes take we just have to take it on a case by case basis. So I wouldn't necessarily

103
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.480
Well,

104
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:23.340
Dr Jameson: You're doing a lot of changing things like stopping Xanax and dropping Adderall and I mean I guess I just, I don't know that I would

105
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:31.410
Dr Jameson: necessarily recommend you drop that to without at least a discussion with

106
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.190
Nicki Cummings: Know I called the neurologist, I left a message over the weekend.

107
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.080
Nicki Cummings: Oh, I just haven't heard back from him, but I do have an appointment Friday as well. So whether

108
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.730
Nicki Cummings: Or not, I'm

109
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:48.660
Dr Jameson: Are you going to be able to the same OB that you you have used in the past, or is this going to be a, I don't know if he's still live where

110
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:56.490
Nicki Cummings: I'm going to go to a new riverside is what I'm going to try to. Okay, have the best Nick, you

111
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.530
Nicki Cummings: Have anything were to happen.

112
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.950
Dr Jameson: That's fine. I just, okay, so it's not going to be like somebody that already knows you and has kind of gone through these

113
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.510
Dr Jameson: Same conversations before. Okay.

114
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.550
Dr Jameson: Because that would probably be the other thing is to get in.

115
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:27.120
Dr Jameson: As soon as they can will take you, because sometimes they don't want to see you instantly but you know that you have concerns about some medications. You've been taking any would like a discussion about, you know, medication safety during beginning stages of your pregnancy.

116
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.470
Dr Jameson: And see if you can get in, get in with the OB or their nurse or something, just to kind of do a little bit of

117
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.360
Dr Jameson: Review

118
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.960
Dr Jameson: And then do you have prenatal vitamins.

119
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.860
Nicki Cummings: No, but another thing I went

120
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.400
Nicki Cummings: On. Well, are you a lot because I

121
00:09:47.460 --> 00:10:00.420
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I can't. I mean, they're also I'll tell you when I was pregnant I my personal my doctor wrote me a prescription for the you know prescription prenatal vitamins and they were like,

122
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.620
Dr Jameson: I don't know 30 bucks or something for the month.

123
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.570
Dr Jameson: And I thought, jeez, really, is there a generic, like, no, that is a generic. So anyway, just that I was just like, that seems silly. So anyway, I just asked the

124
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:22.620
Dr Jameson: doctor about it. She's like, Yeah, they're expensive. She said, or you could take the over the counter ones which have this exact same stuff and I'm so that's what I did. Just because they were cheaper.

125
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.140
Dr Jameson: But anyway, but yeah, I can send the an initial prescription for that anyway.

126
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:31.530
Nicki Cummings: Yeah.

127
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:39.180
Dr Jameson: Alright, so, um, so the pharmacist was willing to dispense because I know they were they were giving us a hard time

128
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.530
Dr Jameson: It was so early. Okay.

129
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:53.760
Dr Jameson: And I mean I can't blame them. So what and I just wanted to chat with you in general because I just I know stuff happens. And I'm not necessarily I'm not like

130
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.860
Dr Jameson: It's not a problem necessarily the only thing here that I'm not super psyched about is that it was like, so after the fact that you

131
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:11.670
Dr Jameson: Like I would have preferred if you could have told me a week ago that you were doing all this and that your cravings were happening or that you mentioned that a group or something because

132
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.190
Dr Jameson: You know, when it happens and it's already done and now we're completely out of medicine, it just

133
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.440
Dr Jameson: It's a, it's just

134
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.810
Dr Jameson: We just need

135
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.900
Dr Jameson: More clarification about it so that we can

136
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.840
Dr Jameson: Be on the front end of what's going on because I mean that was

137
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:39.000
Dr Jameson: Quite a bit early. Right. I mean, you should have had enough medicine through tomorrow and you were out last week, so

138
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:48.750
Dr Jameson: Was it anxiety that you were having or it was more trying to find prenatal vitamins. I'm having a hard time that works.

139
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.890
Nicki Cummings: It and I'm

140
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:54.780
I don't

141
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.690
Nicki Cummings: Irritability

142
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.700
Nicki Cummings: And like a date on Facebook and these are people I know that did us, you know, and I don't know.

143
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.320
Dr Jameson: What. Say that again.

144
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:26.910
Nicki Cummings: I said I got you know I got on Facebook and then like I'll see posts from people that I know what they're doing. And then, you know, like, just stop there gone through my mind like if I hung out with them and you know

145
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.730
Using

146
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.640
Yeah.

147
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.020
Dr Jameson: So I guess you don't have a marina.

148
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.790
Nicki Cummings: Know, when did that come out.

149
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.760
I'm

150
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.250
Nicki Cummings: December.

151
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.230
Dr Jameson: Well, I guess it doesn't matter because you were on the Sunday text anyway. Oh.

152
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.820
Nicki Cummings: That was quick to. Yeah, I know.

153
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:08.460
Nicki Cummings: Last time, he was. It was like three years, but because I was my 20s, that I wanted to get pregnant. I thought I was a good man and he begged and begged begged for years.

154
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:23.370
Nicki Cummings: And other kids violin. I want to find out, like, No, I'm fine. Like, I don't want to do on myself again. But he begged to beg beg. I finally great like okay. No, I got my first be sold out and like I just didn't get pregnant. And I was like,

155
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.310
Nicki Cummings: Okay, and then like at the most awful time if you like I

156
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.780
Nicki Cummings: Like my apartment is just tore down I lost everything. I'm like,

157
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.770
Nicki Cummings: Awesome, now I'm having to

158
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.380
Dr Jameson: Okay, but now

159
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.410
Dr Jameson: Is who's, who's the dead.

160
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.030
Brandon

161
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.950
Nicki Cummings: Okay, he's like my support system. The only person.

162
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.660
Dr Jameson: Okay. I mean, is he does he know about the pregnancy.

163
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.830
Nicki Cummings: Yeah, okay. Is he coming to pick me up in a couple hours. Is he happy or

164
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.120
Nicki Cummings: I mean, I think he's kind of nervous. He doesn't have any biological zone so

165
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:33.390
Nicki Cummings: And then he said, Well, I will leave it in the documentation from a doctor. I was like, yeah, because

166
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:35.790
Nicki Cummings: Okay, okay.

167
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.280
Yeah.

168
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.800
Nicki Cummings: Well, like you'll get that I don't know when. But someone will give it to me.

169
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.450
Nicki Cummings: Yeah yeah

170
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.120
Dr Jameson: I mean the over the counter ones are

171
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.340
Pretty accurate. So

172
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.930
Nicki Cummings: Right, I was like, Why do you think they thumb at Kroger's like forget it. I didn't get them from Spencer I got them from

173
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.000
Dr Jameson: Okay, so at this point.

174
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.020
Dr Jameson: How are your cravings and anxiety and all that.

175
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.960
Nicki Cummings: Oh, I'm good right now.

176
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.740
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I sent the prescription for back to, to a day, which is what was, what was your dough. So is that

177
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.870
Dr Jameson: Working or

178
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:45.750
Nicki Cummings: I would come to initially asked you if I could go to and a half day, but I know the insurance thing would be an issue. And then it probably wouldn't be a good idea or more. I'm pregnant. Like should I be going down or

179
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.890
Dr Jameson: No, I don't think that necessarily, I mean, the goal is

180
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.890
Dr Jameson: To keep you in recovery.

181
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.030
Dr Jameson: So I think

182
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.990
Dr Jameson: Clearly, there are also other

183
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.300
Dr Jameson: Ways to manage anxiety and, you know, besides just taking more Suboxone

184
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.560
Dr Jameson: So,

185
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:22.740
Dr Jameson: I mean, that's the other thing is working on things, you know, stress relief and how to how to handle anxiety and

186
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.750
Dr Jameson: Whether that's

187
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.980
Dr Jameson: Meaning counselor more often or

188
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:38.910
Dr Jameson: Doing meditation or exercise or, you know, working. Anyway, working on those kinds of issues.

189
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.090
Dr Jameson: So I think that it all works. You know, it all comes together. It's not just one thing.

190
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.800
Nicki Cummings: I'm tomorrow I have sorry I don't

191
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:57.240
Nicki Cummings: Know, I haven't seen it, it's called the main place they're like a behavioral health type place.

192
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.180
Nicki Cummings: So obviously a co worker there.

193
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.340
Nicki Cummings: Okay, so I'm kind of like our

194
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.440

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.460
Dr Jameson: And have you ever looked, I know we were always a broken record about this.

207
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.370
Dr Jameson: Insight timer. But do you have you tried that meditation, that kind of stuff at all.

208
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.730
No.

209
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.360
Would you

210
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:07.380
Dr Jameson: Think you think there's any way you could find 20 minutes to download that. Have you downloaded it even

211
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:18.120
Nicki Cummings: Though I looked over it, right, like the phone I have right now it's like okay crap trying to get a new one. I'm going through

212
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.070
Dr Jameson: Are there. I mean, there are other

213
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.870
Nicki Cummings: There's website I downloaded that

214
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.830
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it doesn't have to be. I guess I

215
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.190
Dr Jameson: I would, I guess. Do you have a computer to or no.

216
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:31.680
Nicki Cummings: No.

217
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.330
Well,

218
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.310
Dr Jameson: But

219
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:38.910
Nicki Cummings: Yeah.

220
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.330
Dr Jameson: I mean, I

221
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:48.780
Dr Jameson: There's got to figure it out. Yeah. There's gotta be some other sort of I don't you can Google meditation or borrow phone or

222
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.210
Dr Jameson: Take a CD out of the library.

223
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:52.890
Nicki Cummings: Try yoga.

224
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I think, I think that's the thing is to still

225
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:07.590
Dr Jameson: Push yourself sometimes a little bit beyond what seems comfortable. I mean, in a good way to try learning new things, you know, maybe you might

226
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.700
Dr Jameson: We all can

227
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:14.040
Dr Jameson: Benefit from from, you know, exploring other avenues and I think

228
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.800
Dr Jameson: You know deep breathing is it's sounds hokey to some people, but actually there are

229
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.850
Nicki Cummings: Measurable

230
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:30.390
Dr Jameson: When you work. Yeah. And when you expand your belly with the diet for matic breathing. It actually compresses the nerve endings inside your

231
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:39.360
Dr Jameson: Being a cave and aorta, which help stimulate those nerve endings which relaxes you. So

232
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.990
Nicki Cummings: Like there are

233
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.910
Dr Jameson: There's actually a when I do it.

234
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.350
Nicki Cummings: Right, so, so I think I can feel like my hair down to my nose. Yeah.

235
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.500
Dr Jameson: So everything good yeah no I mean it and you know yoga has been you know that

236
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.480
Dr Jameson: whoever they are.

237
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:06.210
Dr Jameson: In India that I've been doing it. I mean, it's like Chinese medicine. We just because we don't understand how it works, doesn't mean it doesn't work. We just don't

238
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:13.200
Dr Jameson: Understand it but they enter this stuff doesn't come out of, out of nowhere for no reason. You know what I mean, like, people have

239
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.310
Dr Jameson: Been finding benefits from

240
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.090
Dr Jameson: Yoga for centuries and millennia, so

241
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:34.110
Dr Jameson: Just keep on working with with looking at those kinds of things, too. So when you feel anxious, which is understandable, your, your, you know, medications are changing. You've got hormones and now a whole prospect of

242
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.860
Dr Jameson: That's a lot to to, you know, kind of adjust to. So, no, no.

243
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:52.680
Dr Jameson: That's, that's not necessarily an unexpected but just don't. Don't forget that besides taking more Suboxone or 70 texts. There are other things that can help.

244
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.210
Nicki Cummings: Right.

245
00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:09.030
Dr Jameson: And our goal is over time to help you develop such strong, you know that that becomes your automatic eventually you know that we've changed this equation from taking my medicine or using or whatever to

246
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.960
Dr Jameson: singing a song or going for a walk or calling a friend or you know whatever your usual

247
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.080
Dr Jameson: You know, you become kind of a you kind of have a new toolkit basically

248
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:30.630
Dr Jameson: OK, so I'll be interested to hear how your appointment goes tomorrow with the local place.

249

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:07.530
Dr Jameson: As far as medication goes. I mean, I can write it for two and a half. I don't know what will happen if you want to stick with two. What do you want to do.

268
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.780
Are you there.

269
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.440

Okay.

271
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:31.800

274
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.240
Dr Jameson: I mean, that should be a big weight off your shoulders right there too.

275
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.780
Dr Jameson: And then

276
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:56.640
Dr Jameson: Maybe when you're at the visit tomorrow. You can ask them if they have any resources for meditation and

277
00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.410
Dr Jameson: Maybe they have a book or they have a tape or something they can give you

278
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.080
Dr Jameson: Know that doesn't require

279
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.120
Dr Jameson: A computer

280
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:18.510
Dr Jameson: I'm sure there are plenty of books. I just don't know necessarily at the top of my head. But that's the kind of stuff that the counselor sometimes have good information about

281
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.910
Dr Jameson: But going for a walk is good and do what about do um

282
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:31.260
Dr Jameson: I don't know. Do any music or art or any, any other sort of hobbies that you've had in the past.

283
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:38.370
Nicki Cummings: Um, I like music. Sometimes it can have the opposite effect so

284
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.830
Dr Jameson: No, I guess it depends on the kind of do you play music are you listening to music.

288
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.970

289
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.170
Dr Jameson: You can sing by yourself if you're really that worried about

290

292
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:40.980
Dr Jameson: Maybe, maybe, maybe you'll have more more options here. Get your vision, your eyes. Close your eyes in

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:28.440
Dr Jameson: Okay, well I send a week supply on the two day you have group tomorrow right and then

303
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:41.220
Dr Jameson: We'll kind of just see how that goes. And if you want. Since we're doing a prayer off that soon anyway. We can also try increasing the dose, but I have a feeling

304
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:50.040
Dr Jameson: I have. It's okay if you if you do want more or anymore. It's okay. But I think sometimes it's more just kind of

305
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.300
Dr Jameson: Dealing mind over matter. Yeah, but like

306
00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:09.600
Dr Jameson: Making sure you're using all of your resources and and reminding yourself. There are other other avenues and you know you you you have a lot of grit and you look, look what you just finally got worked out with your contacts and

307
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:19.800
Dr Jameson: I know anyway. See how it goes. But it you know if it's really if you still can't stop thinking about it and it sounds like here.

308
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.070
Nicki Cummings: What's the term we use

309
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.550
Nicki Cummings: What's all that buzzing. I'm sorry, a phone call came in.

310
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.300
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay.

311
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.200
Dr Jameson: She's like your phones turn explode.

312
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.730
Dr Jameson: Um,

313
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:57.210
Dr Jameson: Oh, there's a there's a term for when we're kind of like, thinking back to the days of using in a in a nostalgic way, like, you know, as if that would, you know, gosh, I wish I could go back to that which is kind of delusional right like that wasn't really so great right so

314
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.710
Dr Jameson: You know, trying to make sure you counter any of those

315
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.330
Dr Jameson: Memories, you know, memorializing sort of

316
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:15.510
Dr Jameson: Thoughts with the reality of really what else goes on when you're in that world, you know,

317
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.760
Dr Jameson: Just make sure you're, you know, not fantasizing about it in

318
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.460
Dr Jameson: In appropriately positive way. Right. It was not also great.

319
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.570
Dr Jameson: Okay.

320
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.090
Dr Jameson: So I'm gonna let you go unless you have any other questions for me.

321
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.420
Nicki Cummings: No, um,

322
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.480
Nicki Cummings: Were you able to find a needle.

323
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:52.710
Dr Jameson: I sent I sent one I just kind of randomly chose one. I said okay to substitute, so I don't know whether it'll be in the plan or what I mean.

324
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.870
Dr Jameson: Like I said, worst case scenario. I don't know. You can check but

325
00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.880
Nicki Cummings: How much they cost, but

326
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.540
Dr Jameson: Over the counter over the counter ones are perfectly reasonable to I think so.

327
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:20.700
Dr Jameson: But that's another thing, you know, a call to the OB office. Hey, I need prenatal vitamins and I want to review my med list if I know you already, so I guess you said you left and left a message, but

328
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:32.520
Dr Jameson: Yeah that should be something that nurse can do easily enough anyway. And they'll know which brand is or which version is the approved one in your area.

329
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.840
Nicki Cummings: Right, okay.

330
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.000
Nicki Cummings: Um,

331
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.420
Dr Jameson: Any knowledge or anything. You feeling okay that way.

332
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.760
Nicki Cummings: I've had some knowledge that I actually you wrote me a prescription for the

333
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.290
Dr Jameson: On

334
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.750
Nicki Cummings: Gas and stronger when I heard

335
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.770
Nicki Cummings: On dance.

336
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.350
Nicki Cummings: I actually got out of Brazil. So, is that okay while you're checking

337
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:13.710
Dr Jameson: It depends who you ask for you. We've used it historically. I think it's okay. But there was one study that came out, suggesting raising a question of whether it was associated with cleft palate or something.

338
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.560
Nicki Cummings: Oh my gosh.

339
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:19.980
Dr Jameson: I don't know.

340
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:28.950
Dr Jameson: I don't know. But usually I asked people to get the okay from their Ob because some of them say yes. Some of them say no.

341
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.520
Nicki Cummings: I always before they gave me productivity, but

342
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.200
I know

343
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.020
Nicki Cummings: Like once they know you were an addict. They don't want to give you from

344
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.180
Dr Jameson: Mm hmm. I don't know.

345
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:54.360
Nicki Cummings: I don't know, it never got me. Hi. I don't know what the thing with it is so. Mm hmm.

346
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.370
Dr Jameson: Have you been muted.

347
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.660
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I know. Can we have been using Clonidine or any of the other

348
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:02.700
Dr Jameson: Things recently.

349
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.300
Dr Jameson: I guess I would have brought one

350
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:14.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I would. So I'm going to inoculate that one into I guess I would, you know, in general, it's usually, you know, we get all paranoid, um,

351
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:24.480
Dr Jameson: I would just try to run everything by that will be possible and get the okay before you continue, other than I mean don't stop doing seizure medicine without talking to

352
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.040
Nicki Cummings: Anybody but right

353
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.300
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then are you completely off the Adderall, then

354
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.210

360
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:18.660

387
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:05.550
Dr Jameson: Come to find out you've been having a lot of cravings and anxiety and

388
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.340
Dr Jameson: Probably partly related to her ongoing taper of Xanax

389
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:23.010
Dr Jameson: She'd also stopped her Adderall, which she now today tells me it's because she took pregnancy test.

390
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:31.140
Dr Jameson: Late last week, which was positive. So she's trying to cut back on anything that wasn't essential

391
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:42.360
Dr Jameson: We did call in an early refill for her, which she was ultimately able to pick up all of the pharmacy was initially

392
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:54.420
Dr Jameson: Reluctant due to how early. She was I canceled their refill on the previous prescription. However, so. She'll. She'll be to for medicine, now she has an appointment with her neurologist. This

393
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:01.980
Dr Jameson: Friday to discuss her seizure meds. She's need to put a call in

394
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.510
Dr Jameson: To OBO office. She does not have prenatal vitamins.

395
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:19.620
Dr Jameson: Father of this baby is her friend Brandon has been like a support for for some time. He sounds a little. It sounds like he's a little bit

396
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.680
Dr Jameson: Wary of this idea

397
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.950
Dr Jameson: He doesn't have any other kids of his own.

398
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.000
Dr Jameson: She's excited mile nonja

399
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:42.120
Dr Jameson: On a positive note. She recently got word that she is going to get her contacts covered by her insurance, which is just

400
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:50.430
Dr Jameson: fantastic news mental status physical normal UD severe, number one. Number two, pregnancy state.

401

Dr Jameson: We talked about additional stress relief man anxiety management techniques. She has an appointment locally with a social worker of some sort, tomorrow and an appointment scheduled with Maggie for later this week she has group tomorrow.

403
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:27.450
Dr Jameson: We reviewed some of her other medications as far as pregnancy goes, ultimately, the best approach is to get okay discuss with our OB.

404
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:43.800
Dr Jameson: But certainly in the case of a seizure disorder. It's not a good idea to stop procedure meds until without the discussion with her neurologist and the motor gene does not seem to have certain certainly definitive terada genetic effects from my

405
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:45.990

475
00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.350
Dr Jameson: Was if you weren't on buprenorphine. Do you think you would have paid

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:47.670
Dr Jameson: Good. Okay.

481
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.560

543
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:35.820
Back.

545
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.100
Dr Jameson: I'm

546
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.590
Dr Jameson: Hoping that since you were 11. That's right.

547
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:41.400
That's right.

548
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.640
Dr Jameson: And well, just curious, how come you're cutting back

549
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:59.700
iPhone: And I just feel like it's just time like I get home after 1012 hour day, and I gotta go to bed kind of shortly after time thing. Not really a personal decision.

550
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.340
Dr Jameson: Then you sleep fine without

551
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.140
Dr Jameson: Something so much

552
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.730
iPhone: Yeah yeah

553
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.160
Dr Jameson: Okay i mean i'm i'm

554
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:15.120
Dr Jameson: All for you, cutting giving it up. Believe me, I'm just trying to get a sense of why you were using it, and what's you know

555
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.320
iPhone: How about I guess I was just using that as a replacement

556
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.400
iPhone: And this option actually helped me come back, believe it or not.

557
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.760
Dr Jameson: I do believe it. I think there's a

558
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.760
Dr Jameson: While there's a lot we do and don't understand

559
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.240
Dr Jameson: About which reset and I think different people are wired different ways and

560
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:35.370
iPhone: So,

561
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:44.340
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I mean I listen smoking anything is bad for you. So I'm you know your your lungs will be

562
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.420
Better for right

563
00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:50.460
There, you know,

564
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:52.740
iPhone: We don't have to get

565
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.520
Dr Jameson: And then you're

566
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.260
iPhone: Less. I don't think we have to

567
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.990
Dr Jameson: Do all your labs again to be

568
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.140
iPhone: Glad to know. They told me I didn't have to. Okay.

569
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.890
Dr Jameson: Oh yeah, these are all they have a whole new order in there.

570
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.210
Dr Jameson: But you did do the blood work. Did you never do your homework.

571
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.750
I did.

572
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:15.750
What does it say

573
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.070
System. I don't know. They're in here, but it still says pending.

574
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.680
Looking back,

575
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.550
Dr Jameson: Was it always pills for you or did you

576
00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.450
iPhone: Yes. Okay.

577
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.490
Dr Jameson: And was it um

578
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:51.630
Dr Jameson: Anxiety, like what was, what do you think drew you to them in the first place, or was it just pain and then you got stuck on him.

579
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.880
iPhone: Knows probably anxiety.

580
00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:02.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there's usually more than one reasons. Yeah, yeah, pain, but then, oh, it also makes me

581
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:05.850
Mm hmm.

582
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:17.460
Dr Jameson: So interesting, right, because some people. It makes them. Most people have many people get sleepy when they take them and then some people say that. So I think, again, we don't know what we don't know about how that

583
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.700
Dr Jameson: how that all works.

584
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.020
Dr Jameson: Okay.

585
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.320
Dr Jameson: So anxiety lately.

586
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.570
iPhone: Right now it's off the charts or

587
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:28.500
Dr Jameson: Is it

588
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.620
Dr Jameson: Do you think cuz you're well

589
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:39.450
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay. Sorry, I was just gonna say, Well, okay. Well, when we were taking the taking the buprenorphine it. How was your anxiety.

590
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.290
iPhone: The last week. It's been kind of bad because I keep it down to the third.

591
00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:47.670
iPhone: Yeah, but other than that it is amazing. Yeah, okay.

592
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.170
Dr Jameson: So, so the

593
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.530
Dr Jameson: Morphine still seems to

594
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:58.560
iPhone: Work for that. Yeah. My goal today was hopefully to get a prescription and get back in, just like normal.

595
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.210
iPhone: Yeah.

596
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:00.750
Dr Jameson: That's fine.

597
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:05.400
Dr Jameson: I just wanted to sort of touch base on for me, I think, you know, yes, there's the

598
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.870
Dr Jameson: We can satisfy the receptors in your brain, so that you don't have the

599
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:17.670
Dr Jameson: Physical withdrawal and that's what the Suboxone is so good at. I personally just think we need to be holistic about, you know,

600
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.800
Dr Jameson: long term success we should

601
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.970
Dr Jameson: probably also be

602
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:26.340
Dr Jameson: Also be thinking about what other things.

603
00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.340
iPhone: Absolutely. If we can set up.

604
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.120
iPhone: To talk about a taper off program, I would be totally

605
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:39.270
Dr Jameson: Sure. I was just talking about sort of the other like did you do individual counseling.

606
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.760
iPhone: No, not really. Okay.

607
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.150
Dr Jameson: Because I think that's usually also helpful.

608
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:53.460

Dr Jameson: Well, it's a history and physical, but the patient is rejoining our program very shortly after

659

Dr Jameson: Seven months but due to a change in his job and loss of benefits. He was

660
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:23.490
Dr Jameson: Uncomfortable with the prospect of an undetermined length of time being achievement as a self pay patient he since gotten a new job that has benefits which will be kicking in at some sort of known date in the future. And he has been struggling with

694
00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:51.930
Dr Jameson: I'm not entirely certain whether the plan was for the patient to easing Jaden with Dr. Waters or switch to me. So I'm gonna follow up with our staff about that.

695
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:59.250
Dr Jameson: His work schedule necessitates groups that occur after 4pm

696
00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:12.120

722
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:28.290
Dr Jameson: Which they kind of over scheduled me anyway. But we're usually supposed to have an hour for these visits, so I'll do as much as I can. Today, but I don't know that we'll be able to finish the whole thing.

723
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.090
Dr Jameson: Right here, just

724
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:40.320
Dr Jameson: But we can at least get started. Um, so the purpose of this visit, maybe, I don't know if you know, but it's to kind of like review your medical history in general and just

725
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:41.700
Dr Jameson: Make sure this seems like

726
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.860
Dr Jameson: You're a good candidate for our program and talk about medicine and that sort of stuff.

727
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.480
Dr Jameson: So tell me, are you have you been in treatment. Previously, or is this your first

728
01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:59.100

729
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:07.770
Brittany Dingess: I started out on Suboxone back in 2015

730
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:14.460
Brittany Dingess: I had a methadone clinic. And then I started to see a private doctor

731
01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.770
Brittany Dingess: And they transition major sub located

732
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.130
Brittany Dingess: Okay, we, I feel like doesn't work as well. I have a lot of cravings.

733
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:27.510
And

734
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:38.040
Brittany Dingess: I've discussed it with them, you know, to try to switch me back to this, the boxing because I was on him for Sarah, you know, I was on it until

735
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:52.260
Brittany Dingess: Up until April of last year's and almost four years and it worked really well. And when they switched me to the sub located, I noticed

736
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.020
Brittany Dingess: A pretty

737
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.850
Brittany Dingess: pretty distinct difference and

738
01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:13.350
Brittany Dingess: I'm like, how will the medicine work and everything and I my doctor that has me on the sub located won't switch me back to the Suboxone

739
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:15.870
Brittany Dingess: Okay.

740
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.580
Dr Jameson: Why don't

741
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:35.970
Brittany Dingess: They, they didn't really tell me why I mean I'm just going to win them over and over about, you know, I feel like medicine those workers will and everything. And they tell me that since I'm not having like you know like a life threatening reaction or like an allergy to it. They don't want

742
01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:38.730
Brittany Dingess: Me back. Okay.

743
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.920
Dr Jameson: So, do you know what your dose. What was your dose. I'm sure you do know what your dose Suboxone was before.

744
01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:50.460
Brittany Dingess: And eight milligrams once a day, I was on the same dose room.

745
01:05:52.620 --> 01:06:00.060
Brittany Dingess: Like I'm February 2016 all the way up until April of last year.

746
01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.660
Dr Jameson: So was at one a day or two a day.

747
01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.400
Dr Jameson: To day it was it the Suboxone or the Butte the sappy checks.

748
01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.320
Suboxone

749
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:19.080
Dr Jameson: And then how, when was the let's even getting the month. That's every month. I, I believe. Correct. I haven't used it myself.

750
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:20.760
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

751
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.310
Dr Jameson: When did you see been doing that monthly since April. Is that right,

752
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.180
Yes.

753
01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:32.100
Dr Jameson: And then I think there's different doses on that too.

754
01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:43.920
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, they the first two doses are 300 milligrams and then the then it's 100 milligrams. The issue is that

755
01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:51.330
Brittany Dingess: You're supposed to get the shot every 28 days, but it doesn't break down in 28 day

756
01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:58.800
Brittany Dingess: Gradual months and months to break down and I had my thyroid. I think part of the problem is that

757
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:16.830
Brittany Dingess: I had my thyroid removed in 2017 and so I've asked you know maybe it's not metabolize properly and I'm on live with the rocks and but my thyroid hormones are still kind of high so

758
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:26.970
Brittany Dingess: And they can't have concur with me that that might be an issue, but they don't still don't want to switch me back so

759
01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:27.780
Mm hmm.

760
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:40.170
Dr Jameson: But they didn't try increasing your did it work better at the beginning or never really worked.

761
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:41.760
Brittany Dingess: Um,

762
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:42.930
Dr Jameson: The shot. I mean,

763
01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:51.210
Brittany Dingess: The first shot work for, like, a couple of weeks.

764
01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:58.710
Brittany Dingess: And then it was it's and it kind of does the same thing every time I get it.

765
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:11.100
Brittany Dingess: I'll start to have withdrawal symptoms after a couple of weeks, like, you know, like the medicine, just not getting into my body like it should.

766
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:16.020
Dr Jameson: work well for them. The level doesn't stay up high enough. Yeah.

767
01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.850
Dr Jameson: So you feel better for a couple weeks after the shot and then you start feeling withdrawals again.

768
01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:27.030
Brittany Dingess: I mean it. Yeah, first I would feel better for a couple weeks and now

769
01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:36.420
Brittany Dingess: It just, I mean it just constantly fluctuate. You know, like a few days I feel okay and in a few days. I'll feel horrible and

770
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.120
Brittany Dingess: So inconsistent.

771
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.310
Dr Jameson: Weird and I have only had one other patient come to us who

772
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:55.320
Dr Jameson: sort of vaguely similar anyway that she didn't she'd been on spots on the game or the shot and didn't really work and they tried. I think they upped her dose to

773
01:08:56.250 --> 01:09:11.370
Dr Jameson: I don't know, just didn't seem to do the same thing. And so we put her back on Suboxone and then she felt fine and then a couple weeks later. Suddenly she didn't feel fine anymore and I really was probably because it's a blockade had finally all washed out and

774
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:15.300
Dr Jameson: We had to kind of pick up the dose little bit further, but

775
01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.250
Dr Jameson: It seems like

776
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:23.310
Dr Jameson: Sounds to me like it would have been nice for them to try upping your dose because

777
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:34.440
Dr Jameson: You start with a 300 and then you start need after the two months, like you said, I was just looking at it because I forgot myself. But anyway, these usually 100 A MONTH, BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED.

778
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:36.180
Dr Jameson: More than that.

779
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.470
Brittany Dingess: So I don't know.

780
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:38.970
Dr Jameson: Anyway, um,

781
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.560
Dr Jameson: Okay, so the last time you had a shot was when

782
01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.010
Brittany Dingess: This

783
01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.940
Brittany Dingess: Coming up on three weeks ago.

784
01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:01.230
Dr Jameson: And then tell me what your withdrawal symptoms are like, I think he said hot and cold for that reason.

785
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.510
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I'll have

786
01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:31.590
Brittany Dingess: Like he yeah I'll get really flushed and then optimal have cold sweats and really bad anxiety horrible anxiety and it's got no I mean I have I have anxiety issues. Anyway, and it's gotten significantly worse since I started the symbol Cade and I'm like stomach cramps and nausea and

787
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:42.780
Brittany Dingess: Body. I mean, it's just not always all of those things. But, you know, just the kind of general array. Okay.

788
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:44.400
Dr Jameson: I'm

789
01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.980
Brittany Dingess: Just kind of come and go. Yeah.

790
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:49.410
Dr Jameson: So okay, so you take

791
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.870
Dr Jameson: The box. Oh, did you say

792
01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:56.340
Brittany Dingess: Live with the Roxanne yeah and then

793
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.890
Dr Jameson: And they're still adjusting your dose. It sounds like

794
01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.210
Yeah.

795
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.190
Brittany Dingess: I've had it.

796
01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:03.690
Dr Jameson: You

797
01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:07.770
Brittany Dingess: Don't end up too high. They don't be too low and then just

798
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.260
Brittany Dingess: had a hard time getting it kind of in the right spot.

799
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.060
Dr Jameson: What your doses right now.

800
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:16.440
And

801
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.260
Brittany Dingess: I just recently.

802
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:27.690
Brittany Dingess: Added changed is that I'll take like I was on 125 micrograms every day.

803
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:45.990
Brittany Dingess: I'll take it for like a three or four days in a row, and then I'll that will start to make me really see and I'll just feel hot all the time. And like I won't be able to sleep. And so they lowered it to 25 micrograms every other day.

804
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.690
Brittany Dingess: Just to start off to try to get it really slowly built a

805
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:56.250
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you are overactive, it sounds like

806
01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:05.340
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I was. I had graves disease that developed really quickly like at the end of 2016

807
01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.550
Brittany Dingess: Early 2017 and gotten so bad that it was affecting

808
01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:29.700
Brittany Dingess: My heart like if I was standing at work. I you know I would shake and sweat and throw up all the time. It was horrible. And so they put me on medicine to try to slow it down and that didn't work. And then they they took it out.

809
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.670
Dr Jameson: And now we have to replace

810
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:39.990
Dr Jameson: And then are you on any other medications. So it's the level three Roxanne

811
01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.740
Brittany Dingess: I am on lyrica

812
01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.680
Brittany Dingess: Beauty bar.

813
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.460
Brittany Dingess: Blue Box a main

814
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:57.600
Dr Jameson: Hold on. Sorry, this computer thing. Super. So, you know, therapeutic doses.

815
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:01.530
Brittany Dingess: It's 100 milligrams four times a day.

816
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:05.130
Right. It's like every single thing I do is we'll

817
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:10.200
Dr Jameson: Be okay and then what do you take that for the Lyrica

818
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:16.500
Brittany Dingess: And neuropathy was in a car accident when I was a teenager.

819
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:24.150
Brittany Dingess: So I had a lot of numbness and tingling in my upper extremities. Okay.

820
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.400
Dr Jameson: Did you have an injury to your neck or

821
01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:33.870
Brittany Dingess: I did I actually just back in November finally had a spinal fusion to try to correct

822
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:43.980
Brittany Dingess: Some of the issues which it helps some of the problems and then it may where things were compressed for so long. It made some of the issues worse.

823
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:53.070
Brittany Dingess: I mean my hands and you know my fingers don't go numb. But now I'm having issues a power up like a bit my shoulders, but

824
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.040
Brittany Dingess: They tell me that it's normal.

825
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:58.680
Dr Jameson: Well, things make

826
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:06.600
Dr Jameson: Things may continue to gradually heal because, yeah, it's an adjustment so. Okay, so then you're on boost bar, you know, the dose on that off here.

827
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.650
Brittany Dingess: 10 milligrams three times a day.

828
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:12.120
Dr Jameson: That's for anxiety.

829
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.640
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then you have another one you started a blue a blue box. I think

830
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.050
Brittany Dingess: Yes, the blue box domain and it is

831
01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:28.290
Brittany Dingess: 50 milligrams in the morning and 100 milligrams at night.

832
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:30.270
Brittany Dingess: Okay.

833
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:33.930
Dr Jameson: And that's also for the anxiety or depression to

834
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:40.260
Brittany Dingess: Mostly. Mostly anxiety but depression, a little bit too.

835
01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.450
Dr Jameson: He said 15 in the morning and 100 at night night.

836
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:49.830
Dr Jameson: Okay, and anything else.

837
01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.770
Brittany Dingess: Depot, prepare, just for birth control.

838
01:14:56.010 --> 01:15:00.570
Dr Jameson: Panel that answered the other question I was going to ask you, are you on anything for birth control.

839
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.020
Dr Jameson: Anything else, or is that the end of it.

840
01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:10.260
Brittany Dingess: I believe I believe it. Okay.

841
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.450
Dr Jameson: Okay. Are you allergic to any medication that you know about

842
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:19.920
Bathroom

843
01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:27.600
Anything else that you

844
01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.190
Brittany Dingess: Know,

845
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:41.370
Dr Jameson: Which is the same thing with spectrum.

846
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:43.620
Okay.

847
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:48.930
Dr Jameson: And let's see. So

848
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:56.130
Dr Jameson: You kind of already mentioned you've been on the Suboxone since 2014 I think

849
01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.350
Brittany Dingess: It was the end of 2000

850
01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:07.740
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, actually I don't want to say, I think it was the end of 2014 when I started on it.

851
01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:15.390
Dr Jameson: Oh, you said you were at a method of how long were you on. Did you take methadone or you went to the Methadone clinic and they did.

852
01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:24.210
Brittany Dingess: I never did the Methadone they well they actually wasn't actually Suboxone it was Serbia takes is what they put me on but

853
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:42.240
Brittany Dingess: They just increase, they just kept wanting to increase my dose to like they were going to put me up to 32 milligrams a day and you know I wanted to kind of go to get out. I didn't want to go up for, for sure. So

854
01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:55.110
Brittany Dingess: And plus, I mean it's just super expensive and really far away. The closest clinic is in Chattanooga, which at the time from where I live. It was like an hour and 10 minutes each way.

855
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:57.450
Yeah.

856
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:09.270
Dr Jameson: Sorry, my next patient just checked in.

857
01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:13.290
Dr Jameson: Okay.

858
01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:23.610
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, we had had some issues getting connected with them to check in for my one

859
01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:27.480
Dr Jameson: Did you have to wait. You mean

860
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:34.410
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I mean I like I went to the waiting room and I could see them, but I couldn't hear them.

861
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:38.040
Brittany Dingess: On music and they had no idea where the music was

862
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:38.850
Brittany Dingess: Coming from

863
01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:39.630
One second.

864
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:01.560
Dr Jameson: Alright, so

865
01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:07.110
Dr Jameson: Um, let's see. I think what

866
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:13.050
Dr Jameson: All right, what are you working these days. What, what's your schedule like

867
01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:18.690
Brittany Dingess: I am I just went back from my surgery. I work in a factory. Okay.

868
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.610
Dr Jameson: Are you working today or

869
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.400
Brittany Dingess: I work third shift. So I'm I mean I'm supposed to go in it, tend to not

870
01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:27.600
Okay.

871
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.170
Dr Jameson: Are you going when he said it like you and me. We aren't

872
01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:36.720
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I don't really like that play spearmint

873
01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:45.630
Brittany Dingess: I'm gonna try to go. Okay. Yes. It kind of depends on the weather we've had a lot of rain and flooding so

874
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm

875
01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:54.450
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, so I think we're gonna I'm gonna have to

876
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:58.770
Dr Jameson: Put us on pause here for the moment.

877
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:06.390
Dr Jameson: Do you have any well did they explain to you how we work with the weekly groups and

878
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:09.360
Dr Jameson: They explain any of that to

879
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:21.360
Brittany Dingess: Amino a little bit and then I read online. Also, you know, like a little bit not. No. No, not like anything in tremendous detail.

880
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:26.280
Dr Jameson: The same, but so you put you're aware that we have, like, a weekly group that you attend and

881
01:19:29.010 --> 01:19:36.720
Dr Jameson: The Tennessee group that I have is on Wednesdays at noon.

882
01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.500
That's going to be doable.

883
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:43.650
Brittany Dingess: It should be fun. Yeah, okay.

884
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:45.000
So,

885
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:47.400
I think

886
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.830
Dr Jameson: For for

887
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.130
Dr Jameson: If nothing else,

888
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.900
Dr Jameson: Course you probably like to sleep during this point but

889
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:08.070
Brittany Dingess: I mean I don't sleep a lot. I'm always up and down. I'll sleep for a couple hours and I'm up for a couple of hours and oh

890
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:13.860
Dr Jameson: Well, that could be withdrawal related to, or maybe it's other things to pain and stuff but

891
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:16.740
Okay.

892
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.410
Dr Jameson: Are you

893
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:24.660
Dr Jameson: I'm just thinking maybe if you could maybe I could see you like

894
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:30.000
Dr Jameson: At 11 are you what your central your central or

895
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.710
Dr Jameson: eastern Eastern. Okay.

896
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah, if you could maybe we could try to get this wrapped up on well

897
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.140
Dr Jameson: You probably want to get the medication going soon as possible.

898
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.240
Dr Jameson: But what's better for you like earlier in the morning or later afternoon.

899
01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.900
Brittany Dingess: Usually I can do either. I mean, normally I say earlier in the morning.

900
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.530
Brittany Dingess: You know, I mean if or later in the afternoon is better.

901
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:18.180
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm just thinking tomorrow. They have me double booked and then I gotta get out of here for something so I'm kind of stuck with the rest of today, but I could see you tomorrow at

902
01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.490
Dr Jameson: I have. Whoops. Let's see.

903
01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:23.610
What

904
01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.590
Dr Jameson: I could see you tomorrow at like three in the afternoon.

905
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:32.550
Brittany Dingess: That should be fine. Okay.

906
01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:38.700
Dr Jameson: Um, alright, so I'll ask them to make you another appointment and then

907
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:46.980
Dr Jameson: I can send like a just a couple days worth of medicine. Now, so you're not totally stranded.

908
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:57.690
Dr Jameson: You have a sub sub locate. So I don't think there's any risk of putting you into withdrawal by giving you more Suboxone

909
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:08.760
Dr Jameson: You might not need the full eight milligrams right now because you have some, some in there. So I would probably have you start by doing a half just see if that

910
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:13.050
Dr Jameson: Is enough. And did you have a preference for the tablet or the film.

911
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.220
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I don't care really

912
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:19.650
Dr Jameson: Do you know here insurance cares

913
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.220
Brittany Dingess: I mean, whichever one you think will absorb the best

914
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:41.100
Dr Jameson: I think they're pretty equivalent. Some people just find that they like one the taste of one versus the other one I think the tablets are a little cheaper. So sometimes insurance prefers

915
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.330
Dr Jameson: That but you are. Which one is you talked before

916
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:49.530
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I took the strips before, but I do for insurance.

917
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:54.120
Brittany Dingess: So, and I know like the last

918
01:22:56.130 --> 01:23:04.110
Brittany Dingess: The last couple times that I got them. It was the generic film, which was like, I don't know, it was

919
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:12.120
Brittany Dingess: I didn't like the generic film was much because I felt like it was, it didn't stay in place as well.

920
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:12.840
Dr Jameson: Hmm.

921
01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:18.270
Brittany Dingess: So like I would try to put it under my tongue and then it would just go everywhere.

922
01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:21.000
Brittany Dingess: And okay

923
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:24.960
Brittany Dingess: Well, I know that my insurance is kind of picky.

924
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.970
Brittany Dingess: It's, you know, the insurance. I have to work is not as good as the insurance. I had

925
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.270
Brittany Dingess: Previously, so my weekend.

926
01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:50.700
Dr Jameson: Well, maybe we should try the tablet. And you can see it's probably going to be generic either way. So maybe the tablet won't bother you as much as the film. Did I say one a day but like I said I would suggest you break them in half.

927
01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:53.460
Dr Jameson: And then

928
01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.010
Dr Jameson: I'll just do enough for

929
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:07.170
Dr Jameson: Well, I'll do three days so that you could get you through group anyway. But I'll see you tomorrow. Anyway, but that way we'll get you lined up. What we do is try to do

930
01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:17.670
Dr Jameson: When you come to group we do your refill. That same day, so it's nice to have those things. And this way you can try the tablets. If you hate it, then we can we can we can decide

931
01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.610
Dr Jameson: If you want to do the other one instead.

932
01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:23.910
Dr Jameson: But we can at least

933
01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:27.810
Dr Jameson: Get getting started on something.

934
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:34.320
Dr Jameson: And then I'll see you tomorrow. Anyway, but wait till we can talk about it and see how it's going to now and then.

935
01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:46.860
Dr Jameson: I have to tell you, sometimes the pharmacies don't love they see the bright heart health addresses in California and they get

936
01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:55.890
Dr Jameson: Sometimes all upset about. Wait a minute. How are you seeing a patient from California. And sometimes the idea of total mess and does not seem to

937
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:09.360
Dr Jameson: Actually they sometimes get upset. So sometimes one pharmacist is like, no, no. And we have to find different pharmacy because they just don't

938
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.660
Dr Jameson: Accept it

939
01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:19.260
Dr Jameson: So I just realized I didn't put my Tennessee D number on this. Anyway, I go back

940
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.780
Dr Jameson: But just so you're give them a call and make sure everything sounds like it's all squared before you head over there.

941
01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.470
Dr Jameson: Because it can be frustrating. So, at least, at least to save your favorite the gas.

942
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:45.000
Dr Jameson: So if you give them a call and if they sound dubious or like there's a problem or you need a prior author mean there's a variety of things that can happen.

943
01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:51.600
Dr Jameson: We can do that. We can certainly process, the prior off, but that slow things down a little bit, obviously.

944
01:25:55.530 --> 01:26:08.010
Brittany Dingess: As far as I know they cover Suboxone they have fought me pretty hard over the sub located. I mean, obviously, it's like 1500 dollars a month.

945
01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:21.630
Brittany Dingess: And that's what they say and I was there's cheaper alternatives, but they, I mean they have actually accepted this tub. Okay. I mean, as far as I know they cover Suboxone and it's

946
01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.800
Brittany Dingess: I think it's one of their preferred generics.

947
01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.420
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I know that this

948
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.790
Dr Jameson: Should be fine, but I

949
01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:37.980
Dr Jameson: Just fine anyway just sometimes even though it's their preferred they still make you fill out the form and

950
01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:38.580
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

951
01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:39.210
Dr Jameson: I just don't

952
01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:42.540
Dr Jameson: They're not. They're not our friend.

953
01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:43.710
Brittany Dingess: put it that way. I mean,

954
01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.220
Dr Jameson: They're not here to help you. They're here to try not to have to spend money on you so

955
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:57.240
Dr Jameson: It is what it is. But I've just the the additional. So that would be the case, no matter who was writing about this. The additional

956
01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:12.240
Dr Jameson: Issue with us being a telemedicine practice. So sometimes if sometimes a phone call from me solve the problem, but sometimes it doesn't matter, they're just very suspicious and

957
01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:14.520
So,

958
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:18.540
Dr Jameson: I'm trying to get the sense for you.

959
01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:21.270
Dr Jameson: I will

960
01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:27.840
Hourglass

961
01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:35.730
Dr Jameson: So I'll plan on seeing you tomorrow. We may check in the same way. What are the virtual

962
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:37.650
Dr Jameson: Clinic.

963
01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:40.740
Dr Jameson: To check in and

964
01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:43.800
Dr Jameson: Then

965
01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:53.910
Dr Jameson: They'll be they'll be, you know, it'll sort of be the same idea. And then for group on Wednesday, which I'll remind you tomorrow. But same thing you pretty much always start at virtual clinic whenever you're

966
01:27:56.610 --> 01:28:02.760
Dr Jameson: Whenever you're having an appointment, no matter what sort of if it was a counselor group or me or whatever. Okay.

967
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:17.370
Dr Jameson: All right. Normally I would, you know, want to talk to you a lot more about the medication, but since you've been on it before. I don't think we have to go through all the specifics on that, although I'm happy to answer any questions. We can talk about more tomorrow if you

968
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.410
Dr Jameson: Write this just a second ago. Okay, so, um,

969
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:33.000
Dr Jameson: But I'm gonna check because I have another patient to see so

970
01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.360
Dr Jameson: It was nice to meet you.

971
01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:52.710
Dr Jameson: Out on my face. So yeah, so we'll go through more. I just want to hear more about sort of how this all came to be in your life and a little bit more about the rest of your life and family history and you know do small and blah, blah, blah. That kind of stuff.

972
01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:59.910
Dr Jameson: Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I will see you tomorrow. Thanks for your flexibility.

973
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.400
Brittany Dingess: Yes, absolutely. I appreciate it.

974
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.420
Dr Jameson: No problem.

975
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:04.890
Brittany Dingess: You have again.

976
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.110
Brittany Dingess: You too. Thank you.

977
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:34.680
THE QUEENS LG: Hello.

978
01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:36.390
Dr Jameson: Hi.

979
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.590
THE QUEENS LG: Can you hear me.

980
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.900
Dr Jameson: I can hear you. Can you hear me.

981
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.340
Dr Jameson: Sorry, I'm gonna have to be on the move.

982
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.330
Dr Jameson: To daddy leave

983
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:56.970
Dr Jameson: Hey, I'm sorry. I was talking to my daughter. I have to. I'm gonna have to take you with me in the car. I want to take my daughter up

984
01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:01.320
Dr Jameson: One of those days, but this should be quick. So hopefully

985
01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.230
Dr Jameson: Hopefully no big deal. I just wanted to

986
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:09.630
Dr Jameson: Let me get my earbuds back in. Sorry, I'm breaking all the rules.

987
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.310
Dr Jameson: Wanted to talk to you again about

988
01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:19.050
Dr Jameson: Your screen, which I know we already talked about but

989
01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:23.820
Dr Jameson: Still have some in there again this week.

990
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:28.290
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, I went me out with getting

991
01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:30.150
Dr Jameson: That's how come I didn't make group because I

992
01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:35.130
THE QUEENS LG: Didn't take my phone with me. I know I did a call that I didn't have any numbers or nothing.

993
01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:38.520
THE QUEENS LG: Either

994
01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:43.800
Dr Jameson: I didn't come through. It was kind of he went and hung out with

995
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:49.800
THE QUEENS LG: Some friends of friends. I wouldn't stay the night and the desktop.

996
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.770
Dr Jameson: Well,

997
01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:54.000
THE QUEENS LG: You probably don't know what that is.

998
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.770
THE QUEENS LG: You're like freezing. I can't hear you.

999
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:06.120
Dr Jameson: Perfect, of course.

1000
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.800
THE QUEENS LG: I can hear you.

1001
01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:58.830
THE QUEENS LG: You're nothing now.

1002
01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:01.560
THE QUEENS LG: Okay, you're moving

1003
01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.120
Now, you're not

1004
01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.320
THE QUEENS LG: I can't hear you. I can see you, but I can't hear you.

1005
01:34:18.810 --> 01:34:19.740
THE QUEENS LG: Why this sucks.

1006
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.440
THE QUEENS LG: You're your screen. Can you hear me. I don't know if you can even hear me big your screen is frozen and I can't

1007
01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.720
THE QUEENS LG: I can see you moving, but I can't hear anything.

1008
01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.920
THE QUEENS LG: I can see you. I still can't hear anything.
