00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:11.910
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so she mentioned this program to you to you. Are you thinking that you'll want to try to utilize that for

29
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.740
Amber Romero: Well, I can only use it.

30
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.040
Amber Romero: When I'm on probation. So

31
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.820
Amber Romero: If I want their help. I have to

32
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.860
Amber Romero: Find something within the next two weeks or within the next week.

33
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.330
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so what are your thoughts on that.

34
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.550
Amber Romero: Or kind of hard to get anywhere without a rise and it's easier when you just call

35
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.140
Amber Romero: I call places, based on the number on the side of the building.

36
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.390
Rather than

37
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.520
Amber Romero: Try to do it online, because I don't get. I haven't been able to get very far.

38
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.770
Amber Romero: Online and then there's application paperwork and it'll have a source of income.

39
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.870
Amber Romero: We want that as well. So I don't know.

40
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.320
LIsa Anderson: So how

41
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:16.320
LIsa Anderson: You know how, how can you kind of think about working through that with the probation program would they pay the application fee.

42
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.570
Amber Romero: No, no.

43
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.900
Amber Romero: Question, um,

44
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.790
Amber Romero: I don't know.

45
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.210
Amber Romero: Did you see application for like 25 $35

46
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.780
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. Would you, we didn't have any funds for that at all.

47
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.820
Amber Romero: No, not for that.

48
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.320
LIsa Anderson: For the application fee.

49
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:36.780
Amber Romero: No, not for that.

50
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:47.970
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I mean I would definitely encourage you to maybe talk with your probation officer, a little bit more, you know, try to take advantage of this. I mean,

51
00:13:48.300 --> 00:14:07.140
LIsa Anderson: I know it's it's really quick deadline, but I know a lot of apartments are doing virtual virtual tours. So, you know, if you can even just call and you know you could look online and look at the apartment, you know, online and all the information online.

52
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.010
LIsa Anderson: Put your application and maybe you know utilize this resource while you still can.

53
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.660
Amber Romero: Yeah, everything that we do have about doing it online.

54
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.760
Amber Romero: As I'm like all the fraud or scum that go on with it.

55
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.620
LIsa Anderson: As far as an apartment complex

56
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:31.740
LIsa Anderson: Can you read

57
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.160
LIsa Anderson: Have you rented an apartment on your own before

58
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.910
Amber Romero: Yeah, but I usually go through independent owners, rather than

59
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.550
Amber Romero: Complex.

60
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.530
LIsa Anderson: I see. Okay.

61
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:56.550
LIsa Anderson: And that is where you are going to run into possibly more, um, you know, fraud, you know, definitely don't want to send money to anybody.

62
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:04.770
LIsa Anderson: You know about having a signed lease or something like that. Um, do you have that like a felony on your record that you mentioned before.

63
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.370
LIsa Anderson: Yeah okay so that being kind of a barrier.

64
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.250
LIsa Anderson: Getting

65
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:23.400
Amber Romero: Yeah, well I'm gonna have an eviction when I was 18 to 35 now some they for some reason they still hold that against me and then

66
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.340

67
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.160

71
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.490
Amber Romero: I'm gonna, I haven't tried rather complex in a while. It's always been more independent because because of that issue.

72
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:45.660
Okay.

73
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:53.880
LIsa Anderson: You know and i i would imagine your probation officer might have a list of either landlords or

74
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.730
LIsa Anderson: They work with

75
00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.110

LIsa Anderson: Slip you bye

84
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:44.130

Amber Romero: She was going to email the supervisor for different department because we're she's a more. I want to go on to several places.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.420
Amber Romero: Yeah, but I don't really want to be

159
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.110
LIsa Anderson: How, how are you been spending your days lately. What kind of things have you been doing just dated

160
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.170
Amber Romero: All these past couple days it's been just a little bit different because

161
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.560
Amber Romero: It went out of town. You want to see my friends in real dorsal

162
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:23.970
Amber Romero: But

163
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.810
Amber Romero: My brother ended up taking me and

164
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.980
Amber Romero: His, His car broke down in the middle of the night in the middle of basically nowhere.

165
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.110
Amber Romero: So I spent the past couple days working on

166
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.180
Amber Romero: towing the Jeep from over there. Back to Albuquerque.

167
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:52.830
Amber Romero: And now from Albuquerque. We got to figure out how to what to do to get it back to pickle. So let me just spend a little bit different this past week.

168
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.240
LIsa Anderson: Wow. Yeah, that sounds like it's been

169
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.270
LIsa Anderson: A little bit stressful.

170
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.140
Yeah.

171
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.020
Amber Romero: Cell phone service in the middle of the mountain. Yes. Yeah. I was

172
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.560
Amber Romero: It was kind of crazy. Um,

173
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.250
Amber Romero: One thing I have one of my friends have pointed out to me was that

174
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.640
Amber Romero: I'm always cold.

175
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.260
Amber Romero: And it'd be like 100 degrees outside, and I'm freezing

176
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.240
Amber Romero: And you said that's not like normal.

177
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.930
LIsa Anderson: Is this new for you or have you sort of always been

178
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.130
Amber Romero: Um,

179
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.380
Amber Romero: I would say it's new within

180
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.700
The past.

181
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:50.640
Amber Romero: Couple months but I was thinking maybe it was cold because of wintertime. But now that it's summer I mean

182
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.510
Amber Romero: I'm still like crazy. Um,

183
00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.730
LIsa Anderson: Do you feel cold. You ever feel like really cold in your hands.

184
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.610
LIsa Anderson: Or all over

185
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.190
Amber Romero: Everywhere.

186
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.310
Amber Romero: Right everywhere cold all the time.

187
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:15.690
LIsa Anderson: Okay, um, you know, in my experience working with people who have

188
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.570
LIsa Anderson: Who have smoked cigarettes for a long time.

189
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:33.480
LIsa Anderson: So so tobacco use and cigarette use can cause poor circulation. So if, if your circulations poor you know that can affect your

190
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:39.930
LIsa Anderson: You know, your ability of like of your blood circulating kind of regulating your temperature

191
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.010
LIsa Anderson: But you also might, you know, consider talking with

192
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.600
LIsa Anderson: You know,

193
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.070
LIsa Anderson: primary care doctor and we check checked.

194
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.100
Amber Romero: You know, I've worked with a lot of ways to

195
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.010
LIsa Anderson: Who die word can be like a

196
00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.790
LIsa Anderson: Kind of just an underlying thing that can cause a lot of

197
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:19.860
LIsa Anderson: No sleep problems like you've mentioned or, you know, feeling cold. That's a symptom of a little high. Right. You know, might not be a bad idea, and trying to just get in with your, your primary care doctor and maybe they just want some blood work and kind of check everything out.

198
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.950
Amber Romero: Because not too long ago, I am

199
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.220
Amber Romero: Check.

200
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.160
Amber Romero: It says good move your body, your soul, but

201
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.430
Amber Romero: It was it was okay. It wasn't anything

202
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.430
Amber Romero: Anything wrong with it.

203
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.620
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I mean, you can always you know just mentioned it to your doctor.

204
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.260
LIsa Anderson: next appointment and see what they

205
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:46.590
Think

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.560
Amber Romero: Yeah, I'm not really

207
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.190
Amber Romero: Really go to the doctor too much, um,

208
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.290
Amber Romero: I don't really care about too much, you know,

209
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:12.180
LIsa Anderson: So we talked about, um, how have you been doing as far as like eating regularly. Have you been able to get out for walks. How's that

210
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:22.110
Amber Romero: Yeah, that's fine. Okay. I actually went for a walk, yesterday, and I've been. I've been walking outside

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.330
Amber Romero: I feel like I've been eating a lot

212
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.190
Amber Romero: More than usual.

213
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.610
LIsa Anderson: Do you feel like that's been like stress related or

214
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.250
Amber Romero: Not really.

215
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.020
Amber Romero: Just because everything looks. Looks really good.

216
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.800
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, that happens.

217
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.360
Amber Romero: I had this

218
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.000
Amber Romero: Is really good. It was a

219
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.730
Amber Romero: It was a road cheesecake cone.

220
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.160
Amber Romero: Yeah, that was really good. That was from Albertsons

221
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.240
From the

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.490
Amber Romero: bakery.

223
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.250
LIsa Anderson: Oh wow, that's just me, me.

224
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.860
LIsa Anderson: About your trip to Rio. So other than the car breaking down

225
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.380
LIsa Anderson: Isn't that was to visit a friend.

226
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.090
Amber Romero: Yeah. What I'm one of my friends that I've been talking to

227
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.100
Amber Romero: Over the last couple weeks.

228
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.270
Amber Romero: He works at a town a lot and

229
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.070
Amber Romero: A versus everything a lot of time with this person.

230
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:53.040
Amber Romero: And when he wants you read. Also, I had time was like, man, I gotta wait. You know, I have to wait till next week, hang out with you because He'll. He'll stay out there to fill the jobs done he was working on a college and

231
00:28:54.750 --> 00:29:08.430
Amber Romero: He's like, well, you can come if you want and toes like yeah I will watch and he and I just ended up going. So that's how that came from. It wasn't fun. It was just kind of like some other than where you spontaneous you

232
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:10.740
LIsa Anderson: Know,

233
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.480
Amber Romero: Well, yeah, it was those nice I feel pretty out there. I thought it was

234
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.320
Amber Romero: The thought it'd be a lot smaller than what it is, but real beautiful

235
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:28.200
LIsa Anderson: So that was good for you to kind of have a little bit of a change of environment and get out to the mountains and

236
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.320
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, friend. Okay.

237
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.120
Amber Romero: Always nice just the

238
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:40.920
Amber Romero: The whole breaking down being really sucking in. Um, so that was the middle of the night.

239
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:42.990
Amber Romero: We had

240
00:29:44.040 --> 00:30:06.150
Amber Romero: Some lady had stopped and we had asked her if she can help us, and she ended up calling a tow truck. So a tow truck guy showed up and then state police officer had showed up so they they knew what was going on. Apparently the tow truck is the only one in town. So, you know, he's

241
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:14.010
Amber Romero: He wasn't hard to find. But the next day when we were on our way to go get the truck.

242
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.920
Amber Romero: It had gotten told

243
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:19.770
Amber Romero: And

244
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.730
Amber Romero: Guess my brother has a different license plate on it.

245
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.840
Amber Romero: So they told it for

246
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.020
Amber Romero: Fictitious

247
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.480
Amber Romero: Registration

248
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.300
LIsa Anderson: Oh,

249
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:45.330
Amber Romero: Yeah, better pay 300 bucks to get it out. They only had it for 15 minutes to

250
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.980
Amber Romero: Oh, yeah. So that really sucks but

251
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:54.120
Amber Romero: You know,

252
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.040
Amber Romero: It is what it is, I guess.

253
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.490
LIsa Anderson: And your brothers. He lives in Albuquerque.

254
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.930
Amber Romero: Know he lives in

255
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:02.520
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

256
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.010
LIsa Anderson: So you're using your dad lives in Arizona.

257
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.170
Amber Romero: My dad lives in California.

258
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:20.400
LIsa Anderson: California, I'm sorry, California. Okay. Um, and I know you had kind of been talking with him. And now you know maybe trying to buy a vehicle has that. Have you guys

259
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.770
Amber Romero: Have me on. He gave me his, his BMW, um,

260
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:37.110
Amber Romero: But then the coronavirus everything started with that. So there was like a quarantine going on. So he said that I wouldn't be able to go get it.

261
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.450
Amber Romero: Until

262
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.020
Amber Romero: Until after that's over.

263
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:50.370
Amber Romero: But I didn't know we're supposed to like our state supposed to reopen on Friday. Right.

264
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:58.500
LIsa Anderson: I, I believe, on Saturday. Yes, some of the restrictions are going to be lifted as far as

265
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.690
LIsa Anderson: I think though.

266
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.950
LIsa Anderson: As do you mean as far as like traveling to California.

267
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.110
Amber Romero: I'm just like, overall, in general, I, I'm not sure.

268
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.220
Amber Romero: I haven't been

269
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.180
Amber Romero: Keeping up with it.

270
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:18.660
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I think, I think, you know, here in New Mexico, some of the restrictions are going to be lifted, like maybe some more.

271
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.810
LIsa Anderson: Small businesses might be opening up

272
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:37.710
LIsa Anderson: As far as out of state travel. I mean, I think, I don't. As far as I know, I don't think there's any restrictions on out of state travel, but I don't know if California is allowing people to travel in from other states.

273
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.530
LIsa Anderson: Is that, is that what you're asking if you could go to Hell, yeah.

274
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:52.650
Amber Romero: Yeah, so like I'm like my dad will know for sure because overall the decisions is his if I can go or not.

275
00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:54.390
LIsa Anderson: Right.

276
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.120
Amber Romero: Yeah.

277
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:13.200
LIsa Anderson: Yeah yeah I know that's that's hard because you mentioned last time that it sort of been a source of frustration to you where you're trying to me to be make things happen and and get the ball rolling on things, but it's hardly you're relying on other people.

278
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.130
Amber Romero: Mm hmm.

279
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:25.920
LIsa Anderson: And I'm sure you know, just right, getting to a job interview or going to an apartment to, you know, pay the deposit or any of those things are really challenging when you don't have

280
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.580
LIsa Anderson: You know your own transportation so

281
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:30.360
Yeah.

282
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.560
LIsa Anderson: Do you use the bus Gemma bus pass

283
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:40.440
Amber Romero: Um no I don't use the bus. I'm going to have before.

284
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.440
Amber Romero: No, I don't have a bus pass

285
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.180
Amber Romero: The places where I hang out.

286
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.410
Amber Romero: They don't. It doesn't seem like there's

287
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.540
Amber Romero: Like a bus that runs right there, but

288
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.680
Amber Romero: I usually try to find the right if I have to go somewhere, what

289
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.890
Amber Romero: You don't have to go anywhere. No.

290
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.270
LIsa Anderson: Yeah yeah it's challenging

291
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.690
LIsa Anderson: Definitely you know keep working, employment and

292
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:30.570
LIsa Anderson: Place, because I know those are, are some of the big things that you know we've talked about as far as like getting your, your stability. But yeah, I know not having transportation would be a big, big part of that.

293
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:31.770
Amber Romero: You know,

294
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.280
LIsa Anderson: Okay, I'm

295
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:53.670
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so, I mean, I think those things are still kind of then just just on hold a bit. Um, but yeah, other than breaking down. I'm glad that you were able to, you know, connect with a friend and we had oh so other than that ordeal about the car getting towed

296
00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.290
LIsa Anderson: In relationship wise with with everybody else, things are going. Okay.

297
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:00.870
Amber Romero: No. Okay, good. I

298
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.270

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.880
Amber Romero: Makes me

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:24.120
Amber Romero: Feel like

306

Amber Romero: It was supposed to be different than what different, but it doesn't act different

307
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:36.300
Amber Romero: Or maybe he wants me to act different, I don't know, I just kind of a didn't leave enough alone, like I haven't really been talking to him.

308
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.580
Amber Romero: He hasn't really been talking to me.

309
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:55.920
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Yeah. You mentioned that last time that when you guys were younger, you may be kind of just didn't stand up for yourself as much you're going to assert yourself. And now when you do assert yourself. He's, he's not used to that or

310
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:04.650
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, doesn't. OK, I see you guys just kind of taking a break from communication right now.

311
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.910
Amber Romero: Kinda like

312
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:15.300
Amber Romero: Call them when we were driving back from weird also and we told them, like, hey, my brother needs help with with the chief and

313
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:24.060
Amber Romero: You say column. When I get closer Albuquerque. So that way you can, you know, meet up with the end. So what you do to fix it and

314
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.430
Amber Romero: You never answer the phone.

315
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:29.070
Amber Romero: Or online.

316
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:37.020
Amber Romero: He's been doing that a lot lately. So the next two days for the next two days afterwards. I didn't answer the phone.

317
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.040
Amber Romero: He was already getting upset and I thought the one I know tells

318
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:54.570
Amber Romero: You magically thought he said, oh, I fell asleep, no lawyer so magically you fall asleep. Every time or something happens and just it's been pissing me off. So I just been kind of staying away from it.

319
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:04.710
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I mean, if you know that sometimes he's a source of stress for you or you know it's it's a source of conflict.

320
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.730
LIsa Anderson: So yeah, if you're not engaging in that right now.

321
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:10.500
LIsa Anderson: Right.

322
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:11.970
Hey,

323
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:20.160
LIsa Anderson: You know, and one of the things we talked about last time is surrounding yourself with people who are healthy for you.

324
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:29.280
LIsa Anderson: Know people who are healthy, emotionally, physically, you know, who are safe people for you who are people who are clean.

325
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:45.360
LIsa Anderson: And so yeah, I think taking those steps to kind of protect yourself emotionally is really great day, you just recognize that that you know just this week, or just right now if there's a lot of conflict going on, kind of just taking a step back.

326
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:46.800
Amber Romero: Yeah.

327
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.490
LIsa Anderson: Mmm yeah had any like cravings or anything like that to us.

328
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.910
Amber Romero: I'm young. Right. I do.

329
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.640
LIsa Anderson: How, how often would you say in the past week. You've had cravings.

330
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.270
Amber Romero: Every day.

331
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.470
Every day.

332
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:09.840
LIsa Anderson: Is it

333
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.460
LIsa Anderson: Today. Does it kind of come and go.

334
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.880
Amber Romero: It comes and goes. When it depends on what I'm doing.

335
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.000
Amber Romero: Okay, I'm super busy my mindset preoccupied so

336
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:36.750
Amber Romero: It's like when I when I get bored or if I realized like, I try to extend up and my body's hurting you know there's some days I feel old.

337
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.310
LIsa Anderson: So definitely that the pain.

338
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:48.030
LIsa Anderson: Definitely. If you feel like you're in physical pain that brings up those thoughts about using

339
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:55.560
LIsa Anderson: And then just if you're bored. If you start thinking about it, that kind of brings up some of that craving.

340
00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:07.800
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, okay, what, what have you been doing to stay busy or when you when you have that craving like if you're just kind of hanging out at your board and you have that craving. What do you, what do you do

341
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.500
Amber Romero: A couple times have actually tried to

342
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:21.660
Amber Romero: Like feed into it, but it wasn't very successful to kind of find anything.

343
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.160
Amber Romero: Other times it just

344
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.300
Amber Romero: Other times, I've just

345
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:37.950
Amber Romero: Been up and

346
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:39.480
Amber Romero: Do

347
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.380
Amber Romero: Like sometimes, it kind of hurts you know to

348
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.640
Amber Romero: Fill that craving like my arm hurts.

349
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.850
Amber Romero: My arms been going like tingling lately.

350
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.420
Amber Romero: Like if it fell asleep.

351
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:19.380
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I mean, you know, you hear about kind of that mind body connection is is huge, you know, when we've talked about, you know, just the time that it takes for your brain to kind of reset or itself to kind of rewire itself to regrow like those connections that were damaged even

352
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:26.400
LIsa Anderson: So tell me about that. Amber when you when you have those cravings. See, we're just kind of bored, he you know

353
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:40.410
LIsa Anderson: Which yeah you know you start thinking things your mind kind of goes down that rabbit hole. So tell me about what was that like for you being like in search of drugs and then not being able to get it and how did you feel about that.

354
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.280
Amber Romero: I don't know.

355
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.200
Amber Romero: Frustrated.

356
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:57.450
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so you were, you were wanting to use and I'm like what calling people calling people you knew

357
00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.520
LIsa Anderson: That you thought yeah okay

358
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.130
LIsa Anderson: And then when when you couldn't find anything you felt frustrated

359
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.470
Amber Romero: Yeah, exactly.

360
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:15.120
LIsa Anderson: So then, so then what did you do, you couldn't get drugs, you still have the craving you felt frustrated that you couldn't find anything.

361
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.950
LIsa Anderson: Than one

362
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.130
Amber Romero: And nothing

363
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.810
Amber Romero: Nothing at all.

364
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.770
Amber Romero: Just kind of let it go, you know,

365
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:29.910
LIsa Anderson: Just let it go.

366
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.590
LIsa Anderson: Okay, yeah. Um, and then tell me about the times where you you felt board you felt

367
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:46.050
LIsa Anderson: You know, restless, or you had the cravings and were you dinner pursuit of trying to get drugs. Tell me, tell me, like,

368
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.260
Amber Romero: I don't know. I don't really think about stuff like that.

369
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:54.630
LIsa Anderson: So,

370
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:06.390
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so if you were, you were born, you were having a craving that you didn't pick up the phone and call somebody and try to get drugs like what did you do instead

371
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:15.420
Amber Romero: Nothing else out there, depending on who I was with or that just

372
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.470
Amber Romero: Kind of involved myself in the surroundings pain.

373
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:25.680
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so you you involve yourself in the surroundings of the people you are with

374
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:31.230
LIsa Anderson: Yeah okay so is is being with supportive people

375
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.710
LIsa Anderson: A way that you can kind of overcome that craving.

376
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:42.720
Amber Romero: I don't know. It depends on if I'm with somebody or not. I mean, I feel maybe it would be, but

377
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.820
Amber Romero: It doesn't necessarily mean that those people would be available.

378
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:55.140
LIsa Anderson: Right. So what I want you to try to get to think about amorous, you know, you're going to have cravings and that's normal.

379
00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.530
LIsa Anderson: But to try to identify what you can do instead of seeking out drugs. Right.

380
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.300
LIsa Anderson: So doing that work.

381
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:15.660
LIsa Anderson: You know, and you had you've had times where you have tried to seek out drugs, but you've also had some success, where you didn't. So I want to try to find and help you recognize like what you did that worked for you.

382
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.330
LIsa Anderson: Like what you did.

383
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.730
LIsa Anderson: To not try to do drugs. Does that make sense.

384
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:33.480
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. And so, because that's, that's huge, you know, you know, you kind of had a slip up where you might have used, but you had other times where you didn't

385
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:48.480
LIsa Anderson: And that's a huge success. So I want you to, you know, kind of give yourself some credit for that and just think about so so if people are around you that are helpful to you. You can engage with them. Right.

386
00:43:48.540 --> 00:44:00.330
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, if they're around. Okay, so if you have a craving and say you're by yourself. Um, what, what are some things you think you could do instead of calling the dealer.

387
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:03.630
Amber Romero: No, no.

388
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.670
LIsa Anderson: Have you ever had a craving where you were, by yourself and you didn't try to get drugs.

389
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.180
Amber Romero: I'm usually not by myself.

390
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.160
LIsa Anderson: Usually not by yourself.

391
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:22.590
LIsa Anderson: So usually you're with someone and being with other people.

392
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.340
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, okay. So say you're by yourself.

393
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.140
LIsa Anderson: You have a craving. Can you call someone a supportive person.

394
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.650
Amber Romero: And that may work.

395
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:42.060
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, so are like can you think about

396
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:51.360
LIsa Anderson: How would it be for you to cut off contact with people that you get drugs from or that you used to use with

397
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.410
Amber Romero: Well, like that's the thing I i

398
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:56.190
Couldn't

399
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:04.710
Amber Romero: I couldn't find them because I did cut them off like cut off my contract.

400
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.430
Amber Romero: Got a little bit hard, you know,

401
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:18.060
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so that was a good thing, right, I mean, I know you, you said you felt frustrated that you couldn't reach them.

402
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:25.830
LIsa Anderson: Looking back on it now. Like, how do you feel that you didn't use

403
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.430
Amber Romero: To write about it, you know, which is a good thing.

404
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.540
LIsa Anderson: Yeah yeah you you should feel good about it. It is a good thing.

405
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:38.460
LIsa Anderson: I mean,

406
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:46.770
LIsa Anderson: I think at some point, thinking about everything. You have to gain from continuing to be clean.

407
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:57.420
LIsa Anderson: And weigh that against like what's at stake, you know that you would lose if you used again.

408
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:09.420
LIsa Anderson: So maybe just, you know, to, how would you way that in your mind like what would be some of the cons of using drugs again.

409
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.930
Amber Romero: No, definitely go backwards.

410
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.170
LIsa Anderson: Right, so all the progress you've made thus far, it would it would really put you back at square one.

411
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.300
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, hey,

412
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.730
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. What else

413
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.580
Amber Romero: Know what my overall health or being fair

414
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:48.780
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so your overall health. Um, you know there's there's definitely health risks to, you know, intravenous drug use.

415
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:56.010
LIsa Anderson: You know, that's the tune of pretty high risk for a lot of you know diseases and things like that, but

416
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:05.610
LIsa Anderson: You know, then possibly going into withdrawal again right if you used, and then you are able, you know, then you tried to get clean again.

417
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.640
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, possibly being sick.

418
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.440
LIsa Anderson: So the other thing I'll share with you to me. And I don't know if you've

419
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:27.540
LIsa Anderson: If you guys have gone over the same group, but sometimes people who relapse on heroin. If you go back to the same dose that you were using previously you can overdose.

420
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:34.860
LIsa Anderson: Huh. Oh, it can be just really dangerous. You know, possibly have a fatal overdose.

421
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.030
LIsa Anderson: So I mean that's that's a pretty big thing, right.

422
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:44.280
LIsa Anderson: You know, you know, possibly dying if used again.

423
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.800
Amber Romero: Mm hmm. Definitely.

424
00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:56.100
LIsa Anderson: So, um, maybe, Emery. If you can make a list for me about what things you can do when you have those

425
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.780
LIsa Anderson: Cravings because I really want you to be able to think about

426
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:11.160
LIsa Anderson: You know, you might not always be around people, you might not always be able to call someone your phone might be dead, you know,

427
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:19.080
LIsa Anderson: And you have a craving or you have a stressful situation that comes up that makes you think that you want to use. And so I really

428
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:28.800
LIsa Anderson: Because you know things come up right there's not going to always be people around, or there's not going to always be there's going to be moments of boredom.

429
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:35.850
LIsa Anderson: And so I want you to be able to have the skills and the tools to be able to cope with those things.

430
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.610
LIsa Anderson: Mm hmm. Does that make sense.

431
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:47.940
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so, you know, think about what what works for you, you know, cuz what works for me or what's worked for other people might not work for you.

432
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:57.570
LIsa Anderson: But, you know, just some ideas. You've, you've mentioned social distractions, which I think is great. And that seems like it works well for you.

433
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.890
LIsa Anderson: You know, talking to somebody on the phone, a supportive person.

434
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.750
LIsa Anderson: So,

435
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:15.690
LIsa Anderson: So let's just, you know, get creative. Just, you know, it could be anything but if Fordham is a trigger for you that just brings up those, you know, the board sitting around, you're not doing anything.

436
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:29.520
LIsa Anderson: To think about one maybe what you can do to prevent that boredom and then to if you are bored or you're alone and you have a craving, what you can do to distract yourself, even if it's temporary

437
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:46.440
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so maybe between now and next week. If you can just kind of jot down, you know, just maybe two or three things that you can do if you have a craving to distract yourself.

438
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.180
LIsa Anderson: It's if there's no one else around you.

439
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.720
LIsa Anderson: Kind of have a plan in place, right.

440
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.950
LIsa Anderson: Mm hmm. It's right those cravings come and go.

441
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:06.090
LIsa Anderson: You know, even, even you said if you're having them every day but but you haven't used so

442
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:16.110
LIsa Anderson: You know, that's awesome that you've, you've been able to work through that somehow. And I know it's kind of maybe on the spot for me to just ask you right here. So,

443
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:34.320
LIsa Anderson: Think about it in and maybe just take some time to kind of reflect on it, maybe have that list handy. We'll review it next week together and then that way when you like, do you have a craving. Again, you can look at your list and be like, Okay, I can go for a walk. I can

444
00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:41.340
LIsa Anderson: Do some yoga or, you know, watch TV, whatever it is for you that is maybe a distraction.

445
00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:44.520
Amber Romero: Okay.

446
