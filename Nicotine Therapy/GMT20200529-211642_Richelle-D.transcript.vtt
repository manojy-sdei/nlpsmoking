00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.880
Richelle Direny: You turn on your camera for me.

2
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.530
Sandee A: Oh, come on. There it is.

3
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.330
Richelle Direny: Okay.

4
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.840
Richelle Direny: You said you're still at the hotel. Right.

5
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.860
Yes.

6
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
Richelle Direny: Okay you your daughter came by today or no.

7
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.830
Sandee A: No, not yet. She just got off work at five o'clock.

8
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.700
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, um, so tell me a little bit about the home because I, you do have an appointment, because I did ask them to get you an appointment with Natalie.

9
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.820
Sandee A: Yeah, they gave me an appointment at 9am on Monday with Natalie.

10
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.810
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I know you said that you're really, really overwhelmed and really anxious about the upcoming surgery.

11
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.690
Sandee A: Yeah, I don't have any options left and it's less than two weeks away.

12
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:41.160
Sandee A: And it's the surgery is going to determine if I have the use of my legs or if I lose my legs. I'm out of options there is no if ands or maybes, I have to have the surgery.

13
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.840
Sandee A: And after the doctor went over the list of things that could go wrong, which I, they have to, you know, I'm, I mean, I understand that.

14
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.800
Sandee A: I don't have the option to not have the surgery because

15
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.000
Sandee A: The tiny blood vessels that are now supplying circulation to my legs.

16
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.610
Sandee A: Also supply blood to vital organs like my kidneys in my liver

17
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.780
And

18
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.760
Sandee A: Those organs are being compromised.

19
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.410
Sandee A: So that's the reason why they want to get me in quickly.

20
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.080
Sandee A: And I sent you and Natalie both name of the surgery.

21
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.730
Sandee A: And they're going to go from my shoulder to my leg.

22
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.310
Sandee A: Was an artificial thing.

23
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.050
Sandee A: Is that doesn't work. I will raise my life.

24
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.590
Richelle Direny: And what they're doing this the type of surgery which that's more, you know,

25
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.950
Richelle Direny: Natalie is field of, you know, her expertise and everything that's going on.

26
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.060
Richelle Direny: With what they're doing. It's, um,

27
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.450
Richelle Direny: Is it to do what the, what is it a cloud or whatever is going on with the circulation in your leg.

28
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.870
Sandee A: Back in

29
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:24.600
Sandee A: October and November I had the angioplasty was just supposed to be easy peasy in and out and done where they open up the arteries and put instance, who are necessary.

30
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:37.860
Sandee A: That didn't work and they perforated my artery. I had to go back in February. And I mean, December. And they did a double the mortal Artery Bypass

31
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:48.690
Sandee A: I just learned that the doctor who did that made several mistakes in doing it and it is closed up it's failed.

32
00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:00.000
Sandee A: I've got these artificial graphs in my body that clogged there they're blocked off. They're not producing what they shouldn't have done.

33
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.000
Sandee A: In each day that I

34
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:16.290
Sandee A: Don't have this surgery, I'm compromising all the other organs, because if muscles and tissues. Don't get adequate oxygen rich blood they die.

35
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.310
Sandee A: So,

36
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.290
Richelle Direny: So they're trying to just kind of restore back the flow of

37
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.620
Richelle Direny: Oxygen needed and deoxygenated blood on that side.

38
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.060
Sandee A: On both sides. Eventually, I'm going to have to have the left side done as well.

39
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.450
Sandee A: But it's the right side that worse.

40
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:46.320
Sandee A: So now I'm looking at two surgeries over the summer before I can have my right hip replaced

41
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.400
Sandee A: And that is also preventing me from walking without my Walker.

42
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:08.130
Sandee A: Right now, I cannot go anywhere without it. I call it my Master Card goes everywhere I go and I absolutely cannot do stairs at all.

43
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:18.360
Sandee A: Which is also another prevention of getting a room are getting a apartment not able to the stairs.

44
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.020
Richelle Direny: So the apartment that you were moving in was a first floor apartment.

45
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.950
Yes.

46
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.510
Richelle Direny: So why was it that you, you weren't able to move in with her daughter.

47
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.070
Sandee A: There's four adults in the family and two dogs in a

48
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.380
Sandee A: three bedroom ranch. There's just absolutely no room.

49
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.090
Richelle Direny: Okay, you said for adults, which was she has adult children.

50
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.650
Sandee A: Yes. A 16 year old and a 23 year old that was

51
00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.330
Richelle Direny: Ok ok so with her, her husband, I'm assuming, and two children.

52
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.980
Sandee A: Yes.

53
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.540
Richelle Direny: It's a long time, but you're caught, you're pretty close to where she lives.

54
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.820
Sandee A: And then the same time.

55
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.210
Richelle Direny: So what was going on with the apartment.

56
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.770
Sandee A: I don't know. They told me they would call when it's available.

57
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.130
Sandee A: So now that do with laying off workers do to Colin.

58
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.590
Sandee A: I am just really unsure at this time.

59
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.100
Richelle Direny: Now, given that, you know, one of the things that you had in your last department was that you had, um,

60
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.270
Richelle Direny: You have someone that came like an aid that came to assist you.

61
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.580
Sandee A: Yes, three days week

62
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.950
Richelle Direny: And you do, you don't have that now.

63
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.850
Know,

64
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.960
Richelle Direny: What is the person comes to assist you with

65
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.310
Sandee A: Everything from Beijing to

66
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.470
Sandee A: Doing my medication reminders.

67
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.620
Sandee A: Helping me cook.

68
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.870
Sandee A: Laundry.

69
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.440
Sandee A: It's literally almost impossible for me to walk right and when I do walk in.

70
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.000
Sandee A: Every step I take is painful because my hip pops.

71
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.490
Richelle Direny: Even with even with a walker it's it's it's becoming more

72
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.800
Richelle Direny: Atheists is your

73
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.810
Richelle Direny: Is your daughter come by and help you

74
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.270
Sandee A: As much as she can.

75
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.150
Richelle Direny: Hold her. And what about

76
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.980
Sandee A: Sunday and pick me up and I went to her house and makeup done she helped me do laundry.

77
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.000
Richelle Direny: Okay, what about your grandchildren. The, the, if there is a boy and a girl or two boys.

78
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.580
Sandee A: Yes, my grandson. This

79
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.120
Sandee A: doesn't dry he's

80
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.150
Sandee A: He's a good support person I text him now and then and he's very active in their church.

81
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:21.030
Sandee A: But he also or a full time job and my granddaughter is 16 she's very active with activities. The just now starting back up with softball.

82
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:32.220
Sandee A: They're both grandkids are in the choir at church and they're just now starting back up with the practices and

83
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.730
Sandee A: So my daughter is very busy and I didn't come down here to be burdened with her.

84
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.290
Sandee A: And not reached out and what

85
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:56.670
Sandee A: Benefits that I am allowed our qualify for I am getting meals here in my room. They bring me a hot meal every day.

86
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.080
Richelle Direny: Is that the hotel or motel you're staying here.

87
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.290
Sandee A: It's a budget in

88
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.240
Richelle Direny: Like long I

89
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.230
See

90
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.440
Sandee A: I'm sorry.

91
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.450
Richelle Direny: It's like an extended thing.

92
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.930
Sandee A: Why vendors since May, the first

93
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I really did.

94
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.280
Sandee A: Luck out when I come down here on

95
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:35.310
Sandee A: Everybody kind of shrieks when they say, Oh my gosh, you know, that's expensive. Well, yeah, it's normally $250 a week.

96
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.290
Sandee A: And

97
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:49.680
Sandee A: Someone that my daughter knows at the church was able to make a deal with the people who own motel I pay $100 a week.

98
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.180
Sandee A: And that is really not much more than I paid

99
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.140
Sandee A: For my apartment.

100
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.700
Richelle Direny: So Mike, Mike. So who is so who is providing these meals. The hotel.

101
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:12.390
Sandee A: And the meals know it's a senior citizens then are down here. Meals on Wheels.

102
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:20.610
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, so, so as far as you be there, like in terms of getting the meals in certain things. You have a lot of support where that's concerned.

103
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:34.710
Richelle Direny: Your biggest stressor right now is the upcoming surgery and what is overwhelming you is the information they gave you with the the the uncertainty as to whether or not you will have us if you're not

104
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.750
Yes.

105
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.630
Richelle Direny: Now,

106
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:52.920
Richelle Direny: I want you to basically tell me, just what is just you just express it. What is frightening about the concept

107
00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:11.310
Richelle Direny: Because I know the last time that we spoke it was the either the wheelchair or the arm or kind of like with the surgery. Either you could be in a wheelchair for a very long time or now you will lose your legs and when, when you say lose your legs. You mean amputating it

108
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.960
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay.

109
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.640
Sandee A: I cannot restore oxygen rich

110
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.770
Sandee A: Blood flow.

111
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.850
Sandee A: More than what I have with the teeny tiny veins, then

112
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.140
Sandee A: Tissues and muscles will dissipate.

113
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.360
Sandee A: And die.

114
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:43.320
Sandee A: So eventually, yes, that is a probability that is this option, this option that I'm going through and it's the only option left

115
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.390
Sandee A: It fails.

116
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.960
Sandee A: And I'm just overwhelmed because

117
00:11:50.370 --> 00:12:01.740
Sandee A: After understand back in October, when they said, oh, this is simple. It's an angiogram and going with the balloon and blow up your veins put in the stent.

118
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:19.950
Sandee A: And then you're good to go. When that failed and I coded on the table. I mean, I actually died on their table and they revived me gave me blood patch me up less than a month later, I went in for a double the moral arc bypassed.

119
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.260
Sandee A: Which he spliced in do a main artery.

120
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:32.940
Sandee A: And tried to route blood flow to both of my legs from his artery, and he didn't do

121
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:40.740
Sandee A: According to the surgeon. I'm seeing now. He did not do the proper technique and it failed.

122
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.790
Sandee A: So that bypass graft is occlusion. It's completely shut off.

123
00:12:51.810 --> 00:13:04.650
Sandee A: The other doctor kept telling me that I would create new veins. Well, with that being said there was a possibility that might have worked for someone who is younger and more active and

124
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:25.260
Sandee A: In better health than I am, but it did not work for me, mainly because I wasn't able to move around, or do as much physical therapy as they wanted me to. And if you remember the main reason that I wanted to come down here was hip surgery.

125
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:26.550
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

126
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.680
Sandee A: Well, that had to be postponed.

127
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.880
Richelle Direny: Because what's more pressing is what's going on with your leg.

128
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:55.470
Sandee A: Yes, and the vascular surgeon explained to me that if they can't get this blood flow restored. Then I will not heal. If I have a major operation like the hip replacement right now they're afraid that if I get any open wound up what so ever that I will not heal.

129
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:59.610
Richelle Direny: Because of what's going on.

130
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.450
Sandee A: Right. Yes.

131
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.330
Sandee A: They've even told me not to shave my legs.

132
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:12.690
Sandee A: But I, I stopped using electric our regular razor. Many years ago, I use an elector shape or so that's a good thing.

133
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:25.290
Sandee A: But they they have stress to be very, very hard that I have to avoid cuts and scrapes and

134
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.060
Sandee A: Open of any kind. I mean, I'm bruised up all over my

135
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.030
Sandee A: See my arms, where I'm

136
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:45.540
Sandee A: I just, if I bump up against anything that's it i bruise so hard, but I'm on blood thinners, I have to take baby aspirin.

137
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.760
Richelle Direny: Because a lot of medical underlining medical thing.

138
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:51.990
Yes.

139
00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:07.200
Sandee A: And to make matters worse, my pancreas started acting up again. So I've been struggling with keeping food down even drinking water I vomited like four times today.

140
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.350
Sandee A: And I'm just

141
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.780
Richelle Direny: I felt she said it was due to I mean granted with the pancreas did the doctor say like your brain curious your pancreas is inflamed or anything is going on with your pancreas.

142
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:29.220
Sandee A: I have chronic pancreatitis. That is the reason why I was on so much opiate medication.

143
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:42.810
Sandee A: Back in 2010 when I had my gallbladder removed and they diagnose the chronic pancreatitis. I went to be evaluated.

144
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:53.640
Sandee A: For the pancreatic I liver transplant because my pancreas does not secrete enzymes that digest food.

145
00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:06.090
Sandee A: And when I went in the hospital to have pancreatic eyelid transplant I develop a blood clot when they were prepping me for surgery.

146
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.370
Sandee A: And it was postponed.

147
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:17.880
Sandee A: And from that point on, and they started giving me all the opiate medications in

148
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.450
Sandee A: My pancreas, it stopped hurting why I don't wonder why now. I mean, I was

149
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.150
Sandee A: But that was almost 10 years ago now.

150
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.220
Richelle Direny: It's, it's, um,

151
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:44.910
Richelle Direny: I mean you do definitely have a whole lot of medical things going on. Now this is going to be your second surgery major surgery.

152
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:46.830
Sandee A: Third,

153
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.300
Richelle Direny: So okay, so what were your other your first two surgeries.

154
00:16:52.560 --> 00:17:00.510
Sandee A: The femoral the bilateral angioplasty looking stencils. The first one and then

155
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:13.320
Sandee A: I had the double femoral artery bypass in December and now I'm having this axial axial I femoral bypass now.

156
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.880
Sandee A: So that's three in less than six months.

157
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:19.860
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

158
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.610
Richelle Direny: And all of them seem to be interrelated all of the different search

159
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.830
Sandee A: It's yes it's all because I have

160
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.180
Sandee A: To not just peripheral artery disease.

161
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:46.740
Sandee A: Peripheral vascular disease. It's my entire body. And that's what has me so freaked out. Rochelle is the fact that all of my veins, not just my leg.

162
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.150
Richelle Direny: veins are slowly on

163
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.450
Richelle Direny: The medical world.

164
00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:06.840
Sandee A: Where they said, I have a lot of plaque buildup. Um, but I just had last week cholesterol test done and I don't have cholesterol issues so

165
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:14.610
Sandee A: They don't know if it's hereditary or I mean my mother had bad problems with her legs.

166
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.170
Sandee A: And it could be a little bit of

167
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.600
Richelle Direny: This she lose her legs, you

168
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.340
Sandee A: Know, she they were successful in just standing, relax.

169
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.350
Richelle Direny: Okay. So the big thing is

170
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.570
Richelle Direny: Now going back to what we talked about. It's the what I said that I just want you to share

171
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:56.970
Richelle Direny: So I can know your thoughts, the scary part of the surgery and everything that we've said to you, like, how are you process it because it. Listen, there's one way what the doctor tells us, and there's another in how we process the information

172
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.280
Sandee A: What are my thoughts.

173
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.250
Richelle Direny: Because remember, you're, you're having a lot of

174
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:13.110
Richelle Direny: Anxiety and your anxiety very physical with the vomiting and just kind of like the physical response.

175
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.060
Sandee A: I get overwhelmed when I even tried to talk about. I have a hard time getting my breath. My heart.

176
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.810
Sandee A: starts now. But taking get lightheaded.

177
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.430
Sandee A: I can't sleep.

178
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.400
Sandee A: I mean, I guess what's so overwhelming is the fact that I know when they

179
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:49.800
Sandee A: Did the first bypass or first procedure, the angioplasty and they perforated the artery I died.

180
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:59.160
Sandee A: I mean I'm ever so grateful that I they brought me back. But that's a very strong possibility that could happen again.

181
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:18.360
Richelle Direny: So the, so what's scary is not so much the surgery and the, the total possible outcomes of being in a wheelchair or losing or your legs getting amputated. It is the possibility of dying because of the invasiveness in the just

182
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.970
Richelle Direny: The arm.

183
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.280
Richelle Direny: The magnitude of

184
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:33.270
Sandee A: Yeah, because of everything that could happen that could go wrong. I mean, there's so much more that could go wrong when she goes in to do this.

185
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:44.220
Sandee A: Artificial the bypass and they're using artificial material after run it from my shoulder artery, all the way down in through my body to my pain in my leg.

186
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:52.530
Sandee A: There are nerves appears, she explained to me. I could be paralyzed from a nerve. It's

187
00:20:53.670 --> 00:21:03.720
Sandee A: I mean, those are even less possible then loss of my legs. But, I mean, I could bear allies on the right side from my neck down

188
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.350
Sandee A: But whatever any other reason.

189
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:18.540
Sandee A: I was given an option. I would not have this surgery but I don't have that option.

190
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:24.420
Richelle Direny: You want to have this if you are given another option, you wouldn't you would not have the surgery because

191
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.900
Sandee A: Because of all the risks involved.

192
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:36.870
Richelle Direny: But wouldn't it be true that any type of invasive procedure that is completed. There's a lot of risk involved in it.

193
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.980
Sandee A: This one is more risky because of what I've had done prior

194
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:50.280
Sandee A: He's the one I had the bypasses done. He's already

195
00:21:51.510 --> 00:22:01.620
Sandee A: Compromised the artery that the doctor has to use to resupply blood to my legs are adequate blood anyway.

196
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:17.100
Sandee A: Right now, my legs are not getting enough oxygen. I mean, they're cold all the time. And, you know, if you have you ever sat on your foot, and he goes to sleep when you go to stand on. It's like pins and needles.

197
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.200
Sandee A: My leg like that all time.

198
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.610
Sandee A: I've adapted to it and I tried to push through it.

199
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.750
Sandee A: But my legs get so tired so weak and then they start cramping.

200
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:47.940
Richelle Direny: So if you have, if you have the surgery and you're in a wheelchair. Um, and it goes well but well enough for you to be in a wheelchair, like it always being a wheelchair. The the

201
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:58.050
Sandee A: Feeling of the menial chair the wheelchair would come to play if it doesn't work, and eventually it means I will lose my legs.

202
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.680
Richelle Direny: You said if this matters to me.

203
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.490
Richelle Direny: It would come into play if it doesn't work, or if it works.

204
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:15.510
Sandee A: If it doesn't work, then my option. The only option left is of course the wheelchair and without that rich oxygen blood supply.

205
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.540
Sandee A: My legs will die.

206
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:30.870
Sandee A: I mean, it's only been December, January, February, March, April, it's only been four months since I had that major bypass done in my life.

207
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.140
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I think I'm trying to follow. So the

208
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.400
Sandee A: Wheelchair here.

209
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:42.180
Sandee A: In 30 years I will have no feeling at all in my legs and the tissues will die.

210
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.470
Mm hmm.

211
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.490
Richelle Direny: So in everything that I'm understanding that you're saying is that

212
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.550
Richelle Direny: The surgery is hopefully

213
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.710
Richelle Direny: The surgery.

214
00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.180
Richelle Direny: When successful because let's let's be positive.

215
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:08.520
Richelle Direny: If that you will be able to walk without the king. I mean, without the walker and user be a walk and function.

216
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:20.070
Richelle Direny: Depending on the direction in which the surgery goes, you could possibly either be in a word wheelchair worst case scenario lose your legs.

217
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.400
Richelle Direny: Now, based on my

218
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:36.330
Sandee A: And let me stop you there. Honey, it's not a worst case scenario, possibly losing my legs. I will inevitably lose my limbs, because without that blood supply.

219
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.790
Richelle Direny: Even with the surgery.

220
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:39.750
Yes.

221
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.440
Sandee A: We will hear

222
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.410
Richelle Direny: The surgeon buying your time.

223
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.540
Sandee A: If the surgery work. Eventually I'll have to have the left side, done.

224
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.620
Sandee A: Then I can have my hip replacement

225
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:04.800
Sandee A: And at the end of the tunnel is that light of me being able to walk without the walker.

226
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:14.910
Richelle Direny: This is what and listen we're being you're being positive and but I know anxiety is in play. Because when you go to the doctor. The doctor has to tell you everything

227
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.760
Richelle Direny: They have to go over everything.

228
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:29.010
Richelle Direny: They have to tell you, this is what we're going for. This is why we think that this is the word electing to do the surgery because you need to have the surgery done

229
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:42.660
Richelle Direny: In the same token, they're saying that in all of the cases that they've ever done. These are two different directions or these are the things that can happen.

230
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:53.220
Richelle Direny: I think for a medical standpoint, they have to tell you everything they're going to leave no stones on turn in terms of information they're going to tell you everything

231
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:54.720
Richelle Direny: I

232
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.910
Richelle Direny: Mean like

233
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:14.520
Richelle Direny: The doctor is sound pretty sure that you know them doing the surgery and them doing it so quickly, because it's coming. It's coming up so close is that it needs to be done, and they need to get to a quick before it goes beyond what they can do, where repair.

234
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.320
Sandee A: Okay, with that being said, I know you don't understand that. Okay.

235
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:36.750
Sandee A: The surgery that I'm having is supposed to be a one shot surgery and it's supposed to go from my right to my right leg and then from my right leg over to my left leg with a graph, but because of what's already been done.

236
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.630
Sandee A: They have to break it up in two surgeries that strike number one against me.

237
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.280
Sandee A: Number two is I'm not as mobile as

238
00:26:51.660 --> 00:27:05.880
Sandee A: Anybody else is because of my hip arthritis. Therefore, when it comes down, they say she's what the doctor told me was that I would need to do a lot of exercises, etc. What if I could exercise. That'd be wonderful.

239
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:21.750
Sandee A: But I have a problem walking without the Walker, not just because of the sensations in my legs, it's also because of the hip pain, but I have that hip surgery and until they restore the blood flow.

240
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:28.710
Richelle Direny: But once you finish. Once you have the surgery and you're at a place. Aren't you going to go to a rehab right after

241
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:46.410
Sandee A: With this surgery. No, I will be a nice little three to five days and then I'll come home to recover what she said. What happened from there is either. I would go to a physical place possibly use a pool, um,

242
00:27:48.870 --> 00:28:07.110
Sandee A: I don't think that will happen until the incision is yielding the stitches are out. But at that point do exercises to build the strength up in my leg, because they're so weak right now from the last surgery I had it's it's just ridiculous to impossible for me to walk.

243
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.270
Sandee A: And I haven't given up hope. But

244
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.990
Sandee A: I'm losing hope.

245
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:22.710
Sandee A: I mean, I do. I feel like I'm at the end of the road a dead end road.

246
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.020
Sandee A: Against a rock and a hard

247
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.210
Sandee A: Place. I know.

248
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:35.130
Sandee A: I phases very strong, but quite honestly, Rochelle I need a miracle.

249
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.710
Richelle Direny: I know you said that you know i don't understand in terms of the medical piece of it, and rightfully so.

250
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:54.180
Sandee A: Well, yeah. And you weren't sitting on the doctor was talking to me, telling me I don't want to have to be the one to tell you this, but, you know, this is what we want you to be prepared for

251
00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:05.970
Sandee A: And a lot of what the doctor was telling me she kept saying because of what you already had done.

252
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.410
Sandee A: And in me thinking about what I've already had done.

253
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.150
Sandee A: It failed.

254
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:23.370
Sandee A: So I've, I've got less than a 5050 chance is what I'm being told.

255
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.250
Richelle Direny: Well, you have a chance

256
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.600
Yes.

257
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.990
Richelle Direny: That's what we're talking about is the chance that you have

258
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:40.410
Richelle Direny: And that's what you have to. You say that you have hope. And you you know you have faith. And that's what you have to hold on to is that you have a chance

259
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:48.990
Richelle Direny: If you didn't have it if you'd be going down this road. And I think that's where a lot of your anxiety comes from because

260
00:29:50.280 --> 00:30:05.790
Richelle Direny: You're not capitalizing on you have a chance and they're trying to give you and I and I understand what you're saying that in. However, the doctor spoke to you and all that they shared with you, but you have a chance and

261
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.910
Richelle Direny: Holding on to hope and having faith is holding on to that you have a chance

262
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:27.870
Sandee A: I know that, and I do I go through the motions every morning when I wake up every other hour when I'm awake through the night, and it's like a rocking chair, he know I go back and forth, back and forth, holding on.

263
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.700
Sandee A: To that little bit of hope.

264
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.630
Sandee A: But

265
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:36.330
Richelle Direny: Because your brain only brings you back to the it's a 5050 chance

266
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.310
Richelle Direny: Erasing

267
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:47.160
Richelle Direny: Your well whatever the percent of your brain. What keeps you up at night and what makes us anxious is because our, our brain.

268
00:30:47.700 --> 00:31:02.730
Richelle Direny: Goes and focus on the negatives piece of it. Your brain is saying that your chances limited, this is what's going to happen and you may lose your leg. You may be in a walker. It's not going to work. You remember the last time you did this. That's what you're bringing, bringing you back to

269
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:03.690
It.

270
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.910
Sandee A: It's me, that has gone on and on in my head round and round.

271
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.940
Richelle Direny: And we have hope.

272
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:20.370
Richelle Direny: If I'm being faithful and if I am. Look at my little wall here walking by faith.

273
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.230
Sandee A: Yeah I noticed that

274
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.480
Richelle Direny: If I'm walking by faith.

275
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.350
Richelle Direny: I have to hold on to.

276
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:33.750
Richelle Direny: And have faith in the chairs. They're trying

277
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.830
And they're working towards

278
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:48.480
Sandee A: Really trying so hard to be that person that my daughter wants me to be an

279
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:54.300
Sandee A: Hold on to the hope and you know

280
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.910
Sandee A: I just get overwhelmed. I

281
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.340
Sandee A: I don't understand. I just don't

282
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.110
Sandee A: Because you're you're you're

283
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:22.260
Richelle Direny: In. I understand that. I understand that. But are you the type of person who even though you have faith and you're holding on to hope. Are you the type of person who thinks about the negative pieces of things before focusing on the positives.

284
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.130
Sandee A: No I push myself every day.

285
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:43.020
Richelle Direny: So what's, what's the struggle. Now with pushing yourself and staying faithful and hopeful that they're giving me a chance. Even if it's a 1% chance it's a chance

286
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:55.110
Sandee A: Well just up until when I spoke with the surgeon who is going to try and restore my legs. Um, I had that hope in the back of my mind.

287
00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:08.970
Sandee A: They are, you know, I'm going to recreate blood vessels and I'm going to be okay. And I just push a little harder and my legs will stop feeling like they're asleep all time and I'll stop getting cramps and Middle of the night that

288
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.010
Sandee A: Are unbelievably hurts so much

289
00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:22.650
Sandee A: You know, I want to believe that it's going to be okay. But it's been four months.

290
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:32.400
Sandee A: And it's just gradually gotten to this point, every day, it gets harder.

291
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.360
Sandee A: And I kind of feel like I should have plateaued by now.

292
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.510
Richelle Direny: plateaued in what way.

293
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.930
Sandee A: I should have gotten used to it. Mine how I guess is what I'm trying to say because

294
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.910
Richelle Direny: having surgery are used to

295
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.010
Sandee A: The sensations. I'm feeling low or the lack of, I guess.

296
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.420
Richelle Direny: They're giving you a chance of not being in pain anymore.

297
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.830
Richelle Direny: They're giving you hope.

298
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:21.870
Richelle Direny: You won't be in pain, they're giving you hope that I know your history. So we're going to talk about your history, we're going to review your history.

299
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:38.250
Richelle Direny: We're going to talk about all the different possibilities and where you can go and what you're getting into. And prepare yourself for all of that, right, because you have enough medical issues and has gone to enough different specialists than just doctors in general to know

300
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.770
Richelle Direny: That they have to give you all

301
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:46.650
Richelle Direny: What when it's all said and done what they want you to do is

302
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.160
Richelle Direny: Just keep the faith and maintain the same

303
00:34:54.630 --> 00:35:00.600
Sandee A: I had so much hope and faith in the doctor that original and you done this.

304
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:10.500
Sandee A: You know, the doctor told me that he would see to it that I would dance again. Well guess what, I don't think I will.

305
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.290
Sandee A: I'm trying not

306
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.720
Sandee A: To be negative.

307
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:31.680
Sandee A: Overwhelmed I I can't shake it off. I don't know what to do about it. I can't sleep at night when I do sleep. I have nightmares I have.

308
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:38.850
Sandee A: flashbacks. When I coded on that table and

309
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.680
Sandee A: I mean, I can hear the screaming and we're losing, we're losing her

310
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.890
Sandee A: And I think because it's in front of me again.

311
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.120
Sandee A: That I'm going under the knife again I'm

312
00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.580
Sandee A: I'm so frightened.

313
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.030
Sandee A: I don't know. I can explain anything

314
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:17.550
Richelle Direny: I think it's because you're so frightened, like your, your fear.

315
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.570
Richelle Direny: Is making your anxiety goes through the roof.

316
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.570
Richelle Direny: Your fear and your anxiety is making it very hard to hold on to face.

317
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:35.250
Richelle Direny: Your fear, anxiety is making it hard to hold on to fake. So you're you're losing hope.

318
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:48.660
Richelle Direny: Because all all of that is doing is making you focus on the all of the what ifs in comparison to holding onto the chance

319
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.490
Richelle Direny: The hope.

320
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:54.600
Sandee A: That that is

321
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.860
Richelle Direny: Everything you say to me, everything when you're when I'm talking to you, you go back to

322
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:15.150
Richelle Direny: Everything that has happened that were negative everything and not to say that, you know, hey, this is negative, this is negative because it's not because it's a surgery that needs to happen. And this is what's really going on. So it's not negative, because it's not

323
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.420
Richelle Direny: We're not being negative because hey, you know what, this is what I'm going to be faced with in two weeks. I'm going to be doing this.

324
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.570
Richelle Direny: What it is for you. Is that your mind, it's very hard for you to grasp.

325
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:41.700
Richelle Direny: That they're going to put me under and it's almost like having PTSD, because you go back to I remember when I was on that table and I hate. Remember when I'm saying we're losing her we're losing her that's just playing in your mind.

326
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:43.770
Richelle Direny: And so

327
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.200
Sandee A: The little playing over and over in my mind is the doctor saying to me.

328
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:57.150
Sandee A: The bypass that you had back in December has failed. It's occluded.

329
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.020
Sandee A: Your options are limited.

330
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:07.170
Sandee A: Mm hmm. And there's only one thing left that we can do.

331
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.270
Sandee A: This is my last chance to save my legs.

332
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.970
Sandee A: But when we do this.

333
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:20.100
Sandee A: You have to understand that this surgery.

334
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:27.390
Sandee A: Um, the outcome could result in and there's a possibility. Oh.

335
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:38.190
Sandee A: She didn't talk to me about when the surgery is over with and rehabilitation and getting my legs stronger.

336
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.650
Sandee A: The main focus was what could go wrong.

337
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.730
Sandee A: And I'm having a hard time getting past that.

338
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.090
Richelle Direny: Is the, what can go wrong.

339
00:38:51.780 --> 00:39:02.700
Sandee A: The appointment. The majority of that appointment with her was, this could happen. This happen. And if this happens, you need to be prepared for this.

340
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:12.150
Sandee A: Not telling me that when we're finished, and everything starts getting better and you're going to be able to walk again she never said this things to me.

341
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:26.070
Richelle Direny: What would it be right to say that. Well, every time you go to the doctor and they tell you about, you know, these are the side effects. This is what could happen. This is if you do this, and they tell you everything

342
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:32.520
Richelle Direny: Don't we naturally go to everything that they tell us that they go wrong all the different side effects.

343
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.400
Sandee A: Not naturally

344
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:44.610
Sandee A: And I did. I was very attentive, isn't it, my daughter also was there with me, and she was attending and when we left there, she said.

345
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.000
Sandee A: Mom, I just got you back in my life. I'm not ready to lose you yet.

346
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:56.850
Sandee A: She doesn't want me to have this surgery, either.

347
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.660
Richelle Direny: So it sounds to me that your real fear.

348
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.280
Richelle Direny: Is

349
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.830
Sandee A: Low my real fear is dying.

350
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.980
Richelle Direny: Losing the possibility of

351
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:23.160
Richelle Direny: spending this time with your daughter because going back to my said it's the dying because of what happened in the past.

352
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:35.400
Sandee A: It's not just what happened in the past. It's the list that the doctor went through that.

353
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.410
Richelle Direny: All of it as you just said your fear your fear your real fear is dying.

354
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.250
Sandee A: Yes. And my daughter does not want me to go through with the surgery, she said she would be there for me if I do

355
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:35.940
Sandee A: But it's me going in a wheelchair and losing my legs is going to keep me or longer, she'd rather have me as being empty.

356
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:45.810
Richelle Direny: What, then, so the fear of the night with that piece of it comes from in out of the surgery.

357
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.790
Sandee A: I don't understand what you mean.

358
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:59.340
Richelle Direny: Because you said that your real fear of dying. Now, and you said that the list that the doctor went over that went through with

359
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:05.100
Sandee A: That she had more negative things to say than anything possible positive

360
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:13.110
Sandee A: It's a very complex and complicated surgery.

361
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.560
Sandee A: I mean, she's already told me that I will be having

362
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.260
Sandee A: Additional transfusions during the surgery.

363
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.490
Sandee A: Because I'll be bleeding out a lot.

364
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.210
Richelle Direny: Because of the car because of the arteries that they're going to be working on.

365
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.310
Richelle Direny: It is it is

366
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.650
Richelle Direny: Since knowing that have us been spending a little bit more time with your daughter.

367
00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:52.470
Sandee A: She was off yesterday and I tried to spend as much time as I could with her.

368
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.300
Sandee A: But

369
00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.630
Sandee A: It's hard to it's hard getting my Walker in the car and

370
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:20.280
Sandee A: You know, I can't ask her to come and sit here and just talk. She wants to be out and about and doing things and taking me to people to meet them and you know yesterday she wanted to take me to the church, so I can meet her pastor and the pastor's wife and

371
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:38.460
Sandee A: She took me to a place of employment and introduced me to her boss and every time we went and stop somewhere. It was getting in and out of the car and that just irritates and aggravates my hip and my legs.

372
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.740
Sandee A: To the point of my legs go totally numb.

373
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.440
Sandee A: And I can't tell her that

374
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.740
Richelle Direny: Did you did you

375
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.670
Richelle Direny: When you went to the fact that they pray with you.

376
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:55.740
Sandee A: Yes.

377
00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:04.290
Sandee A: I've been since I've been down here. I've been going

378
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:14.730
Sandee A: To the virtual church on Sunday mornings with my daughter. I just haven't been able to meet them face to face yet.

379
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.480
Sandee A: So, I mean,

380
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:27.480
Sandee A: They're actually people who are helping to maintain and pay for this room. The what I can't pay

381
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:40.290
Sandee A: I'm paying $100 a week. The room fees 250 a week.

382
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.340
Sandee A: Because I paid around 400 a month before

383
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:55.140
Sandee A: They saw our able to make arrangements with the owners of this motel.

384
00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:01.290
Sandee A: To where I paid $100 a week and they pay 150

385
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:10.770
Richelle Direny: OK, so the church is the church is helping you and everybody kind of their you have a little bit more way more to support

386
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:12.810
Richelle Direny: A lot more support.

387
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:21.090
Sandee A: I reached out to a helpline down here earlier today, just because I felt like I

388
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:34.770
Sandee A: Needed to talk to someone and my new care Navigator. I didn't even know I had a new one. But in speaking with her. I'm

389
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:44.130
Sandee A: I'm not in any way, shape, or form suicidal. I'm scared to death die, but

390
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.580
Sandee A: When I lay down and go to sleep. I

391
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:56.460
Sandee A: Some of my last thoughts that are if I don't wake up, then the pain will go away.

392
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.770
Sandee A: But almost like clockwork every two and a half or three hours.

393
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.410
Sandee A: I'm waking pain.

394
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.290
Sandee A: Is wearing me down.

395
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.830
Richelle Direny: You say you have faith. Do you believe in God.

396
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.770
Sandee A: Oh yes, absolutely.

397
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.060
Richelle Direny: Do you pray

398
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.910
Sandee A: I just didn't have an hour time processing everything and comprehending it all.

399
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:40.800
Sandee A: And

400
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.600
Richelle Direny: It's it sounds to me like it's hard for you to process it and comprehending it

401
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:56.430
Richelle Direny: This is what I'm hearing and just correct me if I'm wrong, you have a hard time because granted you've kind of gone down this medical world for a while. Kind of know that your things coming up.

402
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:04.950
Richelle Direny: You have a hard time processing comprehending it because know in just the last month, you have transitioned to

403
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:11.430
Richelle Direny: This, this new place where you're going to be spending more time with your daughter and you know guys going to work on just

404
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:19.860
Richelle Direny: Just building a better relationship between mother and daughter and all of that, knowing, even though you knew there were some medical things going on. And that you need.

405
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:32.850
Richelle Direny: Surgery, but now this is a big game changer and all you're thinking about is, I'm going to lose the opportunity to spend with my daughter. I'm gonna lose this I may die because of all of the things that they were telling you so now

406
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:43.290
Richelle Direny: Death is like what sits on the forefront of your brain. So because of that, it's just so hard to process everything and just kind of maintain the whole thing, keep faith and just look at

407
00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.820
Richelle Direny: The chair. They me popular you make you're getting

408
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.110
Sandee A: The bottom line is I need a miracle.

409
00:47:53.820 --> 00:48:04.800
Sandee A: I need a miracle. Because after this surgery and she told me that they're going to have to watch me very closely because I'm gonna have a hard time healing.

410
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:11.700
Sandee A: My legs have been deprived of oxygen rich blood and it could cause complications.

411
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.750
Hey,

412
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:17.040
Sandee A: I'm just

413
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.850
Sandee A: And this is all new to me. Also, I just am finding these things out this week.

414
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:29.370
Sandee A: I mean, yes, you're right. I'll come down here knowing what I needed to have my hip replaced

415
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.810
Richelle Direny: Your income, they're expecting to hear what you're hearing now.

416
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:35.040
Exactly.

417
00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:45.300
Richelle Direny: And so it's it's a lot to process because it's a it's a big transition. It's a whole lot of happening.

418
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.070
Sandee A: You know when when

419
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.390
Richelle Direny: It doesn't sound like a

420
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:59.790
Sandee A: fun night when anybody that I know is or even even a stranger. I'm going to use this as a scenario.

421
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:11.640
Sandee A: A lot of times yesterday. For instance, when I was at the hospital having lab work done. The woman said to me, go to your happy place.

422
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:15.330
Sandee A: And

423
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.930
Sandee A: When, when a person is in so much pain.

424
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:27.510
Sandee A: How can you think about taking a stroll in the park.

425
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:37.650
Sandee A: You know, or going on a long Sunday drive when your legs fall asleep just sitting

426
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.090
Sandee A: It's so hard.

427
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.440
Sandee A: To concentrate on good things.

428
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.390
Sandee A: Because the last year. My wife has been a living hell.

429
00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.310
Richelle Direny: It honestly I'm Sandy.

430
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.610
Richelle Direny: being around people to help because I think what's happening as well being home by yourself.

431
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:15.330
Richelle Direny: Over time just keeps your mind rolling just thinking about. That's all you can think about

432
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.700
Sandee A: Yeah, out of my diamond art. I don't have any more towards

433
00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.070
Sandee A: I'm sorry, that was sorry

434
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:30.780
You're fine.

435
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:40.470
Sandee A: You know I'm yesterday in group I have such a weak stomach and

436
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.580
Sandee A: I don't remember his name.

437
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.920
Sandee A: A key Akita

438
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:48.660
Sandee A: Or

439
00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:50.940
Sandee A: A deca or

440
00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:52.860
Richelle Direny: The

441
00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:54.660
Sandee A: Yeah.

442
00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:10.800
Sandee A: After you while you were talking them. And after you finish speaking them. I mean I save roles and I tried to learn while I'm in that session, but he kept spitting

443
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.350
Sandee A: Oh my gosh.

444
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.650
Richelle Direny: They are in the group.

445
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:17.910
Yes.

446
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.940
Richelle Direny: Oh, Mike up Spinning. Spinning

447
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:28.620
Richelle Direny: Yes. Oh. Oh, I know what you're talking about. I know what you're talking. I told him like he needs to stop.

448
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:37.620
Sandee A: Or you didn't, I didn't hear you tell him to stop spitting, but every time that that I see that it made it made me gag.

449
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.390
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes.

450
00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.230
Richelle Direny: You talking about my head.

451
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:45.540
Richelle Direny: Right. You're talking about the academics. Yes, I did. I did. I told him like your girlfriend. Yes.

452
00:51:46.890 --> 00:52:00.270
Sandee A: Oh, well, maybe you're sending the text I just to me that that took me back quite a few years and my kids when they were growing up, I'm a hillbilly I grew up in the woods barefooted

453
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:11.220
Sandee A: And when my kids would bring friends home from school or during the summer months. If they sit on my property. They had believe

454
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:27.390
Sandee A: And I'm because I walk in my bare feet. I don't want to step in your movie. And it's funny because the kids that I would discipline. I tell you gotta go. I don't nobody spits my yard.

455
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:35.160
Sandee A: They will always come back to me and apologized and tell me, I'll miss a really sorry. And we won't do it again.

456
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:47.040
Richelle Direny: I remember what it was, it wasn't a little. It was a little I did. I did. I did. I don't remember if it was a message I sent or I did, I did tell him. Like, could you not do that on the camera.

457
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.040
Sandee A: I don't think

458
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:57.690
Sandee A: I don't know, I, is it okay when I come to group and I leave my video off. I mean, I just

459
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:07.230
Richelle Direny: I would appreciate, like when you come in and you start off with your video on. And at some point, if you want to turn it off. You turn it off.

460
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:07.680
Richelle Direny: At least

461
00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:17.880
Sandee A: If I ever had anything to say. I will turn it on. But other than that, I mean, because I can just there was another fellow that was falling asleep and

462
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:38.700
Sandee A: I mean, I, I'm very observant. That's another thing I'm sure other people watch other people too. But I'm very punctual, and I don't know what happened this morning but remember a couple weeks ago you were telling everybody that we should check in up to six hours early and they would email.

463
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.590
Richelle Direny: Early yesterday.

464
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:48.780
Sandee A: Yeah, but I didn't get the at 625 last night, I got a message from telling me with ID.

465
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.630
Sandee A: Reality in the room.

466
00:53:52.320 --> 00:54:02.610
Richelle Direny: Yesterday, so this is the thing. Yesterday we especially with groups of individuals are different because individuals. The code is the same. It's the same every time we meet for individual

467
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:14.940
Richelle Direny: The groups. It's a little different because the groups, even though you check in really early. The code doesn't come available to you until maybe an hour half an hour to an hour before

468
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:24.990
Richelle Direny: If I'm in a sense. So like if I'm in a session right now. And my session goes over and I will have to ask them to generate a number for me and they will have to send it

469
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:37.050
Richelle Direny: And so I think that's what happened yesterday. That's what because everybody started flowing in. At the same time, because they had to send it for because I was in a session on my session literally ended at six o'clock.

470
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:45.660
Sandee A: Well I at 530 yesterday, I still hadn't gotten emails. So I went into virtual clinic and I actually took me almost

471
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:56.580
Richelle Direny: 40 minutes because what you said when you when you so like in a situation like that, if you because I know you check in, because you were the only one that checked in. As early as you did.

472
00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:09.390
Richelle Direny: I see that, you know, I saw that you checked in. So if, like, if I have the code and it's coming closer to the time and you say, Hey, I'm sitting here waiting and I don't have the I could send you to hold because then I saw that you sent you checked in. So

473
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:27.630
Sandee A: What I've been trying to come to the early sessions like noon on Thursday, but yesterday I was at the hospital, letting blood work done that very fact that that's what I did. While I was waiting for them to draw my blood was my survey, it took him three hours to get my boys.

474
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:30.360
Richelle Direny: Was a long

475
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:38.400
Sandee A: Before they had to keep putting hot compresses on my arm, and it was a slow process. And I got

476
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:45.450
Sandee A: Four different technicians an eight times I got poked

477
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.380
Richelle Direny: Know, wow. Maybe the technician didn't really know what they were doing.

478
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:56.490
Sandee A: No, I'm hard stick. I know that it then it's also because of the peripheral vascular disease.

479
00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.070
Sandee A: My veins are just

480
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:00.840
Sandee A: No good.

481
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:07.500
Sandee A: So listen, I really do appreciate you taking your time out.

482
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:12.060
Sandee A: To speak with me. And I don't mean to be so negative

483
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.640
Sandee A: But it's so hard.

484
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:24.540
Richelle Direny: It is, it is. And it listen, it is I can think about different times where I have been in situations where something is

485
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:32.460
Richelle Direny: take some deep breaths, take some deep breaths.

486
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:39.840
Richelle Direny: You sure you don't need to go to the ER.

487
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:52.350
Sandee A: No I when she called me and told me they see me I'd actually just lay down. Try and rest a little bit because I've been up all night.

488
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.970
Richelle Direny: So maybe that's what you need to do try to get some rest.

489
00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:02.250
Richelle Direny: Because your mind is all over active and everything. So maybe trying to get some rest is best

490
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.870
Sandee A: Yeah, I think I need that really bad.

491
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:07.890
Yes.

492
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:10.020
Richelle Direny: Yes.

493
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:30.090
Sandee A: So I don't know what happened yesterday. I'm Natalie sent a prescription into my drugstore and I got a text message because I have message alerts telling me that it was way too. It was too early to get my prescription

494
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.220
Sandee A: When she called my prescription in on

495
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:37.530
Sandee A: Mars it out here.

496
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:44.490
Sandee A: She called the last prescription and on this 14

497
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:51.450
Sandee A: She gave me 114 strips.

498
00:57:52.860 --> 00:58:06.240
Sandee A: This time they gave me 47 of them. And I have a refill that I get on June the 14th. So I didn't ask for a prescription yesterday. I didn't need one.

499
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:18.420
Sandee A: But evidently she generated a prescription anyway. And when I called the pharmacy. He said that what they would do is just keep it on file.

500
00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:23.820
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, I don't know.

501
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:28.530
Sandee A: I definitely won't. I asked for another prescription until I need it.

502
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:33.060
Richelle Direny: Oh, I think she'll be able to tell if you needed another prescription

503
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:39.810
Sandee A: Well, she should have been able to see that I she just gave me that TWO MONTHS SUPPLY Rochelle.

504
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:42.930
Richelle Direny: Or two months acquire

505
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.620
Sandee A: She gave me on May the 14th.

506
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:55.530
Sandee A: And can you see that it says 47 refills of 114 they gave me 60

507
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:03.090
Richelle Direny: Oh wow, okay. Yeah. So I'll let her know that that's it you don't

508
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:07.260
Richelle Direny: See here, let her know, You don't need another one.

509
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:23.310
Sandee A: Yeah, I won't ask for another one I get a refill, he said. On June 14 I'll get the balance of that refill and says she prescribed 114 I got 60 of those

510
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:30.300
Richelle Direny: Wow, that's a lot. Maybe, I don't know, I'm guessing that is somewhat of an error.

511
00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:37.830
Sandee A: Because I know I think that you she realized I mean I'm going through a lot right now and I did ask her to give me a little bit of

512
00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:47.730
Sandee A: Breathing Room because I knew I was going to be having these procedures and I didn't know about this procedure, but I know it's going to be having a hip surgery and stuff.

513
00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:58.680
Sandee A: And I have to talk to her on Monday about that. The anesthesiologist was trying to explain the difference between some box on the sub B tech

514
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:07.170
Sandee A: And that's she told me I needed to find out what he meant. Because she doesn't understand it either.

515
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:13.950
Sandee A: So I do have a call into the anesthesiologist, I know I will talk to him before Monday morning.

516
01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.490
Sandee A: Unless he worked on Saturday.

517
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.760
Sandee A: Tomorrow is my birthday.

518
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.890
Richelle Direny: Oh, happy birthday.

519
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:29.100
Sandee A: Right, I haven't celebrated a birthday in all my years but

520
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.390
Sandee A: Are you

521
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.670
Richelle Direny: What are you going to go by your, your daughter's

522
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:45.270
Sandee A: I'm actually tomorrow evening as my granddaughter's first softball game this year. So I'm going to go with them to the softball games.

523
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.190
Richelle Direny: Daughter has

524
01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.320
Richelle Direny: Been nice then

525
01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:58.020
Sandee A: Yes, I'm looking forward to it. And I'm hoping I can get enough for us up on my legs because there's flowing from the activity yesterday.

526
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:04.110
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I like I said it's you really need to, like, kind of get out. I think also

527
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:05.940
Richelle Direny: Um,

528
01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:12.330
Sandee A: Believe me, I go a whole lot more since I've moved down here. Then when I did and I was up north.

529
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:15.990
Richelle Direny: You mean go out

530
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:17.250
Yes.

531
01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:27.420
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I think, in light of everything going on now. I think it will be good for you to just kind of get out of the house kind of

532
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.050
Sandee A: Change.

533
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:39.150
Sandee A: Up the get my mind off and hoping that again another one of my diamond arts in the mail. They ordered more of them. I'm just get some do

534
01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:44.520
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. Yes, yes. To keep like distract yourself get

535
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.380
Richelle Direny: Out of your head just kind of

536
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:48.090
Richelle Direny: Just change it up.

537
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.520
Sandee A: Tonight I went several places down here and tried to find them and they don't sell new stores.

538
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.990
Sandee A: Probably have to go to the craft store to get one but

539
01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.250
Richelle Direny: What with all of the restrictions, it's gonna be hard to go to a craft or

540
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:06.120
Sandee A: They're slowly opening back up down here.

541
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.830
Richelle Direny: They are

542
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:12.750
Yes.

543
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:19.050
Sandee A: In the nail salons are back open now.

544
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.660
Sandee A: I checked it Myers and Walmart and

545
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.430
Sandee A: Came down here and they didn't carry him.

546
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:39.660
Richelle Direny: With them that. Yeah, I mean, but, you know, even if you find something else. You know, it's weird because like on your phone. They have like an app.

547
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:47.160
Richelle Direny: Because I've seen an act like that like a gaming app that was like that diamond art where you take it up and you just place it in different places.

548
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.470
Sandee A: And I've seen the pain.

549
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:54.630
Richelle Direny: Not the painting one. There's one that you pick up the different diamonds and you put it in the numbers.

550
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.830
Richelle Direny: And then it like form never seen. Yeah.

551
01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.640
Richelle Direny: They have something

552
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.610
Sandee A: Okay, well, you want to schedule another appointment or

553
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:10.050
