00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.540
Michael Hoefer: Hello.

2
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.500
Anna Bakhmatova: Thank you for meeting with me. I'm sorry. I look like absolute crap right now.

3
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.820
Michael Hoefer: Oh, it's fine, no problem. Can you hear and see me okay

4
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.160
Michael Hoefer: Perfectly. Okay, great.

5
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:23.700
Anna Bakhmatova: Just an FYI, at some point, I might need to like sneak away because my family's completely not understanding about my addiction and are completely against me using Suboxone and it's just been a nightmare.

6
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.100
Michael Hoefer: Oh wow, okay. So if that happens, what will what will happen.

7
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.510
Anna Bakhmatova: Just need a second or two, just so I can sneak away from the house for a minute.

8
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.830
Anna Bakhmatova: Okay, yeah.

9
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.720
Michael Hoefer: All right, well, um, anyway, I'm a psychiatrist working with Brian heartfelt, it's really nice to be to

10
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.710
Anna Bakhmatova: Teach you

11
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.090
Michael Hoefer: We will have about 30 to 40 minutes today to talk about your OB abuse but also your medical and psychiatric history.

12
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.040
Michael Hoefer: And come up with a plan together.

13
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.360
Anna Bakhmatova: Great, thank you.

14
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.410
Michael Hoefer: Okay, can you start by telling me how you heard about help

15
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:11.160
Anna Bakhmatova: Um, so I actually reached out to marine treatment center which is our local methadone clinic and right now it's kind of out of the question for me to go to a methadone clinic. My family's had me quarantine for 33 days at home.

16
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:20.220
Anna Bakhmatova: And I just can't leave the house is not an option. And I she actually connected me with Jeffrey at marine General Hospital here in our area.

17
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:28.800
Anna Bakhmatova: And he told me about bright heart and that that's an option, you know, to get it sent to my home, rather than going out. So this was just the perfect thing for me.

18
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:41.970
Anna Bakhmatova: And really trying to get clean. I've been on opiates for six years. And I just, I'm done. You know, I lost two friends last week to opiate overdose email, it's just it's a nice reality check that. I don't want to die at 30 you know

19
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.190
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and especially with you know better, they'll be more and more things. It's just

20
00:07:47.610 --> 00:08:01.110
Anna Bakhmatova: That's, that's what's scary. You don't know where the fentanyl is and you can easily overdose any minute. You know, so it's just scary and I don't want to lose my life and I'm trying to straighten myself up and get back on track. You know, so this is the best option.

21
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.560
Michael Hoefer: Excellent. Well, I'm glad you're getting connected and you've already given me a lot of really helpful information so

22
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.010
Michael Hoefer: We might be useful for me to start is kind of, when was the first time you ever had an opiate and what was it for

23
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.150
Anna Bakhmatova: That was about six years ago and it started with like it in the first year, but then like didn't wasn't strong enough. So my

24
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:30.480
Anna Bakhmatova: boyfriend at the time and I started using roxy's and then roxy's just became way too expensive of a habit because we were buying 15 and 16 pills a day.

25
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:41.130
Anna Bakhmatova: At 30 a piece, you know, so it was just way too much and so we switched to heroin. About two years ago. And we've just been using it since. And it's been so hard to get off of

26
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.500
Michael Hoefer: Having tried

27
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.480
Anna Bakhmatova: I've actually tried three different times and all three times. I ended up in the emergency room because it was throwing up so much. I couldn't breathe.

28
00:08:52.290 --> 00:09:04.260
Anna Bakhmatova: So I know I can't do this without Suboxone because I've actually tried Suboxone when I haven't had any opiates and it's the only thing that's helped me not feel the withdrawals, but not get high. At the same time, you know,

29
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.080
Michael Hoefer: Excellent. So it's been helpful for you in the past. What was the longest time you've been on Suboxone

30
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:22.770
Anna Bakhmatova: I'd say about two weeks, but then you know I'm surrounded by a bunch of users. You know, so obviously I just relapsed and just gave up on quitting completely, but with this quarantine have been alone, you know, and

31
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.180
Anna Bakhmatova: It's much, it's a great opportunity to stop. You know, there's no better time than now.

32
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.080
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, like that. It's like, it's like a silver lining trying to

33
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.880
Michael Hoefer: Like what's the

34
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:39.450
Anna Bakhmatova: What's the current crazy scenario of the world ending around this, you know, it would be the best time to start, you know,

35
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:50.970
Anna Bakhmatova: When I'm too scared to go to the hospital or anything, because at first, Jeffrey asked me to come to marine general hospital and they said, that's just out of the question. You know what a wonderful family at home and

36
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:57.540
Anna Bakhmatova: God forbid I get the corona, you know, and pass it along. I can lose a lot of family members right now and I don't want to risk that

37
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.160
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

38
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.840
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And then as far as the heroin use, how are you using the heroin.

39
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:14.340
Anna Bakhmatova: I just smoking. I've never shot up never want to. I know I would like it way too much and I'm way too scared that I would OD right away when I tried it. So it's been too scared to do it and I'm happy I never did it.

40
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:15.990
Anna Bakhmatova: Okay.

41
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:29.910
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, that's good. Yes. And do you, do you have any sense. Like when you guys, you know, get your heroin. Is there any sense of, do people say it's with it as fentanyl or not, or do you ever purposely by fentanyl. How does

42
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.120
Anna Bakhmatova: Run. So I actually I've learned

43
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.160
Anna Bakhmatova: It. I know it's horrible to say, and I'm doing my best to be honest, but it is embarrassing.

44
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.360
Anna Bakhmatova: I actually lived in San Francisco, most of my life and I know like the whole tenderloin area where all the drugs are

45
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.340
Anna Bakhmatova: And I've learned that if you go to the Hondurans they're the only ones that have the pure

46
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:59.100
Anna Bakhmatova: Black, you know, pure heroin and stuff that's not laced with fentanyl so I've been going to them for two years. And I mean, I've never overdosed have never

47
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.820
Anna Bakhmatova: never had any issues, you know, so I know I'm getting decent stuff that's not laced with fentanyl that's going to kill me. You know, so

48
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.360
Michael Hoefer: You seek out the Herald like specifically heroin.

49
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:21.630
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, I am too scared of fentanyl honestly I tried it once and I was scared. I was going to OD because of how many people are dying around me from it. So I just too scared to touch it and I've just been using heroin for two years.

50
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:31.320
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And can you just explain to me some of the ways that your heroin uses cause problems in your life like things that its cost you and

51
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:39.630
Anna Bakhmatova: So honestly, my whole life has fallen apart, since I've started using I had a really, really good job. I was getting 30 an hour.

52
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:50.460
Anna Bakhmatova: I was working full time and I lost the job because he was withdrawing at work. And I mean, people aren't stupid. They can see when you're not doing well, and especially when you're withdrawing, you can't

53
00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:02.130
Anna Bakhmatova: You know, you can't just put on a brave face and go to work and be fine. So I mean, they're not stupid. They knew what was going on. And it really hurt to lose that job because that was the highest paying job I've ever had.

54
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.540
Anna Bakhmatova: With no you know degree. So, it's, it's just disappointing and

55
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:17.160
Anna Bakhmatova: I've really let my family down. I know. My family's really disappointed in me but partially because they don't understand addiction at all. So that's really hard in itself. I live in Soviet Russia.

56
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:25.680
Anna Bakhmatova: With three generations of Russians in the house. You know, so they just have no emotion whatsoever and know understanding for addiction. So it's been really tough.

57
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.400
Michael Hoefer: They understand our holiday. No.

58
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:37.680
Anna Bakhmatova: No, I mean they've never really had issues with addiction in their life. You know, so it's harder for them to understand, but like, even with Suboxone my mom.

59
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:45.690
Anna Bakhmatova: Was fighting with me last week and saying, you're absolutely not going to use Suboxone and I tried to explain to her. It's not to get hired. So I'm not sick.

60
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.650
Anna Bakhmatova: Not definitely ill and I'm able to sleep and eat and drink, you know,

61
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:59.520
Anna Bakhmatova: Last week I went, four days without sleeping, eating or drinking because it was wrong with withdrawing so badly. So I ended up relapsing because there was no Suboxone obviously

62
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:11.640
Anna Bakhmatova: And I'm just scared because withdrawals are about to start again. And obviously my family can't see me withdrawing right now because they think I got past the worst of it, but they have no idea. You know, so it's just really tough.

63
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:18.420
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And, um, any, any legal issues at all from your obedience.

64
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:30.180
Anna Bakhmatova: Um, so, so I got a DUI for weed in California. When weeds legal which does not make any damn sense, especially since I was sober. When I got arrested. So that's just great.

65
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:39.420
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, the town. I live in. We have all the rookie cops in the whole Bay Area, you know, so their ticket hungry assholes pardon my French.

66
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:50.730
Anna Bakhmatova: But, but they just they completely screwed me over. They ruin my record with the weed DUI and then a couple months ago my ex my fiance right now. He

67
00:13:51.630 --> 00:14:07.230
Anna Bakhmatova: Actually, so I was really tired that day, this was like two months ago and I told him, please do not smoke in the car. I'm going to take a nap. I'm exhausted and some lady walked by and called the paramedics on us and said that I was odd from needles in my car.

68
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:15.210
Anna Bakhmatova: So I woke up to two empties at my windows asking me if I'm odd on needles and I just couldn't believe it, you know, and didn't take it seriously.

69
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.420
Anna Bakhmatova: And then right after they walked away two cops are at my window.

70
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:28.320
Anna Bakhmatova: And my my fiance has the foil on the floor. And I'm like, looking at him, staring at him with daggers, you know, like, cover it up, you know, don't get us caught right now.

71
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:35.730
Anna Bakhmatova: And the cop immediately looked at it and saw, and he's like, what is that, and my fiance lied and said it's hash.

72
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:52.380
Anna Bakhmatova: And then the officer just on my reaction and looked at me and said, so what really is that tell me the truth. And I told them was heroin and they handcuffed us in sadhus outside my car and they found my tiny piece of heroin. So I got to charge for heroin possession like

73
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.240
Anna Bakhmatova: Two months ago. Yeah, so it's

74
00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:02.820
Anna Bakhmatova: It's totally unfair to because it was actually being responsible and safe and not not using at that moment, you know, so it just really sucks but

75
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.600
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm I'm

76
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:12.930
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm slowly handling everything I have a lawyer. I'm trying to get through it right now. I actually am about to start DUI school. Once this pandemic is over. If it ever ends.

77
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:23.250
Anna Bakhmatova: So we'll see. And I'm paying restitution. Also, I mean it really sucks, but I'm doing what I can to get back on track. And this is one of the major steps I need to take

78
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.150
For

79
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.750
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever had an overdose, never. No.

80
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.130
Anna Bakhmatova: Never, never in my life.

81
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:30.690
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah.

82
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.820
Michael Hoefer: You've never injected so you

83
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:43.560
Anna Bakhmatova: Know, never, like I said, I'm too scared to inject I've seen people use it before in front of me and I see how high they get, you know, and just pass out immediately. And that's just scary to me. I can't get

84
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.320
Anna Bakhmatova: That high I'm too scared. I wouldn't wake up.

85
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.430
Anna Bakhmatova: And it's a whole different thing when you're shooting straight into your veins to as opposed to smoking so

86
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.300
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

87
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.440
Anna Bakhmatova: It's too scary for me.

88
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.170
Michael Hoefer: Know you use any other

89
00:15:59.460 --> 00:15:59.790
Michael Hoefer: Other than

90
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:12.450
Anna Bakhmatova: Just, just weed. Occasionally, and that's just to ease the you know the anxiety I have when I'm withdrawing, but there's an issue with that as well. My mom is completely against lead as well. You know, so it's just really hard for me.

91
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.220
Michael Hoefer: And give me that. Okay.

92
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:26.520
Anna Bakhmatova: You know, honestly mess. Occasionally. That was more recent because we were obviously we were smoking so much heroin each day that we were just cashing out

93
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:33.780
Anna Bakhmatova: All the time. You know, so we would just smoke a little bit of math with it, just to stay awake, but it's not like I'm severely addicted to it, you know.

94
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:43.410
Anna Bakhmatova: Meth head, you know. No, it's just so I would stay away, but I mean it's not an issue. I can stop, you know, no problem. But heroines big issue with me.

95
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.380
Michael Hoefer: Any homes.

96
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.200
Anna Bakhmatova: And not for like four years.

97
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:57.510
Anna Bakhmatova: Already has which is funny because before I was 21 I was drinking so much every day. And now that I'm like past 21 I'm just completely over it and

98
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.880
Anna Bakhmatova: You know, alcohol, just not my thing.

99
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.580
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, you got it out of your system.

100
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.110
Anna Bakhmatova: Well, yeah.

101
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.270
Michael Hoefer: Oh, yeah.

102
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:20.250
Anna Bakhmatova: Well, it's really funny too because you know my Russian family that's all they really do is drink vodka, you know, so all the family holidays everybody just has your mouth to the floor like on is not drinking right now really like no I don't want to drink.

103
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.880
Michael Hoefer: You smoke cigarettes tobacco.

104
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.270
Anna Bakhmatova: Cigarettes. Yes, that's been on and off since I was

105
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:35.430
Anna Bakhmatova: 12 honestly yeah really messed up story. My mom actually got me addicted to cigarettes 12 years old.

106
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.960
Anna Bakhmatova: she overheard that I had tried a cigarette at school. So she bought a carton of cigarettes and it just chain smoke that whole carton.

107
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:51.870
Anna Bakhmatova: And after that I just been hooked on cigarettes and it's hard to stop you know that's one thing that's like my crutch, you know, the only thing that's not getting me high that's like

108
00:17:52.290 --> 00:18:05.820
Anna Bakhmatova: You know, calming me down and or just like letting me relieve some stress for a few minutes and get away from whatever situation. And then, you know, so that's that's kind of out of the question of stopping right now, you know cigarettes are all I have.

109
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.900
Anna Bakhmatova: About half a pack a day right now. Okay. Yeah.

110
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:22.110
Michael Hoefer: Um, and I have you ever, you know, been diagnosed with them. You feel like you have any psychiatric mental health issues.

111
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.520
Anna Bakhmatova: Just anxiety. You know, I have really bad anxiety issues and

112
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:37.830
Anna Bakhmatova: I've had Xanax here in there just to calm me down because I've had severe anxiety attacks were literally just hyperventilating and crying and can't talk. So, I mean, the Xanax helps, but it's

113
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:46.020
Anna Bakhmatova: It's not even my prescription is my grandmas and I've never had my own prescription. And I know that's not legal. And I know I'm not supposed to be saying that but

114
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.510
Anna Bakhmatova: It's literally the only thing that helps me when I have major anxiety attacks and I actually want to get more

115
00:18:52.260 --> 00:19:03.630
Anna Bakhmatova: For myself, I want to get a prescription. I just don't know how to go about doing it. And honestly, I literally I'm in the middle of getting my medical renewed right now, so I don't even have insurance at the moment so

116
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.870
Michael Hoefer: Awesome. Okay, so you're out of pocket.

117
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:17.940
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, unfortunately, I got the prices from the pharmacist today for the Suboxone it. Oh my god, she was saying is 322 99 for 30

118
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.410
Michael Hoefer: Wow.

119
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.150
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, I

120
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.280
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm one of the

121
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:25.590
Michael Hoefer: Like

122
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.750
Michael Hoefer: What's up detects that'll be the cheapest that'll be just an orphan.

123
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.430
Michael Hoefer: But

124
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.520
Michael Hoefer: But that's usually if you're paying out of pocket. That's the best

125
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.470
Michael Hoefer: And then you just, you know, you don't have a

126
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.460
Michael Hoefer: History of inject

127
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.500
Michael Hoefer: With this, make sure you don't inject it okay with

128
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:56.430
Anna Bakhmatova: Absolutely not. No. No. Right. It's, I can't even believe people do that, you know, I just I can't even come to terms with that, honestly. Our team is actually telling me earlier, there's a clinic in Vallejo, that they will pay pay for the Suboxone for me so I don't have to pay for it.

129
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:12.420
Anna Bakhmatova: Oh yeah so I mean that's an option too. But the issue is, I don't have a car right now. And the lady was like 30 minutes for me and like I said and quarantined at home and my mom is just on me non stop. So I like it's it's hard to get out of the house.

130
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:14.790
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah.

131
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.060
Michael Hoefer: Um, so, how often do you have these panic attacks.

132
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:30.810
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm honestly it's pretty much when I don't have the heroin, because the heroin pretty much numbs me out and I don't feel any emotion, you know, and that's pretty much what the deal is of it to me all this time is just numbing out

133
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.410
Anna Bakhmatova: From my life and just not having a care in the world, you know, and

134
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.120
Michael Hoefer: Then

135
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.810
Michael Hoefer: Have the teenager before you started using

136
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:47.490
Anna Bakhmatova: Well, oh my god, I've been through a lot in my life. I've had a lot of trauma in my childhood. My parents divorced when I was 13

137
00:20:47.910 --> 00:21:00.000
Anna Bakhmatova: And my stepdad was an abusive alcoholic. So, I mean, it started early and I actually my mom sent me to rehab in the middle of the Nevada desert for 17 months for high school

138
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:06.570
Anna Bakhmatova: And I mean if you look up that school on Google right now. It literally says children's prison. So, I mean,

139
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.630
Anna Bakhmatova: That should just be an attest to what kind of school. It was

140
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:18.480
Anna Bakhmatova: So, I mean, I've had a lot of trauma and I managed to get through it, you know, but I mean I feel like that's where all the anxieties developed from over the years.

141
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.120
Michael Hoefer: It is the trauma been physical, emotional, sexual, all of them.

142
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:34.800
Anna Bakhmatova: I'd say all honestly. Yeah. And honestly, like a about six months ago, I actually got raped by my one of my dealers and

143
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.580
Anna Bakhmatova: That's just been eating away at me because I really have not many people to talk to you about it and it's really embarrassing, you know,

144
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:51.960
Anna Bakhmatova: So it's just been emotionally draining and I have taken Xanax in the last few days, just because it's like that keeps coming up, you know, and it's just hard to deal with.

145
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.770
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, it's terrible. Sorry.

146
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:09.630
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and especially that process can continue to drive the heroin use to number now and along you kind of avoided. Sometimes the bigger can get over that.

147
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.480
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, either more bottles up, the more it builds up

148
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.260
Michael Hoefer: Um, do you have things like nightmares or flashbacks, or things like that. I

149
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.710
Anna Bakhmatova: Actually, I have not had nightmares or dreams for

150
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:31.020
Anna Bakhmatova: I'd say since I started the opiate usage, six years ago, I haven't had a single dream or nightmare and kind of sucks. You know, I miss having dreams and

151
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.210
Anna Bakhmatova: Even nightmares. Honestly, I mean it feel like it's a healthy balance when you have nightmares in your life, but

152
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.500
Anna Bakhmatova: I haven't had either for about six years now, five, six years. Yeah.

153
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.380
Michael Hoefer: And how do you sleep. Okay.

154
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:55.860
Anna Bakhmatova: Right now, honestly. No, I'm not even sleeping. I mean like I told you I relapsed a few days ago and I just finished my stuff this morning. So this is back to square one day one of withdrawal.

155
00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:03.930
Anna Bakhmatova: So I just know already that I'm not going to sleep at all. Tonight, or the next four days, or five, it's just absolute hell, honestly.

156
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.920
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah.

157
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:15.870
Michael Hoefer: I'm okay. How about you know things like are you able to be in large crowds of people are you allow sound goes off.

158
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:22.530
Anna Bakhmatova: I actually prefer to be in large crowds, because I don't like being alone, very much. I've always been

159
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:30.300
Anna Bakhmatova: I don't know, that kind of seen person you know we're parties crowds, that's my thing. You know, I don't. I just don't like being alone.

160
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:38.790
Anna Bakhmatova: I like being surrounded by people. I like you know people distracting me from my head and my emotions and that's the best way to do it. You know, being surrounded by friends.

161
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:48.810
Anna Bakhmatova: So, I mean, the quarantine is really killing me in that sense to that I'm not getting any social interaction and I make like 1000 video calls a day but so over it.

162
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:56.970
Michael Hoefer: Okay, so then some kind of background history. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist or therapist.

163
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:02.190
Anna Bakhmatova: Before a long, long time ago and it was forced upon me by my Russian mother.

164
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:11.460
Anna Bakhmatova: So it wasn't even by choice, you know, is because I was a minor and she just forced me to start going, but after I turned 18 I stopped going, obviously.

165
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.560
Michael Hoefer: I mean it's it's

166
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.930
Anna Bakhmatova: It was a little bit helpful but like I told you, as I was in

167
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:28.350
Anna Bakhmatova: The rehab in the middle of the desert for 17 months that trauma has stayed with me because all they did is drill into your head about a and 12 steps, you know, and

168
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:35.040
Anna Bakhmatova: And therapy and all that 20 477 days a week, you know, so I mean I just I can't do that, you know,

169
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:46.560
Anna Bakhmatova: Traditional therapy anymore and that's why this program was so appealing to me because it's just a completely different you know take on opiate addiction and the different way to approach it, and they like this approach.

170
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:53.880
Michael Hoefer: Right, Greg. And have you ever been prescribed any like any depressants or anti anxiety medication.

171
00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.620
Anna Bakhmatova: I actually have not

172
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.980
Anna Bakhmatova: It's just a surprise. I've had a lot of anxiety medication. Over the years, but I've never had my own prescription

173
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:12.870
Anna Bakhmatova: And mainly because ever since I turned, you know, got past 26 and got off of my parent's insurance. I've had a lot of time where I just haven't had medical insurance, you know, just good I can't afford it.

174
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.450
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. And have you ever been on a 5050 or

175
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.500
Anna Bakhmatova: Never, never, I am proud to say I've never lost my mind like that.

176
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:27.000
Michael Hoefer: That's good. And have you ever had a suicide attempts.

177
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:27.870
Anna Bakhmatova: No, never.

178
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.070
Michael Hoefer: You have any medical issues that we need to know about.

179
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:45.000
Anna Bakhmatova: I just have Hs. We want an HST to herpes type one and two and that's from a previous partner who didn't tell me he was sick, and I found out from the doctor that I have it so.

180
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.120
Michael Hoefer: And you take like a security thing ever. For

181
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:55.440
Anna Bakhmatova: A cycle of area. Yeah, that's what I have and it's only for breakouts, you know, so it's not like I'm taking it every single day. It's just at this point it's been like

182
00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:04.620
Anna Bakhmatova: Seven years that I've had it, you know. So I just know my body and I know when it's starting to have an outbreak. So that's the only time may take it. But other than that, nothing else.

183
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.750
Michael Hoefer: You don't take any other medications or other supplements.

184
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.940
Anna Bakhmatova: Nothing, just the

185
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.510
Anna Bakhmatova: Heroin and occasional Xanax when my grandma gives me some to

186
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.140
Anna Bakhmatova: Calm down.

187
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.480
Michael Hoefer: In the surgical history right surgeries.

188
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.120
Anna Bakhmatova: No, no surgeries, knock on wood.

189
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.000
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah hopefully I don't break anything

190
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.750
Michael Hoefer: He allergy medication.

191
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.540
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Oh, some more background questions. Where were you born. Where did you grow up.

192
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:46.320
Anna Bakhmatova: I grew up. I was born in Moscow, Russia and we moved to San Francisco in 1995 and I grew up in San Francisco, and we moved to Novato, about six years ago.

193
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:59.970
Anna Bakhmatova: And it's like 35 minutes away from San Francisco and my mom partially did that to get me away from all my old friends and the old crowds. But I mean it didn't really work because we're all still friends. I just live further away and it's much more convenient.

194
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.950
Anna Bakhmatova: Harder to make friends when you're at 30 years old and you just get dropped into a brand new town, you know, and no absolutely no one

195
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.970
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah, it's not really far enough away, either.

196
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.260
Anna Bakhmatova: But yeah, yeah, that's

197
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.880
Michael Hoefer: Valley, so I

198
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:22.290
Anna Bakhmatova: Know I'm over here telling you, like, oh, it's over here, this far away from the city and you're right next to me or my neighbor.

199
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:29.370
Michael Hoefer: Yeah so. So yeah, it's not really, I understand, you know, the thought. But it's far enough away.

200
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.350
Michael Hoefer: Okay, how far along.

201
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.300
Anna Bakhmatova: Would you say I'm sorry you broke up.

202
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.480
Michael Hoefer: On overall how how far along. Did you go in school.

203
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:48.270
Anna Bakhmatova: I actually graduated high school and I did about four years of Community College and then just gave up.

204
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:57.720
Anna Bakhmatova: Okay. Yeah, but I have like it. I mean, I'm pretty much halfway done with my general education degree. So, I mean, at least I have some college under my belt.

205
00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.820
Michael Hoefer: And how was school for you.

206
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:11.340
Anna Bakhmatova: Um, it was really anxiety ridden, it was a little much. You know, it's just overwhelming because of you know what what's expected of you in school and just staying consistent with the

207
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:19.860
Anna Bakhmatova: Schedule every single day. I mean, I was going to school full time, I was taking five classes like 40 units a semester. So it was just insane, you know,

208
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.740
Anna Bakhmatova: And it was just getting to be too much and it was mainly because my mother pressured me to go and

209
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:37.500
Anna Bakhmatova: There's just more to appeal to her and make her happy. But it's always been such an anxiety ridden thing for me. But I've always managed to get good grades. I mean, I have a 4.0 GPA and in community college so

210
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:45.840
Anna Bakhmatova: I mean, that's good. But as you can't motivate myself to get back, especially with opiate addiction. It's really hard to even think about school. You know, so

211
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.550
Michael Hoefer: And what was the work that you were doing earlier that

212
00:28:50.700 --> 00:29:02.880
Anna Bakhmatova: It was it was a construction company. And I'm actually I have a lot of experience in the legal field in the accounting field. I've done all kinds of work than actually pretty smart. When I don't do drugs, you know, so

213
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:10.680
Anna Bakhmatova: I mean, I've got a head on my shoulders and I have great resume, but with opiate addiction, it's just completely screwed me over and

214
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:17.070
Anna Bakhmatova: I lost all my chances to have a successful career right now with opiate addiction and

215
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:24.690
Anna Bakhmatova: I honestly can't. It's really unfair. I can't even get a decent job right now because every time they run my background check when I'm about to get employed.

216
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:31.080
Anna Bakhmatova: After the interview went great. And everything the DUI comes up in the background check, and then they just don't give me the time of day again.

217
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.980
Michael Hoefer: And any have you ever been married any kids anything

218
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.400
Anna Bakhmatova: Nope, not married, no kids, thank God.

219
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.050
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm sorry if you have kids, I'm sorry, but

220
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:48.990
Anna Bakhmatova: Really not the time.

221
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.670
Michael Hoefer: 38 so I

222
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:52.980
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah.

223
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.050
Michael Hoefer: And I understand people not having kids.

224
00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:00.450
Anna Bakhmatova: I mean, with a I just can't see myself having a child as a drug addict. You know, so

225
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:08.550
Anna Bakhmatova: I couldn't do that to my child. I mean, after what I've been through, even with my, you know, a call, except that I could never see myself doing that to get, you know,

226
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:09.450
Well,

227
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.290
Michael Hoefer: And how do you support yourself financially. These days, you get

228
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.080
Anna Bakhmatova: Honestly, I started

229
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:22.590
Anna Bakhmatova: hustling. About two years ago. I like I told you I go to only the Hondurans in the Tenderloin

230
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:30.030
Anna Bakhmatova: And I figured out a hustle for myself where I haven't. I've literally not paid for heroin for the last two years, and they get a gram a day.

231
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:43.680
Anna Bakhmatova: And that's because I started driving the dealers from Oakland to San Francisco, so they can work on in the Tenderloin and then at like 3am and drive them back to Oakland and they give me a gram pay for my gas pay for my food pay for everything I need. You know, so

232
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.890
Anna Bakhmatova: That's what this part of the reason why it's been so hard to stop. You know, it's completely different when you get everything for free.

233
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.950
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, so it makes it that much harder.

234
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.160
Michael Hoefer: But it sounds like it's also gotten increasingly at least without one time increasingly safe.

235
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:13.140
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I actually haven't talked to that dealer. Again, I have. It's really bad. I'm at the point where if they just want down Turk and hide there's 30 people calling my name out to me. You know, it's really bad.

236
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.220
Anna Bakhmatova: It's really bad.

237
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:23.730
Michael Hoefer: Oh yeah okay and then family history anybody in your family with a history of psychiatric issues that you know

238
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:33.600
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm honestly my grandma has really really severe anxiety and that's why she has a Xanax, you know, but she's like

239
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:50.310
Anna Bakhmatova: I don't even know if she's bipolar or what but she's very unstable and she I think all of my history, my medical history comes from her, you know, and I feel like it's it's been passed down to me, you know, and I feel like I relate to my grandma in that sense.

240
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.520
Michael Hoefer: So you guys, so she's a support for you guys.

241
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.540
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, yeah, but lately. She's just, you know, my mom's been

242
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:12.480
Anna Bakhmatova: Blah, blah, blah, in her ear. You know, so my grandma was completely against the Suboxone to but I mean, the first time I mentioned it before she talked to my mom, she said, I'll pay for the Suboxone program and then she talked to my mom and came back and said I'm not getting used to boxing.

243
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.800
Anna Bakhmatova: You know, so

244
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.680
Michael Hoefer: And do you have any siblings.

245
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:26.820
Anna Bakhmatova: I have a little sister. It's been really hard for me, you know, she's not stupid, she can see me withdrawing and that's part of the reason why I'm so scared to start withdrawing again because I don't want her to see that.

246
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.680
Anna Bakhmatova: And I don't want her to know what her sister has been doing, you know, she's 13 years old and

247
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.420
Anna Bakhmatova: I don't want to be that example.

248
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.110
Anna Bakhmatova: You know that she's, of course, they know she's looking up to me and they just don't want her to know what I'm doing.

249
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.060
Michael Hoefer: This is a good motivator.

250
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.880
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, yeah. Oh, big, big, big, big motivator.

251
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:51.390
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Excellent. Well, those are the main question that need to ask you for intake process.

252
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.530
Michael Hoefer: To see you being so forthcoming and honest about it. Yeah.

253
00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.400
Anna Bakhmatova: No thank you. It's nice to actually talk to someone that's not you know a friend that's not going to judge me and just can hear me out and

254
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.480
Anna Bakhmatova: Let me talk

255
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.150
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah. Um. And was there anything that I left out or anything.

256
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:20.040
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, so I just had a question a couple of questions. I noticed that I got in the email but I have to do a blood test and I don't know how I'm going to do that. Honestly I can't get out of the house.

257
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.740
Anna Bakhmatova: I have no idea how I'm going to do that.

258
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.560
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about that now.

259
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.770
Michael Hoefer: I think with the shelter in place, things are people are

260
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.030
Anna Bakhmatova: A bit more lenient

261
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.930
Michael Hoefer: And you're paying out of pocket, and I think that's just not

262
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.720
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

263
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.320
Michael Hoefer: Okay, and I'll put I'll put in my notice kind of that we spoke about it.

264
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:51.060
Anna Bakhmatova: Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. And so what would the next steps be like, what would we have another video conference in like a week or something, or how, how does the process work from here.

265
00:33:51.330 --> 00:34:00.270
Michael Hoefer: Great question. So what I can do is once we get off the line here is I can put it on an electronic prescription or Suboxone to you to remember pharmacy you like

266
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:07.140
Anna Bakhmatova: Preferably CVS and 2035 Novato Boulevard, because it's like two blocks from my house.

267
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.700
Michael Hoefer: Great. Okay.

268
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:21.000
Anna Bakhmatova: And is it possible, I know that. I mean, I told you I've used Suboxone before in the past. I actually really prefer the sublingual film as opposed to the pill, just because it's hard for me to swallow pills.

269
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.600
Michael Hoefer: Yes, I'm totally fine with that.

270
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.790
Michael Hoefer: It's just a matter of it may be more expensive.

271
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:37.560
Anna Bakhmatova: I already discussed all the pricing and everything. And actually, the pharmacist gave me a tip and showed me a website where they have coupons for Suboxone

272
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.830
Anna Bakhmatova: Depending on how much you're going to prescribe me I'll get I have like all the coupons for each

273
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.740
Anna Bakhmatova: Amount each quantity of Suboxone you know

274
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:47.640
Michael Hoefer: Oh, cool.

275
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.360
Anna Bakhmatova: All right, yeah.

276
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.310
Michael Hoefer: You got he got this off that

277
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:59.550
Anna Bakhmatova: Yes, I've got it all figured out I well I mean what what the people that were doing my intake earlier and setting up my appointment with you. They told me you know get prepared for your appointment.

278
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:09.900
Anna Bakhmatova: And go ahead and call pharmacies ahead of time, get the prices figured out so you know which which pharmacy want it sent to for the doctor so I mean I'm just making your process a little easier.

279
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:19.800
Michael Hoefer: Yes, I appreciate that. Great. So, um, so, yeah, I can give you the film's for the intake appointment. I can only give you one week of prescriptions.

280
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.020
Anna Bakhmatova: Okay. Okay, so that's seven right

281
00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:27.150
Michael Hoefer: Yes, I will do is, I'll give you 14 films. So you walk into a day.

282
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.740
Anna Bakhmatova: 14 pounds. Okay, and

283
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.070
Anna Bakhmatova: Is that, is that the eight milligram or the formula grammar.

284
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.240
Michael Hoefer: Eight milligram film.

285
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.530
Anna Bakhmatova: Okay. Okay, great.

286
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:39.690
Michael Hoefer: And the way you want to start them is remind me when the last time you had any opiates was

287
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.150
Anna Bakhmatova: This morning. This morning was the last time.

288
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.690
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha.

289
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:47.430
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, so I mean like I told you if I if I can't get the prescription. Today I'm

290
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:56.430
Anna Bakhmatova: Definitely going to be in withdrawal tonight for the night, but I'm hoping I can sneak out at some point and get to the pharmacy two blocks away and get it.

291
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.350
Michael Hoefer: And how long in the past that you waited till you took your first Suboxone

292
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:15.810
Anna Bakhmatova: I actually every time I've had Suboxone it's always been right when I'm like looking for heroin. You know, so it's not just been like, to the point where I'm withdrawing terribly before I take it in. It's before the withdrawals start getting really bad.

293
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.410
Michael Hoefer: Okay, and you've been bond. You've never precipitated withdrawal.

294
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.730
Anna Bakhmatova: No, no.

295
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:21.570
Great.

296
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:31.050
Michael Hoefer: So the last time we did it this morning we usually recommend so you get into mild to moderate withdrawal, probably by this evening, great. If not tomorrow morning.

297
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.900
Anna Bakhmatova: Okay, yeah.

298
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:43.410
Anna Bakhmatova: Let me, let me just see one second. Sorry, I'm going to see how much 14 are going to be. I have the coupons right here. So yeah, with the coupon. It's only 3982 for a week.

299
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.460
Anna Bakhmatova: Cool. So it's not bad at all. I mean, she really came through for me.

300
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.990
Anna Bakhmatova: Telling you that little secret.

301
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.450
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, just say that my my

302
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.740
Michael Hoefer: Electronic health record here it's showing like prescription saver coupon.

303
00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.040
Anna Bakhmatova: Here. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. So I mean, as opposed to $322 that's much better.

304
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.940
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, so I can put that in. And then, you know, just before you take them no food or drink for 15 minutes

305
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:09.360
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah.

306
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:17.700
Anna Bakhmatova: Yeah, just so it can dissolve and everything. Yeah, I know, I know, I know how the process works. I've actually I did the Methadone clinic for like two weeks and

307
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.810
Anna Bakhmatova: Driving to Richmond at seven in the morning, every day. And that just not working out for me, you know, it's just too much.

308
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.190
Michael Hoefer: Okay, that's good. I'm really excited about this program.

309
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.790
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Have you ever tried on track zone at all the

310
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:46.830
Anna Bakhmatova: I have an honestly Suboxone my main preference. Honestly, it's the only one that doesn't get me high but it just like cancels out the withdrawals. You know, so I just feel normal. You know, I don't feel like I'm on opiates and I just don't get sick and

311
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.090
Michael Hoefer: Make the shot.

312
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.230
Michael Hoefer: Oral Naltrexone

313
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.520
Michael Hoefer: That world. Oh.

314
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.730
Anna Bakhmatova: They gave it to me at the hospital, one time and

315
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.740
Anna Bakhmatova: I mean it didn't like it. It everything. But Suboxone it's just not for me.

316
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:04.590
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Do you have any questions about side effects from Suboxone or how long to stay on it or

317
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:10.170
Anna Bakhmatova: Anything. No, no. I mean, it's pretty clear. I've done my research on it. I've taken it enough times to know

318
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:25.710
Anna Bakhmatova: How it works and everything, but I am really, really excited that this is this is my program. I'm in this program. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. It's, it's just major I've actually gotten a few other friends into this program in the last few days to so

319
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:26.670
Michael Hoefer: Cool.

320
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:32.250
Anna Bakhmatova: Trying to help as many people as I can. Right now it's like my quarantine goal right now is to save my friends lives.

321
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.180
Michael Hoefer: And is your end as far as your Fiance's you can get into.

322
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.920
Anna Bakhmatova: I'm actually about to get in touch with Jeffrey after we get off the phone so I can get

323
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:49.920
Anna Bakhmatova: Him into the program as well. I'm trying to get them into Bret Hart as well because he's also quarantined at home and can't leave. So hopefully he gets to talk to you as well.

324
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.660
Michael Hoefer: Oh cool, that'd be great.

325
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.730

Michael Hoefer: Patrick. OK, Jerry.

328
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.660
Anna Bakhmatova: Jeffrey's my connection that connected me to Bret Hart.

329
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:01.710
Cool.

330
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.890
Anna Bakhmatova: Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it.

331
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.530
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, absolutely. So, um, I will, I will go put in the prescription. Now, it's very nice meeting you.

332
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.740
Anna Bakhmatova: Very nice to meet you too. I hope we get to have another appointment soon.

333
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:18.570
Michael Hoefer: Yes i. So, I will have a one unfortunate thing about that is I am only doing intakes

334
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.410
Anna Bakhmatova: Oh,

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.310
