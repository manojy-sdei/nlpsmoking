00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.360
Richelle Direny: went on for all day, no matter where I went. It was the same was like it rained on Florida all day yesterday.

27
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.070
Donita McClintic: Called theory, it's really cold here today.

28
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.130
Donita McClintic: Oh, especially like a high 50

29
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.780
Richelle Direny: You know what, that's

30
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.460
Richelle Direny: It's funny because

31
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.080
Richelle Direny: I was talking to my brother. He lives in

32
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.860
Richelle Direny: Was it him. I think in Louisiana. What I think it was him who said that it was very cold there, but it seems like the weather.

33
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:21.360
Richelle Direny: No, no, he just said it was really it was the sun was out and it was beautiful. But whoever I had spoken to his said like the weather. It was really cold, but it just seems like the weather is a little bit more

34
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.980
Richelle Direny: Than usual i mean i don't know in those states that it gets it's cold.

35
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:39.030
Richelle Direny: I don't know how it is this time of year, but I know here. It's kind of like there were some days even in the past weeks where the evenings was really cool and nice and typically it's not like that.

36
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah we coming out of spring.

37
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.160
Richelle Direny: And summer because we're getting ready to go into some

38
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:55.380
Donita McClintic: Right well here in Ohio kind of feels like we're going out of winter going to be going into summer like our spring keeps going back and forth. Yeah.

39
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.210
Richelle Direny: Yeah, like what winter day

40
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.000
Richelle Direny: Yes, that's what that's what my brother who was I spoke with my mother. And she said,

41
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.860
Richelle Direny: Where she was like in upstate New York, and there were different places that were. It was actually smoke. She said there in the city.

42
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.150
Richelle Direny: It like yeah the snow would come down, but by the time it hit the floor, it would melt.

43
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.040
Donita McClintic: But she said her further right

44
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.470
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it was like they had snow on the ground. It was like a lot of snow on the ground so she was like it was really cold.

45
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.630
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah

46
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.040
Donita McClintic: It's crazy for me.

47
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.400
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yeah, which again like I've never lived in, you know, in a cold state. I've always lived in Florida, so

48
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.530
Donita McClintic: It. Well, you're lucky.

49
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.690
Richelle Direny: And you know here.

50
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.620
Richelle Direny: Robbing

51
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.320
Richelle Direny: And you know here. It's always like really

52
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.340
Richelle Direny: So whatever it whenever it gets like 60 like we're all going for the win rate the bubble jackets in the boots and the gloves. I

53
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.510
Know, that's funny.

54
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.640
Richelle Direny: says, oh, we don't ever see here people's wearing shorts.

55
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.320
Richelle Direny: I know, I know. And so

56
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.820
Richelle Direny: If people come

57
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.650
Richelle Direny: Year, we're not used to that weather so

58
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.280
Richelle Direny: I mean I wouldn't really say we had much of a winter.

59
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:17.550
Richelle Direny: If we do have two or three consistent days of cold day, it's like we're all excited. Yeah, but it's not like very we get calls. I personally say they're cold snaps that we get maybe different parts of the state.

60
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.300
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

61
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.780
Richelle Direny: They're a little colder and I think like last year, I want to say if it wasn't last year was the year before, like in Tallahassee

62
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:37.410
Richelle Direny: That's where it was. I think I want to say they had snow. Calm down. It was like I had gotten that. So, BUT I GUESS YOU'RE GOING CLOSER like the further up in the state you go

63
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.600
Donita McClintic: LIKE GOING CLOSER TO GA. Yeah.

64
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.170
Richelle Direny: Here it will be a little colder than south, south Florida like where

65
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.630
Richelle Direny: We're at yeah

66
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.250
Richelle Direny: Look at the United States.

67
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.990
Further, yeah.

68
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.640

Donita McClintic: And I'm sure she is yeah I all of them, all of us.

86
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.970

Richelle Direny: That's how did it feel for you.

89
00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.660
Richelle Direny: I mean around with your mother, but with your sisters because if you're saying it's five years since you guys are all together.

90
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.500
Um,

91
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:11.070
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I kind of redrew myself a little bit, just because there's so much chaos so much noise because

92
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:23.520
Donita McClintic: There's five of us girls. Then you put their people with them. And then there's like 20 some grandkids it in it. I can't it just drives me nuts. So I kind of like step back for a little bit by myself.

93
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:38.190
Donita McClintic: And watch TV with Kayla Like I played with Kayla with my niece, but my, my cousin, I should call her my sister, my mom's raising her. But yeah, so I just say back and played with her this medicine is so disgusting.

94
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.280
Donita McClintic: That strips.

95
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.810
Donita McClintic: It and it's disgusting and

96
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.450
Donita McClintic: I just know him taking my Suboxone it's, it's got to dissolve under metallic it's

97
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.640
Donita McClintic: It's gross.

98
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.920
Richelle Direny: So why don't you do you weren't doing

99
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.170
Donita McClintic: My pharmacy changed the strip

100
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:07.560
Donita McClintic: I was, but they take so long to dissolve it. I mean, I had a quarter of a pill under my mouth. One time for almost a half an hour.

101
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:18.420
Donita McClintic: I couldn't do it. Yeah, I couldn't do the pill. So she switched me to the films and they go, they dissolve a whole lot quicker but there's so

102
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.010
Donita McClintic: All of this nasty, it's all, it's all sick, but

103
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.530
Donita McClintic: I but I'm not sick so

104
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.030
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

105
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.860
Donita McClintic: So I do it every morning.

106
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:46.290
Donita McClintic: But they just the pharmacy switch to like a generic kind of something and they're not. I could tell a difference in them. I could definitely tell the difference in them day like I'll start to kind of have withdrawal symptoms. I was like, oh no, they need to switch them back.

107
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.250
Donita McClintic: It's the pharmacy is not the doctor, you would

108
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.500
Donita McClintic: Get like they'll get a cheaper.

109
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.270
Donita McClintic: Yeah, they get

110
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:04.680
Donita McClintic: X THE SAME milligram and stuff. I just think it's someone different that's making them like the pharmacy order to cheaper batch or something, I don't know.

111
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.770
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.560
Donita McClintic: Because it was taking your second to respond to me. And it wasn't it's not been like that at all.

145
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:14.970
Donita McClintic: I had mine.

146
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.830
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

147
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.930
Donita McClintic: So I was like to be a delay.

148
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.060
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

149
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:21.510
Yeah.

150
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:31.980
Donita McClintic: I don't forget tomorrow. It's probably just supposed to be like a cleaning and do X rays and then they'll still be up an appointment to get them pulled and then I'll have fake ones.

151
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.630
Richelle Direny: Um,

152
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.780
Richelle Direny: So are you. Hi, this is not the ones are going to get

153
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:43.200
Donita McClintic: Yes, but I'm nervous. Like, I feel sick to my stomach because my nerve like I'm terrified of a dentist.

154
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.020
Donita McClintic: But what about what is it

155
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.670
Richelle Direny: What is it for you. This

156
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.420
Richelle Direny: theory about the

157
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.470
Donita McClintic: experiences I've had before with them.

158
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.670
Richelle Direny: Is like

159
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.080
Richelle Direny: You're going to

160
00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:11.340
Donita McClintic: Yep. And it takes a lot to know me like they have to do it a couple times. I've had one, it would be no man went away for like two hours and came back and put it in it. Yeah, so well. He waited too long, but I'm just scared. I just don't like it at all.

161
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:18.030
Richelle Direny: So I think, you know, just being upfront and honest about, you know, the experience

162
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.790
Richelle Direny: With the dentist. I think because, I mean,

163
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.660
Richelle Direny: I'm not gonna sit here and make it seem nice. I don't

164
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:25.890
Richelle Direny: Either

165
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.390
Richelle Direny: But I know I have to go.

166
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.920
Richelle Direny: I really tried here.

167
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.920
Richelle Direny: And when they have this big ridiculous needle that

168
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.920
Richelle Direny: They pulling you're putting your gum to numb it and then they're sitting there doing the shaking thing like you can't feel

169
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.710
Richelle Direny: The pinch of the needle. Oh, we got

170
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.420
Richelle Direny: To doing I still feel it.

171
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.820
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, but then

172
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.450
Richelle Direny: You know your

173
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.640
Richelle Direny: Your whole mouth and sometimes depending on the

174
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.430
Richelle Direny: Person, sometimes it takes to have those shots.

175
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.450
Richelle Direny: And then you're too numb and then take forever for to come back. The feeling comes

176
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:08.460
Richelle Direny: Back. Yeah. So I would say just just be upfront and honest, um, I was wondering if like part of outside of the scariness of

177
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.830
Richelle Direny: Pulling in the past experiences.

178
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.410
Richelle Direny: Is it just like the anticipation of what everything is going to look like afterwards.

179
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.730
Richelle Direny: Because like you said like

180
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.000
Richelle Direny: Your mouth. It's like your teeth and everything is one way now.

181
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.380
Richelle Direny: To the end and

182
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.910
Richelle Direny: The whole idea or concept.

183
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:30.030
Richelle Direny: Of removing all of it and then having to put new ones in it's like the anticipation of it.

184
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:35.610
Donita McClintic: All yeah yeah I'm excited. And I'm nervous. And I'm scared. All

185
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.870
Donita McClintic: About everything

186
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:44.670
Richelle Direny: At one time, I, I got you, because it's like it's the what you look like. Now the process.

187
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.440
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and then the end result. And then you're thinking in your head. I want to have

188
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.830
Richelle Direny: A look like, what is it gonna be like all of this different stuff.

189
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.020
Richelle Direny: So it's the right now and then it's the

190
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.620
Richelle Direny: Process and the process is a little bit more scarier like

191
00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.430
Donita McClintic: Um, there was

192
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.270
Richelle Direny: One guy who

193
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.280
Donita McClintic: I think he had to have surgery on

194
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.310
Donita McClintic: His hand and he never, you know, been put to sleep before

195
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.820
Richelle Direny: He ever

196
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.970
Donita McClintic: Until I said to him, I was like, listen, it's not as bad as your

197
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.250
Richelle Direny: Your mind is making because your mind, load up like a balloon and so

198
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.740
Richelle Direny: You're thinking about all these crazy things.

199
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.830
Richelle Direny: And I said, so then afterwards, I said, So how was it was like, oh,

200
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.760
Richelle Direny: After they put me to sleep and they won't be up I was

201
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.140
Richelle Direny: Like like

202
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.050
Donita McClintic: I said,

203
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.200
Richelle Direny: Before a few hours of your life.

204
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.980
Richelle Direny: It was put on pause and then here it is so

205
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.390
Richelle Direny: But in this case. And then the other thing about the dentist is they don't have to to sleep.

206
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.290
Richelle Direny: You're awake through all that call game you're pulling in all of that.

207
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:44.790
Richelle Direny: But

208
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:45.210
Donita McClintic: Again,

209
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.870
Richelle Direny: It's just thinking about, you know, if this is a new dentist.

210
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.010
Richelle Direny: You know, put a little hoping that dentist.

211
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.270
Richelle Direny: But also expressing your past experience because

212
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.810
Donita McClintic: Yeah, if you don't express your past experiences and just letting them know

213
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.830
Richelle Direny: The things that you're nervous about they're just going to go do whatever they want.

214
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.180
Richelle Direny: So, like, one of the things like I usually say to the dentist. Like if

215
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.530
Richelle Direny: I'm going to get a two score.

216
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.780
Richelle Direny: Or whatever the situation is I would always

217
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.080
Donita McClintic: Say,

218
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.920
Richelle Direny: You know, sometimes it really takes to have those things, those notifications injections or whatever it is, sometimes it takes to

219
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.500
Richelle Direny: For me to really go know right

220
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.860
Richelle Direny: And usually they do it in like maybe leave for like 510

221
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.150
Richelle Direny: Minutes and they'll constantly keep

222
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.750
Richelle Direny: Checking like

223
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.640
Donita McClintic: You can you feel it. Can you feel it until

224
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.870
Richelle Direny: You're numb. So I would just express to them, letting them know

225
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.090
Richelle Direny: How you feel

226
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.400
Richelle Direny: And just as to how nervous, you are or what have you.

227
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.240
Richelle Direny: Suggest at least ease your mind.

228
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.630
Donita McClintic: Well, I know that sometimes if you're like when they go to pull them, they'll give you, um,

229
00:15:49.950 --> 00:16:00.270
Donita McClintic: I think they give you like a couple hundred pills to take before you come if they're not going to knock you out, so I'll have to let if they do that, I will know that till tomorrow if they're going to give out to let Dr. James to know

230
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:06.750
Donita McClintic: That so I don't fail drug test if they if they even do that. I'm not sure if they do or not. But if they do, I'm doing it.

231
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.540
Richelle Direny: Is this your first time ever, I'm getting dental work like this major dental

232
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.430
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

233
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.660
Donita McClintic: Major. Yes.

234
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:27.810
Donita McClintic: I'm mad like cheeseboard um yeah so this will be like, and it shouldn't take much because they're rolling out anyway where I been punched in my face by man.

235
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.410
Donita McClintic: It just, that's basically what started it all. Yeah.

236
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.180
Richelle Direny: Okay, for arms.

237
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.190
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

238
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.950
Richelle Direny: But, um, you know, I think it just saying

239
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.270
Richelle Direny: It trying your best. Sometimes it's

240
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.840
Richelle Direny: Like I said, leading up to something.

241
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.400
Richelle Direny: Your nerves in there.

242
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.170
Richelle Direny: you're anxious and a lot of the anxiety comes from what it's going to be like afterwards.

243
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.280
Donita McClintic: Am I going to like it.

244
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.210
Donita McClintic: You know,

245
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.780
Richelle Direny: Just that that felt confident that will come with big

246
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.760
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so

247
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.190
Richelle Direny: There is that anxiety.

248
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.290
Richelle Direny: So sometimes

249
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.160
Richelle Direny: Maybe focusing on the end result and what that's

250
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:11.520
Right.

251
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.480
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

252
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.770
Richelle Direny: And just make

253
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.240
Richelle Direny: It more stay focused on it because

254
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.730
Richelle Direny: For everything there is a process that you have to go through

255
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.100
Richelle Direny: You know, it's

256
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.750
Richelle Direny: Just saying, you know, not so much sinful because the longer you stay focused on the process.

257
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.700
Donita McClintic: And you ponder the process.

258
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.320
Richelle Direny: You end up talking yourself.

259
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.860
Richelle Direny: Out of it.

260
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.050
Richelle Direny: And you come out of going

261
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.120
Richelle Direny: Through the process to get to the other side.

262
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.720
Richelle Direny: And all done that God has done in October.

263
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.570
Donita McClintic: And I didn't go because I'm scared, but um

264
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.610
Richelle Direny: You stay focused on the process.

265
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.800
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So in this case, it's not it's not staying focused on the process but staying focused on the

266
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.190
Richelle Direny: On the end result ultimately

267
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.630
Richelle Direny: And the end result in this

268
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.650
Richelle Direny: Case would be

269
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.630
Richelle Direny: You know having

270
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:01.590
Richelle Direny: You know,

271
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.820
Richelle Direny: The tea. I can be

272
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.220
Donita McClintic: Mean

273
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.140
Richelle Direny: And that is very important. That is very important. You know, for some

274
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.370
Richelle Direny: People to others.

275
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.420
Richelle Direny: It's like

276
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.470
Richelle Direny: You know,

277
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.120
Richelle Direny: I know someone personally

278
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.040
Richelle Direny: Who had gotten into a really bad.

279
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.220
Richelle Direny: Accident and for years there.

280
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.630
Donita McClintic: Was really bad it was.

281
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.500
Richelle Direny: Like corroded. And just like a whole lot of bad situations and

282
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.150
Richelle Direny: Everything that was in

283
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:27.450
There.

284
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.960
Richelle Direny: And through that process.

285
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.180
Richelle Direny: ended up going back to the dentist having

286
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.730
Richelle Direny: It all removed and had

287
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.360
Donita McClintic: Nothing.

288
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.650
Richelle Direny: Like pretty much like

289
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.510
Richelle Direny: As the day they were born.

290
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.930
Richelle Direny: And so going through that process.

291
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.160
Richelle Direny: And so

292
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.700
Richelle Direny: You know,

293
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.110
Richelle Direny: Seeing him.

294
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.060
Richelle Direny: And sometimes I would like how do you eat the park with my

295
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so in he did it for a while and

296
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:04.680
Richelle Direny: Well, let me tell you something. There was the current state like where you are right now, the current state of knowing

297
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:05.940
Richelle Direny: Your presentation, how

298
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.030
Donita McClintic: You love and having to accept and be comfortable

299
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.340
Richelle Direny: With your image as it is.

300
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.290
Richelle Direny: And and looking at it and it being a

301
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.490
Donita McClintic: Reminder of

302
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.930
Richelle Direny: Why it's like that.

303
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.790
Richelle Direny: And not necessarily liking.

304
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.180
Richelle Direny: This that disposition and you know sometimes feeling

305
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.260
Richelle Direny: Depressed or, you know, having motel to lower self esteem or

306
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.080
Richelle Direny: Seeking variety of being around people simply

307
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.650
Donita McClintic: Because

308
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.770
Richelle Direny: You are not necessarily fond of what you're looking at in the

309
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:40.680
Richelle Direny: Mirror. And so, you know, in knowing this person that was that. And so when the opportunity was presented

310
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.720
Donita McClintic: To go through that process.

311
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.680
Richelle Direny: To get to that.

312
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.020
Richelle Direny: Other side. I'm sure the nerves were

313
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.440
Donita McClintic: Because

314
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.190
Richelle Direny: It's like like exactly what you said you're anxious, you're not, you're

315
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.800
Richelle Direny: Like all these emotions comes in.

316
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.600
Richelle Direny: And he went through. He allowed himself and he for a long time. Just by looking

317
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.130
Richelle Direny: For a long time he goes

318
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:06.180
Richelle Direny: Through it for years. He didn't go through it and just having to live with that ridicule of people looking at him and

319
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.630
Richelle Direny: Seeing what it had become eventually how they

320
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.200
Started

321
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.650
Richelle Direny: How supplying and just kind of what that looks

322
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.510
Richelle Direny: Like. And so eventually

323
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:16.680
Donita McClintic: He

324
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.970
Richelle Direny: Allowed himself.

325
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.480
Richelle Direny: To go

326
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.680
Through that process.

327
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.710
Richelle Direny: Despite the fear, despite the anxiety.

328
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.890
Richelle Direny: Despite past experience assistance or what have you.

329
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.560
Richelle Direny: He allowed himself to go through that process.

330
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.700
Richelle Direny: And, you know, and that process was a long process. It wasn't no

331
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.760
Richelle Direny: Go to the dentist and everything is fine. It was a long

332
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.900
Donita McClintic: Process, because for

333
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.590
Richelle Direny: A while after

334
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.760
Donita McClintic: We had everything removed.

335
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.950
Donita McClintic: He was like, he

336
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.360
Richelle Direny: Was dumbing it down for a minute.

337
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.690
Richelle Direny: And so again that's another process.

338
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.150
Richelle Direny: Of reboots. Think of yourself as a team.

339
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.640
Richelle Direny: Because he was dumbing it down for a minute.

340
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.090
Richelle Direny: And I would look and I'm like your show how you, how you

341
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.080
Richelle Direny: Like you can have some food worse than me who have a full head of

342
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.440
CIA

343
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:01.110
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

344
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.610
Richelle Direny: And so you don't want any

345
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.140
Bob

346
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:05.460
Richelle Direny: But

347
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.900
Richelle Direny: You will heat up some food. You hear me.

348
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.500
Like

349
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.320
Richelle Direny: I have a full head.

350
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.640
Richelle Direny: And I'm sitting here taking my

351
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.050
Richelle Direny: Time at certain things and he

352
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.480
Richelle Direny: Was killing it, man. Yeah.

353
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.410
Richelle Direny: And so forth.

354
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.960
Richelle Direny: And that process going on for a while because remember

355
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.440
Richelle Direny: After they were moved the GM. I mean after they remove the teeth.

356
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.390
Richelle Direny: Then they have to make the gums heal.

357
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.680
Donita McClintic: And then, you know,

358
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.120
Donita McClintic: It was a process.

359
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.540
Richelle Direny: And so

360
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.890
Richelle Direny: That's going to be your biggest challenge. It's not even right now because you're starting that journey.

361
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:35.610
Richelle Direny: It's

362
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.490
Richelle Direny: The journey. Yeah, that's more meaningful.

363
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.790
Richelle Direny: Not the beginning and not the end. It's the journey.

364
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:42.720
Richelle Direny: That you

365
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.020
Learn

366
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.440
Richelle Direny: And so that guarantee, he went through because

367
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.280
Richelle Direny: After he was

368
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.920
Richelle Direny: With no teeth and gums work healing.

369
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.100
Richelle Direny: And after it got to that point then he had to go back

370
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.510
I think what he did.

371
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.100
Richelle Direny: It's something that they put like these little

372
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.870
Richelle Direny: Impression

373
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.730
Richelle Direny: Well, it was like, oh, look what

374
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:04.380
Donita McClintic: I

375
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.230
Richelle Direny: Got a place that

376
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.940
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so they put that in his

377
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.500
Richelle Direny: Because like I said it was his whole mouth.

378
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.190
They put

379
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.160
Richelle Direny: And so he was going with that for a while.

380
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.420
Richelle Direny: So now.

381
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.650
Richelle Direny: I go through

382
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.870
Richelle Direny: But he looking jacked up from the beginning.

383
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.740
Richelle Direny: To now.

384
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.390
Richelle Direny: Being willing to get on this.

385
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.930
Donita McClintic: Journey.

386
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.200
Richelle Direny: And now in this journey. I went through.

387
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.280
Richelle Direny: The pain.

388
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.530
Richelle Direny: Or whatever now know to

389
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.780
Richelle Direny: Being too because now we have to

390
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.110
Donita McClintic: Keep

391
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:38.130
Richelle Direny: Your like this. Okay. And so that image for a while and then he has the things

392
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.170
Richelle Direny: Today, let me tell you something on either

393
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.370
Donita McClintic: End result.

394
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.430
Richelle Direny: I kept saying, well, you got some pretty

395
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.520
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah, that's

396
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.980
Richelle Direny: Where your team room.

397
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.210
Richelle Direny: Is prettier than

398
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.810
Richelle Direny: This smile.

399
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:04.170
Richelle Direny: Everything. His smile everything. It was just like, no, like, it was gorgeous.

400
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.610
File.

401
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.520
Donita McClintic: You probably love to smile after he got done all the time. Yeah.

402
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.450
Richelle Direny: And let me wait and they were they're gorgeous.

403
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.590
Richelle Direny: Gorgeous, but just understanding

404
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.570
Richelle Direny: That journey he went on.

405
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.530
Richelle Direny: To get

406
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.210
Richelle Direny: To that end result.

407
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.530
Richelle Direny: And what that end result looks like. And now the compliment. So now,

408
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.600
Richelle Direny: Here it is my self esteem is the

409
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.410
Richelle Direny: way it is right now.

410
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.120
Richelle Direny: I mean, I have something going on. I've gotten used to it. I've gotten adjusted

411
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.660
Richelle Direny: I made this process. Now, I'm like, why did I allow myself.

412
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.940
Richelle Direny: To do this. Now, look at me. I have no teeth.

413
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.150
Richelle Direny: And

414
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.100
Richelle Direny: You're going through all the emotional roller coaster from the while you're on this journey.

415
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.640
Richelle Direny: And now having to kind of shut yourself from people somewhat because

416
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:51.810
Richelle Direny: It's just like, man.

417
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.700
Richelle Direny: And having to go through all of that.

418
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.930
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, so your, your, your self esteem if it was going down.

419
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.420
Richelle Direny: In the beginning, now it's painting.

420
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's taking through that process, but in the end.

421
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.160
Richelle Direny: You think about that cool of self esteem that he got

422
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.900
Richelle Direny: Because I wasn't just like

423
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:10.800
You're

424
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.560
Richelle Direny: Like, that's all I saw

425
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:23.940
Richelle Direny: That also now sneaking he was a little bit more loose. I mean, smiling. It was just like, all you can see with Pete

426
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.290
Donita McClintic: And I was just like, yeah.

427
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.270
Richelle Direny: So you think about that boost.

428
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.190
Richelle Direny: Himself as a team. So then in the end.

429
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.690
Richelle Direny: You are you, you become super excited that you allowed yourself to

430
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.980
Richelle Direny: Get on this journey you allowed yourself to go through that process.

431
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.920
Richelle Direny: And it's thinking about all that you learn

432
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:41.640
Richelle Direny: While you're

433
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.160
Richelle Direny: On the on this point, it's

434
00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.690
Richelle Direny: Always important is the process. And it's kind of like taking this

435
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.010
Richelle Direny: Instance, and

436
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.450
Richelle Direny: And let's let's

437
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.900
Richelle Direny: Take it and kind of apply it to you.

438
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.580
Richelle Direny: You're on the journey.

439
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.720
Richelle Direny: Like you were an active addiction and just kind of everything that surrounded that

440
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.130
Richelle Direny: And when you got to that.

441
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.870
Richelle Direny: Point where you decided

442
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:08.700
Richelle Direny: That I no longer want to do this, I no longer want to travel this road.

443
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:09.450
Richelle Direny: So now.

444
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.700
Richelle Direny: Right now what you're on if you're on Twitter.

445
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:12.930
Richelle Direny: You're going through the

446
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.100
Richelle Direny: Process. And so in this process you're realizing that

447
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.560
Richelle Direny: You're going to lose friends.

448
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.000
Richelle Direny: You're going to lose.

449
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.640
Richelle Direny: Relationships, maybe with some family members.

450
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.550
Richelle Direny: And even when you're losing and sometimes it's really just being repaired because they're so used to you being

451
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.150
Richelle Direny: One way.

452
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.610
Richelle Direny: That now you're changing in this new way.

453
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.870
Richelle Direny: And its effects. I mean,

454
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.310
Donita McClintic: I don't really know what to take up it

455
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.820
Richelle Direny: Actually I'm waiting to see you to fail. And so

456
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.540
Richelle Direny: They have

457
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.070
Richelle Direny: This process with you.

458
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.110
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

459
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.250
Donita McClintic: And so

460
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.700
Richelle Direny: As you're going through this journey. Maybe you'll gain a little bit more

461
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.890
Richelle Direny: weight on your appetite and like

462
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.030
Richelle Direny: All of the things that

463
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.050
Richelle Direny: You're going through

464
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.360
Richelle Direny: A renewing of your mind. A renewing of our bodies transforming

465
00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.520
Richelle Direny: Think about it.

466
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.980
Donita McClintic: If you were still in active addiction, would you be

467
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.030
Richelle Direny: Talking I want to

468
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.740
Richelle Direny: Deal with

469
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.140
Donita McClintic: That

470
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.970
Richelle Direny: So you think about right.

471
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.810
Richelle Direny: You're, you're, you're so busy getting high. So now you think about now I'm on this journey.

472
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.480
Richelle Direny: And going through the process. And this is what's meaningful.

473
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.220
Richelle Direny: This is what's meaningful, because when now I have long

474
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.300
Richelle Direny: Term sobriety.

475
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:34.410
Richelle Direny: Now I can go and I could probably help somebody. And why can I help somebody because I learned

476
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.730
Donita McClintic: A lot while I was on the

477
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.170
Richelle Direny: Journey while I'm

478
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.760
Donita McClintic: Going through the process.

479
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.630
Richelle Direny: Of recovery while I was going through the toxic vacation.

480
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.240
Richelle Direny: Because even though there is detoxification, whether it's three days or four days initially

481
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.720
Richelle Direny: Be pacification is a really long process.

482
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.190
Richelle Direny: Because you're really

483
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.740
Richelle Direny: You're giving back to life. Because the tissues in your

484
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.050
Donita McClintic: Body you're restoring your brain cells.

485
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.520
Richelle Direny: You're restoring so much within your body so your body is still going through a

486
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.690
Donita McClintic: Detoxification

487
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.040

488
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.960
Richelle Direny: Going on, while you're on the journey.

489
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.280
Richelle Direny: You're going through the traffic.

490
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:16.830
Richelle Direny: And once you hit that long term sobriety. Let's say you you're now at like five years or 10 years and you're like, man, I've learned so much

491
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.840

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.960
Richelle Direny: Of getting to the end.

621
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.780

625
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.400
Donita McClintic: Lot to learn

626
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:09.630
Donita McClintic: And so

627
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.970
Richelle Direny: Even though I'm feeling like crap, right now I'm going to go back to my journal

Richelle Direny: You know what, I'm a part of. So

632
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.570
Richelle Direny: If I'm feeling sad if I'm feeling lonely feeling, whatever.

633
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.550
It's a part of the process.

634
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.320

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.390
Richelle Direny: How do I want you to tell me

639
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.820
Richelle Direny: How did that feel this weekend being around the

640
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.270
Richelle Direny: Family being around everything and how you felt overwhelmed.

641
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.940
Richelle Direny: And how you were able to withdraw yourself and feel

642
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.720
Richelle Direny: Okay, with that.

643
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.230
Richelle Direny: And I

644
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.450
Richelle Direny: Take that in somewhat apply it to

645
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:06.240
Richelle Direny: Knowing that tomorrow is your four year wedding anniversary. And you've you've you've separated yourself just like how you separated yourself from the larger

646
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.980
Donita McClintic: Crowd to pretty much get back

647
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.030
Richelle Direny: With yourself.

648
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.230
Richelle Direny: How is that

649
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.950
Richelle Direny: Going into knowing that this is your anniversary

650
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.010
Richelle Direny: And because this relationship is so toxic you've kind of separate

651
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:29.640
Donita McClintic: I guess i mean i i try to keep my mind busy. So I don't think about them because then if you, you know, if I think about him, or whatever, then we'll start feeling sorry for him and then you

652
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:38.550
Donita McClintic: So I just remember all the bad because there was more bad than there was good, so I you know outweighing it whatever

653
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:52.500
Donita McClintic: But I just, I mean, I don't want to slide back into any of that. I, I feel so much better. I'm doing so much better. I I'm out in society, even though you know we're not supposed to be.

654
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.170
Donita McClintic: But I'm

655
00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:09.540
Donita McClintic: I love who I am today. And I'm not going back to that. I mean honestly just keep myself occupied. I keep myself busy so I don't start to think in

656
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:21.660
Donita McClintic: Because I know me, I mean, in the past, I will be right back with them. But I honestly don't want that ever again. I gone done I'm 42 years old. It's time to be an adult.

657
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:33.330
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I'm not young teenager that in the little party stage like I'm I need to. I need to show my kids like the, you know, you got to

658
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.780
Donita McClintic: What's the word I'm looking for.

659
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.210
Donita McClintic: You gotta, you gotta

660
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.850
Donita McClintic: Like when they get older, they got to be a part of.

661
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:55.860
Donita McClintic: I don't know, I'm trying. I know I'm trying to say, but it's just not coming out like okay, you have to get out and do stuff on your own. You can't expect people to do it for you.

662
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.850
Donita McClintic: And I've done that a lot. Now when I was young.

663
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:06.330
Donita McClintic: I was like 27 when I got on pain pills, so

664
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.740
Donita McClintic: Before then I was like,

665
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:22.350
Donita McClintic: The anti drug like absolutely not like don't even I was I judged. People really bad to when I was

666
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:30.720
Donita McClintic: Like I didn't understand how people got to that point in their life where like I didn't understand it. So one day I was like oh my gosh, I'm here. Like I okay I get it now.

667
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:42.630
Donita McClintic: So I don't judge anymore, but I just I like you, I am today. I love who I am today. And I'm not letting him bring that back, you know, take me back down. Yeah.

668
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.530
Richelle Direny: taking you back down.

669
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.640
Richelle Direny: So one of the things

670
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.460
Richelle Direny: You know, okay, so

671
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.740
Richelle Direny: For you.

672
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.540
Richelle Direny: What was it that was

673
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.660
Richelle Direny: Significant when everybody was together.

674
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.100
Richelle Direny: Pretty much like everybody in the family was together hanging out with your mom and it became

675
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.300
Richelle Direny: Overwhelming for you.

676
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.600
Richelle Direny: You said that what got

677
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:13.650
Richelle Direny: Overwhelming for you was the noise and everything that was going on right and you need it now was it like a reminder, like people were making you feel uncomfortable or

678
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.140
Richelle Direny: Whatever it was, or was it just the noise.

679
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:27.720
Donita McClintic: It's just the noise and it just it it's like it makes me not good enough to my head like just all the commode, like all the noise. It drives me crazy.

680
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:29.880
Richelle Direny: And so you can separate yourself.

681
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:36.870
Donita McClintic: Yes. Yeah, I can't like a crowd of people, if there's five or more. I kind of, I can't

682
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.910
Donita McClintic: I can't make it worse. It's like

683
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:50.400
Donita McClintic: It's, yeah. It's like, to me by peoples too many like everybody's trying to talk over top of every everybody know what I mean, like, I can't it just drives me nuts and

684
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.610
Richelle Direny: Feel when you went and you sent my yourself.

685
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.230
Richelle Direny: With your little news.

686
00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:07.560
Donita McClintic: Well I calm down, like I was okay. And I still listen to what they were saying. But I kind of blocking. I'd love to some out and listen to. You know what I mean like I could

687
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:20.850
Donita McClintic: Away from everybody. I can do that. But being all around, everybody. There's, like, it's like marquee signs going off everywhere. And you got to pick which one you're going to read or whatever. So that's what it feels like me.

688
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.770
Donita McClintic: And takes

689
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:31.200
Donita McClintic: Then it's like I trade on whatever one you know it might be weird analogy, what I'm using but the

690
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:37.140
Richelle Direny: Reality that you're using, because I want you to take that same concept.

691
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.600
Richelle Direny: Of how you felt in the morning and how

692
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.590
Richelle Direny: To separate yourself in order to

693
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.880
Richelle Direny: Kind of

694
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.190
Richelle Direny: Bring yourself back to a level of

695
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.850
Donita McClintic: Functions.

696
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.190
Richelle Direny: To calm your mind down so we could show

697
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.850
Richelle Direny: You. I love

698
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.910
Richelle Direny: The fact that you did all of that, what was happening to

699
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.090
Richelle Direny: You in the moment. It was a point where you were no longer

700
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.050
Richelle Direny: In control.

701
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:01.800
Richelle Direny: Of your

702
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:05.760
Richelle Direny: Situation of your surroundings in your mind. Everything was kind of going

703
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.860
Richelle Direny: So you said, Okay, no, this is where I am right now I need to

704
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.420
Richelle Direny: Separate myself.

705
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.710
Richelle Direny: I need to know what's

706
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.140
Donita McClintic: Good for me. I need to bring myself back

707
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.160
Richelle Direny: Sustainability.

708
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.240
Richelle Direny: And I know

709
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.090
Richelle Direny: I know, like you said, I do know you

710
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.320
Richelle Direny: For you know what's good for you.

711
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.940
Richelle Direny: So I want to be in a good place both mentally, emotionally

712
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.560
Richelle Direny: Physically, I need to be in a good place.

713
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.970
Donita McClintic: For you separated yourself.

714
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:31.920
Richelle Direny: Knowing the reason why

715
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.490
Richelle Direny: You city.

716
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.080
Richelle Direny: And sticking to that.

717
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:34.620
Donita McClintic: Reason.

718
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.510
Richelle Direny: It's in the same way.

719
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.570
Richelle Direny: With your spouse. You know what was going on in that married

720
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.480
Richelle Direny: And you can identify there was more bad

721
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.020
Richelle Direny: Than

722
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.430
Richelle Direny: There was good when I wake

723
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:48.420
Richelle Direny: Out everything

724
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.650
Richelle Direny: And so

725
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:55.740
Richelle Direny: Just like how you were feeling with all of the commotion. You can all be for a family member, they weren't physically abusing you weren't making you

726
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.640
Richelle Direny: Continue to to fault, but in this relationship.

727
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.120
Donita McClintic: You're saying

728
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:00.960
Donita McClintic: This is

729
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.190
Donita McClintic: All that was going on.

730
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.300
Richelle Direny: And if putting me

731
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.810
Richelle Direny: In a bad hesitate, emotionally, physically and otherwise.

732
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.600
Richelle Direny: And so you just like what you did yesterday you

733
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.890
Richelle Direny: Separated yourself.

734
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.780
Donita McClintic: And you went with a little girl because you know

735
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.040
Richelle Direny: That will help you

736
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:23.850
Richelle Direny: To kind of realign and refocus know the reason why you walked out of the relationship. All of the what the toxicity that consisted of that or

737
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.380
Donita McClintic: How it was making you feel

738
00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.210
Richelle Direny: You're now going to

739
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.870
Richelle Direny: The reason why you separated yourself and cancel your mom's house.

740
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:31.920
Richelle Direny: Because you know there was

741
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.360
Richelle Direny: Structured their ability

742
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.710
Richelle Direny: And it brought up.

743
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:39.870
Richelle Direny: And it allows you to refocus and redefine yourself, Tina.

744
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.200
Donita McClintic: Her mom house for like yesterday that little girl gave

745
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.030

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.820
Donita McClintic: mom's house.

749
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.300
Richelle Direny: And

750
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:52.800
Richelle Direny: Everything that's surrounding your mom's

751
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.580
Donita McClintic: House, it's

752
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.510
Richelle Direny: Allowing you

753
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.450
Richelle Direny: To get back to the basics. What is my purpose.

754
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.430
Richelle Direny: What is my purpose for doing this.

755
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.530
Richelle Direny: I need to stay on this journey.

756
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.710
Richelle Direny: I need to continue with this process of detoxification emptying what seems to be a very

757
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.990
Richelle Direny: toxic relationship. I can't

758
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.000
Richelle Direny: Solve making the list.

759
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:13.920
Richelle Direny: Identifying you remember we talked about

760
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.260
Richelle Direny: It in one in one session, making

761
00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.700
Richelle Direny: What was the reason why you did it in the first place. Why did you walk out of it.

762
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.940
Richelle Direny: Going back and when you feel those emotions.

763
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.020
Richelle Direny: Tomorrow, what is

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:17.040
Donita McClintic: Else and I got a dentist appointment so I'm really not even focused on the marriage focused on the dentist. So that kind of work that was kind of good that I was able to get on that day. And that's because I have

782
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:24.600
Richelle Direny: For you, not recognizing it was intentional so that you're not sitting here, think about the loss of a relationship.

783
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.260
So,

784
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.590
Richelle Direny: That was not healthy for you.

785
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.140
Richelle Direny: You're not pondering on

786
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.050

Donita McClintic: Yes, yeah.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.880
Richelle Direny: Sprinkled in there. There was some good

791
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.430
Richelle Direny: But what stands out in your mind, the

792
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.190
Richelle Direny: Most is all of the bad time.

793
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.590
Richelle Direny: You have to remind yourself when you read at any point

794
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.190
Donita McClintic: In time

795
00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:57.630

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.180
Richelle Direny: Well, that's the part that gets your

803
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:19.320
Richelle Direny: Heart. It's the relationships. If the loss of a partner. It's the law for some type of stability in some whatever way.

804
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.520
Donita McClintic: That it was

805
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:21.480
Donita McClintic: It's a lot

806
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.360

808
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.370
Donita McClintic: You don't want, right, that part is not there, because that's the part that's making me think, wow,

Richelle Direny: Today is my four year anniversary and

810
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.160
Donita McClintic: You know, I'm not wishing it. So there is that last

811
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.200
Richelle Direny: BECAUSE, INITIALLY WHEN YOU DECIDED

812
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.070
Richelle Direny: To get married.

813
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.240
Richelle Direny: There was a reason. And there was a purpose and you felt like this is person for

814
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.510
Donita McClintic: You

815
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.000
Richelle Direny: So many years into it, you recognize

816
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.170
Richelle Direny: That this is not good for me.

817
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.450
Richelle Direny: Good. Now you're making that on this process of detoxification.

818
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.730
Richelle Direny: We're recognizing this is not good.

819
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.170
Richelle Direny: So read

820
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.510
Richelle Direny: If you get to that place or after

821
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.790
Donita McClintic: After you talk to me movie in your

822
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.710

Donita McClintic: Yeah.

825
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.310
Donita McClintic: After you go through

826
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.920
Richelle Direny: That thought that comes with it.

827
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.120
Richelle Direny: And which I

828
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.870
Richelle Direny: Read it.

829
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.580
Richelle Direny: And just say

830
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.950
Richelle Direny: I do miss the idea of a

831
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:25.470
Richelle Direny: Relationship. I do miss the idea of being in the company.

832

Donita McClintic: I

833
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.020

838
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.290
Richelle Direny: Jeopardize journey that I've been on

839
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:44.730

842
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.400
Donita McClintic: With my family.

843
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:51.960
Donita McClintic: It's going to jeopardize

844
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.300
Richelle Direny: I want you to be able to write all that down.

845
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.760
Richelle Direny: And remind yourself of all
