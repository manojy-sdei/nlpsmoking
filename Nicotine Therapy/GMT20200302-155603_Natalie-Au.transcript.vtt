Jenette Lockett: Well, I started really really young.

22
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.160
Jenette Lockett: Don't even know how that was started around 15 angels by God.

23
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.550
Jenette Lockett: On more campaigns and then axes and then it went to heroin.

24
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.350
Jenette Lockett: Yeah, so I was doing heroin over 20 years or more. I don't know my whole life, very much. I got I've been clean for

25
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.040
Jenette Lockett: About eight years, maybe I want to say about eight years I've been good, but I've been on Suboxone you to not like totally clean again. But please, for me, so

26
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.540
Jenette Lockett: I'm liking it.

27
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.870
Jenette Lockett: But uh yeah and it's getting old now and then I had a sister died last year.

28
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.750
Jenette Lockett: She I guess the new drugs, the new drug that they strain your heart. So if you need a new heart valve and that's my baby sister show. Yeah.

29
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.480
Jenette Lockett: They're in her my dad just, you don't want to get that high anymore. I still smoke weed. They're still got that in the system. I'm trying to play again and then

30
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.750
Jenette Lockett: I quit for a couple years. And then I started bad guy.

31
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.990
Jenette Lockett: I buy with friends it but it almost gave me more anxiety, if that makes sense.

32
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.940
Natalie Austin: What

33
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.400

37
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:24.930
Jenette Lockett: His dad had cancer so that then you could get. I mean, they just report it out like oxy have every kind of tell you two things up. And yeah, so with me. He lived for years. So we were hype a lot

38
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.610
Jenette Lockett: Again, I grew up in Florida. So it's a little easier to get at the time, no faster pace, I guess, I don't know, and then

39
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.640
Jenette Lockett: Yeah. So I started young really young.

40
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.370
Jenette Lockett: I went to try the Methadone clinic.

41
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.900
Jenette Lockett: I don't want. I'm trying to think of my age, I'm bad with the years when

42
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.360
Natalie Austin: You're 44 now.

43
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.120
Jenette Lockett: I know, I know how old I am. But I'm trying to think of what year I lived in Daytona Beach. I went to, it was

44
00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:02.550
Jenette Lockett: I tried to do that for about 15 months they slowly detox me but I it was in my phone so bad. So when they came out with the oxygen that actually worked for me. And I think we incent

49
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.750
Natalie Austin: You have a claim for eight years.

50
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:33.390
Jenette Lockett: Yeah, about that and then going to be right. Yeah, yeah, that that day I knew I had to move away when they say people, places and things like you know i just whatever, but it was true. I had to literally move away.

51
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.120
Jenette Lockett: My daughter.

52
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.390
Natalie Austin: You started like at age 15 or so you think, just like

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.140
Red

54
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:51.540
Jenette Lockett: Pill like Lord tab and part of that or whatever. And then slowly went to China, why

55
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.090
Jenette Lockett: Is it. Yeah.

56
00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.880

62
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:29.070
Jenette Lockett: Right, and that's not how to do it because I was not strong enough it. I didn't even stop craving to like my second year, I want to say, I still kind of all the time.

63
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:38.220
Jenette Lockett: That I met with everybody else created that long, but I wouldn't have been around. I couldn't be around somebody doing it. Not one you know at the time.
