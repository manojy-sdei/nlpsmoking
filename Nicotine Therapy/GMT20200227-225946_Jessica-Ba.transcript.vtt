00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:44.010
Windy Borjas: I, I didn't mind it. But I honestly felt. I liked it more for the feeling of it, rather than the feeling of being off of the drugs.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:41.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're not the only one that's a lot of a lot of patients in this program and just in general, that's the biggest fear of filling the withdrawal symptoms again.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was going on around that time that one had access to the marijuana and to decide to use

63
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.820
Windy Borjas: My older sister, happened to be

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:06.900
Windy Borjas: She didn't offer or peer pressure or nothing, she actually was scared, but she wasn't very much older and I think she found it actually in my older brother's

Windy Borjas: room or in his backpack or something.

67

69
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:37.530

Windy Borjas: Repeated terms, I guess you could say I was having fun.

71
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.730
Windy Borjas: Because I really was like, I didn't go myself at that age.

72
00:07:48.750 --> 00:08:00.840
Windy Borjas: I was still playing with toys with dolls, I would ask my mom permission to go to my room to play when she was in the living room like I was a baby still

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.710
Windy Borjas: I want to say.

86
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:33.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It seems as though the opioid epidemic is very, very significant in Mexico Asia's access everywhere.

92
00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:11.310
Windy Borjas: Okay, no, let's say, okay, well now that you really actually put my brain to work and I'm really thinking back to the beginning of my addiction. The real beginning

93
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:21.720
Windy Borjas: I mean the marijuana, the one time. Never again. And then I started when I was 1314 and I continued, whenever I could get it.

94
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:31.380
Windy Borjas: I love marijuana still to this day, I do, I do not see it as a drug to a certain extent.

95
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.580
Windy Borjas: I'm glad that you know there's

96
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:47.070
Windy Borjas: New ways of them, showing that it's not just a drug like heroin or cocaine or math or any of the bad ones.

97
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.840
Windy Borjas: But honestly I feel I became an addict.

98
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:01.080
Windy Borjas: I don't know the right term for it, like in directly

99
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.020
Windy Borjas: Innocently

100
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.900
Windy Borjas: Unintentionally

101
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.070
Windy Borjas: I remember

102
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.930
Windy Borjas: Trying a Suboxone

103
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.220
Windy Borjas: The when they were pills. They look like stop signs.

104
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:36.930
Windy Borjas: I remember when those were on the streets god that was so long so long ago I was in eighth grade, okay. And I did a tiny, tiny, tiny little nothing like a dust.

105
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:44.730
Windy Borjas: And oh my goodness. It got me and my sister so sick.

106
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.670
Windy Borjas: I assume now that I think about it, then the locks in and how strong

107
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:59.310
Windy Borjas: Types were the stop sign ones. Yeah. Um, I never tried it again after that and in

108
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:15.270
Windy Borjas: My whole heroin addiction. It was never honestly like anybody. I knew and got high with God drugs from or four never really put it in my view, it's crazy. I remember

109
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.960
Windy Borjas: A point in time having so many

110
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.910
Windy Borjas: Just there in two, three drawers.

111
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.540
Windy Borjas: Because, you know, they mean but I was

112
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.660
Windy Borjas: Boxing Harry. Yeah, but I was carrying around ounces of heroin and getting high.

113
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're getting high with

114
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.850
Windy Borjas: Me as much as possible.

115
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.560
Windy Borjas: Um,

116
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.680
Windy Borjas: It's always been the boyfriend.

117
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:59.010
Windy Borjas: The friend the best friend. I no longer believe in friends. But while use that term repentance.

118
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:21.690
Windy Borjas: Those seems to be the ones that were like the partners in crime. But back to the beginning. So when I started, you know, using marijuana. I'm more regularly. When I got a little older, I ended up dislocating my knee.

119
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.910
Windy Borjas: And tearing the are ripping the ligament right underneath the kneecap.

120
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.240
Windy Borjas: My birthday, when I was

121
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:46.860
Windy Borjas: 13 or 14. It was around the same around the same time that I really started using marijuana regularly.

122
00:13:47.310 --> 00:14:06.300
Windy Borjas: That's it. I 15 as low as 15 because I had already been smoking marijuana for like a year, year and a half, you know, 1516 I had that injury. I never got surgery for it, they were able to just get it to sit back with

123
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.090
Windy Borjas: rapping and a little like a brace.

124
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.790
Windy Borjas: I never remember getting a cast. I never remember getting surgery. Never have.

125
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.620
Windy Borjas: But

126
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:29.490
Windy Borjas: That's the reason for me ever even needing to

127
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.350
Windy Borjas: Put

128
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.520
Windy Borjas: Pharmaceutical drugs into my body.

129
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For pain.

130
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.070
Yeah.

131
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.260
Windy Borjas: And

132
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.850
Windy Borjas: I never

133
00:14:46.590 --> 00:15:09.930
Windy Borjas: Even knew what addiction was to tell you to. I just remember being sick. I don't even remember what it feels like to be sober to, to be honest. Like, I don't, I don't know what it feels like to wake up every day on a daily basis for years and years and years.

134
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:21.810
Windy Borjas: With no substance no marijuana know cigarette know whatever drug, you know, I mean, it may be for me at that point in time.

135
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.490
Windy Borjas: I really don't.

136
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:33.210
Windy Borjas: Know, only thing I can think of it is what it feels like to be a kid.

137
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.180
Windy Borjas: Like

138
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.360
Windy Borjas: No.

139
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:48.210
Windy Borjas: I don't want to say no care in the world because I don't like that saying I like it said better no stress in the world. Yeah.

144
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:32.490
Windy Borjas: green ones as well. I am beginning both 10 milligrams. One was green. One was blue. They're both what they will said, Watson, I believe they're both Lord tab. And I remember getting the Percocet.

145
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.770
Windy Borjas: 7.5 milligrams and then

146
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.610

150
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:14.760

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:23.430
Windy Borjas: I'm older. You know what I mean like it honestly makes me wanna call my mom and ask her a lot of questions.

Windy Borjas: Know, I honestly

163
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:20.670
Windy Borjas: Like I just said I never even really knew what Suboxone was what what it was labeled at that time in

164
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.120
Windy Borjas: Point in my life was

165
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:44.520
Windy Borjas: Fake heroin. I remember my mom used to always be talking about it. I don't know why they invented that all it is is just fake heroin. It's not no here. It's not going to happen just replacing one addiction with another

166
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:52.590
Windy Borjas: And, you know, then I just remember, I would always think to myself, you know, like

167
00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:05.820
Windy Borjas: Questions about what she was saying, but I never press the issue because in my eyes. We didn't have that in my family.

168
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No one. No one, you

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.950
Windy Borjas: Okay, but

171
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.290
Windy Borjas: They made sure that from my point of view.

172
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.960
Windy Borjas: And my understanding.

173
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.110
Windy Borjas: Nobody ever did.

174
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:40.020
Windy Borjas: That it was wrong and it, it was like one of the worst things you could become was an addict and it would leave you with nothing homeless on the streets, no family.

175
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not ready

176
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How do they teach you these narratives, if they will use it.

177
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.730
Windy Borjas: I

178
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your mom and your dad I

179
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.400
Windy Borjas: Am I guess the only the only word I can think of is lying.

180
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:09.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when they, when they turn to cover their addiction or when they, it was clear that they they were addicts, but they were like trying to tell you

181
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:17.190
Windy Borjas: Otherwise, I'm trying. I never, I never knew my, my parents and

182
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:42.030
Windy Borjas: It wasn't until I was like in high school that I actually really heard it from somebody else that knows my mom actually need some stories about her that I actually knew like I'm talking like they made sure to a tee.

183
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.040
Windy Borjas: That

184
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.920
Windy Borjas: There was, it was just not in our family, not in my genes, not in

185
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.580
Windy Borjas: Anyone's or, you know, I mean, in

186
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The past like they did in the past. I'm going to be

187
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:05.190
Windy Borjas: Gone. Just because just because I don't know.

188
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:07.290
Windy Borjas: They are like

189
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.420
Windy Borjas: I can put up this front that it's

190
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.910
Windy Borjas: picture perfect when it's how behind doors, pretty much. Okay.

191
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So while you were child they were using. They were just hide it.

192
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.600
Windy Borjas: Yeah. Well, obviously I'm

193
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wondering, you know,

194
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:40.500
Windy Borjas: What I never saw it. But see, it's not like they were there shooting up drugs and there was paraphernalia and drugs everywhere they got talking like like alcohol, um,

195
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:55.920
Windy Borjas: So they might remember my mom being gone, sometimes you know weeks at a time to just cut me off one day and never come back and then show up one day and I just miss her so much.

196
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.280
Windy Borjas: I'd be so happy to see her.

197
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.830
Windy Borjas: I would ignore how

198
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.460
Windy Borjas: How disgusted. I was in her

199
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:07.410
Windy Borjas: Just

200
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.860
Windy Borjas: It makes

201
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me. Yeah, yeah.

202
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.250

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Connected the backs of their, their, you know, dropping you off and neglect and they're in attention to you, actually, because of their addiction, because you never saw the paraphernalia never saw any of it, but their actions. Now you were able to put the pieces together. Okay.

204
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how old were you when you

205
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Started doing the Methadone clinic to treat

Windy Borjas: And not get high.

221

Windy Borjas: I dislocated my leg. I had an injury. I was just taking the medication. The doctor told my mom to give me

226
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.460
Windy Borjas: And

227
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was the onset of wanting the opium.

228
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.160
I'm

229
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:28.170
Windy Borjas: Slightly eventually. Yeah. Because I remember waking up one day filling withdrawals in some symptoms. I didn't know what they were. But I remember actually being kept home from school because it was being treated as like a cold or the flu.

230
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.830
Windy Borjas: Like, I don't know if it didn't occur.

231
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:47.610
Windy Borjas: To anybody that it could happen that fast. Or if I was just so young that my mom didn't, you know, I don't know. I really don't. I

234
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:13.350
Windy Borjas: Like, it's just a touchy subject for her. And I understand. I know she has a lot of, you know, like hate for herself.

235
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.050
Windy Borjas: For

236
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:26.760

Windy Borjas: My daughter is what

238
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:38.070

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Bobby do the information we get processes and how

263
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.540
Windy Borjas: It's just sad that all that evolves, but

264
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:24.240
Windy Borjas: We still continue to just let the cycle run its course.

265
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:36.780
Windy Borjas: When it comes to addiction and the war on drugs. And you know what I mean. Yeah. Like, I feel I don't know I

Windy Borjas: I have trouble explaining like stuff when it comes to that pen, a topic or spiritual topics.

267
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.470
Windy Borjas: He I just have different views, I guess.

268
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You identify with any spiritual practice will be

269
00:29:55.770 --> 00:30:12.990
Windy Borjas: No, I, I guess I if I had to put a name to, I would say, Christian, just because Christian Catholic because that's just what my family based off of

270
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That will you believe it.

271
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.720
But me,

272
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:23.460
Windy Borjas: I believe in my high my higher power. I don't have no

273
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:35.760

Windy Borjas: Just in different languages different terms, it was all there's a God, and every one of them. There's a devil, and everyone or those wrong and every one of them, you know, I mean it's man made to me man made destroys man made is dark.

Windy Borjas: It's never peaceful or restful when it comes to mankind.

278
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:19.770
Windy Borjas: So I feel I guess I would call myself a spiritualist maybe

279
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you taking any medication for your

280
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.330

287
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.500
Windy Borjas: Extremely

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.340
Windy Borjas: Intensely for even

289
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:25.410
Windy Borjas: someone my age. That's a lot stronger. But I remember my anxiety being this bad when I was a kid, a baby like 567 like I had the worst anxiety, like it was

290
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.700

293
00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.430

294
00:32:48.720 --> 00:33:07.080
Windy Borjas: I guess, you know what I mean, took the time to like explain or confer so it just remain something that was unknown. It was the unknown to me. And in my mind that terrified me

295
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.960
Windy Borjas: Anything that

296
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:17.640
Windy Borjas: brought up the idea or the topic of death or the world ending or

297
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.570
Windy Borjas: Everybody just dying and being gone would trigger me

298
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:34.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A little about your mom, you said that you when your mom was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

299
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.200

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, okay. Do Is your mom in the database currently living

301
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.120
Windy Borjas: My mom.

302
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have any relationship with your father.

303
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:55.110
Windy Borjas: Um, yeah, I did. He passed away when I was you.

304
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.240
Know, because

305
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.670
Windy Borjas: I wouldn't happen.

306
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:13.320
Windy Borjas: until I was about 14 maybe I was told it was all hard natural causes a heart attack.

307
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:21.480
Windy Borjas: A high blood pressure, high blood pressure, bad cholesterol and then

308
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:29.850
Windy Borjas: When I got older, I finally saw with my own eyes. It was a overdose.

309
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:36.510
Windy Borjas: A mixture of uppers and downers and cocaine and alcohol.

310
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.650
Windy Borjas: And that caused a heart attack.

311
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you mean on the song with your own

312
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:47.760
Windy Borjas: What do you mean

313
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:57.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you said it happened when you were younger, and then they told you a heart attack and then you said you got older, you saw with your own eyes that it was overdose.

314
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.750
Windy Borjas: Oh well, like the paperwork from when he died.

315
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By you saw that paperwork and so you got it. Okay, um,

316
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So dad wasn't added some mom was also an added

317
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you know they had any psychiatric illnesses mental health diagnosis.

318
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.790
I honestly

319
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.220
Windy Borjas: couldn't say, I would say no because I don't believe so.

320
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, what's your relationship like with the money.

321
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.550
Windy Borjas: Complicated.

322
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:49.080
Windy Borjas: It's closely complicated. I get well distantly slightly closely complicated

323
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What way.

324
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.050
Windy Borjas: Just because

325
00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.330
Windy Borjas: I love her to the moon back. I mean, I

326
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.780
Windy Borjas: REMEMBER SEEING MY MOM as the most

327
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:09.330
Windy Borjas: amazing person.

328
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.010
Windy Borjas: I've ever known as a little girl.

329
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.780
Windy Borjas: And

330
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.790
Windy Borjas: She's very, very beautiful.

331
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:27.000
Windy Borjas: Everyone says she looks just like me. I didn't know she was like my hero. My whole life.

332
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:32.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what what makes it complicated

333
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.700
Windy Borjas: I can't tolerate it.

334
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.630
Windy Borjas: I am

335
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:47.760
Windy Borjas: I guess I just never really dealt with the resentment.

336
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.090
Windy Borjas: Or

337
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.850
Windy Borjas: Saw

338
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.010
Windy Borjas: Or felt

339
00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:08.730
Windy Borjas: In any way that she made an attempt to make it better or explain you know I was addicted to drugs or I was an alcoholic or

340
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.080
Windy Borjas: Even

341
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.310
I'm sorry.

342
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:22.560
Windy Borjas: So tolerating her is always or has been difficult for me since

343
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.130
Windy Borjas: Like my early teen years.

344
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: More awareness, you get one life that you uncovered.

345
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That some some hurt.

346
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:37.800
Windy Borjas: Pretty much.

347
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.170
Windy Borjas: Like I

348
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.470
Windy Borjas: My daughter's dad.

349
00:37:46.080 --> 00:38:01.080
Windy Borjas: I believe he's my first to love ever like I said that before. I've had long term relationships before but like I've never known what love is ever

350
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:11.040
Windy Borjas: Not even from family, to be honest, not unconditional love like the way my fiance loves me.

351
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.100
Windy Borjas: Like

352
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.280
Windy Borjas: If it wasn't for him.

353
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:25.320
Windy Borjas: I probably wouldn't have a relationship with my mother.

354
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.210
Windy Borjas: Because it

355
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:37.320
Windy Borjas: Even to this day to this very moment, probably, if I were to call and start a conversation

356
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.380
Windy Borjas: She's a liar to me.

357
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:50.370
Windy Borjas: She's always lying. She's always trying to hide stuff and be sneaky and

358
00:38:52.680 --> 00:39:00.780
Windy Borjas: You know it it's wrong. And I don't like it. And my fiance, you know, he's been in and out of the

359
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:21.450
Windy Borjas: Corrections Department his whole life, and he's very disciplined when it comes to honoring your word and being honest and not lying, and following through with what you say you're going to do, just because of

360
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:29.100
Windy Borjas: How things are in prison. So I think getting with him moving

361
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:35.370
Windy Borjas: Out here to Farmington with him and US building our own little structure.

362
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:48.420
Windy Borjas: And me, you know, taking a step back when it was finally up and running and settled and then looking back

363
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:57.690
Windy Borjas: At the structure. I thought I had from my mom and her first husband.

364
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.410
Windy Borjas: And her second has been now.

365
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:07.530
Windy Borjas: I just seen nothing but a lie.

366
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.290
Windy Borjas: I feel like

367
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.970
Windy Borjas: She gave birth to me, I'm

368
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.090
Windy Borjas: Covered my eyes covered my ears whispered to me that

369
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:48.690
Windy Borjas: She and our family and my dad and his family were saintly holy godly people and we don't do mean things and we do right and do what we're supposed to do go to school graduate, get a job, and pay bills and

370
00:40:49.860 --> 00:41:02.820
Windy Borjas: I guess that's it be miserable. I see it as being miserable because I don't see that as a lifestyle. I'VE NEVER BEEN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN DIFFERENT FROM MY FAMILY on every side.

371
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.820
Windy Borjas: I've never fit in anywhere just because I

372
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.350
Windy Borjas: Oh, from what my government says I see through the bullshit.

373
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To do you call a relationship with your father.

374
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:24.900
Windy Borjas: Yes.

375
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:31.440
Windy Borjas: Good.

376
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.400
Windy Borjas: He was a

377
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.280
Windy Borjas: He was a great dad.

378
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.770
Windy Borjas: I know he loved me so much.

379
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.480
Windy Borjas: He didn't want me at first.

380
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.720
Windy Borjas: When my mom found out that

381
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.910
Windy Borjas: She was pregnant. He told her to get her abortion.

382
00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:03.510
Windy Borjas: He's he had already had my brother and he didn't want to my kids. He was still young.

383
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:16.920
Windy Borjas: Younger to not all probably like early 30s late 20s, you know, still in the phase. I'm in now not ready to grow up.

384
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.520
Windy Borjas: But she couldn't do it, she said.

385
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.020
Windy Borjas: I'm so you eventually

386
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.030
Windy Borjas: I guess just accepted it, because he didn't have a choice.

387
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:31.980
Windy Borjas: And

388
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:35.790
Windy Borjas: My birth story is

389
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.150
Windy Borjas: He didn't know I was a girl.

390
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:47.550
Windy Borjas: They didn't know what I was they were never able to get a good enough picture to tell my mom and dad for sure.

391
00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.620
Windy Borjas: And

392
00:42:52.170 --> 00:43:02.670
Windy Borjas: According to his mom. My grandmother from him his side. He always wanted to be a dad since he was little, but to a little girl.

393
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.150
Windy Borjas: And he had my brother first

394
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.960
Windy Borjas: And their clothes they you know they have had a good relationship. He had him longer than I did.

395
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.640
Windy Borjas: But

396
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.240
Windy Borjas: I was his heart.

397
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.350
Windy Borjas: And he showed it

398
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.350
Windy Borjas: He worked here.

399
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.710
Windy Borjas: How does your house next to my grandma's in Idaho.

400
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.530
Windy Borjas: Me and my mom stayed there and my brother.

401
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:57.240
Windy Borjas: And my other brother to see I have two older brothers one brother, we have the same mom and different dads and then my other brother, we had the same dad, but different months.

402
00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, okay. So two half brothers.

403
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:08.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. And then there's you can share mommy dad and they mentioned have a mother, sister to right

404
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:15.390
Windy Borjas: Um, she's not biological that she's my sister from my mom's first. Okay.

405
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So any other siblings.

406
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So for your mom and your dad. You're the youngest

407
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's the relationship like with your sibling.

408
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.600
Windy Borjas: Um,

409
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.320
Windy Borjas: My brother.

410
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.930
Windy Borjas: That's here in

411
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:45.000
Windy Borjas: New Mexico down in slo with my mom for my mom's side.

412
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.530
Windy Borjas: We've always been told, we should have been

413
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.940
Windy Borjas: Born as an identical twins.

414
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.830
Windy Borjas: Were

415
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.580
Windy Borjas: Extremely

416
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.520
Windy Borjas: I don't know alike in a scary way almost

417
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.620
Windy Borjas: He's just like a copy of me in the male version.

418
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.660
Windy Borjas: A little more

419
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.240
Windy Borjas: You know,

420
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.060
Windy Borjas: He's a guy so

421
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.670
Windy Borjas: rough around the edges, I guess, but not really.

422
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:39.870
Windy Borjas: We we balance out, we should have been twins, I believe it. He believes it. It's just

423
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:49.590
Windy Borjas: We've always had that that's what keeps us from drifting apart. Well, we're not

424
00:45:52.230 --> 00:46:06.030
Windy Borjas: That relationship between siblings that talks everyday and send pictures and hangs out and goes places and stays over with each other and

425
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.000
Windy Borjas: Um,

426
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:20.670
Windy Borjas: We had that with my mom's first husband when we were younger. That was like the most stable I ever remember living around my brother.

427
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:32.550
Windy Borjas: After that, he got his first girlfriend or his girlfriend pregnant when he was 17 so he had a baby right when he graduated

428
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:38.790
Windy Borjas: And he's a rapper producer or was at the time.

429
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.720
Windy Borjas: So he was in that fast life.

430
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:52.860
Windy Borjas: Also became an addict. We became an added together, same point in time, same

431
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.290
Windy Borjas: Introduction. Pretty much everything the same.

432
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.170
Windy Borjas: But

433
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.520
Windy Borjas: We're cut from the same cloth so

434
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:12.990
Windy Borjas: Both of our flaws tend to bring out the worst in each other.

435
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:23.850
Windy Borjas: And if it's going to be an argument. It's going to be a fight, and it's not going to be a pretty one were both combative we're both

436
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.700
Windy Borjas: Both mostly

437
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:33.570
Windy Borjas: We have dad last word. And we will not back down. We will not stop.

438
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:41.940
Windy Borjas: It's just, I'm female and he's Mel. That's only difference. He's like 10 of me, but

439
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.890
Windy Borjas: We have always been very, very

440
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.040
Windy Borjas: combative

441
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, um, what about the sister that you mentioned.

442
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:58.680
Windy Borjas: Um,

443
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.990
Windy Borjas: We don't really care for each other. When I first started dating.

444
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.570
Windy Borjas: I just didn't

445
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:18.480
Windy Borjas: I didn't like the fact that all of a sudden, my mom had a new girl, little girl to take care of my same age.

446
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.450
Windy Borjas: Same gender.

447
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:27.450
Windy Borjas: At a point in her life where she was no longer

450
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.060

Windy Borjas: I couldn't

543
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:38.910

544
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:41.610

545
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.960

546
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.690

549
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:02.820
Windy Borjas: 2018

550
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where they just thought

551
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.360
Windy Borjas: That what

552
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What did you have a plan, or was it just thought

553
01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.430
Windy Borjas: It was just

554
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:23.250
Windy Borjas: A feeling it wasn't a thought or a plan. It was just a feeling you're

555
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Passing emotion. Yeah. So with a treatment plan.

556
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:47.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that plan you already were you have to come in group once a week and make a scheduled appointments. So in that group, you're going to attend group weekly and we're going to be helping you to develop some relapse prevention and skills coping skills.

557
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Connecting you with identify what your emotional relationship triggers are

558
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And helping you to find some healthy coping skills, aside from the isolation.

559
01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:09.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will use different interventions food therapy relaxation mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy Dialectical Behavioral therapy.

560
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:25.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All these techniques to help you tap into capture your thoughts stopping the thoughts and placing the more healthier because we understand that the expensive job us have impacted your mind. He thought process. The depression also take phobia.

561
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:35.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so meeting with you want to want to have to identify where these doctors thing and help you to find replacing thoughts, encouraging.

562
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:52.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then right now that you don't have any friends, but as you continue to thrive and become more self fulfilled through your, your actions within the community purpose. I want you to identify work environments will be healthy for you and which ones won't be

563
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So those are the things that will navigate

564
01:01:56.550 --> 01:02:07.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And do that you're discharged from the program I want you to get connected again call us back. Get back in the program a relapse doesn't mean that you can't come back to the right.

565
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:24.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And get back on the horse. Research shows that when people relapse and make it connected back again into a program it's it's a reduced rate of that. And the longer you're sober, the more opportunity to do more challenging path to prevent that.

566
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any short term or long term goals you want to add to your treatment.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.250
Windy Borjas: Getting back to being a little more organized

591
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:10.230
Windy Borjas: Not so stuck in my slump, I guess.

592
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:24.210
Windy Borjas: Because then I feel things just pile up just like laundry. For example, I see my life is that pile of laundry and every day. I'm stuck depressed and

593
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:30.690
Windy Borjas: Lost in my own raw, you just piles up and piles up

594
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:37.260
Windy Borjas: And then when I finally come through the pile is just so big. It's too overwhelming.

595
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:48.750
Windy Borjas: I just want to walk away from it and start again. But the next time I turned back I have 100 of those enormous piles.

596
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:55.290
Windy Borjas: So I want to work on on just

597
01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:02.190
Windy Borjas: Being more strict with myself when it comes to, you know,

598
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:06.030
Windy Borjas: My personal routine.

599
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.340
