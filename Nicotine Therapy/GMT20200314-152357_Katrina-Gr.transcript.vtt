Katrina Groves: Hi it's Dr groves.

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:21.240
Katrina Groves: Zoom room number five to 26493217 doing histories and physicals on Saturday, March 14 from

3
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.010
Katrina Groves: Nine.

4
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:37.410
Katrina Groves: To, I don't know, it's kind of brand. It's going to be variable. So these are all established patients with me over three years from the donor community health center.

5
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.960
Katrina Groves: They're all opioid dependence in remission, at least.

6
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.950
Katrina Groves: I'll get them in when I can.

7
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
Katrina Groves: And as usual for all of these if you are my

8
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.810
Katrina Groves: Little transcriber

9
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.750
Katrina Groves: With Joe I believe if you could put in that

10
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.470
Katrina Groves: The risk scores protective scores a Sam a spurt and the cures report reviewed and appropriate that will be great.

11
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.200
Katrina Groves: For all of these

12
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.240
Katrina Groves: API.

13
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.790
Katrina Groves: Just looking at the last

14
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.810
Katrina Groves: Bullet points that you guys look at

15
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.130
Katrina Groves: The psych impression is also

16
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.310
Katrina Groves: The same as I always do, except I will put in some

17
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.220
Katrina Groves: Extras here and there.

18
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.830
Katrina Groves: If needed,

19
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.610
Katrina Groves: Good morning.

20
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.750
Katrina Groves: I see Doug's iPhone don't see dead yet.

21
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.870
Douglas’s iPhone: Sorry, I was right down. Never. I didn't realize you were there, right.

22
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.610
Katrina Groves: Oh, there you are.

23
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.640
Katrina Groves: Good morning, are you good. I've got my Yellowstone waterfall in the background.

24
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.600
Katrina Groves: Are you at home. Yeah. Yep.

25
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.830
Douglas’s iPhone: There and I just got back from we decided we wouldn't be too crazy, but we'd go get some groceries. Anyway, just to

26
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:43.740
Douglas’s iPhone: Stock up especially now that are Riley's home for the next like 18 days they canceled school and everything else. So we figured, might as well just go stock up on groceries at least

27
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.240
Douglas’s iPhone: Perfect. There's an interesting morning at five o'clock at window.

28
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.310
Katrina Groves: Is there a ton of people there. Was there like a run on toilet paper or something.

29
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.630
Douglas’s iPhone: Just most of the lot of shelves are pretty bare and

30
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:14.910
Douglas’s iPhone: There was quite a bit of people there for five o'clock in the morning, you, you know, normally we like to do that early, early shopping, especially if we wake up early and then get it done over with. But yeah, there was probably at least three or four times the normal people for 5am

31
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.680
Katrina Groves: We live in interesting times. That's for

32
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.860
Douglas’s iPhone: What do you think about this isn't something we need to worry about are obviously worried about, but not. I mean zones were healthy and taking precautions.

33
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.360
Katrina Groves: Yeah, you guys are not the high risk people if you're over 65 or if you have immune problems, you know, like

34
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.870
Katrina Groves: If you have diabetes. If you

35
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.670
Katrina Groves: Have

36
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.810
Katrina Groves: Other medical issues, you know, if you're just really sick then yeah, you should hide away from everybody. But right now, just

37
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.980
Katrina Groves: Wash your hands and keep going through your life, maybe avoid large crowds. You just mostly want to avoid old people.

38
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:15.720
Katrina Groves: We want to protect our elders. So, I mean, this is a we've been knowing this was going to happen for 2030 years it was just a matter of when. And now, it hasn't been the best

39
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:25.110
Katrina Groves: Start for the medical people didn't really get on it as as best as they could have, but it's all political in this country.

40
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:34.020
Douglas’s iPhone: That's exactly so I mean that's that's from, like, ah, one in one compared to this. Wait a minute. Right.

41
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.400
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, so that

42
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.780
Katrina Groves: The death toll and the people that all died up in Washington, apparently, most of them were

43
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:56.670
Katrina Groves: There were DNR DNI you know they're there were no codes. So that's, they just kind of let them pass so they didn't do anything to try to save them. And I think the press didn't talk about that. So just everybody panics and we don't panic. Yeah, good.

44
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.080
Katrina Groves: So this is going to be like a 45 minutes to an hour depends on how I have a feeling it will be pretty quick with you.

45
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.200
Katrina Groves: Just like an intake so

46
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.890
Katrina Groves: Yeah, you're in Oregon. Anyway, right. So, where, where are you living

47
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:26.730
Douglas’s iPhone: Well i. So, for them to even be able to put me in the system. They wanted me to use my California work address. Oh, yeah. Oh, living in cave junction, just like I always have been.

48
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.660
Okay.

49
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.340
Katrina Groves: Yeah.

50
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:38.700
Douglas’s iPhone: I don't know, for some reason, when they're doing that intake. The original paperwork that when I tried to give them the cave junction address he wasn't sure you'd be able to help me and then

51
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:48.750
Douglas’s iPhone: What I do, I'm like, Well, I haven't, you know, address, you can use for works. That's why I have used Dr groves is because I'm over on that side of the hill. So

52
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.390
Katrina Groves: Yeah, that works because I, they don't have or again yet in the bright heart health system.

53
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:09.150
Katrina Groves: So I'm we're working on that. But it takes a while. So if you ever have a problem, you can always come up and see me in person and Cottage Grove, which is a long drive probably but you know where that is right.

54
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.840
Or

55
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.710
Katrina Groves: So that's where my other practice is OK.

56
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.460
Douglas’s iPhone: So,

57
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.630
Katrina Groves: I am available. You just gotta call Tony, which was trying to work the system. I think all medicine should be like this. You know, I don't

58
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:30.420
Katrina Groves: You don't need to see people in the office. I think my older people should be doing telemedicine and then they don't have to come in with all the other people that are viruses.

59
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:41.460
Douglas’s iPhone: That's what I was telling the guys at work about how I just got set up to do this and like this can't beat it. I'm having had my appointment for intake was it work in the office and then

60
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.940
Sweet.

61
00:07:44.730 --> 00:08:00.720
Katrina Groves: Alright, so some of this is going to be duplicated. I have your part of your file on the other computer here at the same time. So I'm multitasking. I'm so for medical stuff dog. Do you have high blood pressure. Still, what, what are your medical problems that I need to remember

62
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.560
Douglas’s iPhone: previous history of high blood pressure, but rolled with low dose.

63
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.250
Douglas’s iPhone: On that simple staten and then Kobe Kobe this all skin cream.

64
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.800
Douglas’s iPhone: Limit I sent

65
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:27.480
Katrina Groves: My son, my son, is it the Lisinopril with the water pill enough hydrochloric side or just plain liason a pro.

66
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.000
Douglas’s iPhone: Thing. It's just playing my center pro like five milligram or something like that.

67
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:41.370
Katrina Groves: Okay, and finally rooms, less than a quarter once a day, and what what others. What was the Staten was the

68
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.670
Douglas’s iPhone: Cholesterol from the Staten thermostat.

69
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.530
Katrina Groves: And what's the dose on that you think

70
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.600
Douglas’s iPhone: I'm not positive. I mean, I can go grab it and see.

71
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.960
Okay.

72
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.220
Katrina Groves: So,

73
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.260
Douglas’s iPhone: let's invest in those 10 milligram

74
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.570
Katrina Groves: Good. And that's the only two that you take. Yeah.

75
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.150
Douglas’s iPhone: Oh, and then Claritin D.

76
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.850
Douglas’s iPhone: For seasonal allergies.

77
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.910
Douglas’s iPhone: One A Day. The 24 hour kill. Okay.

78
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.100
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I hear you sniffling already

79
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.110
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, that's it.

80
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.160
Douglas’s iPhone: closed beta cells, skin cream and then

81
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.040
Douglas’s iPhone: hydrocortisone for eczema.

82
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:47.340
Katrina Groves: So medical problems, eczema, high blood pressure, high cholesterol seasonal allergies. Anything else no diabetes, no thyroid

83
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.620
Douglas’s iPhone: Nope, okay. Well, the cholesterol and

84
00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:03.990
Douglas’s iPhone: High blood pressure at this point have been perfect I did just have a whole nother round of my annual blood work done at with Dr.

85
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:15.000
Douglas’s iPhone: Sue Taryn. And I haven't had my appointment to see her about that, but she didn't obviously call with any major problems are

86
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.290
Katrina Groves: You how do you

87
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.360
Katrina Groves: How do you spell her last name.

88
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.720
Douglas’s iPhone: E r a n

89
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:35.910
Katrina Groves: Okay, because if you have labs bright hearts going to want you to do labs to their little bit different. They're like that HIV. The hep C, all that stuff from past. Do they already do that.

90
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.520
Douglas’s iPhone: I don't know if they do the HIV and hep C. It's just the normal like

91
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.290
Douglas’s iPhone: Like cholesterol workup and thyroid and

92
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.820
Douglas’s iPhone: And I'm not sure about the HIV or have seen the

93
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.820
Katrina Groves: So bright heart will want you to do that on intake if they haven't told you already.

94
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.710
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah. They said they're setting labs to open door.

95
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.060
Katrina Groves: Okay to

96
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.740
Douglas’s iPhone: That I had a week to take them after seeing you basically week from today.

97
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:21.000
Katrina Groves: Okay, yeah, this is new to me too. So I'm learning their system. And if you prefer to get that done at your primary care, Doc, I suppose you could, but maybe just get them done and then give her a copy or whatever.

98
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:42.120
Douglas’s iPhone: That's fine. And I did do a records release for you for bright heart to be able to communicate with Sue Taryn. And then I did a record, please. Very under your name through open door so that open door had that were quite hard as well. Thank you.

99
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:49.170
Katrina Groves: So any hospitalizations. In the past, our operations or surgeries.

100
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.980
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, the collarbone. And last, then two years ago now broken collarbone.

101
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.300
Douglas’s iPhone: put back together with metal plates. Other than that, there hasn't been anything. The last 10 years at least.

102
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.890
Katrina Groves: And I would call you didn't even take any pain medication because you're just Superman.

103
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.370
Katrina Groves: All right.

104
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.620
Douglas’s iPhone: Your original surgery all the shoulder. The reason they're still

105
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:30.360
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, chronic pain reason I'm still on Suboxone would be the shoulder surgeries or surgery on my left and then impingement. It's non surgical they can't do anything about on the right.

106
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.540
Katrina Groves: Hmm, so they don't. They can't do anything about the right side, because why

107
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:46.650
Douglas’s iPhone: It's like that when I went to. I went to two different orthopedic people for that one. And after an MRI and everything that that it's just

108
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:58.500
Douglas’s iPhone: The join it. They said that the joint itself was described as a shoulder impingement and like a kind of a sloppy least joint, but it wasn't something that was surgery really

109
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:09.450
Douglas’s iPhone: Flexible when I was basically told that that's just the pain that you know just going to have to live with it and doing the Suboxone and then keeping it strength and

110
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:20.850
Douglas’s iPhone: That's really been quite honestly, the fix. I know it's been by strengthening those muscles and probably most health that any other than anything.

111
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.460
Katrina Groves: So they did send you to physical therapy right

112
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.900
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, okay.

113
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.880
Katrina Groves: So is the right shoulder the painful and the left is no longer painful.

114
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.980
Douglas’s iPhone: Know I have pain in both

115
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:41.700
Douglas’s iPhone: Surgery on the left, it kind of goes back and forth either both kind of flare up at different times seems to be a lot when I'm

116
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:57.000
Douglas’s iPhone: Having to do a lot more physical labor working like like go in and dig with the guys for a couple days or something like that or, um, I always find myself having to do that kind of stuff. But when I do, those are the times that it really flares up

117
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:05.100
Douglas’s iPhone: But he's really keeping up on those exercises that I've learned from physical therapy that's kind of a key.

118
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.550
Katrina Groves: Great. And the Suboxone dose, you're on right now is

119
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.350
Douglas’s iPhone: Three eight milligram per day.

120
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.080
Douglas’s iPhone: Not

121
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:27.420
Katrina Groves: Any problems that you're having with it trouble with the saliva trouble with the feeling not good doses are any issues.

122
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:33.540
Douglas’s iPhone: Been been just about right. I don't have a, you know, I take a lot of fiber.

123
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.520
Douglas’s iPhone: Fix that

124
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:52.230
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, I haven't really had any issues. There's months that you know I have a lot left over at the end. Sometimes I have two weeks worth you know extra because I don't always take three days.

125
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:58.500
Douglas’s iPhone: But then there's months that, you know, it really gets bad and I might have to take a full three a day.

126
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:05.340
Douglas’s iPhone: So definitely kind of goes back and forth, but so far. I think that right now. I think it's been working

127
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:19.980
Katrina Groves: Pretty well. So, so would you say two days your average or like when you're not hurting. Is that what keeps you is that your normal dose or would you say one with two and three with flare ups or

128
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:34.020
Douglas’s iPhone: A two a day or two to three days my point, honestly. Okay, then there you know below average would be days that sometimes I just straight forget. Forget even take it or something like that.

129
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:41.010
Katrina Groves: So as far as cravings. I mean, I know that's the chronic pain part. But do you have cravings for your past drugs.

130
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.530
Douglas’s iPhone: No, I don't.

131
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.350
Douglas’s iPhone: That's pretty awesome, really.

132
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.500
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, there's so many people out there and like just really

133
00:15:53.550 --> 00:16:01.950
Douglas’s iPhone: I've ever even had close to a craving. It just takes thinking about all the people that are still, you know, struggling from this, these

134
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:11.430
Douglas’s iPhone: kind of keeps me stable and it's never add up. I can't even really think the last time I really had a craving to

135
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:25.650
Douglas’s iPhone: Actually have an opiate actually kind of sick, obviously, with the having a surgery and then having a bottle that was right in front of me. I never. It was not a problem at all to not take the city given with him sitting on my shelf like

136

217
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:15.630

246
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.460

247
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:28.650
Douglas’s iPhone: That kind of kind of scared me and had me having that conversation with her about, you know, my annual blood work would catch early stages of cancer because my mom does have colon cancer in her family.

248
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:41.190
Douglas’s iPhone: And she had colon polyps when she was just like the last five years, and her doctor said, make sure you tell your, your kids about this, that they should be on kind of a high risk group for for

249
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:53.580
Douglas’s iPhone: Cancer in the future. So I had all those three tests done early. Just she had to kind of change some of the writing in her notes to make my insurance even pay for it, but

250
00:28:54.090 --> 00:29:04.080
Douglas’s iPhone: I was able to get all that stuff sounds like. I mean, I get it with her, but she hasn't called to say anything came back, you know, irregular

251
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.220
Katrina Groves: So your mom's, who was it in your mom's family that had colon cancer.

252
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.440
Douglas’s iPhone: My grandfather died of colon cancer and then she

253
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:13.710

255
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.900

257
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.340
Douglas’s iPhone: Sprint, she was getting watched for colon cancer as well. She had a

258
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:39.120
Douglas’s iPhone: Colonoscopy and they found polyps that are non cancerous, but kind of cancerous polyps or whatever that they caught early kind of thing.

259
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.530
Katrina Groves: That's excellent that you had all that health maintenance done. That's really good.

260
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.470

261
00:29:47.700 --> 00:30:06.660
Katrina Groves: 42 yeah so that the colon cancer screen. That's great. And they probably just let you wait another five years or so, and the and the CTO of the lungs. I assume as normal. But you know, that's that every time you smoke, you're going to risk the chance of turning on that gene.

262
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.530
Douglas’s iPhone: So,

263
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.420

285
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.610
Douglas’s iPhone: Nothing. That's not normal.

286
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.590
Katrina Groves: And neurologically you don't have history of seizures.

287
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.290

Katrina Groves: Okay, and the allergies to any medication that you know I've dug or just the pollen.

296
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.010
Douglas’s iPhone: Pollen

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.110
Not allergic to penicillin.

298
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:47.580
Douglas’s iPhone: When I was a baby. I was allergic to penicillin, but I've taken it since many times and I don't have any allergies to any medicines. Okay.

299
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.820
Katrina Groves: And have you had all your immunizations to get the flu shot.

300
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.540
Douglas’s iPhone: I didn't get one this year but I usually do.

301
00:33:55.590 --> 00:34:13.980
Katrina Groves: Okay, and then just for the record. Give me your history. This is the hardest part, probably to history of your addiction. How old were you when you started and what was the first thing you got hooked on alcohol pot just kind of give me the summary.

302
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.130
Douglas’s iPhone: Probably

303
00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:21.300
Douglas’s iPhone: Like

304
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.000
Douglas’s iPhone: Middle school age.

305
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.600
Douglas’s iPhone: Started smoking pot.

306
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.310
Douglas’s iPhone: And then throughout college years kind of really

307
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:47.610
Douglas’s iPhone: Strong with everything never really got hooked on say cocaine or anything like that. Like, can't you know how to do it every single day. But party plenty

308
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.070
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, drank.

309
00:34:51.690 --> 00:35:01.650
Douglas’s iPhone: The pot and the alcohol. Never. It never was an issue like where you can't do it kind of stopped doing it kind of thing. It was really when I hit the opiates.

310
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.750
Douglas’s iPhone: And now was

311
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:16.290
Douglas’s iPhone: Probably late probably in my college years just experimenting with different things. And, you know, people would have some pain pills and try those and I like those.

312
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.380
Katrina Groves: Can that was

313
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:34.680
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, I'd say Tony's, you know, and then when I really, when I lost control of it was after when I was probably what 24

314
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:45.690
Douglas’s iPhone: When I had my shoulder accident Akamai actually had the accident with my shoulder. It was my first season out here in Oregon and

315
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:52.710
Douglas’s iPhone: We had a water skiing accident and then got pain pills for that. And that kind of started just

316
00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:01.410
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, years like two almost three years straight before I even had surgery that I would go back to the doctors and get more pain pills and back.

317
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:11.520
Douglas’s iPhone: Back and forth. And then that eventually led to multiple doctors and, you know, lying to them about, Well this one's not working so

318
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:19.590
Douglas’s iPhone: Getting them to write a new prescription before that prescription was even up, you know, and then eventually that doctor might catch on and then

319
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:38.190
Douglas’s iPhone: I moved to a different doctor and and that kind of things and then eventually you know when doctors in between doctor start buying them, you know, on the street, kind of thing. And so as the other Opiates are definitely the biggest one and

320
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.040
Douglas’s iPhone: Obviously what

321
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.980
Douglas’s iPhone: 2009 is when I finally

322
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.630
Douglas’s iPhone: Gave up and checked myself into a rehab there in Oregon at serenity lane.

323
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.060
Katrina Groves: How long was the rehab.

324
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:55.800
Douglas’s iPhone: 30 days.

325
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.490
Katrina Groves: But then were you cared. When you got out.

326
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:06.540
Douglas’s iPhone: No, then yeah you know 90 meetings in 90 days of Na na and

327
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.690
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, really. I didn't

328
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.700
Douglas’s iPhone: Know, have a beer here in America Taro, but for

329
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:23.220
Douglas’s iPhone: I'd say it was probably until almost the seven eight year mark that I finally

330
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:35.430
Douglas’s iPhone: You know that I didn't touch anything. I absolutely when I was scared to death of of all of it, you know, thinking that, you know, and knowing myself that, you know, alright have when I was in that

331
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:42.570
Douglas’s iPhone: That delicate of a stage like you know if I have a beer, you know, maybe that'll be the next addiction.

332
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.520
Douglas’s iPhone: You know,

333
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:54.120
Douglas’s iPhone: So yeah, the years of meetings, obviously, and then both the Suboxone treatment and then na na

334
00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:11.640
Katrina Groves: So why did you so you were clean quite a while and in recovery rather after your, your rehab program what led to you saying, oh, you know, I need Suboxone I can't, you know, not just doing it without any medication.

335
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.560
Katrina Groves: Because you didn't get on Suboxone for a

336
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.220
Katrina Groves: While right

337
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.750
Douglas’s iPhone: No, I

338
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.690
Douglas’s iPhone: I got on Suboxone during the, during treatment.

339
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.250
Katrina Groves: Oh, they gave it to you there.

340
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:31.860
Douglas’s iPhone: And went to Dr. Roberts there in Grants Pass for I came to you and saying that when

341
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:45.450
Douglas’s iPhone: They had taken me often Suboxone during the treatment and then also after leaving treatment. I was off for a while. And that's when the shoulder pain would just continue and

342
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.370
Douglas’s iPhone: Doing. Dr. Roberts and then talking to the you know the

343
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.370
Douglas’s iPhone: Orthopedic surgeon

344
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.530
Douglas’s iPhone: Forget the name of the office down in Medford, but doesn't matter.

345
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:07.050
Douglas’s iPhone: When they, you know, decided that it was most likely that some kind of a pain management was going to need to continue throughout

346
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:16.650
Douglas’s iPhone: You know my life if I can't get this corrected and yeah that's that's kind of how that worked out was that between the

347
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:26.520
Douglas’s iPhone: Dr. Roberts and him talking directly back to the treatment facility. The doctor at serenity lane and then orthopedic surgeon kind of

348
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:35.520
Douglas’s iPhone: Together and and made that in with my, you know, with me being part of that conversation that that's the route that we should try

349
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:49.860
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, obviously, you know, we wouldn't want to ever have to go back to true the regular you know like it in or something like that. But maybe that we manage it was the Suboxone and that would be enough. And that's obviously

350
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:59.100
Katrina Groves: Great. Excellent. That was thank you for sharing that. So what are your goals for you. The next

351
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:00.810
Katrina Groves: Year.

352
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.810
Katrina Groves: Longer five years. Do you have any

353
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:14.430
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, we're we're look really looking at I've had multiple offers for like as far as work goes, I'd say first would be in life goals is

354
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:28.170
Douglas’s iPhone: Kind of continue our app for the next three years. Three, including this year will be four years. So we're basically Riley getting out of high school, and we'll, we'll start looking for the next move.

355
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:41.520
Douglas’s iPhone: And that'll probably be out of working California moving like we're thinking maybe Idaho maybe Montana. This summer, you know, you don't have to worry about locking your car so much kind of thing.

356
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:59.490
Douglas’s iPhone: And what that is a career move division chief as my next step up from superintendent of the crew and I'm just, I've been offered that position twice now they really wanted me to take it on my own district as well as another district on the forest.

357
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:06.840
Douglas’s iPhone: But that's that job takes is a lot more behind the desk not you know you're

358
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:16.230
Douglas’s iPhone: You're in charge of the full whole fire program at your office so you don't get to go out on fires as much anymore where I'm part of a fire module. So

359
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:24.630
Douglas’s iPhone: Being in there with the guys and going on fires and, you know, doing what I do. I absolutely love that I quite honestly make more money because of the overtime.

360
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:35.550
Douglas’s iPhone: Even though the GS 11 would be higher pay throughout the year at the GS nine rate I make just as much money, if not more so the overtime. So

361
00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.560
Douglas’s iPhone: And I think the physical activity for

362
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:45.180
Katrina Groves: You is so good for your soul and your brain and your body and you know it's like Captain Kirk, don't let them promote you to Admiral

363
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:55.230
Douglas’s iPhone: I agree. And I've seen it so many times over guys go to that job and next year too because you're constantly do at the

364
00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:10.110
Douglas’s iPhone: Real high up the political stuff. I see some of that, but it's not my main job and guys go from loving what they do to being grumpy and getting overweight and you know making unhealthy choices with everything and

365
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:21.420
Douglas’s iPhone: I'm definitely in no hurry to get there, but same time, I know that you know I'm getting closer to talk. I mean, I can actually retire in five years by wanted to

366
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.620
Douglas’s iPhone: Wow, have a full

367
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:30.390
Douglas’s iPhone: Because it's 25 years under 50 and 20 years over 50 for firefighter attire. So

368
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:42.030
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, getting that you want here. Hi, three or last three years to be their highest pay rate so that are somewhere in there. You want your high, they're going to average your retirement off your high three

369
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:59.400
Douglas’s iPhone: Years of salary. So you want to get that higher rate at some point, just, you know, I'm going to wait a few more years until and get my, you know, Riley out of high school, and then we'll kind of look to we'd like him to finish school here. Mm hmm. Then

370
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.870
Katrina Groves: Disruptive social

371
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.490
Douglas’s iPhone: And then we can, this House is house we're in right now is

372
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:16.020
Douglas’s iPhone: Like our mortgages down to like 70 grand like really in a good spot houses we bought it for super cheap and 2009 when the housing market collapse so

373
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:25.050
Douglas’s iPhone: Selling this or renting it out at that four year mark from now you know or be even closer to pay off where we can, we might be able to just go

374
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:35.850
Douglas’s iPhone: Take a new job somewhere and not even have to buy maybe just rent because it might be just a stepping stone maybe we've even talked about North Carolina, Florida, something

375
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:51.120
Douglas’s iPhone: Different to do for years and and then look to buy property by property, something that we can retire on have chickens and goats and all that kind of stuff. Stuff. We can't have in a subdivision.

376
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.940
Katrina Groves: Right now, that's really, that's great. I can see the whole vision just planned out for your

377
00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:04.410
Katrina Groves: Mind when you're talking about it and it's very good. A plus i mean that you know you're going to get to a point where we all get older and we're all

378
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:12.090
Katrina Groves: crumbling around so you're not gonna be able to do your firefighter stuff for and then you've got another step, though, then you can go into

379
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.450
Katrina Groves: Into the administration.

380
00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.580
Douglas’s iPhone: Personally, yeah.

381
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:25.380
Katrina Groves: Great. So, um, how often are you going to Tony's clinic. Do you think so.

382
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.370
Douglas’s iPhone: Maybe once a month.

383
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:39.630
Douglas’s iPhone: Just depends on how busy. I am this year has been another busy winner. I spent 30 days and North Carolina and Florida in January.

384
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:55.740
Douglas’s iPhone: We just got back from a fire down in Mendocino there and have a fire escape file burned down in colo so I did two weeks down there. Just got back last week from that and then trainings and everything so

385
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:04.950
Katrina Groves: We're so worried about you. During those huge fires down. I mean, anytime there's a huge fire. I think about, Oh my gosh, where's Dad, you know, did you have to go to Australia or did you have to go to

386
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:12.120
Katrina Groves: San Luis Obispo again. Or where was that fire. Oh Petaluma Santa Rosa something anyway.

387
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:18.720
Douglas’s iPhone: We ended up I was on the list for Australia. I even got one got my passport and then

388
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:25.080
Douglas’s iPhone: Couple. There was a couple division chiefs that they pick the people that had been

389
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:39.000
Douglas’s iPhone: Their closest to retirement, because it's kind of a once in a lifetime kind of thing to go fight fire and Australia. So wow, anybody that was ahead of me on the list that had more seniority which there was two guys that ended up getting picked to go and

390
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:50.820
Douglas’s iPhone: I was kind of bummed not to go but that's right around the same time that I go into North Carolina and went and helped run that same crew that I did in 2015 I ran that a crew out there. It's

391
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:57.270
Douglas’s iPhone: A job through like all under privileged, you know, Job Corps students. Cool.

392
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:05.640
Douglas’s iPhone: Our program through their Job Corps center. So it's really a mentoring kind of thing you take them down and burn down in Florida for

393
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:15.990
Douglas’s iPhone: You know, two weeks at a time and it's pretty good opportunity to kind of share your experience with the younger generation. And then you're teaching them really everything from

394
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:28.680
Douglas’s iPhone: Like life skills. Yeah. So it was always a good opportunity. So that was right around the Australia time too. So I wasn't too heartbroken because I already had something lined up. Yeah.

395
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.770
Katrina Groves: Well, so good to see you.

396
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:49.260
Douglas’s iPhone: Doing well what what. So what's the so as far as bright heart. And what does this look like for me, do I need to do anything. Like when I signed up originally with bright heart day I got emails and talked about weekly meetings.

397
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.080
Douglas’s iPhone: Right so anything's changed.

398
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.400
Katrina Groves: Yes, so getting hooked up with me.

399
00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.170
Katrina Groves: What my

400
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:06.120
Katrina Groves: What my goal was for this was when I left open door. I couldn't really leave. Oops. Did I lose you.

401
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.720
Douglas’s iPhone: Know it's just going low power mode. Let me grab my shark.

402
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.940
Katrina Groves: Stan

403
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:49.980
Katrina Groves: When I left open door because I, you know, moved with my dad, I had to come here to take care of my dad.

404
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:55.890
Katrina Groves: I've just been doing telemedicine. Well, I think I've seen you on telemedicine at Dolores before

405
00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:03.570
Katrina Groves: So I did that for a while thinking they're going to get a new doctor, they're going to get a new doctor, it's been like, what, two years and they still don't have a new doctor

406
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:12.690
Katrina Groves: So I just decided, I'm kind of like you for my retirement. What a great thing I could do, and take with me anywhere I could be in Hawaii. I could be

407
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.040
Katrina Groves: I guess I can't be walking Yosemite, I wouldn't good service, but

408
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:29.040
Katrina Groves: So my goal was to get the group because there was like 101 point 120 people that I could not just let not have a doctor because there was nowhere to go.

409
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:46.680
Katrina Groves: So I just decided to do this and that way they can come on board with my group. So long story short, is that right now. I'm just grand fathering in all of you guys who have been stable for 678 910 years. So now you do not have to come, three days a week or

410
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.180
Katrina Groves: I'm thinking every two or three months. Just like we had before.

411
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:58.440
Katrina Groves: You know, bright heart is not used to that because they are a relatively new, not really, but new company.

412
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:08.760
Katrina Groves: So they don't have people with this long term sobriety. So they're they're getting people in right at the original, you know,

413
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:20.460
Katrina Groves: Induction stuff. So I'm totally fine with you coming back and actually that's another question. When do you need your prescription for Suboxone. How much do you have left. How many refills.

414
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.220
Douglas’s iPhone: I'm out on the 31st of this month.

415
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.660
Douglas’s iPhone: So you need a script.

416
00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:32.400
Douglas’s iPhone: No refills left so that that finishes off that three month prescription that the last one that I got from del Norte

417
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.290
Katrina Groves: Got it. So I'm going to what pharmacy. Do you think I can. I think I could send it to any pharmacy. Did you just follow. Yeah.

418
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:47.910
Douglas’s iPhone: Right now in your system there right hard. They have listed CVS in Crescent City and that that's where this prescription should go.

419
00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:48.780
Douglas’s iPhone: Really

420
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:49.740
Katrina Groves: You still want it.

421
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:56.070
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, CBS in Crescent City because they're brand new, and they're never busy.

422
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:08.700
Douglas’s iPhone: Okay things to work. And then, you know, just like in years past. If you know hopefully what the three month thing. It's really been working pretty well to where I can

423
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.440
Douglas’s iPhone: Get refills on the road. And I know you know the only time that becomes an issue is

424
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:26.880
Douglas’s iPhone: When transferring medicine. So if I transfer that prescription away from CVS once that it's no longer transferable. So if I transfer it down to southern California on fire and there's still read to refills left. Basically, I gotta go.

425
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:39.930
Douglas’s iPhone: Refill. So that's the only time it gets weird that like I've called Tony before and said, hey, can you have one month called in to this place, so I don't lose the other two months that are sitting at the pharmacy kind of exactly

426
00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:49.590
Katrina Groves: And and I would encourage you to continue because this is still a transition. And there are some people that can't ever get on bright heart because of their insurance or other issues.

427
00:50:49.920 --> 00:51:02.580
Katrina Groves: I would stay in touch with Tony's group. She's always available, she can get ahold of me 24 seven we can keep doing so just keep doing what you're doing, but just check in here once every three months or whatever you're

428
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:13.560
Katrina Groves: Both. So this is your kind of intake thing. And now you I want to put you on with a group, but I know you can't always make that

429
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:29.310
Katrina Groves: If I do three months down the road you. Who knows what you're going to be doing. Would you rather try and do a group like this Monday or next Monday. Or I'm doing groups on at 545 on Monday evenings to get people so they can work. Okay.

430
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:34.980
Douglas’s iPhone: You have a is that are all of them late like that, during the day.

431
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:37.110
Douglas’s iPhone: They're all right.

432
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:43.140
Katrina Groves: Well, because that's the only I only do one, our group week because I have two other jobs and

433
00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:51.270
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, we can try maybe not this Monday, but let me look at my

434
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.620
Douglas’s iPhone: Yo, I can do on the following Monday.

435
00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:57.150
So the 23rd.

436
00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:58.830
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah.

437
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:05.070
Katrina Groves: That would be good. So I'll put you down for that if there's some problem, then do the 30th.

438
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.750
Katrina Groves: Basically just

439
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:19.050
Katrina Groves: Do you have that bright heart number and call them if you can't make it, and reschedule for the next Monday. I just wanted to get you one one group here and then

440
00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:25.800
Katrina Groves: I'll send your prescription in today for later in the month.

441
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.510
Douglas’s iPhone: That's good.

442
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:37.200
Katrina Groves: And then let me see. What's three months after I don't know if it's worth doing in a schedule. I kind of have to tell him when you're going to be back. So let's try to do

443
00:52:39.690 --> 00:53:01.140
Katrina Groves: 1-234-567-8910 1112 so it looks like June 8 would be 12 weeks. Okay, so I'll put you down on that June 8 at 545 but I understand things will change between then and now.

444
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:05.400
Douglas’s iPhone: And that's basically an other group meeting at 545

445
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:13.350
Katrina Groves: Right, so we don't have this one on one stuff that we do anymore. We just then you'll be in with some other people, you'll know them all. They're all from group.

446
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.230
Katrina Groves: Although you don't know them well but

447
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.580
Katrina Groves: They're all the same people.

448
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.810
Katrina Groves: And then I'm going on vacation from the 15th to the

449
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.420
Katrina Groves: 30th, but so if you need anything.

450
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:28.110
Katrina Groves: You can still get in touch with Tony and we can still

451
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:29.640
Katrina Groves: Do that.

452
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:30.480
Okay.

453
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:35.100
Katrina Groves: All right, well, excellent. Nice to see you.

454
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.820
Douglas’s iPhone: Again soon you enjoy the rest of your day. Is it snowing up there.

455
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.560
Katrina Groves: No, it's beautiful.

456
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.390
Douglas’s iPhone: Weather rainy

457
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.230
Katrina Groves: You got snow.

458
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.430
Douglas’s iPhone: Yeah, we got snow right now. It's just a couple inches on the ground already

459
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.370
Katrina Groves: I fun. Yeah. Alright. Well, I'll let you go and you know how to end the meeting and do all that on your end. All right, take care.

460
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.130
Katrina Groves: See you in a few months. Actually, I'll see you in two weeks.

461
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.570
Douglas’s iPhone: Sounds good.

462
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.130
Katrina Groves: Alright.

463
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.040
Katrina Groves: So,

464
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:22.200
Katrina Groves: Patient was casually groomed and just do the usual site normal very normal psychiatric

465
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.660
Katrina Groves: Any mental status exam or whatever you guys want to call it.

466
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.060
Katrina Groves: No suicide risk.

467
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:40.890
Katrina Groves: So I think you have this please tell me if you don't. But, you know, the alert and oriented, the concentration the mood, the grooming the speech, the thoughts on that. Just put normal

468
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.380
Katrina Groves: Very cool guy.

469
00:54:44.430 --> 00:55:01.920
Katrina Groves: Got his act together. I will be calling in a prescription for the Suboxone eight milligrams three a day for with three refills to CDs and Crescent City his diagnoses are the opioid dependence severe oh no IV use on him. By the way, it was all oral opioids. I forgot to mention that

470
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:10.830
Katrina Groves: in remission hypertension controlled on medication.

471
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.140
Katrina Groves: Eczema controlled

472
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:24.780
Katrina Groves: On medication seasonal allergies controlled on medication you heard about his

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.770
Katrina Groves: Chronic shoulder pain.

474
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:34.410
Katrina Groves: From fracture and impingement which is

475
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:56.580
Katrina Groves: Controlled with current Suboxone so he does have opioid use for pain diagnosis but but it's more addiction. So I wouldn't make the pain of primary and he has nicotine dependence cigarettes and it is mild

476
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:05.250
Katrina Groves: Sounds like he's motivated to perhaps quit hopefully

477
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:16.590
Katrina Groves: He you did get the history of his doctors, Dr. Sue, I think it was Taryn. It sounded like parent but te R and he spelled it but I didn't catch it.

478
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.600
Katrina Groves: And I will see him on

479
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:24.330

484
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.170
Katrina Groves: Alright so I'm done with him. I'm waiting for another one. Hang on.

485
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.980
