Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any progress, um,

19
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:59.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know maybe you can reach out to the album. Have you ever met with Dr. April. I know she was trying to help patients so interested in quitting smoking and so there was, I think there's like different medication that you can mail out to kind of help support that.

20
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
Robert Hammond: All right. Uh, I talked to my doctor about that, dude. I, uh, I got on that Jen pics

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, good, good.

24
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What made you decide what led to the decision of wanting to quit smoking.

25
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.960
Robert Hammond: I've been trying to Chris Farley for a long time now, I can be my own boss and I didn't want him to be ranking I want him around.

26
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.010
Robert Hammond: To the back when I was younger.

27
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.530
Robert Hammond: But a problem because he started getting

28
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Started what

29
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.520
Robert Hammond: Started spitting like

Robert Hammond: Tobacco

31
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.380
Robert Hammond: So I hadn't quit smoking queuing and everything around it. Yeah.

32
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely a process.

33
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.160
Right.

34
00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:07.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, clearly, you're working towards it, you're committed to the goal. So that's the the nose. Whenever you take a step towards investing into your overall health and well being. That's good to have you done any other things like adding exercise or anything else to to the team.

35
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.790
Robert Hammond: I still do.

36
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.370
Robert Hammond: Not

37
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.870
Robert Hammond: Know, I've made a couple of more meeting this weekend.

38
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What did you think about our conversation. Well, we kind of talked about boundaries and relationships. What are some things you gotta

39
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.210
Robert Hammond: I just took up but my opinion old are actually in a group, writing

40
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.700
Robert Hammond: Talking about that.

41
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People anytime out boundaries.

42
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.260
Robert Hammond: Right, I'll codependency and stuff like that.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.780
Robert Hammond: I definitely got to work on that. I still got going on. Yeah.

44
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how long have you been with this. I'm just refine

45
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.860
Robert Hammond: What is it

46
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like fading away. What was that

47
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.160
Robert Hammond: Almost, almost three years.

48
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a long time in

49
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: House for recovery been

50
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Saying, in comparison to look

51
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.870
Robert Hammond: Order backwards.

52
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.360
Robert Hammond: Okay, talk to

53
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.920
Robert Hammond: Me about going into the movies and stuff going to get the fly go the owners. We don't do not

54
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.410
Robert Hammond: Like that.

55
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can you speak a little closer to the mouthpiece, you're like,

56
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.400
Robert Hammond: Yeah, sorry about it. Good, yeah.

57
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.060
Robert Hammond: One of the groups is good, but I didn't know how that how that works, and all that.

58
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.950
Yeah, she

59
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She wants to enroll in the program. That's fine. We just I wouldn't be able to see her as an individual therapists who will be

60
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It would be

61
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A conflict of interest. Yeah, that's what I was thinking a movie and

62
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.010
Robert Hammond: Conflict. If I were seeing her, it will be considered a dual

63
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relationship. So you would have to she would have to see someone else.

64
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:51.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But definitely encouraged if there, if you have a spouse that you're in a relationship with and you want to make it work in there. Also, and at it, both of you should be participate in this type of addiction recovery program to protect your sobriety as well as you know the relationship

65
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.300
Robert Hammond: Right, October after if I want to go to you. I hope you will be before

66
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

67
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.450
Robert Hammond: Celebrating program.

68
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.950
Robert Hammond: Know that one to do something.

69
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:21.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what keeps you committed to this relationship. I mean, last week we talked about some of the not so good things in a relationship, but it was some of the three years I imagine now some some good things so

70
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: what's working well in the relationship.

71
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.780
Robert Hammond: Like during my time there. I don't have like that like I can always rely on her to help me for

72
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.750
Robert Hammond: Maybe go for everything like that to help her.

73
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.210
Robert Hammond: feel happy. We're lucky. Lucky like to be going through

74
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.600
Robert Hammond: Go on record. Oh, we've done

75
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A video for you.

76
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the paradigm of relationships and and the different roles that we

77
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.950
Play in those relationships.

78
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.330
Talking to you.

79
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said the support that you all have for each other.

80
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those things play a part.

81
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.350
Robert Hammond: My father had a pornography that he had to go do today.

82
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How's he doing

83
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.670
Robert Hammond: He's nervous Adele

84
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.130
Robert Hammond: I was all I had to have one of those in the belt.

85
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.770
Robert Hammond: Fantastic literally

86
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

87
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So car when you have to go through different surgeries and process, especially as you get older.

88
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.720
Robert Hammond: Right, you said that you're putting it off for a while.

89
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.980
Robert Hammond: I'm wondering maybe do it.

90
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With Dr. Alan about the medication and glue

91
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.600
Robert Hammond: Yeah.

92
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He says on what

93
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:03.150
Robert Hammond: On the weekend going really like from basically from appointment to appointment. Okay.

94
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I always let him know when the next appointment is and I think we're on. Oh, are we on a weekly

95
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: tracker, we do every other week.

96
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.510
Like

97
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We do every other week. So we'll finalize that before the end of the session and I'll let him know.

98
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:37.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That this here on is the drama triangle. And like I mentioned earlier, it shows the different roles that we play in relationships. And so as you're watching the video identify what role you're thinking, typically playing relationships.

99
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:52.140
Saying how conflict arises between people, often in dramatic or intense relationships or interactions and it was conceived by a guy called Stephen Kaufman in 1968

100
00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:00.870
And it involves three different roles one that's kind of cold one down role and to that a cold one approach.

101
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.340
History roles. The victim, the rescuer

102
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.200
persecutor

103
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:17.760
And I think understanding how these roles work can really help us to identify how we could be resolving potentially destructive interactions that are quite

104
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:31.950
Draining on our energy. So let's start with the victim role. I think the victim role is quite self explanatory. It's the person who feels helpless and powerless, like they can never cut a break.

105
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.620
Or they can never get ahead in life. They often think things like, you know, this always happens to me.

106
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:47.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another role in this drama triangle is the rescue and this person is someone who takes responsibility for other people's problems.

107
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:56.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they kind of make it their own problems. But at the same time, they don't really look at their own life, which could in fact be a complete mess.

108
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:12.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they'll say people who might be going through a difficult time and think, oh look at that person you know they need help. I'm nice so I'll help them or maybe something a bit more parental like if that person did what I said they'd be happy.

109
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:20.010
And I think the dynamic that we often see play out between the victim.

110
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:29.700
And the rescuer is something that we see in movies and, you know, romantic comedies all the time. It's something that we almost think is normal.

111
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:42.360
But it really is an unhealthy interaction. So the third row on this triangle is a persecutor. This is a person who is frustrated. They're kind of self righteous and a bit of a bullied.

112
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:48.120
You know, and they might think things like you know they're wrong. And I'm right may need to do what I say.

113
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:56.880
Or that person will get what's coming to them. Another thing that's really important to recognize about this triangle is that each of these roles move between each other.

114
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:08.130
So, you know, the rescuer can become a prostitute or or the prosecutor can become the victim, the victim can become the persecutor so they all kind of move around.

115
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:19.620
Another concept that's really important to understand when talking about the drama triangle is this idea of the starting gate, we tend to have this one role that we most naturally sort of enter into

116
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:26.910
So for instance, you know one person might often go straight to the victim law where someone else might jump into the rescue.

117
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:38.820
The other thing that's really interesting about this is that starting gate roll sort of is part of what we see as our own identity and like I said before, we shift from one role to the other.

118
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:57.270
Inevitably, we all end up in the victim role feeling powerless and helpless and I able to do anything. And that's why it's really important to work out strategies for how to get out of this triangle. So I guess that brings me to the next question. How do we get out of this drama triangle.

119
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:07.860
So let's take it by looking at each role again. So in the one down victim role, we need to become a survivor. In order to do this.

120
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:20.580
We need to think like a problem solver and ask ourselves questions like what do I want and what steps can I take to get what I want another useful thing to do is to reflect on the good things that are going away.

121
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.170
So we can make a note of it in a calendar or diary.

122
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.480
You know, ask ourselves questions like What are three things that I'm grateful for today.

123
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.480
Or at the end of each week we could ask ourselves, what did I change this week.

124
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:48.030
So let's move on to the rescuer role. Again, if this is where you tend to find yourself sitting, you need to think of yourself as a teacher or a coach.

125
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.710
Rather than as a rescue you need to remember the golden rule about teaching a man to fish.

126
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:59.910
So you need to support and encourage the person in ways to identify and solve their problems rather than rushing into solve it for them.

127
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:07.500
You can ask them things like, what is it that you want to see happen in the situation or what do you think you can do to changes.

128
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.730
Also, you need to make sure that you set boundaries setting boundaries around the time that you're able to listen to the person I'm letting them know that is really important.

129
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:32.460
In some ways it's a similar situation with the starting gate persecutor who like the rescue of what some cells in this sort of one not power powerful position. The difference is with this role is that you need to become a challenge of need to be firm but fair in your approach to people.

130
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:46.140
And to help the person recognize how you're feeling, you need to sort of address the consequences of their actions and set boundaries. So for instance, you could say something like, if you if you keep your side of the agreement, I can keep one

131
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.030
As well the rescuer. It's important to remember to set these boundaries and recognize that this isn't your problem to solve.

132
00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:08.640
By freeing ourselves from this drama triangle, we are able to have happier, healthier relationships with people who might feel so drained and powerless and will also be able to identify toxic relationships that we may in fact be better off without

133
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.250
Robert Hammond: The

134
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:21.330
Robert Hammond: One.

135
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.160
Robert Hammond: Important thing.

136
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.140
Robert Hammond: That I go, I go back and forth between the rescuer persecutor

137
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, what situations do you typically become the prosecutor.

138
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Usually a common person or particular problem that

139
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.810
Robert Hammond: My girlfriend right now. We like every time we run out of gas. She's always expecting you to push

140
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:10.830
Robert Hammond: And lately I've been, you know, sitting like like I thought within boundaries but i would i would even nailed

141
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.890
Robert Hammond: It on my phone. We

142
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.050
Robert Hammond: Know that

143
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.410
Robert Hammond: You know, I could be helping me well.

144
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.880
Robert Hammond: Instead of just making a big deal about it.

145
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:24.690
Yeah.

146
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:37.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean, But lastly you already kind of mentioned that, um, never be established rules and boundaries in your relationship. So it seems that whenever things

147
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:49.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are created, it's more out of anger or resentment, because the situation. So let's see a pattern or history of behaviors that she's doing that you don't like.

148
00:16:49.530 --> 00:17:01.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so rather than communicating the boundaries or the rules or the respectful terms in the relationship. You know, you may just operate out of your anger and resentment.

149
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.070
Robert Hammond: Right.

150
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:10.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, and we've all been guilty of that in relationships, small, we can't play communicate our needs for our frustrations.

151
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, maybe spiteful and do certain things that we know will hurt or a spouse, but we do it as a way to kind of pull back point on

152
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:37.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The downside of that no one really went because your spouse is upset with you and you know, even as you just shared. No, no, it's not right, but you're doing it because you feel like there needs to be some type of balance in the relationship.

153
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's why it's important to

154
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Establish those ground rules and some of those boundaries.

155
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:45.870
Robert Hammond: Right.

156
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.450
Robert Hammond: Good job, good job, Linda, not long ago.

157
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.700
Robert Hammond: And we're talking about that.

158
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, you are discussing.

159
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:04.920
Robert Hammond: Is that how we end up blowing up and then freakin making one problem into a bigger problem just by freaking I resentments to each other.

160
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.690
Robert Hammond: You know, holding up to start working with me.

161
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:18.060
Robert Hammond: But holding on to resentments, and then friggin fighting each other with the with that and it's like no reason for it. Yeah.

162
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:19.890
Yeah.

163
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He becomes the prosecutor, you know, what role is she, she become the victim, but she prosecuting

164
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.610
Robert Hammond: Two brothers do

165
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.090
Robert Hammond: You bet on that one. Yeah.

166
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.380
Robert Hammond: I mean everything

167
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From the rescuer

168
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.410
Robert Hammond: About almost all the time.

169
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.550
Robert Hammond: Always got some something problem going on that needs help with always a favorite actor or something.

170
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.930
Robert Hammond: So I find myself rigging.

171
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.070
Robert Hammond: Stuff and then I don't even think about my stuff and then the exam.

172
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.120
Robert Hammond: Well I pushed to the back and

173
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.480
Robert Hammond: You know, I end up living her life and not mine.

174
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:19.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reaching out with your friends to that they call you whenever they need things but when it's you know your time for me. They're not responsive.

175
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:28.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would it be safe to say that you attract that that type of personality. You know those people that typically need you.

176
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:31.650
Robert Hammond: Definitely

177
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:40.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What qualities do you think that as to attracting those type of personalities.

178
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.520
Robert Hammond: Honesty and my willingness to to actually

179
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.510
Robert Hammond: Meet them to do for me, you know, the same way.

180
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:59.430
Robert Hammond: So I give freely, you know, the people I don't even know. I mean, I trust them everything could do and trust right off the bat.

181
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.420
Robert Hammond: No, no.

182
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that way.

183
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:06.990
Yeah.

184
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:18.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's break down that word willingness. What does that mean to you. What's the definition of work, how does that relate to you.

185
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:26.970
Robert Hammond: You're open to new ideas, new things. Did you know this new experiences. What else without their

186
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Has a child. Um, did you have that same Ole Miss one for us.

187
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.050
Robert Hammond: I don't remember being

188
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.590
Robert Hammond: I don't even know my personality back then.

189
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.240
Robert Hammond: I was always

190
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.600
Robert Hammond: Kind of keep that as I

191
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.620
Robert Hammond: Was in troubles, though.

192
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:10.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So another world will break down as music right so I can imagine Gretna if I'm wrong. Well up in a household where there is

193
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Kind of like this is high standard to not make a mistake to do what you gotta do, and just always be on guard.

194
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:40.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And in situations where I always have to be on guard. I can be defensive or resentful. One of the other depending on situation. And so even though you have this willingness to continue to help people and that willingness, the resentment continues to pile up

195
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:50.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so it's I'm willing. I'm willing but that the other part is, why does it have to be me to do it.

196
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the relationship builds

197
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Into

198
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:07.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Toxic situations which continues to perpetuate the prosecutor role and continuously develop a resentment.

199
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:17.070
Robert Hammond: Right now, remember that before that he's dead. He's like crazy. I'm done. Now just dumping everything in

200
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.880
Yeah.

201
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you find a new release this resentment, it must be

202
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On a scale of one to 10, it must be

203
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A level of intensity

204
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you've been absorbing, so much, for so long. And then you finally just

205
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do those things where you may help her wash the car or like you said last week, so her car different things with that.

206
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:49.830
Robert Hammond: Right.

207
00:22:52.380 --> 00:23:09.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So my question is when do you know that you're reaching your limit. When do you know that, hey, this is a signal that my resentment is rising, and maybe I should communicate around the rule, rule before flag it to the intensity

208
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.820
Robert Hammond: Right, well they leave it when I start catching myself getting angry, that's when I started realizing the Hadith, you know I shouldn't be getting angry. Like there's

209
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.090
Robert Hammond: Nothing I start talking to them right away. There's

210
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.570
Robert Hammond: There's something wrong, there's something wrong with relationship or whatever.

211
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.590
Robert Hammond: Figure out what was going on. What you know what's bothering me and know how to fix it.

212
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, what's the

213
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's your spouse's response on a sheet. Typically, the following day, you're getting

214
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.600
Robert Hammond: Into things I'm always keeping all that

215
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.360
Robert Hammond: Nice Guys blow me off and stuff.

216
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.140
Robert Hammond: I'm displeased engine. But as long as I get it out in

217
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.300
Robert Hammond: A good really

218
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:52.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good.

219
00:23:53.430 --> 00:24:12.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's good to get out, but you also want someone to understand what you're saying. Because when you do the release. And there's a block that person doesn't understand it also takes away from the relation and and feeling understood

220
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.040
Robert Hammond: Right. That's why you're going to be me this one.

221
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You say give me this morning.

222
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.470
Robert Hammond: No leaders read this relationship.

223
00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:25.050
Robert Hammond: Remember,

224
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Remember last week you were really upset and based on what you shared with me. I understand why you would be

225
00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:47.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what happens if you need this relationship and you go to the next relationship and you have it establish boundaries and you continue to be the prosecutor and you continue to

226
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:54.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have this willingness, but on the back end at the speed limit. You're going to see the same behavior, same outcome.

227
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.890
Right.

228
00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.790
Robert Hammond: I know I've been noticing patterns like that.

229
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:14.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What boundaries, would you put in place for yourself so that people won't get to the place of being in that position to continue to use you.

230
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.340
When it's raining.

231
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.070
Robert Hammond: I just didn't know or even even charging them things like that.

232
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.040
Robert Hammond: They charge you money. Pretty good.

233
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:36.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I saw. I'm sorry, saw a quote where said no is a complete sentence. Don't be afraid to use it.

234
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:44.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you may not have a reason as to, you know, why you don't want to do certain things.

235
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But to start off with no

236
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:58.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because in the time that we work together you know you you share that it's hard for you to communities are for you to use multiple words to express yourself.

237
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:14.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so maybe that's why the know can't come out because you're trying to build up the reason as to why it's, you know, and because you rather not go through the whole process of explaining why smell you. Just like I said, I'll just do it.

238
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That accurate.

239
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.430
Robert Hammond: right from wrong. No, no.

240
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No.

241
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He just started with just straight up. No.

242
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.550
Robert Hammond: I don't think I've used that before.

243
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.710
Robert Hammond: So,

244
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.610
Robert Hammond: I've always added like a reason afterwards.

245
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.140
Robert Hammond: So,

246
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:50.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We have limited communication because you don't want to come up with the reason or it's like, Man, I don't have time to explain. And I'll just do, I'll just do

247
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.130
Robert Hammond: A

248
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:58.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Prosecutor role probably rises up more so because of you're angry. You're with it.

249
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:09.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the rescue a row probably comes in when you're not triggered when you're not resentful when something you don't mind doing

250
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something you don't mind doing in the relationship.

251
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.770
Robert Hammond: Even even doing my share, like, you know, throwing trash or whatever.

252
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:24.720
Robert Hammond: Things like that.

253
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.200
Robert Hammond: You know when when they cook or whatever. I'll do the dishes and things like that.

254
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.410
Robert Hammond: Right.

255
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.280
What's, what's my thoughts.

256
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:47.700
Robert Hammond: They just

257
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.390
Robert Hammond: Don't know I did you just do to spoil degree.

258
00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:00.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: attract those world personality. If you continue to have that

259
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:14.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unless you find a woman that's so independent that she can you know function and do things on herself.

260
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:28.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But even that might be a struggle for you because you're accustomed to taking care of the ones that you love and the provider and being protected. So even if you got the independent person that she didn't have to do as much for

261
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That balance will be, you know, a little off because you may even struggle with. What's your goal. What's your purpose.

262
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.740
Robert Hammond: Right, it actually did. So we're on now with my dad. My dad.

263
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.400
Robert Hammond: You know, they own their own company and everything and

264
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.800
Robert Hammond: So he was like, I like I do my work and then try to help her with her. Yeah, and it was

265
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.980
Robert Hammond: just weird. I know made more money.

266
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that relationship.

267
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.420
For year

268
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How did it end

269
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.480
Robert Hammond: She was actually me to get to my kid.

270
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.700
Robert Hammond: My kid like

271
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.390
Robert Hammond: There wasn't even a real relationship.

272
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:30.510
Robert Hammond: Right. That was my ex his daughters and that I was dating.

273
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:33.660
Robert Hammond: So,

274
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.020
Robert Hammond: I didn't even know like that whole time.

275
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what would you want in relationship.

276
00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.720
Robert Hammond: To be honest with

277
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your current girlfriend is honest with you.

278
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.590
Robert Hammond: No, not at all.

279
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm seeing what Aspen fidelity.

280
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.420
Robert Hammond: Even

281
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.610
Robert Hammond: When we're doing the it back on you.

282
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know detrimental. But what

283
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.930
What keeps you keeps you

284
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.050
Robert Hammond: Know, nothing else to do, I guess, basically.

285
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.060
Robert Hammond: Is like a time consumer

286
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:44.760
Robert Hammond: Is basically just

287
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:45.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A routine.

288
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:46.830
Right.

289
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.540
Robert Hammond: Because I lost my kid is like

290
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.780
Robert Hammond: I just wanted like the worst things for me.

291
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't want it to get attracting

292
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.110
Robert Hammond: Right.

293
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe you're confusing what you're chopping is what you actually want

294
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:30.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I could imagine someone that tracks relationships that are depleting that's not necessarily nurturing if there's a continuous pattern of attracting those people then over time you will believe that you're deserving of those relationships.

295
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or this is just normal. This is what relationships are going to be

296
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.360
Robert Hammond: Right. I didn't want to really stupid. The first place

297
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.370
Robert Hammond: I was against whole thing.

298
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.700
Robert Hammond: So I told that from the very beginning.

299
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.160
So,

300
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She, she didn't she didn't want

301
00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.360
Robert Hammond: My product, even after a while I were spending so much time together already don't

302
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.220
Robert Hammond: Give them what they want for a while.

303
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.090
Robert Hammond: No know when and what

304
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.220
Robert Hammond: We just did. It did really didn't bother me. It was just like

305
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:31.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that loss of not having custody of your son, you know, last dreams and goals hope.

306
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:46.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As a mom. I can't imagine what that feels like. Like, I don't even want to try. Yeah, so the extent of your her in your pain and it's very real.

307
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:56.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not something that you just wake up and you wish it away and that hurt and that wants disappears, but

308
00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the other aspects that function in your life.

309
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:13.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't neglect. Those ones and those who died because right now that I'm Mary, what has been my son, my son that you've neglected all the other ones in your life.

310
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.280
When

311
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:24.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We were thinking about, I try to look at things like in profit and loss because people typically understand

312
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:33.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's like if there was an opportunity to focus on, you know, a different investment.

313
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:45.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would you not focus on that investment and and stay focus on something else that wasn't really gaining any interest.

314
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Weren't really earning any money.

315
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:56.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You still focus on that one investment or would you try to see what what other investments are out there.

316
00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:57.930
Robert Hammond: Right.

317
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:10.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And in that it's not abandoning son in law and hope, but it's still adding a purpose. It's still adding value to you.

318
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:29.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's the reason why I made that exam of origin, find that value of other things because we get so caught up in roles and very important roles. But sometimes we lose our identity in that role.

319
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And based on what we shared a lot of pride in that identity.

320
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:41.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when that will was taken away, you forgot all the other identities.

321
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All the other important role that you play

322
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of them spouses, one of them. You deserve to be in a healthy relationship.

323
00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:06.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You deserve that when you get custody of your child again that he can be able to see my dad and your relationship is thriving and it's healthy.

324
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.730
Robert Hammond: And again,

325
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.110
You can add about

326
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:30.810
Robert Hammond: Whole situation with it.

327
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.470
Robert Hammond: I still can.

328
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.850
Robert Hammond: Make if I could get my head in court. I could I could have written, I know I could apply it.

329
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.610
Robert Hammond: What I just did all that energy that can get me.

330
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.730
Robert Hammond: Know, I mean, I knew. They're breaking the law and knew how they're doing it and I was on the call amount of hours.

331

333
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Push the point of the boundaries.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.890
Robert Hammond: After 20 years of anger management Phil friggin that that one thing I couldn't

335
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:29.640
Robert Hammond: Never freakin

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.570
Robert Hammond: Help

337
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anger is hard to manage knows no boundaries. No protections in place.

338
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:56.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is the default emotion you is anger, then there has to be so many barriers, put in place, you can get into that.

339
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In you work on building those barriers.

344
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:49.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of being treated in a different way that you're worthy of having a different experience. Oh, then just going through the routine, no matter how crappy the routine is it's a routine.

345
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.370
