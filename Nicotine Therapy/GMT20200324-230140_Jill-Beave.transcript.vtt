00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.570
Molson Ace. 5777: Military

41
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:31.230
Molson Ace. 5777: Family and we fought for the North before all the wars and I try to distance myself from just the Austin side of my family, just because they're all

42
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.260
Molson Ace. 5777: Psycho military militant and I just saw, really. I mean, that's not who I am. You

Molson Ace. 5777: Know,

44
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.020

Molson Ace. 5777: Damage done you know i mean the images cars over generations. Yeah.

46
00:06:51.990 --> 00:07:01.800
Molson Ace. 5777: I don't know. And I turned it. I mean, I'm probably the black sheep, my family. I'm the only one in my whole other side of my family that was born in Ohio.

47
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.030
Wow.

48
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:16.260
Molson Ace. 5777: Yeah, so I'm the only one that's like they call me a hillbilly and they call me away trash. I'm really not. I'm really classy and smart like that. It's like, I can't even seem to be myself no longer because

49
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:34.740
Molson Ace. 5777: There's so much pressure there. People put so much pressure on me. And I don't know, I just want to give it to keep keep going and not fall back into the throes of the heroin and, you know, my body is beat up to busted up and 42. No, no, I've had a pretty rough go a

50
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:44.880
Molson Ace. 5777: little blip on the radar that we're here on Earth. I tried to this program and peaceful and just mindful of what's going on around me.

51
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.750
Molson Ace. 5777: But sometimes device in the ass and I mean

52
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.250
Molson Ace. 5777: Because I was reading

53
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.820
Molson Ace. 5777: But I don't know.

54
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.590
Molson Ace. 5777: But

55
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:09.330
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's okay. Um, so I'm heroin was the was your drug of choice for

56
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.690
Molson Ace. 5777: Yeah, yeah, it was

57
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.180
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Now, have you tried Suboxone or this is new for you.

58
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.080
Molson Ace. 5777: Or yeah, I've been on. No, no, I've done some action.

59
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.880
Molson Ace. 5777: My father passed away. I was trying to commit suicide. The overdose.

60
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.590
Molson Ace. 5777: And

61
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: When was that

62
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.870
Molson Ace. 5777: I'm trying to get out.

63
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.700
Molson Ace. 5777: Oh,

64
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.430
Molson Ace. 5777: Yeah.

65
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:52.920
But

66
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.250
Molson Ace. 5777: I don't know.

67
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.640
Molson Ace. 5777: I was like his ace in the hole. You know what I mean, like,

68
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.260
Molson Ace. 5777: He wanted and praying ito have to go through

69
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.540
Molson Ace. 5777: He had to go through just to live a peaceful life on this earth, you know, I mean,

70
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.900
Molson Ace. 5777: Unfortunately, I made some bad decisions. And here we are.

71
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:30.240
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So when is the last time you tried any opioids, or had any opioids or anything since has anything recent I

72
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.570
Molson Ace. 5777: Know, I've been off HEROIN FOR 10 years no

73
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.390
Molson Ace. 5777: Boxes because some boxes on my paintings. I booked my back when I was ready on

74
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.780
Molson Ace. 5777: A small scale a little bit, but I used to replace bicycles and skateboard a lot and stuff.

75
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.800
Molson Ace. 5777: And I hurt my back really bad so off the roof.

76
00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:05.790
Molson Ace. 5777: I was doing a lot of her I was doing a lot of her cassettes and whatnot. And my back was my I slipped a couple desk in my lower back and I really don't want to write my mind I was my first prison number

77
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.870
Molson Ace. 5777: She was Native American. She was Cherokee Indian

78
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:27.120
Molson Ace. 5777: As soon as she went under the knife like she went to Alaska to get away from my father as soon as she went under the knife. The first time cancer just spread and then she came back down to the lower 48 so I'm kind of like leery about going to like hospitals and whatnot.

79
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.080
Molson Ace. 5777: That's the reason why I didn't like because I'm like anti modern medicine and

80
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.650
Molson Ace. 5777: Nothing like that. I'm all for modern medicine. That was it for you know any motivation I someone like me wouldn't be alive.

81
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.610
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And that's perfectly understandable.

82
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:45.630
Molson Ace. 5777: But

83
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.060
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What is your

84
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.620
Molson Ace. 5777: Heroin

85
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What's your current Suboxone dose.

86
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.050
Molson Ace. 5777: It was at 12

87
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:56.370
Oh,

88
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.170
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Were you doing like films or pills.

89
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So one film three times a day, or did you take all three at once, or how did you space them out.

90
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.750
Molson Ace. 5777: I was in Connecticut with my my

91
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:21.870
Molson Ace. 5777: A strange wife. That's another can of worms. I was getting 112 I was getting 112 milligrams in the morning.

92
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.410
Molson Ace. 5777: Morning.

93
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:36.900
Molson Ace. 5777: That I came back to Ohio because she wouldn't find a divorce papers or something like that. So I went off. I didn't go off of them. I was just copy them on the street, whatnot. Yeah.

94
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.130
Molson Ace. 5777: Like, like, I'd probably be comfortable with.

95
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:52.440
Molson Ace. 5777: I don't know 338 milligrams a day. I don't know if they but in Ohio. They only let you do it. There's a certain amount, like all the different from state to state.

96
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.210
I do

97
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:11.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: We can what so we since we're on that topic. I'm just a couple of things about way I like to work with patients. And what I found works best for patients and most i think i all my patients agree with this.

98
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:22.710
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But as far as the dose. A and how long you're going to be on it. And when you try to taper and everything that's going to be something that you and I have worked out together.

99
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:33.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I don't have any laws or rules in Ohio that say you can only be on Suboxone for this long. And you can only take this this amount for this long so

100
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.550
Molson Ace. 5777: So we

101
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.690
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Can definitely do the three today you

102
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:41.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Are

103
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:49.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And when the time comes that you want to talk about tapering and I'll bring it up. Sometimes you can bring it up sometimes, but I don't have like

104
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.700
Molson Ace. 5777: I have. And I've tried. And I've tried to quit doing some

105
00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:02.520
Molson Ace. 5777: Like there's some, there's some days like I can't get out of bed. I'm in so much fucking plane because my back and stuff, you know. Oh.

106
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.480
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I get it.

107
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.430
Molson Ace. 5777: A little bit, but maybe I'll take them to the

108
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.500
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Day I die, maybe

109
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.240
Molson Ace. 5777: You want to work on that together.

110
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.770
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know I

111
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.560
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Let you know that I'm not going to say in six months have to do this. I don't do that, um,

112
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.660
Molson Ace. 5777: But you and I can definitely work together to

113
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.950
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Talk about your pain.

114
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Up.

115
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.490
You know how to manage your pain.

116
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then we do. Did they tell you about the group counseling that we do here. I'm with heart health.

117
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.060
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, so

118
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:40.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, yeah, so the body part help health groups are awesome. I have

119
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:49.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Been with heart health, and with another company, though, for a long time. And so this is my first time doing group therapy with people always used to

120
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:58.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know me not being in the group for the patients, but so I'll, I'll be in a group with you. So that's going to be the fun thing about it is, you're going to

121
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:07.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Be there with other people who are various stages of this and you know you've got 10 years of experience. So you can definitely help some of the newer

122
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.070
Jill Beavers-Kirby: People that are going to be in

123
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:15.690
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And talk about your experiences and how you. So yeah, you're going to be the you're going to be the one that people look

124
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.200
Molson Ace. 5777: Up to

125
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I'm

126
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.400
Molson Ace. 5777: About that but

127
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Now you've mentioned a couple different states, just as we've been talking. How long have you been in Ohio.

128
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.340
Molson Ace. 5777: I'm in Ohio most

129
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.280
Molson Ace. 5777: Cuz I have a daughter. Here I have right here.

130
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.700
Molson Ace. 5777: So I can't, like, I'm not just gonna opt in. We even though, like me, my mother, my child summer.

131
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.210
Molson Ace. 5777: We don't get along. But when it comes to her.

132
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.660
Molson Ace. 5777: Thing, guys. She's

133
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:57.360
Molson Ace. 5777: Been exposed, anything to add. Yeah, hold on the changing room. Try to go back to this. Why, if I don't know my dad I

134
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.710
Molson Ace. 5777: Know, and she she she inherited a lot of my gifts.

135
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:15.750
Molson Ace. 5777: You know, being she's got a 4.0 she's never dropped below 4.0 she draws she paints, like I do, she's really really musical like I am, and

136
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:26.970
Molson Ace. 5777: So yeah, I have with that being said, I have roots here in Ohio. So I'm probably going to be in Ohio, the rest of my life because I just a matter of the lead my kid that's not after what

137
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.930
Molson Ace. 5777: I've been trying to be responsible but

138
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:38.760
Molson Ace. 5777: It seems like I take two steps forward and back. Right. You know, but I guess that's neither here nor there.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:22.500
Molson Ace. 5777: And I have my brother and when my father passed away a signed off by everything to my brother, my uncle is probably there's just fine off and everything, because the girl I was married, I'm still married to, but

194
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.630
Molson Ace. 5777: And he he took over all the properties family.

195
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.840

198
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.350
Molson Ace. 5777: Yeah, so he can take all the stress and take all the taxes.

199
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:54.210
Molson Ace. 5777: There you go. That's what he wanted. He got it. I don't blame him or whatever he can take the stress, you know, I mean,

200
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.260
But

201
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.530
Molson Ace. 5777: I can't do it. My mind is

202

Molson Ace. 5777: I don't know. I don't think I'm ready for it.

204
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:17.130
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And that's okay. You don't have to. You don't have to take over any of that. I think that's smart.
