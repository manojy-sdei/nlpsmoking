Helena Rouhe: Hello.

2
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.200
casondra b: Hello.

3
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.820
Helena Rouhe: Today,

4
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.300
Yeah.

5
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.460
casondra b: Who's in a new spot.

6
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.930
Helena Rouhe: You are

7
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.630
casondra b: Not my windows just open

8
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.680
Oh,

9
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.650
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

10
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.240
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

11
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.550
Helena Rouhe: I guess I didn't realize that was the window right there.

12
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.500
casondra b: Yeah, yeah. And the tin foil on I can explain the 10 for

13
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.170
Helena Rouhe: Me, you know, it's all good.

14
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.580
casondra b: It's, um,

15
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.510
casondra b: When I first

16
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.300
casondra b: When I first got, say, well, she would wake up whenever the light

17
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:15.060
casondra b: came into the room and that would be like six or seven in the morning and in order to like sleeping at all. I had to foil up the windows and then I took the foil off the other one but I kind of like it like the one because this is right about my bed.

18
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.520
casondra b: I kind of like it. It's darker.

19
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.450
casondra b: And the mornings.

20
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.730
Helena Rouhe: They do have blackout curtains.

21
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.680
casondra b: This is a blackout window.

22
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.300
casondra b: This is a blend of

23
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.140
Helena Rouhe: The work.

24
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.270
casondra b: It's not know because even

25
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.290
Helena Rouhe: Like that enough

26
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:45.840
casondra b: Yeah, even with this in mind, I like have a like sometimes I'll take a beanie and I'll just like put it over. I sleep like a fucking crazy person because I have his ear earplugs. I always lose them and they don't seem dense enough. So I have like headphones, like the with the rotary

27
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.000
casondra b: Yeah, no not not anything

28
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.650
Helena Rouhe: That's a pretty rough thing.

29
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.670
casondra b: The rubbery thing that I can like shutter my ear holes and then I and so that I don't lose them. Also because they're attached to each other.

30
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:06.870
casondra b: And then I I bought a foam pillow heavy foam like the kind that you push into and it keeps your hand for it not to use as a pillow. But to us to put over my head.

31
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:15.240
casondra b: to drown out the noise that starts at seven in the morning because I live in a house made of paper and the people above me wake up at six.

32
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.550
casondra b: And then I'm right outside the kitchen and it and then so like that. Plus, like I have something over my eyes. It's like, It's unbearable. I'm the lightest sleeper.

33
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.190
Helena Rouhe: I've always been a very much sleep.

34
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.920
Helena Rouhe: It's like a need to be in one of those

35
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.590
Helena Rouhe: Sound chambers.

36
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.420
casondra b: Yeah, sensory deprivation chamber.

37
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.320
Helena Rouhe: Yes, thank you.

38
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.590
casondra b: Yeah, I would love that. That would be ideal.

39
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.260
Helena Rouhe: Have you ever tried one of those. I've never tried one of them.

40
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.550
casondra b: I have not know that seems like a rich white person and

41
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.130
casondra b: I am not rich

42
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.820
Helena Rouhe: Well yeah, I know you might

43
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.990
Helena Rouhe: Be maybe not in the pandemic. Do you go and swim in somebody else's water but at some point.

44
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.370
casondra b: They have

45
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.140
casondra b: To have water in the detail.

46
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.070
Yeah.

47
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.790
casondra b: I mean, like, I wouldn't want to be in it. If I was awake. Like, I only want to sleep in there. Like, I don't, I'm not trying to like

48
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.800
Helena Rouhe: Well, I think that's what people do. I mean, I think they

49
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.190
casondra b: Know like

50
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.860
Helena Rouhe: Correct me if

51
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.190
Helena Rouhe: I'm not interested in a reflection.

52
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.650
casondra b: I'd be claustrophobic.

53
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.030
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Yeah, that's probably why I haven't tried it out yet.

54
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.420
Helena Rouhe: It would have desired response for me.

55
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.920
Yeah.

56
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.710
casondra b: It just seems like a lot. Oh, no.

57
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.840
casondra b: Um,

58
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.290
casondra b: Yeah earlier. Was it this week. No, I guess it must have been last week I like woke up.

59
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.940
casondra b: A scratch on my arm, um,

60
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.390
casondra b: I woke up.

61
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.310
casondra b: And

62
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:11.790
casondra b: I felt. Okay. Initially this on Monday, and I felt okay and then it my stomach will not my stomach really like where my pancreas is. And I was like, concerned that it was pancreatitis again.

63
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.720
casondra b: And I was just like, this feels familiar and terrible and I kind of sat with that.

64
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.730
casondra b: Pain. I didn't really drink or eat anything because if it is pancreatitis. You're not supposed to eat or drink anything

65
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:35.520
casondra b: I was just like, oh my god, like if I have to go to the hospital right now it's going to be packed and also last time I went on. It was just such a fucking close my windows. People said,

66
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.820
casondra b: It was just such a fucking nightmare, because I don't have veins anymore. Like, they're gone. Right.

67
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.990
Helena Rouhe: Like yeah, terrible experience that the web is

68
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.740
Helena Rouhe: Not hope you have

69
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:58.320
casondra b: Multiple one, one after the other, multiple times a day. And yeah, final doctor was like no, but they had to use the initial IV, they had to put way up here. They had using ultrasound machine.

70
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:05.910
casondra b: Like to find the the vein. It was crazy. So like, that's another part where I'm just like, oh my god. Like, I don't want to have to go through that again.

71
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:17.010
casondra b: Um, but eventually I I drink some Gatorade and I felt better. And then I had some soup and I felt better. And then it went away, but it like freaked me out. I was

72
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.130
casondra b: Yeah. It scared me.

73
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:31.590
casondra b: Because I worry. I don't know for a fact because they weren't because they weren't able to draw the blood, they weren't even able to tell me definitively that what I had before was pancreatitis, but I feel like that's what it was. Yeah.

74
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.780
casondra b: And

75
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.310
casondra b: I don't think that I drink that much.

76
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:49.740
casondra b: Although I will say that sometimes I some weeks I drink every day. Not like i well i guess to the average person, it would be a lot, but to me, I'm not. I don't feel drunk. You know what I mean.

77
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.690
casondra b: And so

78
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.170
Helena Rouhe: But you're talking, I don't know, might be a little different than others maybe

79
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.370
casondra b: Probably. I think that's fair to say. And, um,

80
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.140
casondra b: And like when I think about it that way, like for the average person. I guess that is a lot of alcohol and maybe that could aggravate it

81
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:16.350
casondra b: But the fact that it went away. I was like, maybe it was just like something I ate. I don't know. It scared the hell out of me. I don't want to have to deal with that over and over again. Right.

82
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.720
Helena Rouhe: So,

83
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:36.330
Helena Rouhe: My understanding was that there was a plan, or maybe it was just how they discharge here that you were going to be able to follow up with somebody who you trusted who could take the blood to be able to get that tested after you read through all that now I

84
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.190
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

85
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:48.390
Helena Rouhe: Do you have anybody like aside from the huge pandemic thing, which is obviously something we need to consider and deal with but

86
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:59.160
Helena Rouhe: Do you have anybody who you could trust, who would actually be able to follow your instructions and guide and you could guide them as to how to draw blood to get a sense of where you're at, with your level.

87
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.920
casondra b: I mean shit I could do it myself. But like

88
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.640
Well,

89
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:13.290
casondra b: They're not gonna yeah and i don't i don't see what the point of that is also like if I'm not actively in it. I don't know if that will show anything like I don't know.

90
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:20.550
Helena Rouhe: Sorry, go ahead and medical care and you have medical provider. He's talked to about this in the past.

91
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:28.860
Helena Rouhe: Know, and kind of reliably. Okay, so that's kind of, and that's because you didn't have insurance and all of that good stuff to be able to talk

92
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:36.780
casondra b: It was because I didn't have insurance, and when I, when I had insurance. I was a drug addict and I didn't have a lot of money and I was drug addicts to their

93
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.070
Fat right

94
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:47.910
casondra b: And also, like, I think that even prior to that, like I always have been raised with this, like if you're if you're not dying. If it's not falling off. Then you're fine.

95
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:48.900
Helena Rouhe: Mm hmm.

96
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.370
casondra b: I don't know. It just seems like an extra expense.

97
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.610
casondra b: And I don't know. Yeah, this

98
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.130
Helena Rouhe: Could be a chronic condition you I mean

99
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:07.440
Helena Rouhe: It's possible, you know, given the fact that you've had this now likely to major flare ups and

100
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.810
Helena Rouhe: Potentially some minor things going on.

101
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:24.060
Helena Rouhe: Not that it's minor at all. But I would advocate for you to consider. Again, given what's going on, although I'm hoping that we're on the downswing and things are going to settle down and people are going to be able to kind of get back to a better space.

102
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:36.090
Helena Rouhe: In regards regard to moving around and being able to go for more normal kind of health care needs. Maybe it's time to to find somebody who you could work with and

103
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:46.680
Helena Rouhe: I would, you know, interview them a little bit by just finding out to you. They have kind of a prejudice against working with somebody who has struggled with addiction, because

104
00:11:47.190 --> 00:12:01.860
Helena Rouhe: You. I think you've expressed to me before concern about, hey, I do have the struggles getting labs and I don't want people to judge me. And how does the attitude about all this I yet you recognize labs are important for awareness about this so

105
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.600
casondra b: I do I don't

106
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:21.660
casondra b: Have a lab is even possible. Like, I really don't like it like not aside from like being judged on all that. It's like the actual physical act of getting it like I don't see like unless you want to try, try and take it from my leg or something. But like, that's just not

107
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:33.720
casondra b: It's there's, it seems like my experience at the hospital is so terrible because they're like, oh, we can only take it from your arm, we will not take it from here up. It's like, Girl What's like

108
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:48.000
Helena Rouhe: What's. Yeah, but that's going to be. I was like to believe in my awareness is that the hospital is one dynamic a private clinic is going to be a different kind of thing all together. I mean, ideally, you could find somebody who

109
00:12:48.330 --> 00:13:00.510
Helena Rouhe: Would have a lab associated with the same building that you could kind of work with them and they would be aware of the situation, this is News is not some new phenomenon that has just started to happen and private

110
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.200
Helena Rouhe: Labs and private kind of setup have a much different approach than a big public hospital.

111
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:16.590
Helena Rouhe: Which is why I would advocate for that and I recognize that there are some hurdles to overcome without so it's not like it has to be an immediate timeline, but

112
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:26.340
Helena Rouhe: When you have stressors like this situation, it would be nice if you could have somebody who you could talk to from a medical provider standpoint to just have a sense of

113
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:37.350
Helena Rouhe: Where things that and maybe there are some things that you could adjust in your diet and it may, it's very likely that alcohols, it's not doing any favors.

114
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.110
Helena Rouhe: I can, we can talk about that. But I mean,

115
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.460
casondra b: Other than like you have to give up alcohol completely which I'm not ready to do right now.

116
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:52.920
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so let's address that in a moment. I'm not suggesting you have to do that. But, so I just, I do know that there are some dietary

117
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.960
Helena Rouhe: Suggestions for people who struggle with aggravated or sensitive case.

118
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:16.890
Helena Rouhe: So it will probably be a good idea for you to start the process of seeing who would be a good fit for you to follow up with this on a more regular concern. So you're not having to go to the hospital and deal with that which is a very an ideal situation.

119
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:18.690
Helena Rouhe: To say

120
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.280
casondra b: I mean, it wasn't bad enough

121
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.610
casondra b: To like actually even if the hospital weren't in the state that they're at now.

122
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.130
casondra b: Right. It wasn't enough to go to the ER.

123
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.360
Helena Rouhe: Well, I'm glad to hear that.

124
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.890
casondra b: Yeah, it's expensive.

125
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.390
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, for sure.

126
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:41.250
Helena Rouhe: So without advocating for you to not drink alcohol. Could you give me an estimate of how much you drink when you're drinking. Do you have a sense for that.

127
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:48.630
casondra b: But I mean, if I'm drinking beer. Maybe I'll have like because recently I've been like more conscious of it.

128
00:14:49.320 --> 00:15:00.360
casondra b: And so like if I'm drinking beer. I'll have like three or four. Sometimes I try to keep it about three but if I'm drinking wine I can drink like a whole bottle of wine and within like like five or six hours.

129
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.070
Helena Rouhe: So definitely have a tolerance.

130
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.250
casondra b: And yeah, you know, I don't up

131
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.750
casondra b: Yeah, I don't know, like I said it within that time I don't ever really feel

132
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.040
Helena Rouhe: Like drunk right

133
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.800
casondra b: Because it's such a serious face that period of time, right.

134
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.130
casondra b: Well, like this happened on Monday, I didn't drink for like five days in a row.

135
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:27.090
Helena Rouhe: Okay. And did you notice any difference fruit in the sense of physically feeling any differently.

136
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.230
No.

137
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:42.870
Helena Rouhe: So again, you have a high tolerance. I don't even if you're not necessarily noticing the physical differences, I would advocate for you to not cut it off completely. But maybe just try and drink half of what you would

138
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:51.750
Helena Rouhe: Normally drink with the mindset that you're being a little bit more conscientious about overall what's going in your body for Wellness.

139
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:59.040
Helena Rouhe: Not because you can't drink because it's bad for you, kind of thing, because that mindset. So it's going to trigger people

140
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:08.460
casondra b: Yeah, and it's not even like the mindset of, oh, I can do because it's bad for me it's just like, I need somebody to take the fuckin edge off like that's really what it is.

141
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.770
Helena Rouhe: So,

142
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.280
Helena Rouhe: What else can you do to help you with that as opposed to being a substance that you take

143
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.890
casondra b: I don't know. That's what I've always struggled with.

144
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.250
Helena Rouhe: And this has been kind of the go to

145
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.170
Helena Rouhe: A long

146
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.640
casondra b: It's not one thing. It's another you know right before

147
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:39.990
Helena Rouhe: Right. So do you think you're getting to the point where you're starting to kind of consider different kinds of actions as opposed to a substance or behavior to distract you.

148
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:53.730
casondra b: I mean, I try. I tried, but like honestly like the depression is bad. You know I manage it and I kind of white knuckle through life, but the social anxiety is really bad.

149
00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:06.390
casondra b: And the depression is is pretty bad. And it's constant and and and so it's like those are things where I'm just like, God, I don't. I really do not want to take fucking

150
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.160
casondra b: Medication for for that shit I because I've taken every medication under the sun. I had such severe reactions.

151
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.060
Helena Rouhe: I've had

152
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:23.730
casondra b: Like just years of terrible experiences and and doctors. They didn't know what the fuck they were doing mixing medications that should not be mixed together.

153
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.380
casondra b: Mm hmm. And it's just I don't know. And then if I would take something. Sometimes I wouldn't even notice any difference. And it's just like

154
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:45.510
casondra b: I'm really reluctant and like the whole like Big Pharma thing like they are just really pushing like a single pill on all of the psychiatrists and every psychologist is forcing it on all of their patients. And it's just like

155
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:55.140
casondra b: God damn are you even really prescribing the sheet you think's going to work, or are you just getting a fucking paycheck from prescribing me this pill that that you're being highly encouraged to prescribe

156
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:02.520
casondra b: It's hard for me to like trust and also like a fucking psychiatry is what you sit without you sit with them for an hour. If you're lucky.

157
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:09.900
casondra b: And you tell them I don't know as much as you can get out in an hour. And they're like, oh, yes, you have this thing. It's like, how could you possibly know

158
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:20.820
casondra b: How could you possibly know from sitting with me for five hours for 10 hours, let alone one hour. Like it's, I don't know that the whole thing just weird and shady

159
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:31.410
Helena Rouhe: Did you ever talk about or do mood disorder meds with Dr. Waters, I don't think so.

160
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.500
casondra b: No, because I told her I wasn't really open to it.

161
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.190
Yeah.

162
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:50.550
Helena Rouhe: Well, we have an old school nurse practitioner who is doing mental health stuff she has been of quirky death, but I think she's kind of old school and then that makes her kind of

163
00:18:51.330 --> 00:19:02.910
Helena Rouhe: A little bit more loose and open as opposed to these the underdogs, who are a bit you know stuck in the mindset of take this and you'll be fine. Kind of thing so

164
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:03.810
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

165
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.730
casondra b: That's not work there.

166
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.800
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so

167
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:24.540
Helena Rouhe: Men that's potentially an option for you to maybe have a consult with her and see if you feel like she's worth any trouble and talking to you when switch practitioners, she would just be somebody who you can talk to in regard to move stuff.

168
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:27.900
Helena Rouhe: Or maybe

169
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.810
casondra b: Yeah a lot like closed off the to the idea, but I just, I don't want to be peddled like

170
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.260
casondra b: right fucking Prozac or fucking select so like I don't want to be fucking, like, you know,

171
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:52.230
casondra b: Like there's just been like, and I took. I took these drugs for so many years as a teenager and starting it like at eight years old and I feel like it really fucked with me and

172
00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:02.370
casondra b: And I noticed, like there were like waves like there was like one drug that was very popular, no matter where I went. And then there was another drug. It was very popular, no matter where I went. And it wasn't like

173
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.590
casondra b: I don't like yeah

174
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.380
Helena Rouhe: Well, she doesn't make him feel prescriptive so much as a duo like here's the cool thing to do right now.

175
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.210
casondra b: Yes, yes.

176
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:25.590
Helena Rouhe: Would you be okay with me, having that that practitioner and just review your chart kind of see what you've been through and see if she has different ideas or suggestions before you guys even need to see if I think it might be a good fit.

177
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:34.440
Helena Rouhe: You said, I'm saying, like, however, just look and see if she starts preaching birth, just kind of just speaks to medicine supposed to like, oh, I'd like to

178
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:41.340
Helena Rouhe: Think I have a bit of a sense of kind of where you're coming from. Maybe I can better out a little bit, things that might be a good option for you.

179
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.410
casondra b: I mean, yeah, that's fine.

180
00:20:46.410 --> 00:21:02.970
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and I understand where you're coming from. With that, because it's definitely a phenomena that occurs out there. And especially when you starting meds that young, you can have some pretty strong adverse reactions hormones play into it, all sorts of things play into it and can definitely

181
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:14.250
Helena Rouhe: Just emotionally really screw with you in the idea of who wants to take meds and then you know when you're struggling with substances. It's kind of like, why am I going to take a substance to feel better when I just take this

182
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.320
casondra b: Yeah.

183
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:29.220
Helena Rouhe: Well, they only good answer. I have about that. And I don't know if it's a good answer is that some sentences are more about working with your chemistry, then

184
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:36.000
Helena Rouhe: And helping you be functional and others will be against your chemistry. Ultimately, and create more dysfunction, your life so

185
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:49.230
Helena Rouhe: It is that there's also other stuff too. But I think what you're describing, I mean you have a lot of skill sets, I think what you're describing is is legitimate chemical imbalances that create a lot of homework in your life.

186
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.300
casondra b: Yeah.

187
00:21:52.410 --> 00:22:03.330
casondra b: That it's, I don't know, like part of me feels like I should just be able to handle it because I made it this far. It's like just deal with it. Just like suck it up and deal with it, but it's just like, I don't even know.

188
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.640
Helena Rouhe: How many ways you have dealt with it. You aren't dealing with it.

189
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:19.080
casondra b: Right, yeah. That's like the other part is just like, you know, just do it. Just fucking do it but it like, feel like, I don't know. It always feels like there's like a fucking void.

190
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:28.710
Helena Rouhe: So you are making a lot of progress in using your skills and you've come a long way in the time that you and I have known each other.

191
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:43.860
Helena Rouhe: But maybe now is the time to kind of circle back around on your physicality in terms of hopefully addressing your pancreas stuff and or maybe the mood stuff and see if there's a way to kind of find a better

192
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.780
Helena Rouhe: Way to manage it, or a different way to manage it.

193
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.070
casondra b: Yeah.

194
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.640
Helena Rouhe: It's gonna be productive for you, not just something to check off the list.

195
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.080
Yeah.

196
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.460
casondra b: It is. And I've always just been like, oh, like in life like things have been so shooting for so long. It's like, oh,

197
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:21.930
casondra b: Yeah, look, this changes. I'll be happy and then it's like, well, if that changes if I can get this under control. And then if this if I can manage this then I can then like finally it'll just hit me like a fucking truck and I'll be like, Oh, I can live with myself, but

198
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.810
casondra b: It's not quite like that.

199
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:25.950
No.

200
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.500
Helena Rouhe: But that makes sense, right, I mean, in this you know where you have been through.

201
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:40.650
Helena Rouhe: An episode amount of ridiculousness. And so in order to put one foot in front of the other. It is about just getting literally through the next thing.

202
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:56.220
Helena Rouhe: And then the next thing and that's what has kept you alive. Up to this point and I think you're starting to shift out of more of a survival crisis mode into figuring out what the heck it means to actually live a life and have moments of

203
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:05.100
Helena Rouhe: Maybe Joy's too strong, or words that positivity or neutrality and it's not such a terrible slog every minute of every day.

204
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:17.670
Helena Rouhe: And that is a huge adjustment to make and the idea of things being positive and joyful is just absurd but maybe it does. Maybe it could just be neutral and not terrible, which would be fantastic.

205
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:26.610
casondra b: I mean yeah I don't ever expect to be like happy in my life. But I definitely would like to be content right

206
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.060
Helena Rouhe: Which is much more appropriate way to live your life, people who are not really happy really are just that.

207
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.810
casondra b: Yeah, I don't know if that's like a genuine thing that people feel my

208
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:51.630
Helena Rouhe: So how are you doing in terms of food. Now that things have settled down. Are you are you still kind of struggling with all that or is that

209
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.220
casondra b: I mean, not as much. I tried to like

210
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:06.780
casondra b: You are trying to just like do something active during the day and then I don't feel as guilty. And also, like, I don't know.

211
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:18.360
casondra b: The my housemates been away for like several days at a time, she is getting on my nerves and like multiple ways but like when she's around I feel very triggered. Mm hmm.

212
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.500
Helena Rouhe: Same one right

213
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.750
casondra b: Yeah, with regard to food is my

214
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.770
Helena Rouhe: Favorite know

215
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:34.230
casondra b: And because like I know she's not like so blatantly doing it like she was, but I have. I know enough about it to know that she's not stopped. Yeah.

216
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.890
casondra b: Yeah, then like everything out of her mouth is fucking self deprecating and it's fucking

217
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.450
casondra b: A drag to like listen to

218
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.790
casondra b: And

219
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:51.900
casondra b: I don't know. I have, I have a suspicion that she's also like using drugs like hard drugs like I have a suspicion. I can't prove it.

220
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:59.070
casondra b: But I do have a suspicion and like that's been like making me irritated as fuck to

221
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.040
casondra b: I just like want to like catch something in the trash or like

222
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.620
casondra b: Whatever just that I could be like, Yeah, get the fuck out. I mean,

223
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.960
Helena Rouhe: Is that kind of a house rule for you guys.

224
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.740
casondra b: Well, she it's myself and gather who have

225
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:26.220
casondra b: Myself and govern who have who are on like a year lease and she's a month to month and the way that it's stipulated is that we don't really need a reason

226
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.460
casondra b: We can just ask her to leave. But I don't want to

227
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.710
casondra b: Especially right now. Like, I don't want to just like kick her out, even though I would love to.

228
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.160
casondra b: I'd love to be like beat it, but

229
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.340
casondra b: I don't know. I don't want to do it without like a good reason.

230
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.120
Right.

231
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.200
Helena Rouhe: Have you expressed any of these concerns they have ever

232
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:50.730
casondra b: I have

233
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.300
Helena Rouhe: And does he have any sense of this as well, or

234
00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:00.450
casondra b: Um, when it was like the very obvious like throwing up and I told him how much it bothered rain.

235
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:08.310
casondra b: Right. He was like, yeah, she keeps doing it. She's got to leave. And so then she like wasn't doing it as she's like as obviously so that stopped.

236
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:16.650
casondra b: And then I said, I told him I had a suspicion, who was like yeah I don't. I mean, I don't really care about that as long as she continues to pay your bills and I was like okay well

237
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:28.440
casondra b: But I feel like if I could just like prove that it's more than just, just like like right now, I'm just like I said just a suspicion.

238
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.230
casondra b: Based on like behaviors and noises

239
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.160
Right.

240
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.010
casondra b: So,

241
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.410
Helena Rouhe: I give a pretty good gut for these kinds of things.

242
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:41.790
Yeah.

243
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:52.620
casondra b: And it's just like, I don't know, like that makes it hard to be like civil like I'm having a hard time being civil with her.

244
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.920
Helena Rouhe: So how thick. No, go ahead.

245
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:12.360
casondra b: No, I was just gonna say like it just makes me like irritated. Like when she's around and she's here when I know she's here I'm just like, irritated. I just wish that I had my own like my own place.

246
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.900
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, you're not comfortable in your space. Now, this person.

247
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.920
casondra b: Yeah. Yes.

248
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.200
Helena Rouhe: On all the thing. Yeah. Yes.

249
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:29.160
casondra b: You guys are gonna say I regret like because I was the one who was like yeah let's choose her, you know, she, it won't be boring. I remember saying

250
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:35.760
casondra b: And that's what I also said, I was like, yeah, she could be one of the normal or she could be a fucking psycho but it won't be boring.

251
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:46.110
Helena Rouhe: And here we are. I mean, it's so hard to be able to choose people out of the blue. When you really don't have much to go on. It really is the gamble.

252
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.770
casondra b: I mean, I had a gut feeling. I was like, she's going to be crazy.

253
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.400
Helena Rouhe: Think I listened to your gut more how

254
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.350
casondra b: You're obviously

255
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.350
Helena Rouhe: Well, we're just learning these things.

256
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:04.680
Helena Rouhe: Been hard to figure out who to trust. I think that you include you can include yourself in that

257
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.050
casondra b: Yeah.

258
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:32.040
casondra b: Yeah, I just don't like living with women. I think like I've never like obviously I've had bad learning experiences with guys very bad but like consistently like I've had guy roommates that are just find neutral don't care. Almost every girl that I've lived with at least in Oakland.

259
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.910
casondra b: I'm just thinking, is it every girl.

260
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:44.430
casondra b: Yeah yeah probably every girl because I can't think of one that I was neutral with like they all got on my nerves.

261
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:54.180
casondra b: They all just like we're so dramatic and like maybe I'm being dramatic to like probably, I don't know, but like I just fucking cannot be bothered.

262
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:59.550
casondra b: I don't know. I have I have trouble being neutral living with women.

263
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:06.000
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Well, not to sound like a therapist, but that may or may not have something to do with the women, you were raised by

264
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:17.970
casondra b: I mean, maybe, I don't know, it also just seems like these are some fucking dramatic basic fucking stupid bitches like that's like how it comes off, it's like, wow, you guys are like dramatic and fucking weird. And, like you,

265
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:30.720
casondra b: Go into my person you take my money and then you fucking like are hostile like openly hostile. It's just like, Okay, great. Glad we live in this really cool environment like it was it's

266
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.160
casondra b: It's like always been just like openly hostile

267
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:44.190
casondra b: It like a gig. Honestly, you know, it reminds me off and like maybe this is the real reason reminds me of being a fucking little kid and wanting like

268
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:54.360
casondra b: And not like wanting friends but like being so weird that I can't get, like, I can't get along with people and then it ends up like with them bullying me and then

269
00:30:54.390 --> 00:31:00.240
casondra b: In order to stand up for myself, I get aggressive back like that's how it feels, it feels very much like that.

270
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:10.590
casondra b: Like okay, I can't relate to you. I'm having a very hard time relating to you. And then I start to get like maybe I started or maybe they started but it ends up with both of us just like fucking hating each other.

271
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:24.840
casondra b: And then there's like obviously like some girls who do crazy shit like steal my fucking debit card out of my purse and use it to buy their acting classes online on a repeat payment.

272
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:35.250
casondra b: You know, so it's just like, it's just like shit like that. I'm just like, wow, like the spot like I've had multiple like mostly bad

273
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.560
casondra b: Living experiences, mostly bad

274
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:50.370
Helena Rouhe: So, given the fact that you've had mostly bad living experiences and you're not comfortable in the current situation and you would feel better if you had a really solid reason

275
00:31:50.460 --> 00:32:01.080
Helena Rouhe: Do you think that you could start talking together about advocating for yourself, even if it's not a huge reason and start considering the idea of this person not being a part of this House.

276
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:09.600
casondra b: I mean I have considered that I feel I would feel like a witch to do it during the fucking pandemic.

277
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.900
Helena Rouhe: Maybe it can be like a move out date as opposed to have more

278
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:31.620
casondra b: Thinking about it and here's here's like my not a plan because plans never worked out. But like when sep tember comes, you know, I don't know, but I have a feeling that she's going to be offered the option of having a

279
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:38.190
casondra b: Year year long lease and I, I will just say, No, I don't feel comfortable with that.

280
00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:51.300
Helena Rouhe: But before September. I mean, you know, you've talked about saving money and getting to the point where you can get into your own space I'm having a sense that you're not quite ready to go there yet. So

281
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:56.340
casondra b: No, because I have no fucking money because like I just spent all my savings on a car. I've only been

282
00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.290
casondra b: Drug for, what, eight months.

283
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:10.920
casondra b: Right, like I am able to save money very fast now but it's like I said I saved up like 10 grand and then spent all of it on a car. So now I'm back to, like, you know, I guess to ground. No, but

284
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.760
casondra b: That's not what you fucking need to have a house.

285
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:15.660
Yeah.

286
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:27.420
Helena Rouhe: My point is, is that if you're really thinking that this person potentially is going to be around for the long term. That's not a good fit for you and you're not in place to get your own space yet.

287
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:39.390
Helena Rouhe: So maybe instead of waiting you advocate sooner rather than later. And I'm not saying that this person is moved up tomorrow, but you're really not comfortable and I don't see that changing so

288
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.140
Helena Rouhe: Advocating for a different option might be

289
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.220
Helena Rouhe: Something to consider.

290
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.690
casondra b: Yeah, I guess I'm trying to

291
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.390
casondra b: I'm trying to avoid like

292
00:33:53.340 --> 00:34:11.580
casondra b: I guess the confrontation that would happen. And I feel like when September comes, it's already going to have, it's going to have to come up instead of me just bringing it up right it's it's brought up so I have to give my opinion, instead of like me, bringing it up, if that makes any sense.

293
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:23.370
Helena Rouhe: It makes sense. But what I'm concerned about is that we're, we're, I am hoping that we are shifting you to a place of being more of an advocate for yourself.

294
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.950
Helena Rouhe: And you have been in such a

295
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:36.270
Helena Rouhe: survival mode of just trying to live and get through the next day or the next minute or the next hour and see that time is

296
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:44.910
Helena Rouhe: Starting to really kind of create a little bit of a distance and now you're in more of a neutral space. And I know it's going to be a bigger step for you, but

297
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:52.710
Helena Rouhe: Doing things like seeking out medical attention before it's an emergency and getting kind of regular workup.

298
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:58.110
Helena Rouhe: Seeking out a better living situation, meaning that this person is not a good fit for you.

299
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:11.160
Helena Rouhe: And advocating that you either want to just be the two of you or find another roommate or start putting that into play now not saying it has to be this big dramatic terrible conversation.

300
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:21.450
Helena Rouhe: But just like you're really not comfortable and she's not redirecting and not likely to develop the awareness and or accountability to redirect.

301
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.430
casondra b: I mean, that's, yeah, that's true.

302
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:34.770
Helena Rouhe: So it's not likely that this person is going to change. So therefore, they're not going to be working on their stuff and be a better fit for you and that's okay. I mean,

303
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:45.450
Helena Rouhe: It's hard to find roommates that you get along with. And just get along with little own that you actually like. So the fact that you and gather are good friends is fantastic. So

304
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:57.510
Helena Rouhe: I would like to honor that a little bit, you know, and not that she's a third wheel, but she's in a space that you have to share more dramatically. Now, because everyone's kind of

305
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.350
Helena Rouhe: under house arrest on some level.

306
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.190
Helena Rouhe: And so it's

307
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:03.360
Helena Rouhe: More free

308
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.870
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, or extreme right now. Yes.

309
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:14.040
Helena Rouhe: But even if you're not under house arrest is still uncomfortable. And now that it's become this level of awareness. I don't see

310
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:24.000
Helena Rouhe: You know, this is a good trade and it's a torturous one to once you have a level of awareness you you can't go back from that. It's not like once things settle down.

311
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:31.860
Helena Rouhe: You're going to all of a sudden feel better. You're, you're still going to be as uncomfortable, but now you just won't have to have it in your face quite as much but

312
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.020
Helena Rouhe: Now you're going to probably dread going home or dreading having to go outside or dread having to go

313
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:46.950
Helena Rouhe: To the kitchen because what is she's there. I mean, that's just not a if you don't have to live that way. Why would you and I don't think you have to live this way.

314
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:56.160
Helena Rouhe: Doesn't mean that you have to move out just means that conversations need to be had and discussions and and maybe just with you and give her to begin with.

315
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.750
Y'all

316
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.200
casondra b: Are like, I totally hear what you're saying. I just like

317
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.040
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

318
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.050
casondra b: I'm not expecting anything

319
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:14.430
casondra b: Advocating. Yeah, I know you're it's just I feel I because there's the other part of me that is like

320
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.520
casondra b: empathetic to a fault and I just feel like bad for her. Sure.

321
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.390
Helena Rouhe: You can get kind of where she's coming from you. Been there, done that on some level, yeah.

322
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.800
casondra b: Right. Yes.

323
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:33.090
Helena Rouhe: And you would like for someone to been a little bit kinder and more empathetic towards you, when you were in those harder spots.

324
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.370
casondra b: Yes.

325
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.340
Helena Rouhe: But that doesn't mean that you have to live. Kind of a quasi tortured existence. Just because you're trying to be nice to somebody

326
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.200
casondra b: Also thing. I'm like, not, not really trying to be nice to her.

327
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.600
Helena Rouhe: While you are on some level, because I'm

328
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.460
casondra b: Getting on the on the most based on most basic human level. Yes.

329
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.210
Okay.

330
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:15.660
Helena Rouhe: And what you're shifting and it's not doesn't need to happen today. But what we're looking at is really transitioning from you living at a base level to living a more engaged.

331
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.970
Helena Rouhe: So filling level.

332
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:26.970
Helena Rouhe: Which means that these kinds of things take an extra level of energy and engagement and struggle.

333
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:34.560
Helena Rouhe: Which is, in my opinion, kind of exhausting. A yeah well worth it because you live a better life.

334
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.120
casondra b: Yeah.

335
00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:41.460
Helena Rouhe: But I get that it's it's a heartache. I mean, it's not it doesn't come easy

336
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.160
Helena Rouhe: How, how's the lawn gardening project coming

337
00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:58.650
casondra b: Oh my god, so it's fine. And one of my upstairs neighbors is helping me, which is very nice.

338
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.150
Helena Rouhe: He's a big guy with a rock.

339
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.910
casondra b: Know the other different

340
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.850
Helena Rouhe: You aren't having an ongoing discussion with rock and lon

341
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.710
Helena Rouhe: And we finally stopped the drama.

342
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.830
casondra b: Let me tell you about about rocks. So he

343
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:20.100
casondra b: He we all get mailed to the same place. Okay. Oh, God. Let me back up because you don't know any of this is so fucking funny. Okay, so

344
00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:29.280
casondra b: This guy's like, he's just like a fucking weirdo. Like, I don't know how else to describe it. Like, I don't know if I've told you he like he's like part of a cool church and he invited

345
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.880
casondra b: Like everybody to like an event, but didn't tell us, like what the

346
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.670
casondra b: This was several months ago didn't tell us what the was

347
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:53.610
casondra b: And it was it looked just awkward and strange and like very standoffish. And like seems upset, at least to me, he seems upset. Most of the time, and his upstairs. The people that live upstairs with him, do not like him, and there I won't go into why I know that I just know for a fact like

348
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.190
casondra b: I just know and and so we all get mailed to the same place, and

349
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.920
casondra b: This guy had this rocks had lost his job because I saw unemployment.

350
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:06.900
casondra b: checks in the mail.

351
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:16.740
casondra b: Now, I was like okay he lost his job and now he has like packets from not just the military, but the Marines.

352
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:29.670
casondra b: And the reason why I find it so funny is because I don't know my dad was a Marine. And he told my mom. They were all savages and like, it's not like there's like maybe this guy could do the Navy, but not the fucking Marines. I don't know. It just seems like

353
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.380
Helena Rouhe: It's a different mentality.

354
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:37.410
casondra b: It sure is. And, and here's the other part that I think makes it like the the funniest is that

355
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:47.790
casondra b: So I don't know what prompted this but like goober and myself are from Southern California. And so everybody is dude. It just comes

356
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.770
casondra b: Out of our vernacular.

357
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.370
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

358
00:40:50.400 --> 00:41:03.390
casondra b: It is, it's not even like a term of endearment. It's just we call I call my boss, dude. Like, that's the level we're at. So, um, and, and again, we only see this person in passing governor is outside. And he's like, Hey dude, and he says that

359
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:16.590
casondra b: Anytime. He sees Justin and then that's it. So this guy texts Gever and it's like, hey, the last couple times. You called me, dude. Can you don't call me dude anymore. And I was just like,

360
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.300
casondra b: Your

361
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:31.560
casondra b: Your, your that's something I would expect to hear from like a father to a son, a teacher to a student, a boss to an employee, but not like

362
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:42.330
casondra b: Somebody who's like four years older than you. It just seemed so like I'm out of nowhere because the next step after that is that I that we just don't acknowledge you

363
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:56.520
casondra b: Right, because I'm not going. It comes so naturally right and it comes out. So naturally, that it's not like we're maliciously or like intentionally demeaning like anybody

364
00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:00.780
casondra b: Could just cut out so. And actually I'm I don't know or care enough to

365
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:16.980
casondra b: censor myself like that. So like and gerber's like yeah I'm just not gonna say anything anymore. And then I was outside and and I had forgotten about all this. And he was just like outside and I was like, Hey, dude. And then the minute it left my mouth, I was like,

366
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.580
casondra b: Oh god, you

367
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:30.780
casondra b: Eat Deep sigh, and then he didn't say fucking word back to me didn't acknowledge me at all. And I was just like, bro. You need to smoke a bowl or I don't know what like you need to do something to get your

368
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:38.850
casondra b: whatever is going on inside of you in check. I just like all of that was just so funny to me. Um, but back to the lawn.

369
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.220
casondra b: A different person from upstairs is helping me and

370
00:42:45.030 --> 00:43:00.270
casondra b: That's very nice of him, although okay so the last time I will clear a section I will prep the soil and then I will go to Home Depot and I will buy the side and the way that the Home Depot is set up is that it has a lot of the garden area is like outside of the building.

371
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.630
casondra b: Right. And because of virus. You can only go in one entrance which is not the

372
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:04.260
casondra b: Grind mentioned

373
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.190
Helena Rouhe: Not go right

374
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.020
casondra b: In and out of the garden entrance

375
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:15.540
casondra b: At the zone. And so the last several times I've stood in line to get into the home depot from five minutes to 30 minutes this last time.

376
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:22.980
casondra b: To get in and then you have to purchase, you have to get somebody to put in a code and then you buy the side and then you go outside and you load it up and you take it away.

377
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:35.580
casondra b: Last time I did all that got home noticed that the that it was a little bit dry and then when I UNFURLED IT. IT WAS JUST yellow like highlighter yellow not

378
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:36.150
Dead.

379
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:43.680
casondra b: Dead. But like and and I could recognize that it was the same exact roles of sod from

380
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:55.920
casondra b: Before yes yeah I should. And I was like, oh, I don't want to get more than I need, because I don't know how to take care of sod that isn't planted. But apparently, neither the fucking Home Depot, so

381
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:00.480
casondra b: And I tried

382
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:09.360
casondra b: I tried to call them just see like, okay, can you, like, I don't think that they're going to give me a refund or anything because I

383
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.100
Helena Rouhe: Can exchange it.

384
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:16.170
casondra b: Well, it's already laid already fertilized, it already watering it

385
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.610
Helena Rouhe: I didn't write it back to life.

386
00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:27.900
casondra b: Park. Yeah, it's like, it's so difficult to get in and out of the car. Yeah, yeah, you know, and then you'd have to get there. Get it in and out of the car right there.

387
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:35.610
casondra b: And then right in LA and and that like it's just, it's so awful. I'd rather just fertilize it and water it because it's not dead. It's just yellow

388
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:42.480
casondra b: And so I don't think they're going to give me like a type of discount, but I would like them to tell me when they're going to get a new shipment and

389
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.520
Helena Rouhe: Therefore, you can avoid more yellow

390
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:56.220
casondra b: Oh, yes. And so, like, I don't know what to do because every time I call, they're just like, it's like all lines are busy and then it just hangs up on you. So I guess I'll just, like, do a drive by and like

391
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.150
casondra b: scoop it out.

392
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:04.770
casondra b: Like if they got some all I'll go and like, I don't know, it shouldn't be.

393
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.990
Helena Rouhe: It shouldn't be this.

394
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.340
Helena Rouhe: Oh man, how much more do you have left.

395
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.670
Like

396
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:19.530
casondra b: Oh, I got here. So here's the thing. I was only going to do like a certain section but it kind of looks like shit I fucked up one of the edges because

397
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:33.480
casondra b: I was just like, oh, I guess I'll just cut it to fit the area that I've cleared and then I was like, No, if I just clear two more inches. I can just lay it without having to cut it. And so I have this like weird zigzag he side. And so what I think I'm going to do is

398
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.680
casondra b: I guess it's maybe like a foot that I'll have to clear

399
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:44.970
casondra b: So I'm going to bring it to the edge of where the yard ends and then there's this like thin strip on the side.

400
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:55.470
casondra b: And I guess I'll just like that's about a foot. And I guess I'll just clear all that out and bring it all the way so that it's like edge to edge and then my other house me just talking about like

401
00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:00.930
casondra b: Like doing more of the art and I'm just a guy from upstairs and I was like, um,

402
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:12.480
casondra b: Maybe I mean we don't pay for water that's included in our, our rent bill but I imagine if we did enough of yard and we had water as often as we could. They notice

403
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:13.710
casondra b: Yeah. Hey, something

404
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.320
Helena Rouhe: We start with what you have and

405
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.540
casondra b: See right that's, that's where my mind that, like, I'm going to start where I'm at. And then, you know,

406
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:32.820
casondra b: I guess the wet because I hate wasting water like I definitely do not shower, a ton. Because I hate wasting water and, like, in my mind, I'm like why don't shower, a lot. So I guess I can water this grass.

407
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:41.910
Helena Rouhe: It's not so good for the environment to have a little green is good for your pup. I mean, there's a lot of good things that that water is doing.

408
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.070
casondra b: Yeah yeah

409
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.340
casondra b: Yeah, that's a good way to look at it. So yeah, so I don't know, I probably have

410
00:46:51.390 --> 00:47:02.040
casondra b: Since he helped he cleared a lot of the guy from upstairs. He helped he cleared a lot of the area that I would have had to clear to finish the original job I had in mind. And so

411
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.620
casondra b: I don't know.

412
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.000
casondra b: We'll see how much I get done this weekend, I would imagine, like two or three more weekends and then

413
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:09.780
casondra b: It'll be done.

414
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.680
Helena Rouhe: Wow, are you going to have a before and after picture.

415
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:23.820
casondra b: I didn't even think about that. I've taken pictures after I laid the sod. I am here. Let me see if I can show you the picture of how fucking yellow. It is

416
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.070
casondra b: It's like

417
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.370
casondra b: It is comical. Um, okay. So I don't know if you can

418
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.010
Helena Rouhe: Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah.

419
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.410
Helena Rouhe: Oh yeah, that is quite yellow

420
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:47.640
casondra b: Yes. And it's just it's six squares and each square is like eight square feet feet. They are heavy

421
00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:48.930
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, they

422
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:52.770
casondra b: Are heavy. I read that like one square foot is like four pounds.

423
00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.460
casondra b: So like eight square feet.

424
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.700
casondra b: I don't know, is a lot more than four. It seems like it's like at least like 50

425
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.810
Helena Rouhe: Or awkward.

426
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:04.920
casondra b: It's kind of

427
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.790
Helena Rouhe: An awkward. It's not something to kind of easily carry around

428
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:11.850
casondra b: Know, they're rolled up and you kind of have

429
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:12.300
casondra b: To like

430
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.400
casondra b: Brace yourself and pair them up if they're wet, then they're slippery and you kind of have to like

431
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.950
casondra b: Like the way I've been doing it is I have to pick it up a certain way so that I can just like slam it down on the ground.

432
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:28.890
casondra b: Right, it'll just unfurl on its own like God. God forbid I put it down the wrong way and I have to like

433
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:31.920
casondra b: You know, do one of these

434
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.260
casondra b: But I mean, it's

435
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.160
casondra b: It's going and

436
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.480
Helena Rouhe: Everything in your life.

437
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.610
casondra b: I'm very disappointed with hello

438
00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:40.260
casondra b: Very disappointed with that.

439
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:47.040
Helena Rouhe: But to think how exciting. It's going to be when you can get it all be the same green color because you've done such a good job.

440
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:56.520
casondra b: That will be nice. It was kind of like a wrench in the gears, like I was so excited to put it down and then when I unfurled. The first one it was yellow. I was like, Oh, they're all going to be yellow. And this is going to look like shit.

441
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:02.430
casondra b: And that's kind of what happened. And so like it really took the wind out of my sails, I guess.

442
00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:03.780
casondra b: But

443
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.510
casondra b: I don't know. I'm just going to keep

444
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:11.700
casondra b: I've looked up how to bring it back to life and the roots are green. It's

445
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:16.320
Helena Rouhe: It's just not just the top. Yeah. It'll be okay. Yeah.

446
00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.600
Helena Rouhe: I feel like your life just doesn't

447
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.940
Helena Rouhe: come easily be challenged

448
00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:24.300
casondra b: Nothing can be easy. Nothing can be easy.

449
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:26.550
Helena Rouhe: I've learned how to do your own nails.

450
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.410
Helena Rouhe: So that's going to save you a lot of money to

451
00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.990
casondra b: I sure did. Yeah.

452
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.870
casondra b: All fabulous but

453
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:34.890
Helena Rouhe: They're also very

454
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:46.530
casondra b: 33. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, they're better than then you would expect for somebody who's never done it before, but, um, it's not like I was starting from square one, because I've been getting my nails done like this for five years. So I definitely

455
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:47.340
Helena Rouhe: Can you

456
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.590
Helena Rouhe: paid attention over the time. Yeah.

457
00:49:49.800 --> 00:50:06.840
casondra b: Well, right. I know what the probably know what each step is and then like I didn't know what the materials being used were but then there's YouTube and YouTube is a wealth of information and like after buying the materials. I'm probably saving like $750 a year.

458
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:07.920
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

459
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.580
Give or take

460
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:15.630
casondra b: You know, I feel bad because I was very loyal to that nail place. I really enjoyed that nail place but

461
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.510
casondra b: Yeah, I mean, it's not like I wanted to do this. It's just kind of fell in my lap and

462
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:33.330
casondra b: It's also weird to have like if I get because now I feel like I finally gotten the thickness and the the liquid powder ratio down, which is how you like

463
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.070
Helena Rouhe: Manage and that would be pretty hard.

464
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.390
Helena Rouhe: Not an easy thing.

465
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:41.970
casondra b: It's very hard because you have to just do it a bunch of times.

466
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:44.100
casondra b: And I've done my cuticles like

467
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:58.620
casondra b: Twice. Now, I'm like, not I was almost done. I need to finish up this one, but I had to like add length and I had to add a thickness and I'm still not not completely jazzed

468
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.660
casondra b: But

469
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.010
Helena Rouhe: Well, again, that's not an easy skill set. And this is a new endeavor for you.

470
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.180
casondra b: And then doing it with my Non dominant hand is also very difficult

471
00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.680
Helena Rouhe: Taking on some very interesting challenges. These day

472
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:21.600
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, maybe. All of that is kind of an interesting way to distract yourself in a good way, your health, a distraction.

473
00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.980
casondra b: Yeah, definitely. Like, especially the nails it takes so much time.

474
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.000
casondra b: It takes

475
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:38.310
casondra b: Hours literal hours of time, even just to do like a, like, because I fucked up the cuticles and I've had to remove part of the cuticles and redo those even that takes hours but I

476
00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:45.210
Helena Rouhe: Think that over time, you're going to get much more efficient at it. You're just you're taking the time right now because you're just learning

477
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.610
casondra b: Yeah, I would agree with that.

478
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:56.880
casondra b: Art agree with that, you know, I guess it's like a interesting skill to have for somebody

479
00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:57.660
Helena Rouhe: I mean, I

480
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:06.180
Helena Rouhe: Well, I think it's good for you to be able to do all of this stuff for you in particular, I think is fantastic because it has been

481
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:22.050
Helena Rouhe: Low on the priority. And oftentimes, maybe even an intentional thing for you to not take care of yourself. So for you to go out of your way to learn these things, not only for yourself but for your dog and all of these things that you're doing now.

482
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:31.200
Helena Rouhe: is fantastic. I mean it's it's meeting the bigger goal of you being able to have a more functional neutral content life.

483
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.080
casondra b: Yeah, I need more things to do.

484
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.340
casondra b: Well,

485
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.830
Helena Rouhe: There's probably lots of things to do. So you're you're chipping away at it, you don't need to do them all at once.

486
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:42.870
Helena Rouhe: Kind of

487
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:46.200
Helena Rouhe: One skill at a time.

488
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:55.860
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Fair enough. So I would like to advocate that you contemplate the medical provider things for the pancreas.

489
00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.870
casondra b: Yeah, start

490
00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:05.880
Helena Rouhe: Looking into what that would look like. And you contemplate a conversation with government about this roommate situation.

491
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.010
casondra b: Oh,

492
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.340
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and I'm just advocating contemplation.

493
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:13.620
casondra b: Yeah, I know.

494
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.220
casondra b: I will contemplate. Okay.

495
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:20.430
casondra b: All right, thanks. Elena

496
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:21.960
Helena Rouhe: You're very welcome.

497
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.320
Helena Rouhe: Do you want to set up another time, or we'll see each other and group.

498
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:31.050
casondra b: Um, yeah, we'll see each other in group. If I want to another time home he really

499
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:31.830
Absolutely.

500
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:36.480
Helena Rouhe: All right, take care, you too. Bye bye.
