Misty Moncada: I've been like embed a few days. But other than that, I'm okay.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.900
Misty Moncada: Well,

5
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely scary around this time.

6
00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:04.110
Misty Moncada: Well yeah, I was doing home health care and I quit my job last week because I started to freak out with everything going on. And ever since I quit. I've just been stuck in the room. Like, I don't want to come out. I don't want to leave the house.

7
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:19.440
Misty Moncada: But I wasn't feeling sick. Last week I just barely started feeling sick like yesterday or early yesterday morning, and the out early morning hours, but it's still kind of scary now because I feel kind of feverish, and I keep blowing my nose. A lot

8
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, check your temperature

9
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:34.680
Misty Moncada: And no I didn't. I feel like flushed. I keep sweating a lot. So I thought about going taking a cold shower but I feel worse today than I did yesterday, so I'm scared to go the hospital.

10
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.140
Misty Moncada: I

11
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.310
Misty Moncada: Don't know I'm scared. With everything going on, but hopefully I'll be okay. I'm, I'm just really blah. Yeah.

12
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They have one more. They have like drive through testing. They don't have anything like that in New Mexico. So, yeah.

13
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.450
Misty Moncada: Um, I don't know, we live in a small town so like every lot there's so many things that are closed.

14
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:14.610
Misty Moncada: You know, it's just like being in a small town is more crazy because everybody's freaking out about it. So yeah and and the only thing that makes us like look Biggers we have a cannon Air Force Base here.

15
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.580
Misty Moncada: And that's the only thing. But other than that, that's like blocked off like nobody can just get in there so

16
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:31.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yeah, well, do what you can from home, take your temperature and just see. I mean, if you do have a fever, then you should try to get some medical support.

17
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.970
Misty Moncada: Oh, yeah.

18
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That

19
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is a scary time now to have a cough or sneeze. Everything is just so scary.

20
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.670
Misty Moncada: It's so scary how every how it's just going around so fast. Like, and I think that's what scared me last week is because I had went to work and then

21
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.910
Misty Moncada: They lie. I was already having issues with the guy that I used to take care of. They sent me back to take care of him.

22
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.860
Misty Moncada: And I just, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't take care of this guy like he was getting on my nerves. So I was already scared, with the coronavirus thing working. So I just thought, why not going back to work.

23
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.270
Misty Moncada: Then I'll care if I lose my job like I'm freaking out with all this and

24
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A lot of people are well

25
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I hope you feel better soon in. I hope it's not coronavirus and dad. It's just the way

26
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.220
Misty Moncada: The site from oh yeah

27
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How have you been

28
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:40.890
Misty Moncada: Um, I, I'm doing okay like I'm having a lot of issues with my daughter, my daughter, my daughter and my daughter's on drugs and she has a boyfriend beaten honor and

29
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.710
Misty Moncada: It's just a

30
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.990
Misty Moncada: She came in here, flipping out through my mom's TV over and tried to steal my wallet one day and

31
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:03.270
Misty Moncada: Just been taking it rough. So today, she said she needed some money for the baby and I told her she could take my card to get some money out for the baby and

32
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.190
Misty Moncada: She never comes back with my card. So I have to report it stolen. Wow. And like

33
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:25.710
Misty Moncada: Which I should know better. She just a stupid crap all the time like she she shows up Vanessa's and make us believe her but like my mom gets maximum moms like give her a chance, like, You're so mean. I'm like this is the same crap I did when I was on drugs. Yeah.

34
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.950
Misty Moncada: Like the same crap like I know all the tricks and trades.

35
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.940
Misty Moncada: And like this the same crap I did in my mom. Just like you don't know how to talk to her. That's why she does what she does not like no

36
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.950
Misty Moncada: I'm going to tell her exactly what's on my mind. Not see here and let her finesse me

37
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:52.290
Misty Moncada: Man, today I let her do just that. She said, Well, I said, why can go to ATM he gets the money out for you. And she says, No. Well, and I'll just be right back. And she never comes back so

38
00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:01.710
Misty Moncada: You know, it's just, um, I think I'm having issues with my kid right now that's like really stressing me out bad

39
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.060
Misty Moncada: And

40
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.290
Misty Moncada: WE GOTTEN TO A not last week, but the week before

41
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:16.470
Misty Moncada: We got into a fistfight man she was here sleep on the couch and it was early in the morning, I was in the kitchen, and she

42
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.970
Misty Moncada: Was getting ready for work and she's running her mouth just talking crap and I was

43
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.540
Misty Moncada: I just saw her back, like I don't know who the f you think you are, but I'm not the one I gotta do not care like you're not coming this House.

44
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.880
Misty Moncada: To be coming off drugs. If you could talk to me anytime away and she started talking to me. So I just

45
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:44.790
Misty Moncada: ran up on her. And I hit her am I'm we start fighting my mom rooms friendship between us and my daughter's on the couch. She kicks me right in my face and like

46
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:55.260
Misty Moncada: I don't know how to handle it is a parrot because I've never really been a parent. I've been in prison. My whole life I've been on drugs, my whole life. I don't know how to just sit down and

47
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:04.050
Misty Moncada: Talk to her, or be like, Okay, you have a problem you have addiction. I, I just want to beat her ass right away and be like, because I don't know how to

48
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.040
Misty Moncada: I feel like, man, I'm going through this. So my mom went through like it's a hard thing. Yeah.

49
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:26.400
Misty Moncada: It's hard. And for me, I get angry. I got angry issue. So I'm just like, I'm a Snatchers little bit which is not a little girl. She's 21 my novel Snatcher loudmouths up and I'm just gonna slap the shit out of her. You don't it so I haven't gone through a lot of issues like trying to be

50
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:46.020
Misty Moncada: A parent with a child who who's doing the same crap. I did. You know, I don't know how to be so maybe I was kind of thinking about maybe i know i'm done with all my classes for probation, but after this coronavirus thing is over. I thought about maybe taking some parenting classes.

51
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:58.500
Misty Moncada: I mean, my kids are all adults. My baby's 20 but maybe something that will help me learn to speak to them, instead of talking to them like some old gangster thug, Wade.

52
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you're trying to

53
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're trying to retrain yourself on how to communicate effectively how to manage your anger parenting classes are effective and we can also work through those skills in therapy, um,

54
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you brought up a lot of points that you didn't parent her. So this is not for you.

55
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the insight that you have is that right now. It's more about getting control of the situation than it is about parenting.

56
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want her to know that you're not the one and like you said that mentality of who's going to be the boss who you know. So what I have patients identifying is that we all have thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, our thoughts.

57
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:53.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And feelings contribute to how we will behave. So the addicted mind.

58
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.410
Misty Moncada: Is

59
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.580
Misty Moncada: always telling you

60
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:13.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To go. It's always it's always seen go there's no barriers. There's no protectors. It just goes the sole proprietor sofa brain tells you to stop slow down minutes you know when to proceed. So

61
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's some projection going on from, you know, seeing how your daughter is behavior and

62
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In real life. Is this some of my attic behavior. I need to get in control.

63
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

64
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:28.920
Misty Moncada: Yes.

65
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:36.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm curious to know if you really reflect on that that situation that occurred with the fight with your daughter. What was the

66
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.850
What was the feeling

67
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.300
Misty Moncada: For me, like,

68
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:55.950
Misty Moncada: Okay. It was very early in the morning and she's already running her mouth. And I know that she's coming down off drugs. I know that she's irritable, because these are all the things I used to do and then

69
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:05.910
Misty Moncada: She made me so mad because she was just like, fuck you, you know, just told me, like, fuck you flat out, like, fuck you.

70
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.430
Misty Moncada: I'm like, what, what did you say like it's too early for this shit. You know I'm saying too early first so me like

71
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:20.640
Misty Moncada: I have a, I don't have a good way of parenting, like, okay, what did you say I get pumped up like I'm still living a good life. And I'm like,

72
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:28.290
Misty Moncada: Okay, now you got me fucked up. Like, I'm gonna go over them Buster, your mouth is what I told her so, like, for me I afterwards.

73
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:36.210
Misty Moncada: I feel bad. Oh my god. These are not dubs on the streets like these are my kids like I'm not out on the streets anymore. I'm not in prison in the mark.

74
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:49.950
Misty Moncada: But I live. I'll go back to when I feel disrespected like I'll go about to prison time or or me being on the streets time and so sometimes I can tell like

75
00:09:50.430 --> 00:10:05.040
Misty Moncada: I know it's I noticed a big difference. I know this is this is my family, but sometimes I don't see it like that, that moment, it just it pumps me up so bad that I'm like, Okay, well, what's up kind of thing. Afterwards, you know, I feel like can, but I just really do that to my daughter. Yeah.

76
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what you said. The feeling is

77
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The fact is, I feel disrespected

78
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so typically, when you feel disrespected

79
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The feeling that's associated with that is anger its aggression.

80
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:34.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, and so that behavior that follows is it mirrors that aggression. So what you would want to do is be able to get in front of whenever that thought of being disrespected comes up.

81
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:43.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you remind yourself that you're not in the streets. You don't have to fight for your survival. So you would have to

82
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:55.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: deflect the fight of the addition suspected with self talk to get you out of that because your thought your feelings, and behaviors they all align with one shot, one another.

83
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What could what could be some self top

84
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Things that you would say to yourself, whenever that file of disrespect comes up.

85
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:12.510
Misty Moncada: And I don't know because I'm still working on that. Like, I don't know what will help my mind right now like I am.

86
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:22.350
Misty Moncada: I don't, I, I'm still there's so much I have to work on, like, like I'm still new in my sobriety. I'm still new and like trying to change.

87
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:39.960
Misty Moncada: I learned a lot in these classes that I just had for probation. I had 12 classes to do and and I did them in like I learned a lot. But still, like there's so much I have to play in my mind like just because I learned about him like I've never actually did all this

88
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.870
Misty Moncada: It's the big thing for me.

89
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so let's work through that together. Right.

90
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's go back to that situation that happened with your daughter.

91
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:55.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So she said a few. The first thought was, I'm being disrespectful.

92
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:04.530
Misty Moncada: But yeah, especially by my, my daughter at of all people like my daughter is what freaked me out because I was like, damn, like I

93
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:15.540
Misty Moncada: I just that made me it made me more angry. Yeah. Like to know that my child was talking to my dad. I know, I remember that feeling I got it may mean. Oh my gosh, maybe more pumped up

94
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:26.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: being disrespected that core of it is the respect. So we you said your daughter and parenting respect is one of the biggest things

95
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:38.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's how we develop the discipline. That's how you know that your children are going to behave accordingly in private and out in the community. So the core of that was respect.

96
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:52.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, and so it was the lack of respect that my daughter has some of that projection may have been if you really, it's or hot deeper is. I'm wondering if you thought to yourself, is this why raised

97
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.500
Misty Moncada: But then, and then I

98
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:04.710
Misty Moncada: felt bad though because I wasn't always there. I didn't raise her, I was in prison and majority of my life. So that's what bothered me too. I apologize. I may interrupt you, but yeah.

99
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.460
Okay.

100
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so it was the disrespect.

101
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Here was the outrage to I'm going to get my respect.

102
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:25.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it didn't work because one. Your daughter is an addict and at the age of 21 they are practicing identity.

103
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:34.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They, you know, trying to instill that respect at that age is a hard fight because when you said you don't have the foundation of

104
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:45.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What memories or experiences you guys full and share in her childhood and upbringing. So now, moving forward, you will have to go in a different way.

105
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:58.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of when she react this way just taking care of how you respond. And so thinking less of controlling her behaviors, but more so on missed his behavior.

106
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:11.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the self talk would be okay. My thought is, I feel disrespected the feeling is anger. And so typically when misty has

107
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:22.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: disrespected anger, she acts out her behavior is aggression. So what I'm going to do self talk misty mine yourself. Okay. This is not about respect here.

108
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:41.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is an adult. That is an addict. This is an adult that has no control but misty has control misty is learning how to fight the addictive brain and misty is going to activate for sobering.

109
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:52.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what happens when we have these responses. The thoughts. The feelings, and behaviors. Our body will react to be an activated by that.

110
00:14:53.130 --> 00:15:08.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the fact that it was disrespect anger and then aggression, your body tapped into the sympathetic central nervous system and activated the fight, flight, or freeze.

111
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And your defense mechanism is fight.

112
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:22.290
Misty Moncada: And it's always been like that, you know, and that's the sad part. And then another thing with my job. Okay, this is what happened. My job. The other day was really pissed me off so Friday and group.

113
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:30.840
Misty Moncada: I couldn't even pay attention group like at all like my mind was not in group like I was listening, but I wasn't listening. I just kept you know just

114
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:42.600
Misty Moncada: I was just like, to every which way I can think, Okay, this is what happened. My job. Actually, the other day I had a client who was trying to have me do other things for him. Besides,

115
00:15:43.050 --> 00:16:02.580
Misty Moncada: Do what I'm supposed to do at his house, would he came and he wanted me to rub his back his chest. He wanted to lay his, his head on my lap and let me comb his hair and I reported it to my job I reported to my job. And I said, look, I, I told my dog.

116
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:12.720
Misty Moncada: I'm not that kind of girl like if I have to tell him again. I don't care if he's not all there like because I know he is because you could just tell that he's trying to manipulate his way.

117
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:18.480
Misty Moncada: And then they were like misty like calm down. We'll talk to them. And I guess they talked to me said it wasn't true.

118
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:29.160
Misty Moncada: Okay, so they found me a different client. So take care of because of this guy and he's been through like 50 caregivers, because he's so hate

119
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:36.960
Misty Moncada: And doesn't ever want. Okay, so here's new caregiver was going to have surgery and was going to be out for three days.

120
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:50.250
Misty Moncada: They needed someone to take care of him and he requested me and I told my job. No, no. My job said no one else will go work for him because how hateful you so missed you gotta go.

121
00:16:51.930 --> 00:17:01.980
Misty Moncada: That thing for me. So when I go back over there to work for him once again he's been a pervert with me and my little defense mechanism. When I got to his house.

122
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:15.690
Misty Moncada: He had because he has a gate, and he has, you know, the front gate right here on the side gate when I got to his house. He knew I was going to work for three days there. He had locks on the gates that was something he didn't have

123
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.490
Misty Moncada: Okay, so

124
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:26.370
Misty Moncada: Probably came out and I Delbert like I think 50 something years old. I don't even know how to be on I think

125
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:39.540
Misty Moncada: My mom knows his family. My mom said he's not that old. OK, so the gates are locked and I call Genesis and and my job. And I'm like, okay, the gates are locked. Can you please inform me because i don't i'm now my number.

126
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:46.860
Misty Moncada: I was like, can you please inform him that I'm at. So outside becomes he unlocks the gates and when I go inside, he locks the gates back

127
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:57.960
Misty Moncada: Which freaked me out even more so when I go inside there and he says, okay, Eric, what do you want, did you want to wash my hair first numbers like, hold on. Like I just walked in.

128
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:08.730
Misty Moncada: I haven't been here in a minute, like, hold on. And so he's like, but today, you're gonna rub my back in my chest. Now, I'm like, No, I'm not. He's like, Yes, you are. And I'm like,

129
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:21.240
Misty Moncada: I flipped out instead of me being professional I said look cool, like I'm not the one I'll bust your mouth. I said first far Detroit, not to talk to me like that. And then he was like, well, I know you told Genesis

130
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:29.250
Misty Moncada: I said I didn't tell him a damn thing. Why do you think I'm over here. I said I wanted a different client, because I had, you know, and I just straight lie to him, which I did tell Genesis

131
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:37.710
Misty Moncada: But I didn't want him to know that because I'm alone with this man, it's kind of slow. I don't know what he's capable of doing. You know what I'm saying. So I didn't tell him that

132
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:46.110
Misty Moncada: Well, he wanted. He was like, well, I know you told him, so I freaked out. He calls Genesis on the phone immediately my job.

133
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:56.490
Misty Moncada: And is like asking them questions about me. And I'm like, look, this is none of his concern. I'm just here take care of, like, my personal life isn't his concern I go out the door and I jumped over the fence.

134
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:06.210
Misty Moncada: And I don't go back to work. This is actually the whole truth of what happened last week I refused to go back. My job kept calling. I didn't go turn my hours in

135
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:17.730
Misty Moncada: I didn't go back and I was so angry that why would you put me in a situation after I already told you that this man was being perverted with me. Yeah, yeah.

136
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:28.560
Misty Moncada: And that really hurt my feelings hurt my feelings to the point where I am. I mean I'm not saying that I still have a prison mentality. My still have it.

137
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:37.800
Misty Moncada: I still have a good, I call it sometimes I saw this childish mentality where i don't i don't think like an adult sometimes. So my whole thing was like

138
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:49.560
Misty Moncada: What if I had to do so. Or what if I did not ahead to what if I did something so dumb. At that moment, and there I go in trouble again. But I heard already spoke to my job and said, Please don't. Don't put me back over there at that man.

139
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.750
Misty Moncada: Like oh, nobody else will do it. He doesn't want nobody else's house a request to you. So for me, I

140
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was considering what I already told you he would want me back.

141
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:13.920
Misty Moncada: So that for me was another thing. He had a lot of anger. This whole last week Friday I couldn't concentrate in group. It was just like I was just listening and just not even paying attention and then the things of my daughter. It's just like

142
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.160
Misty Moncada: I don't know. Yeah, I

143
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know what I'm sensing

144
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:39.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I hear you use the word anger and hurt into interchangeably. Those are two different emotions. So if you were to reflect on this experience with your employer, as well as your daughter was the feeling anger or was it hurt.

145
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:49.710
Misty Moncada: With my daughter. I think it was more hurt with my client, it was more anger, because I'm

146
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:59.850
Misty Moncada: Like I've never been molested or raped or anything, but I've had friends who said they went through traumatic stuff. And I've always said I hope I never have to go through that.

147
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:11.850
Misty Moncada: And for when the, when I felt like that was my plan. I felt disrespected like I'm like not safe. Yeah, like anger built up like I didn't feel safe there. I feel like

148
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:21.960
Misty Moncada: Man, am I gonna have to do something to get out of this situation because the gates were locked. I jumped over get he came out yelling, it makes I jumped over his game. What are you doing, that's why locked him.

149
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:29.880
Misty Moncada: So I was like, no you a locking me in so that for me was anger with my daughter more hurt because I feel like I'm

150
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.350
Misty Moncada: I come watching me all over again. Yeah, yeah.

151
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.300
So,

152
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:42.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What you work on misty is identifying really what the feeling

153
00:21:44.160 --> 00:22:04.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because, you know, the fight, but the feeling because you haven't process feelings in a while because you just you operate it on survival mode. So initially, when we're talking. He said, You felt disrespected by your daughter. But the more we talked about. It was like, really. I was hurt.

154
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:14.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the conversation with happened with your employer at the beginning of the conversation. It was just very surface level. You just told me I quit my job.

155
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:22.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the more we started talking. Sorry, let me tell you what really happened why really quit my job, you started on peeling those layers.

156
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There was something that shifted

157
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In this conversation that made you feel safe to say, let me tell JESSICA What really happened.

158
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:44.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when they happened at your caretaker with your employer, you said you felt angry, but really, as you kept talking set else scared in that moment.

159
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:56.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you see how initially the automatic feeling you go to with anger and maybe that's why it's hard for you to control that because it really is an anger.

160
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:06.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's a different emotion underlying and when you're able to process what that underlying feeling is without emotion.

161
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:22.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's when you can do the work to find out the self talk because you already. You're very transparent. I appreciate that you said, I don't know what to say to read rewire my brain. I don't know any self talk

162
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:30.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I would offer that perhaps you don't know what to say. Because you're still trying to find out exactly what you're feeling

163
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:41.520
Misty Moncada: And that's the way I do feel like I feel so confused. Sometimes. Sometimes I feel like a, like, it's funny, like

164
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:51.900
Misty Moncada: I know how confused. Your last I felt when I was on drugs, but sometimes I feel confused last like if I was on drugs, trying to find my own feelings me because I can't figure out and

165
00:23:52.230 --> 00:24:05.430
Misty Moncada: It's been so long since I've cried or been sad or the other night I stayed up all night like I could not sleep. I was deep in my feelings I stayed up all night watching Tick tock videos.

166
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:18.300
Misty Moncada: And it was showing videos like Kobe Bryant or his daughter or the coronavirus all around the world. And I started crying like I never hardly cry because I know myself for some

167
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:28.620
Misty Moncada: Years. So when I just the other night like I i didn't even go to sleep. Like I stayed up all night I went downstairs in the morning. And my mom's hear you. Okay. I said, I've been up all night like

168
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:42.990
Misty Moncada: My feelings. I was so deep in my emotions. I couldn't even go to bed like and it was funny. It was it was funny to me. But it wasn't funny because it's like, I cried over other things or other things, or it pertained to other people, but I felt something

169
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:50.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How Daniel in that moment where you felt something. Did it feel comfortable. What does that experience like for you.

170
00:24:51.660 --> 00:25:00.060
Misty Moncada: Like it just felt like man this is life like a gosh like it makes it feel emotional right now is because we, you know, watching them.

171
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:08.430
Misty Moncada: Like it was showing about how in New York, like everybody over there, like all the nurses and the doctors stressed me out and I start crying. I was like,

172
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.860
Misty Moncada: Oh my gosh, like this is life like people are really going to stuff like this is serious and then

173
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:25.110
Misty Moncada: Aware that we're showing a video Kobe Bryant his daughter playing basketball on to talk and I was like oh my gosh, like in their, in their last days, and then I start playing all these feelings like

174
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.140
Misty Moncada: Like, I don't know, it's just weird. Like I in a feel. It feels good to have some type of emotion.

175
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.930
Misty Moncada: That like I couldn't stop having no emotion.

176
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:42.480
Misty Moncada: I just kept wanting to cry. And I was just like, oh, get a grip on yourself. Misty, but it felt good. I guess to relieve

177
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.670
Misty Moncada: Stress because I've been stressed.

178
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.380
Yeah.

179
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:58.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this may seem a little childish, but just just appeasement here, right. These are lists of different emotions, you're not the only one that shows

180
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:10.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really trying to find out what emotion, you're dealing with because some people are so protective of their feelings and not wanting the outside to see that vulnerability

181
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:20.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That the default emotion is go to anger. That'll scare people off. That'll keep people away and that will keep you safe.

182
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:36.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then we start really doing the chicken. You see, well, there's a range of different emotions. You know, I can be surprised excited with my daughter was I angry was I worried, you know, was I embarrassed or ashamed.

183
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.510
He's like different things.

184
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:48.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was going on with your employer, you know, where you annoyed that they didn't listen to your concerns angry scared.

185
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Worn out

186
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These are lifts.

187
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A list of different things. I'm actually going to send it to you. Misty and

188
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want you to just look at it every day and then do a check in with yourself and then Sunday.

189
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.780
What you feel

190
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:18.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because we want to work on. You feeling these things your life didn't allow for you to be vulnerable. You had to be strong, you have to protect yourself.

191
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now you can be vulnerable.

192
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.260
Misty Moncada: Okay.

193
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.470
I'm gonna have you look at him.

194
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then tell me, we'll see more she feeling right now in this moment.

195
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.560
Misty Moncada: I'm

196
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.180
Misty Moncada: See

197
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.760
If you want me to scroll down, there's more at the bottom.

198
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.070
Where did I see

199
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:15.000
Misty Moncada: A calm one I sent a comment like I actually feel calm right now. Believe it or not, I feel calm, because I can talk to you about it and I don't. It's like without judgment. You know, like I don't feel, Oh, there's

200
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.460
Misty Moncada: Like I don't feel there's any judgments. Here I

201
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.190
Misty Moncada: I'm

202
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.370
Misty Moncada: Not overwhelmed. See

203
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:40.260
Misty Moncada: I feel confused with a lot of things going on. Like, I feel confused that my job would send me back. I feel like confuse that

204
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.780
Misty Moncada: With what I'm going through with my daughter like confuses my head like

205
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.890
Misty Moncada: I'm

206
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.940
Misty Moncada: I feel on edge a little

207
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:14.490
Misty Moncada: When I talk about it though. Like when I don't think about it. I'm not on edge. But when I such talk about it. I get like all. Oh.

208
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:15.270
Yeah.

209
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is on edge me for you.

210
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.280
Misty Moncada: Um, for me, I feel like I'm

211
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.290
Misty Moncada: Like

212
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:45.450
Misty Moncada: I'm frustrated that moment, I feel like I'm about to react to it or but it's already over. But me, being on edge when I talk about it because I start getting pumped up and I get angry and I'm like oh yeah inside. I don't know if that makes sense. You don't

213
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:52.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make sense it all makes sense. This is good because it gives me an opportunity to give you some more skills so

214
00:29:53.190 --> 00:30:08.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That on edge feeling is very significant because that is where you can go from here to here, because that on edge means that if anything else rocks the boat. I'm going to tip over. I'm going

215
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.480
Misty Moncada: Over on

216
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:21.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The ball over myself. So when you feel on edge that's that underlining motions those leftover emotion that haven't been process and some situations.

217
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:35.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whenever you rethink it. It's going to rise up. So if there was a box that you could put leftover emotions and only you have the key to open

218
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.400
Misty Moncada: What would that box look like

219
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Describe it imagination.

220
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.710
Misty Moncada: Right to put emotions in it.

221
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whenever you have that on edge emotion.

222
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:58.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And like you said, it's because whenever I talk about it. I get reactivated. I started

223
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have that you would been

224
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Placed on edge and motion into this empty container.

225
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the container is significant because it gives you an opportunity to say

226
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Put it behind me.

227
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:26.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The key that you only have gives you an opportunity to realize that you have the power, and you have the control

228
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.230
Misty Moncada: Now, like

229
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:45.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm describing the box is important, misty because you're literally would visualize this box when ever you get to that place of being on it.

230
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is no silo. It's like it's not something that come up on the spot, but just think about

231
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.710
Misty Moncada: Okay.

232
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.230
Misty Moncada: And it's just like

233
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:17.730
Misty Moncada: A card like for me right now. It's like, I, I would have thought BY NOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SOBER off heroin since January 1 and I would have thought by now that I would be in control of my emotions.

234
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:31.890
Misty Moncada: And I'm still not like when I start to get think about something. Boom. I'm right. Not right on edge immediately because I'll get like pumped up, I'll get angry or like

235
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.540
Misty Moncada: There's just so many things I keep playing in my head right

236
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.800
Misty Moncada: I don't

237
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:39.240
Need that

238
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:53.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It may seem like fantasy and just mumbo jumbo but it works. It works tapping into that different space activating

239
00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:11.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What you activate a central nervous system is the sympathetic part, the one that does the fight, flight, or freeze you now training your body and your brain to activate the calming phase, it's never done that before.

240
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:18.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, for it to do it. It's going to need you talking to it and it's going to need imagination.

241
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's going to be the visual

242
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.970
Misty Moncada: It's hard to I guess it's hard because I never did it before so

243
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me share a story with you.

244
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:42.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When I'm when I was younger, I remember my mom was she's the wash my hair she's to wash it in the same like the picture. See

245
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:56.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I would get so scared because whenever like the water get my face with touch my nose. I would feel like I'm drowning. I would feel like I was submerged in water. So I remember as a young child, I said.

246
00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:05.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I love the little mermaid and Ariel. So whenever it came time to wash my hair, I would think that I was a little mermaid. I was Ariel.

247
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:18.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so, as my mom was washing my hair. Whenever I got scared, I would imagine myself being under the sea, and I was Ariel, the mermaid. And I didn't panic anymore.

248
00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: At a young age I tapped into resource imagery

249
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I activated my brain to a calm state.

250
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.360
Misty Moncada: So,

251
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:38.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe the box is a little too far off for you think about anything that will bring you to a space of calmness.

252
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.740
Misty Moncada: And another thing that's been calling me um

253
00:34:45.660 --> 00:35:02.400
Misty Moncada: I have been getting very, very angry. I'm music like I just get on YouTube. Mm hmm. And I go through like all the songs like I don't care, whatever type of music, it is, and I find something that soothing to me and I'll play music

254
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.730
Misty Moncada: That's another thing I noticed that has been

255
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:18.450
Misty Moncada: Helping me a lot like a all fine, just I don't. It could either be country and I don't even care for country if it seemed soothing. To me, I will play that song and I will save it on my playlist.

256
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's good. It doesn't help you in that moment when

257
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He says F you. It keeps you in your face.

258
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:38.460
Misty Moncada: Yeah, and you're right at that moment. It was just like, like I'm still learning, it's it's sad to say, like, I'm still learning how to be a parent, like I've been out of prison since

259
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.100
Misty Moncada: And like

260
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:55.020
Misty Moncada: I am still learning to be a parent because there are adults now they have their own ways of thinking and talking and doing and and I'm trying so hard to be a parent. And I feel like

261
00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:05.610
Misty Moncada: Sometimes in my head, I'm like, it's too late to do this, I get too late. Misty like it's too late. Just give it up just let them do them like, but then I'm like,

262
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:19.710
Misty Moncada: No, I'm not gonna let them do them. I'm not gonna let them talk to me some type of way. I'm not gonna, you know, and I noticed that. Another thing that probably bothered my daughter was the other day, she kept throwing stuff in my face. She's like,

263
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:31.230
Misty Moncada: You were never there like me all you thought you could buy our love because when I was strung out on drugs. I had this you know really rich sugar daddy that used to take care of me.

264
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.860
Misty Moncada: And he would give me like all this money every month for my kids.

265
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:47.040
Misty Moncada: And she remembers that as a kid. She's like, You thought money could buy our love like you were never there like all you were out doing is getting high and party and thinking that you just bring all this money to us every month.

266
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:53.580
Misty Moncada: And so, I realized that something was hurting her and I told my daughter. I said,

267
00:36:54.510 --> 00:37:00.660
Misty Moncada: You're going about stuff the wrong way, if it bothers you. Maybe you need to go and I don't know where, like,

268
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.640
Misty Moncada: This came out and I was proud of myself, though, that I sent it though. I said,

269
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:14.040
Misty Moncada: Because usually I'm done, I just tell her, like, Oh, shut the F up like stop being a baby and get over it. Well, you know, the other day I was like, obviously, is hurting you.

270
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:21.780
Misty Moncada: Maybe you should try seeking counseling go to counseling and talk about it because if it didn't hurt you. You wouldn't be talking about it all the time we got in a fight.

271
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.530
Misty Moncada: So I told her that I didn't have a problem or any counseling with her like

272
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:39.060
Misty Moncada: And that right there kind of made me feel happy to say that because she is right like money doesn't buy, you know, and that was my way of shutting my kids up when I was strung out

273
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:48.000
Misty Moncada: If I go take my mom 1500 dollars for them. Here you go. They're fine. Kind of stuff. No, no, it didn't work that way. So,

274
00:37:49.050 --> 00:38:00.990
Misty Moncada: I don't know, I just, there's just a lot of things that affect me. And it's like, and I'm trying my best to learn how to speak and then sometimes I just get so angry. I don't know how to speak yet. Yeah.

275
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, let's go back to that imagery what something that represents nurturing to

276
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.740
Misty Moncada: Nurturing

277
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, real or imaginary

278
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.230
Misty Moncada: I'm

279
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.370
Misty Moncada: Like being there.

280
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:34.860
Misty Moncada: I, I tried to use this as an example because I, you know, like I said some prison majority my life like in prison, like we would nurture the younger kids that would come in.

281
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.820
Misty Moncada: And just try to help them when they were crying or going through something

282
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:49.290
Misty Moncada: So I want to be able to do that with my kids and just be like, nurturing, like it's gonna be okay we're gonna get to this kind of thing. If I could do that to someone else's kid. I think I could do it to my own kids.

283
00:38:49.770 --> 00:39:03.810
Misty Moncada: But my kids have a lot of them anger towards me a lot of bitterness a lot and and it's okay like in my mind, I'm like, it's okay to allow them to be themselves, but when I allow them to be themselves. I get

284
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:04.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Angry on my no

285
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.770
Misty Moncada: Yes, not only we can

286
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know why because what you're doing is kind of what you're also doing in this session.

287
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:29.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When it comes to focusing on you and what you can do to regulate your emotions you deflect and think of your kids and like I shared earlier. They're older now. So the best gift you can give them is you being a whole person.

288
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:45.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So seeing and hoping and thinking restoration and it's almost like you're trying to go back to be in the parents and that their little ones, and that you can rewrite history.

289
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.300
Misty Moncada: Right, you can

290
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It is present and it's moving forward. So moving forward, is

291
00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:04.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What can I do whenever you get in that place of, well, I'm not gonna focus on what I'm going to do, I'm going to see how to get my kids involved.

292
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For example, and this is not judging. This is my assessment. I'll go back to parenting. I know they're older. But it'll help me. That's you and your desire to get that nurturing aspect back of being that mom have little child.

293
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When your daughter brought up how she felt that will go to therapy together.

294
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So your growth is almost codependent on your children.

295
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:45.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's that guilt. That's coming up. And that guilt is making you think I'm going to rewrite history.

296
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:47.880
Misty Moncada: Right.

297
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:56.940
Misty Moncada: And I tried so hard to talk to her like that. Like, I tried so hard to keep my cool with her and and I like

298
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:08.880
Misty Moncada: I'm just like, oh, from everything I use from group for heard from group or learn from group or misty, you know, think before you react or I try, I try to do that sometimes. I'm like, Okay. Do you know don't tell her offer and then

299
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:21.030
Misty Moncada: And then she starts getting pumped up, and I guess it kind of gets me pumped up, but I just want them to allow them to be themselves and not come into our lives and change them, but

300
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:28.620
Misty Moncada: I guess it does kind of hurt to hear them say the true sometimes like knowing that a lot of that is true, like I

301
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:38.790
Misty Moncada: I didn't care. I was strung out on drugs or I wasn't prison. I was never there. And so I guess it kind of hurts me to hear that because it's like, damn, like these kids are really hurt.

302
00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:55.140
Misty Moncada: Me and it hurts me and then I start to think down i'm just i'm i'm never going to be the right parent. I might as well just start even try. You know, I start to play these things in my head. And before I never cared like last year.

303
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.520
Misty Moncada: In December, I could be fighting my kids and I could be like

304
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:09.570
Misty Moncada: I could care less. We saw think if you're happy, happy if you're not, you know, I was just because I was in my addiction. I didn't care. It was like, I don't care which I have to say, I don't care what you feel and, you know,

305
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:20.700
Misty Moncada: And I really meant that when I used to tell them back when I was on drugs. I did not care what they had to say. I did not care about their feelings. I really mean that. Okay, now

306
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:30.240
Misty Moncada: I do care because I'm not on drugs, no more. I care about like how this has affected them now that they talk about it like

307
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:41.340
Misty Moncada: I do care. It's like, damn, like I really damaged their minds, where my daughter has to render drugs now or to numb herself or my son, my son is

308
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:51.060
Misty Moncada: Well, my oldest doesn't live from my youngest and he's really not that bad. I know something's affecting me. He'll speak on it, but it still affects a minister and effect.

309
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:58.410
Misty Moncada: Because they're starting to tell the truth, and I'm seeing it in a clear mind. I just don't know how to pay attention to it like that an adult. Yeah.

310
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The way you pay attention to as an Adele is

311
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:14.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Take your responsibility. Moving on it. I'm sorry, that was your experience and putting what they said in that container.

312
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.470
Misty Moncada: Okay.

313
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or creating that imagery that go to

314
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.960
Of calmness.

315
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:32.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like I said, the YouTube and the music is great, but what I'm trying to offer you our immediate imagery resources.

316
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That help you in those moments where somebody is coming at us.

317
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:38.670
With your feelings.

318
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feelings are always facts, but it's

319
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reality for that.

320
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:44.580
Person.

321
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you're gonna may say

322
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something that you may think, but that wasn't true. I did a BSc but

323
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't. You don't fight it. That was her reality. Okay.

324
00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.050
Misty Moncada: Right.

325
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So my other sister.

326
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:10.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relation as you add with the employer, someone may have said, well, I would have. I want to have been a grant would have been, I would have been scared so

327
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Everyone's feeling this individual alive, but

328
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:23.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said in this session that sometimes like I don't even want to try. Is it worth it. It is worth it. Don't give up.

329
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.090
Right.

330
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:40.140
Misty Moncada: And that's what I don't want to do. I don't want to give up. I just get so frustrated sometimes it's just like, oh, like I don't even care or like, but then I do care because I'm not Mr on drugs anymore if I didn't care. I wouldn't be stressed out about it right now.

331
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.580
Misty Moncada: Yeah, that's the way I feel

332
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:47.850
Misty Moncada: And that's how I've been telling my daughter, like, obviously, it does affect because if it doesn't, you wouldn't be talking about it but like

333
00:44:48.300 --> 00:45:04.050
Misty Moncada: I just don't want to be this crappy parent either. I want them to see that I can change my things will be different. It's just going to take time for me because I i've got a lot going on in my brain. I just I just feel like I'm a hot cast

334
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Aren't we all.

335
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All the hot mess of some sort.

336
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:20.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whether it be parenting, whether it be a job relationship. We all have these complex emotions that we're trying to deal with the

337
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right way is regulating it

338
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:32.970
Misty Moncada: And then now it's my job thing like I'm stressed out about it. I'm like, Oh my God, why did I just do that I need this damn job but

339
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.690
Misty Moncada: But then, I don't know, I'll just have to, you know, be strong about all this and just

340
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:43.920
Breathe.

341
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.330
Misty Moncada: Yeah.

342
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:52.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Exactly what you just did that is something that you can go to right away that belly breathing.

343
00:45:52.950 --> 00:46:10.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, take short inhales and long exhales because it can notice when you're activated by your fight response, it's shorter breathing. Right. It's like okay anyhow longer Excel shorter

344
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.030
Misty Moncada: Feel it.

345
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:21.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In your body gets activated. But when you inhale short and Excel for longer call it the 711 breathing.

346
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That helps you activate that calming aspect that I told you is central nervous system.

347
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.540
Misty Moncada: So,

348
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:37.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something happens because you still need to come up with that box. But in the interim, while you're thinking about it.

349
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:48.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something happens, you gotta come back to she comes back home today. She goes, a credit card, he or she comes back home and she plays like she does a little wet with the credit card.

350
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:49.980
Misty Moncada: You gotta tap into that.

351
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:58.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Space, you gotta identify Misty, what am I thinking what am I feeling okay. Now how will I behave

352
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:08.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then that you're doing the 711 breathe. And the reason why 711 breathing is that you inhale for seven seconds.

353
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:09.990
Misty Moncada: And you can

354
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell what you say.

355
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.850
Misty Moncada: So inhale.

356
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Seven seconds.

357
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.110
Misty Moncada: Seconds and accelerate

358
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 11 seconds.

359
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.010
Misty Moncada: Okay, I'm gonna have to try that.

360
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:31.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you can practice it now and then you put the hand on your belly because you want to feel that expansion. You want to feel the

361
00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:32.700
Misty Moncada: Breath coming out.

362
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:35.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So put your place your hand on your belly.

363
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:36.690
Misty Moncada: Okay.

364
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'll do the county. So inhale.

365
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:48.780
1234567 exhale 123456789 states.

366
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Inhale 1234567 XL 12345678

367
00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:09.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For more time, inhale 1234567 exhale 1234567

368
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:18.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So did you feel your shoulders rising. We had to inhale.

369
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.850
Misty Moncada: It made me feel a little dizzy.

370
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.820
Misty Moncada: Yeah, because I haven't definitely

371
00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Doing it and then being

372
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:38.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Taken as long as you can to really get the full exhale for that 11 seconds because what you're doing is you're activating the body to call in a calm state.

373
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:50.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's might react through the amygdala. We can't go on fight response because somebody says something that anger her but mystique not allowing the body to respond. So let's just calm down.

374
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:55.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And by you coming your body. Now you have time to think.

375
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.150
And feel

376
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.940
And then change the behavior.

377
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:11.010
Misty Moncada: Well, I want to be more mature about that, like I was just talking about that in group. The other day I was like, I feel like I could be so mature business right away. It's like site mode like

378
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:22.410
Misty Moncada: You know, so like one day, I want to be able to say, okay, you don't have to do that. It's okay to be angry or her or it's okay to feel belittled, or

379
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:31.530
Misty Moncada: You know i one day, I hope that I can get through that and not have to be so immature because that's the way I'm starting to feel like okay I'm 40 years old, I need to stop acting like that.

380
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:41.550
Misty Moncada: Then, but I think about that. And I'm like, Okay, don't do that. But then when I get angry. I do do it in house. So I hope that one day I can work on that and change that.

381
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:49.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can you just have to use the skills, like you said you're gathering all the information, but it's not the application yet.

382
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:58.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So once you start applying it. I promise you, all of this stuff I'm teaching you is research every race. It works.

383
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It works.

384
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:14.670
Misty Moncada: And I'm pretty sure in like I believe you that it does. It's just, I've never, I've never used any of these techniques. So to me it's new and to me. I'm like, okay, it'll eventually work one day for me, like, like I'm open for anything.

385
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah, I see that

386
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:20.190
Misty Moncada: So really,

387
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How are you feeling now.

388
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:26.730
Misty Moncada: I feel better. I feel relaxed, now that I talked to, like,

389
00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:43.470
Misty Moncada: I in my I'm really not feeling okay my other therapist, I am. I'm just really not feeling it with her. I miss my appointment with her. Um, I don't know if I explain to you, but, um, I don't know, I haven't talked to you.

390
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:54.690
Misty Moncada: I went to see the doctor. The mental health doctor for the month, I have to see once a month, and she was kind of rude to me. The doctor was

391
00:50:55.230 --> 00:51:03.540
Misty Moncada: And I was going to file a complaint on her, but I didn't because there I go once get in prison mode, okay, you don't Snitch kind of thing.

392
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:16.410
Misty Moncada: And I told the lady that I was having a hard time sleeping. I had lines it and she started talking about the Suboxone program. Well, don't you think two strips is too much for you like

393
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:30.930
Misty Moncada: Maybe if you weren't still numbing yourself. So once again, this is what I went through with the doctor last month at men's health. So I was just like wow, like, really. So when I came out of the office with her. I was like, I don't ever want to see a doctor again.

394
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:38.100
Misty Moncada: I told my therapist my therapist said she wanted to have what is the where we all talk

395
00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:39.540
Misty Moncada: Okay.

396
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:47.160
Misty Moncada: Um, and it never happened with the whole coronavirus thing, but my therapist was kind of like different towards me.

397
00:51:47.790 --> 00:52:03.510
Misty Moncada: And or maybe I felt, maybe I feel like they're all against Me when one is I get I just be my head, but she said that she would have a thing talk with me and separate right now the way I felt it mental health. Last month I feel like I don't trust any of them.

398
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:12.960
Misty Moncada: Is what I felt because she was just like, Well, you're still numbing yourself. And I said, I'd rather be numbing myself with Suboxone then beyond heroin.

399
00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:24.210
Misty Moncada: And I felt really disrespected without to that was another thing that happened, and maybe when this whole coronavirus thing is over a she says she's gonna be our mediator. Okay.

400
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:34.470
Misty Moncada: And she said that if she did that that was not professional and I wasn't gonna speak of it. But when she wondered why I counseled all my appointments

401
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:42.240
Misty Moncada: And she'll help I counsel everything so they called me. They're like, what's going on, like, why did you, you just went through yourself from all services. And I said, well,

402
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:49.260
Misty Moncada: I don't want to talk about it. Well, she said, missy. Can you please come in. So I went in and told her, I said, Look, it's just the way the doctor made me feel

403
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.420
Misty Moncada: So I guess maybe I should go back in and

404
00:52:55.530 --> 00:53:04.260
Misty Moncada: That was really nice. I've never seen her be so rude. Rude with me or anything like that. And, but maybe she's having a bad day. I don't know.

405
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, when

406
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You go, seeing a different side of it. Yeah, maybe.

407
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:20.370
Misty Moncada: And I didn't see a different side at that one day when I went out of her office because it's a televised, you know, the doctor to televise over there and telco I was just like,

408
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.870
Misty Moncada: Fuck you, like, I really want to talk to you. So I leave out of her office and the nurses, like, Are you done with her. I'm like, No, I don't want to see her again.

409
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:33.960
Misty Moncada: I don't want to see your good so um when I ran out of mental health. It was just like oh like she's really angry.

410
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:41.340
Misty Moncada: But now I'm looking at from a different thing. Maybe she's having a bad day. Maybe she didn't know how to react to some things I said as well because I'm not

411
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:50.550
Misty Moncada: I'm not perfect either. I have a loud mouth, you know. So I'm now that I'm more calm about it and I'm thinking about it. That's something I want to resolve as well.

412
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:58.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would have been helpful in that moment is the belly breathing the 711 that were to give you a time to

413
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:17.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because what happens is because you have this quick response. You had to react quickly because of survival mode quick reaction that you react so quickly. You don't allow yourself to have time to stop pause and reflect that breathing will allow you to do that.

414
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:31.470
Misty Moncada: You're absolutely right. I don't I get so angry. Boom. I'm like, never it's me against the world. Yeah. And like I said, this doctor, Dr. Xu yeah I've never had any issues. I've never so have heard her

415
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:46.620
Misty Moncada: yell at me or anything. She's so soft spoken so that was another thing that I think I'm gonna once all this coronavirus is said and done, I do want to have her be a mediator for us. Yeah, figure out what was going on. So,

416
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When are we meeting again I want to catch

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me what that experience was like for you. And also, if you notice a pattern. Do you notice, maybe more in the mornings, you're a little more angry. You know, there might be a certain time of the day to

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Day emotions.

431
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:08.340
Misty Moncada: Know I'm pretty like I'm not one of those that wakes up in the morning is irritable. I guess it's just when I feel irritated is when I kind of act out

432
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:17.070
Misty Moncada: Yeah, but if I wake up really early in the morning and I'm okay. Then I'm okay. It's just if I get angry or the evening, if I'm angry or just different.

433
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:18.360

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To help you to one apply the skills, that's something that you said is a goal of yours, applying the skills that you're learning it gives you that opportunity to do it. And the good thing about logs is like I said you can catch patterns in your thinking thoughts or feelings so

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We do that the next time we meet. Okay.
