46
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:44.220
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you're back. Okay, so, um, so what this session is just released an information session. This is just be gathering all the data that I'm going to

47
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.410
Richelle Direny: Use for your intake just kind of getting your history.

48
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.280
Ilene: Okay.

49
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.940
Richelle Direny: You know, of just kind of just the history of everything of what is called a bio psychosocial

50
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.690
Richelle Direny: And we determine kind of what your

51
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.970
Richelle Direny: Plan is and then after that we will schedule. Maybe one session, maybe in a month or so.

52
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.810
Just okay

53
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:23.580
Richelle Direny: All right then. So, um, you know, everything for the most part, when we do, even though this is telephone therapy. It is confidential. Everything is it is a recorded session.

54
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.050
Richelle Direny: But it is confidential. So we asked, especially

55
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.850
Richelle Direny: When

56
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.330
Richelle Direny: We're doing expected group and even individual as well.

57
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.720
Ilene: Sorry about that.

58
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.150
Ilene: My daughter granddaughter here and they're trying to figure out why it wasn't answering them.

59
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.390
Richelle Direny: And it's funny because in the middle of me saying, Oh, we're on a recorded session.

60
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.220
Richelle Direny: And then she walks

61
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.080
Ilene: I know, I know.

62
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.690
Richelle Direny: Oh, but I like how you play that off. You just get it.

63
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.290
Ilene: Um,

64
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:21.510
Richelle Direny: But yeah, so you know, generally speaking on the individuals. That's kind of how it is just having are not in the group. So, you know, no one here is kind of what other people are sharing

65
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.500
Ilene: Okay.

66
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.880
Richelle Direny: All right, so if you could get just get started and you can share with me.

67
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.070
Richelle Direny: How did you hear about the

68
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.710
Richelle Direny: Right heart.

69
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.720
Ilene: So I was attending a group through Stanford in person. I had

70
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.870
Ilene: Been in a pain management.

71
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.780
Ilene: Practice for a while trying to

72
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:09.750
Ilene: Trying to manage pain medication. So I was trying to kind of go down in terms of

73
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:18.480
Ilene: What my prescription was, and you know, then I broke my foot. And so I just had a long

74
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:29.910
Ilene: Past getting off of pain medication. And so in July. I started with the Stanford.

75
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.560
Ilene: dual diagnosis clinic and I was going there for depression and for

76
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.410
Ilene: Opioid

77
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.840
Ilene: Addiction.

78
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.990
Ilene: Although they called it

79
00:07:47.130 --> 00:08:00.330
Ilene: A mild addiction. But nevertheless, it was an addiction. So I started going to their group, which was set up very similar similarly to what we're doing now, except it was in person.

80
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:08.550
Ilene: And when I was getting ready to move to California. We kept looking for

81
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.050
Ilene: A similar situation in Tennessee, but we could never and I could never find

82
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.620
Ilene: Anything even close.

83
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:34.620
Ilene: So the therapist. Actually, the medical director of the clinic at Stanford gave me the information for bright heart.

84
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.960
Ilene: For you, for the medical director of the program.

85
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.790
Richelle Direny: At Stanford. Oh, it's like a minute recommending

86
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.810
Richelle Direny: And I'm now. How long were you a part of the group in Stanford.

87
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.730
Or the program.

88
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.280
Ilene: Since July.

89
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:00.960
Richelle Direny: Okay.

90
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.100
Ilene: Last, last July.

91
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.170
Oh,

92
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.300
Richelle Direny: And you

93
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:20.820
Richelle Direny: Now, what if you could just give me a little bit of history, you said you were more addicted to pain medication.

94
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.940
Ilene: I was taking pain medication by prescription

95
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.210
Ilene: But with

96
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.620
Ilene: You know all the stuff out about pain medication.

97
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.090
Ilene: My daughter kept

98
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:49.320
Ilene: encouraging me to, to try and go off it. I, you know, eventually felt like

99
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:57.450
Ilene: It was time my pain wasn't as bad as it had been so I decided to try it.

100
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.560
Ilene: And I never took

101
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.870
Ilene: Anything other than what it was prescribed

102
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:14.790
Ilene: So I never took anything different, or anything else other than what was prescribed to me.

103
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:25.350
Richelle Direny: And what. What got you started on the pain medication, were you in an accident, like what

104
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.740
Ilene: I hope

105
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:39.810
Ilene: Like just a whole series of things happen at once. I had a probably

106
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:54.330
Ilene: spent almost 10 years I had a pacemaker a podium and I had an auto immune reaction to the pacemaker. So I got

107
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.670
Ilene: Very, very sick and I

108
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.450
Ilene: was thought to need a liver transplant, but

109
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:16.140
Ilene: Fortunately, I didn't. I got out of the hospital and I had a horrible.

110
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.670
Ilene: Symptoms of

111
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.560
Ilene: Fibromyalgia type symptoms like horrible ache Enos

112
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.760
Ilene: And then at the same time I had

113
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:50.670
Ilene: Back problems that just seemed to get worse during that whole process. So I had tried just a lot of different things. I tried practice down to see if that would help the fibromyalgia pain.

114
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.500
Ilene: And

115
00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:06.240
Ilene: I took Lyrica to see if that would help and eventually the rheumatologist suggested to me that I try a pain medication.

116
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.790
Ilene: And that's how I started

117
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:17.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you said did you say you were on a liver transplant or no, no, no.

118
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.740
Richelle Direny: Now, um,

119
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.880
Richelle Direny: And how long have long has this been going on.

120
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.020
Ilene: So that all happened about

121
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:46.290
Ilene: 10 years ago. Does the back situation had probably has probably been going on for I would say good to teen years.

122
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.030
Ilene: And

123
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.200
Richelle Direny: But it's always been controlled medication payments.

124
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.790
Richelle Direny: Yes. So you recently when you're at the medical director

125
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:10.230
Richelle Direny: When he referred you to bright heart you recently got introduced to the Suboxone or you were on Suboxone while you were at Stanford.

126
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:17.550
Ilene: I was introduced to this Suboxone treatment while I was at Stanford. Oh.

127
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.560
Ilene: Okay, somebody else's calling in. Let me just get rid of

128
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.860

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.050
iPhone: But hopefully it will come again.

131
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.450
Hold on.

132
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.870
Richelle Direny: Hold on one. Okay.

133
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.290

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.880
Brandon H: I was just signing on to be there when I was ready.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.740
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right.

146
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.110
Richelle Direny: I mean,

147
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.380
Yeah, okay. Sorry about that. I hadn't

149
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:47.790
Okay.

150
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:49.980
iPhone: Yes.

151
00:15:50.100 --> 00:16:01.920
Richelle Direny: I think when your call is coming in the robo call because sometimes what I find with a lot of these robo calls, sometimes your phone picking up. Pick it up as a scam likely and now they're getting

152
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.270
Richelle Direny: Savvy. So now they come in with a number that you think you would know and you want to and

153
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:19.050
iPhone: That's what happened. It came in with a different number two, um, any way I was going to tell you that through the pain management, Doctor, I tried to

154
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:40.110
iPhone: Go down on the pain medication and I got down to a certain point and I felt like I couldn't get past that I just had to me like horrible withdrawal type feelings. I was getting like horrible restlessness.

155
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.200
iPhone: And anxiety and

156
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.200
iPhone: I was working full time. So I just couldn't afford to feel like that.

157
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.510
iPhone: And be working

158
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.350
iPhone: And so I was

159
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.040
iPhone: really afraid to completely go off of it. So,

160
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:19.830
iPhone: My therapist that I was saying at that time was able to get me into Stanford and at Stanford. I started taking the Suboxone and I was easy. I was able pretty

161
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:33.540
iPhone: Quickly to go off the pain medication which I never thought I would be able to. So it was pretty amazing. And I'm on a fairly low dose.

162
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:49.380
iPhone: And for the most part it's helping there's some days that I seem to have some kind of breakthrough feelings, where I start getting getting say um but

163
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.400
iPhone: Like I said, for the most part, it feels like it's working.

171
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.030
iPhone: So I

172
00:18:35.370 --> 00:19:00.930
iPhone: Was short this this weekend. And so what I did is I took like one film I normally take two thirds of a film, but I took one film and I cut it into thirds, so that I, you know, would have enough to get through the weekend and I would say it was pretty uncomfortable. So when I talked to her.

173
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.970

199
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:41.370
iPhone: I did drink before that, but it wasn't where I felt it was a problem and then

200
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.240
iPhone: I think

201
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.820

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.630
iPhone: 15 hour shifts and

205
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.340

Richelle Direny: So how long would you say that you've been clean and sober from the alcohol addiction.

212
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.710
iPhone: Like since 2007 or something like that.

213
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:22.200
Richelle Direny: And now this is and then this was the recent admission into the Stanford clinic and

214
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.260
Richelle Direny: And how long would you say

215
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.350

216
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:36.870

iPhone: For

219
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.290
iPhone: A couple years that I

220
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.530
iPhone: I mean, I didn't really talk about it. Anybody but I felt like it might

221
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:14.940
iPhone: Be a problem because I knew that when I was getting close to the end of the month, you know, or to the end of my prescription. I started to feel kind of anxious. So I just felt that

222
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.360
iPhone: If I'm having those feelings that I

223
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.470

224
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:36.570
Richelle Direny: Okay, and how long would you say since you've gotten to that point where you want to work on managing your payments, where you're not

iPhone: But I am if you if you said

228
00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:06.240
iPhone: Like this weekend when I thought that I wasn't going to be able to have a Suboxone I was just dreading going through that withdrawal feeling

229
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.580
iPhone: So I don't know if I'm answering your question.

230

Right.

434
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.150
iPhone: And if I

435
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:23.580
iPhone: Was able to do whatever I wanted. And had the money to do it. I would not have moved to Tennessee.

436
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.420

438
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:38.070

439
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.750
iPhone: Oh,

440
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.790
Richelle Direny: Well, it was a mutual decision for inviting me to consistency.

441
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.530
iPhone: Yeah.

442
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:51.750
Richelle Direny: Oh. Now, what is your, what would

443
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:59.910
Richelle Direny: In terms of your goals. What would you identify that you would like to work on during your time with bright heart.

444
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:07.860
iPhone: I would like to be able to go off of the soapbox

445
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:19.860
Richelle Direny: Now when you said you would like to come off of the socks on how much time are you giving yourself able to work through

446
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:41.670
Richelle Direny: Those underlining situations or circumstances that led you to the addiction of the pain meds that Pokemon brought to the Suboxone because to come off the Suboxone I would suggest that it's a slow process very disciplined process. But in the meantime, working on

447
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.090
Richelle Direny: You know those underlining core issues.

448
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.780
iPhone: So, you know, I don't have a time frame.

449
00:44:50.700 --> 00:45:10.050
iPhone: I don't want to put myself in a situation like I was this weekend. You know where I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. But, um, you know, I, I just would like to get to a point where I'm, you know, comfortable, without taking anything

450
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.460
iPhone: Oh, so. But again, no no timeframe.

451
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:27.540
Richelle Direny: Timeframe now editor. Okay, so that's at least one goal, which is a pretty distal goal because it's a long term goal, but in terms of a short term goal that leads on

452
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:29.220
iPhone: That long term goal.

453
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:41.850
Richelle Direny: What would you say that your goal when you heard about bright heart and what the program offers. What would your, what would you like to work on for yourself to be able to help you with this process.

454
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.020
Again, so your long term.

455
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:57.510
iPhone: I feel like I was

456
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.880
iPhone: Previously getting a lot of support for

457
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:19.770
iPhone: Moving forward with my goal was then I had just a really good feeling about the support I was getting through Stanford and I actually have a similar feeling right now. It just feels very

458
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:29.670
iPhone: I don't know. It feels good and I like actually having the other week, every other week meeting and that sort of thing.

459
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:42.000
iPhone: My only concern is that this is not covered by my insurance. And so I'm trying to work on that and see

460
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.650
iPhone: If there's any way that can be possible.

461
00:46:47.700 --> 00:47:00.990
iPhone: But I guess what I want is just to be supported as I go through kind of a new life, you know, a new living situation.

462
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.740
iPhone: A new situation.

463
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.780

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:32.940

469
00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:33.780

470
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.580
iPhone: Okay.

471
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:45.390
Richelle Direny: Um, so, maybe, so if you did therapy would have to be a private page just like the group session on

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.380
Yeah.

473
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.820
Richelle Direny: Okay.

475
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:22.710
Richelle Direny: I'm a firm believer. And what's this about Suboxone therapy alone. It's not quite effective if you're not working, especially if your plan is to eventually maybe a year or two or three down the line that you want to be able to taper off of the medication.

476
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:29.430
Richelle Direny: I definitely I'm a big advocate of

477
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:44.160
Richelle Direny: Doing individual to work on those core issues because, you know, when you think about your history of the alcohol being addicted to alcohol, something was going on.

478
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:59.310
Richelle Direny: In your past that got you to whether it was you were introduced through it through social through socializing and then you liked it or was it because of relational issues because you also had

479
00:48:59.340 --> 00:48:59.910
The law.

480
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:06.210
Richelle Direny: Years ago, when you have to come. He said that you do last one child right

481
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:07.890
iPhone: Yes.

482
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.890
Richelle Direny: Okay. And would you say that the depression started after that, or you have the depression prior

483
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:22.320
iPhone: I would say is, you know, it totally escalated after that.

484
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.080
Richelle Direny: It escalated after the depression.

485
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.150
iPhone: So, yes, yes.

486
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.520
Richelle Direny: They did drinking start after

487
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:30.270
Richelle Direny: That

488
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.210
Richelle Direny: Part of the escalation after you lost that child.

489
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.110
Yes.

490
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.130
Richelle Direny: And it is never had any

491
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:46.470
Richelle Direny: You've never had any therapy during that time refund loss therapy or any kind of counseling during that time.

492
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.110
iPhone: Oh, I had quite a bit.

493
00:49:49.740 --> 00:50:03.450
Richelle Direny: Old now. Did you have relation, like when you say quite a bit with some of it included like relationship between with you and your husband to go through like the grieving process of the loss.

494
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.060
iPhone: No.

495
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.730
Richelle Direny: It was always just you.

496
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:18.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, okay. So, I mean, even, you know, granted, you said that you did have quite a bit of therapy, but even now.

497
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:29.820
Richelle Direny: Having to pretty much uproot your life. And even though. Yes, it's nice kind of looking at the silver lining. You're living with your son, your I mean your daughter and your

498
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:46.650
Richelle Direny: Your son in law in your granddaughter, you're still, like you said, having to uproot your whole life and move the whole nother state and so circumstances rounding why you had to move and having to readjust your life. So there's still that within itself.

499
00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.170
Richelle Direny: Could make one fall into a depression.

500
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:57.030
Richelle Direny: Yeah box alone alone won't necessarily treat them.

501
00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:08.730
Richelle Direny: And that's why I believe in, not only are you on the Suboxone therapy, but you're on the maintenance program, but you're also talk therapy because through talk therapy.

502
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:16.920
Richelle Direny: Will help you to learn the coping skills, be able to identify what those underlying issues are what came about, where were in

503
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:29.280
Richelle Direny: You know, kind of looking at the timeline as to when you lost full control over your life, being able to apply, apply effective coping skills in the senior hour of neat or so.

504
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:41.850
Richelle Direny: And Suboxone only helps with the cravings. It helps like with the pain management because I know part of your thing was the pain management, it only keeps you stable, but that's all it does.

505
00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:51.600
Richelle Direny: Point in time. The Suboxone which is a bandaid to your real issues will have to be removed and

506
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:59.640
Richelle Direny: Mark zone over time. You just become a used to having the band aid over the room.

507
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.450
Yeah.

508
00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:10.140
Richelle Direny: Or without actually allowing the wound to heal. We just take my band aid and just put it over it because we don't

509
00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:10.500
iPhone: Yeah.

510
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.580
We're looking

511
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:18.930
Richelle Direny: So I would definitely you know recommend, whether it's like I said outpatient or whether you check in.

512
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:33.660
Richelle Direny: With you know here and we meet once a month, it's really up to you, but I understand financial strain, you know, know I know the financial part of it is a big factor. So, you know, I will just leave it up to you, but I would definitely recommend that

513
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:34.710
Okay.

514
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:55.830
Richelle Direny: But, you know, of course, in group therapy in the group individual therapy that's also an added bonus, in a part of the program is to do your every other week. Individual therapy and what I know with Dr. We talked through these Dr. Jamison is a big

515
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:56.070
Big

516
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:08.220
Richelle Direny: Doing the Suboxone maintenance program as well as the individual, whether you're doing it through us or outpatient she definitely advocates for the Olsen as

517
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.740
One can truly be successful.

518
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:20.430
Richelle Direny: With. It's like, I want to be a doctor, but then you have to eat, but you don't want to study, you have to do both in order to become a successful doctor right

519
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:21.090
So,

520
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:37.470
Richelle Direny: I'm be able to take her off the Suboxone and independent of any substances or any replacement substance in order to the independent of them and be successful. You have to work the program.

521
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:49.320
Richelle Direny: Authentically how it's created being on the maintenance program as well as doing psychotherapy, the two combined can only lead to success. Well,

522
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.930
Richelle Direny: It's not really going into

523
00:53:53.100 --> 00:54:07.740
Richelle Direny: So, but, yeah, I'm going to leave it up to you. I would recommend if you did it once we could do it once a month, we can meet once a month. If not, you find someone in the community, whatever, you know, makes you feel comfortable is what I would recommend

524
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:12.540
iPhone: So I think the once a month works for me right now.

525
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:22.320
iPhone: And meanwhile, I can try to see if there's somebody identified identify in the community. Okay.

526
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.090
One more.

527
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:29.220
Time.

528
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:52.050
Richelle Direny: What days and times are

529
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.470
Best

530
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.030
iPhone: Pretty open right now.

531
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.790
iPhone: Monday always feels good. If that works for you.

532
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.040
Richelle Direny: Monday.

533
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.560
iPhone: Yeah.

534
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.870
Okay, so

535
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.680
Richelle Direny: We could do the

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:43.650

541
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.490
Richelle Direny: A program in the community that

542
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.790
iPhone: Okay, okay. Yeah, that sounds good.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:37.260

Richelle Direny: So what's new. What's going on, you're staying

568
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:52.020
Richelle Direny: Safe

569
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.630
Brandon H: Yeah. Stay now trouble.

570
00:58:56.310 --> 00:59:02.460
Richelle Direny: How is it with your I know you only have the one guy that you work with on third shift. So there's no scare there for you.

571
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.600
Brandon H: Yeah, he had a cold like a real cool like is like Bronco infection.

572
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:22.440
Brandon H: And had a Bronco, I would say, but it was like a throat was ROSIE. Rosie, sore throat, and Israel congestion. His voice was down to come to the stack here, and instead he don't have a coronavirus so

573
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:27.210
Richelle Direny: He said that you they brought him in to get him testing.

574
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:33.840
Brandon H: They took them a stat care of the got the other staff said that he didn't have the coronavirus I'm sure they prayed testing and board.

575
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.980
Brandon H: He would infer a sore throat and raspy voice.

576
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.500
Oh,

577
00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:49.110
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, well, that's good. But so he just had the regular cold or flu.

578
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:51.750
Brandon H: As

579
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:57.120
Brandon H: Far as we know, I don't know how it works is that can turn into the coronavirus or

580
00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:05.280
Richelle Direny: Oh no, I doubt that that will be something new. If that turns into the coronavirus that you have a whole new set of fear running around here.

581
01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:06.750
Yeah.

582
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:17.070
Brandon H: I looked into the coronavirus basically it turns into pneumonia is what gets people and it's such a strong pneumonia their immune system can get rid of it and the

583
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:19.710
Brandon H: Latest

584
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:39.540
Richelle Direny: Well, that's for people who are medically compromised already so it's kind of like if you had an upper respiratory issue or you had underlining medical issues pre existing medical issues and you've got the you've got the coronavirus which it sounds to me version of the flu.

585
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:48.630
Richelle Direny: That's kind of where it becomes fail, but then even the flu can become fatal if you have underlining medical issues as well.

586
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:54.840
Brandon H: Yeah I seen it on when I did. What did I do it in a safe hundreds of thousand people die from the regular flu each year.

587
01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:09.930
Richelle Direny: Exactly so. I mean, as much as it's a new the coronavirus is new. And as much as they're still trying to research to find out a vaccine for it and how they can help. Whether it's preventing or

588
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:15.810
Richelle Direny: You know, at the end of the day, it's still the flu is still more dangerous than anything else.

589
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:23.070
Richelle Direny: Because I mean, when you have the flu, you know, because it knocks you out. You can't move. You can't do anything. Yeah.

590
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:41.100
Richelle Direny: You're, you're not going anywhere. You can you sleep all day. You just cannot move when you have the flu. But again, those are for the most part, a lot of that is for people who have. That's why the death toll are a lot more for the elderly and for people who, again, has

591
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:57.210
Richelle Direny: Children adults young adults. Anyone who already has a pre existing medical condition they are more susceptible. So the fatality. Also, the disease or you know this. Yeah, the disease. So

592
01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.520
Brandon H: I said to take excessive amounts of vitamin C helps to ward that up to

593
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.300
Richelle Direny: Well, I guess you're going to be buying a whole lot of oranges.

594
01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:10.860
Brandon H: Now, I just, I had a blend of vital vitamin C. I'm taking like five on Monday.

595
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.530
Richelle Direny: Oh wow, well, I'd be you also do like so much of anything is not good for you.

596
01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:23.340
Brandon H: Know, actually, vitamin C, they said you can't get enough of it, you can take three, four or 5000 milligrams a day and will harm you.

597
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.510
Richelle Direny: You really

598
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.070
Brandon H: Yeah well attended

599
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:34.050
Brandon H: I researched it. Yeah, it just popped up as vitamin C was a helpful against coronavirus and I read all into it. You can't overdose on Vitamin C.

600
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.650
Richelle Direny: Okay, was it can't overdose. I mean, you know, they told

601
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.370
Brandon H: People

602
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:44.490
Brandon H: Are getting injections in England, they're getting shots of it, like, super powered shots of vitamin C.

603
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.540
Brandon H: A lot of money but

604
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.260
Brandon H: America present to a lot of money.

605
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:59.610
Richelle Direny: Wow. I mean, but again, I still believe in too much of anything is not necessarily good because you know we're all we're all uniquely created

606
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.610
Richelle Direny: And no one knows exactly how our body functions fully 100%

607
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.610
Brandon H: Well, the only side effect is you might have, like, you have to go the restroom more than usual.

608
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.400
Richelle Direny: There you go. So he probably caused

609
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.630
Brandon H: The side effect. I mean, Rama consummate person. Anyway, so in America.

610
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:24.330
Brandon H: I'm constipated, as it is even before I took the box on this stuff, so

611
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:26.490
Brandon H: Since I was a kid.

612
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:38.970
Richelle Direny: And so that's the other thing. So, you know, that's something that you can even speak with you know whether it's your medical provider Natalie or whomever to talk about like being on the the Suboxone

613
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.320
Are you on any other medical

614
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:52.860
Richelle Direny: You know, can you taking all of this vitamin C, you know, can interact with anything because though they're saying for a normal, healthy person with no medical issues.

615
01:03:53.370 --> 01:04:04.860
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen, you can take as much vitamin C, but then for the person was medically compromised already can taking a lot of Vitamin C can that affects you know asking those questions because

616
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:13.500
Brandon H: What they say that is nothing but good. There's a research it to death. And there's nothing but good from wait and see.

617
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:14.700
Brandon H: That

618
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:22.470
Brandon H: It doesn't it say almost all mammals, besides humans produce vitamin C, naturally. That's why animals don't get sick and stuff.

619
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:24.120
Richelle Direny: Gotcha.

620
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:28.440
Brandon H: They actually produce vitamin C, naturally, we're one of the few mammals, it don't

Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm always whoa okay okay

624
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.450
Brandon H: But for the most part, you know,

625
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.910
Richelle Direny: But for the most part, you're mostly indoors. Right. You don't really go out, a lot of them seem like it.

626
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:55.080
Brandon H: Right. But I just want to be because she's been in a DD field and those guys. They always seem susceptible to colds and flu and stuff.

627
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.140
Brandon H: And the top that cold pretty bad. He was

628
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.380
Brandon H: He was out. He's usually pretty good about so he was bawling. His eyes out to me the 91st got it.

629
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:11.850
Brandon H: He was in bistro economic. It started with bright going to collapse because he was his, his voice was bad.

630
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:14.580
Okay.

631
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.830
Richelle Direny: Who is this

632
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.860
Brandon H: My individual for work.

633
01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:25.020
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, you say he has the school really bad.

634
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.650
Brandon H: Now it's more of a like, I don't know, like that, sore throat, congestion.

635
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:40.230
Brandon H: Okay, when really the flu. He was able to go to work. This is his voice was almost gone overnight.

636
01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.030
You know,

637
01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.980
Brandon H: As long as you don't turn pneumonia. I'm not worried about it.

638
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:55.050
Richelle Direny: I mean, again, there's, I mean, and then also the weather seems to be kind of up and down as well. So there's just so many different

639
01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:56.850
Brandon H: And he goes outside and shorts and

640
01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:05.850
Brandon H: When it's cold out. I told my wife. I told him when he have his Grandma You gotta dress for the one other costs, you probably costs. You didn't get this cold.

641
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:20.730
Richelle Direny: Yes. So, you know, there's just so many different factors that people just take advantage of, like, you know, you get sick. I mean, like you said, you can't be out in the cold in shorts walking up and down and think that young

642
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:29.400
Richelle Direny: Man, you're not the invisible boy. I mean, you know, there's so many different factors. So we have to be very cautious about that.

643
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:38.880
Richelle Direny: And the things that we listened to and we hear you know you have to really like you said, do your due diligence in identifying like okay what are all of the components.

644
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:55.770
Richelle Direny: That make up this like what was going on, like, what are all of the factors that led up to this is one thing, but I mean, you definitely want to be able to keep me mindful keeping proper hygiene coronavirus good no coronavirus you want to keep proper hygiene.

645
01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:05.850
Brandon H: Yeah, I agree. I think it's a big scare mostly, like you said, is for children and elderly adults and people have already had problems are the ones that risk.

646
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:19.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah, there are more at risk than a healthy a healthy individual they're more at risk because their immune system already come to people that their immune system is already compromised, like I said, a flu for them can be just as deadly

647
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:20.970
Brandon H: Yeah.

648
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:24.480
Richelle Direny: System is already compromised. So anything that means

649
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:35.370
Richelle Direny: It's gonna, you know, very a big impact. It's kind of like if you're I learned this some time ago, like if you're on hospice year you have

650
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:48.990
Richelle Direny: You have cancer or let's just say, and you're on hospice and you know they can't do anything for you, somebody comes and gives you a coal, guess what, now you die. Was it the cancer that killed you. Or was it the flu that killed you.

651
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.140
Brandon H: Don't say the flu did it.

652
01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:59.790
Richelle Direny: Because that was the newest thing and that was the newest complication. So that's what else it took you out. Nevermind that you've

653
01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:09.480
Richelle Direny: Already on hospice and dying of cancer. It's the flu. So what did they tell you you died of the flu, simply because the flu. Was that final thing that came in.

654
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.120
Richelle Direny: And kind of shut everything down.

655
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:31.950
Richelle Direny: So, and that's kind of how the corona viruses. They're not telling you that these people already was already on their dying bed and other things was going on. They just say, oh, it's a flu. So then everyone gets nervous and saying, Hey, but hey, that's my, that's my rant.

656
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:37.860
Brandon H: Yeah, actually, Ohio is shut down all restaurants and bars because you know they do carry out

657
01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.670
Richelle Direny: Everywhere. That's not just Ohio everywhere.

658
01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.920
Brandon H: Everywhere. Everywhere.

659
01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.790
Brandon H: On Ohio things I'm in Ohio. I didn't know I did everywhere. Yeah.

660
01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.630
Richelle Direny: Everywhere. If you look at if you go on the CD.

661
01:08:52.770 --> 01:09:03.930
Richelle Direny: You go on their website and you they have like a map of the United States. Mm hmm. When you click on they haven't color coded and based on the color coding of the map. It tells you how many

662
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.880
Richelle Direny: documented cases of the coronavirus

663
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:16.380
Richelle Direny: And he, but then nationally. Remember the President I think on Friday, he declared a national emergency

664
01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.360
Brandon H: Really

665
01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:37.770
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So because of that schools are closed for two weeks. Um, they they they suspended, a lot of things, then that's just nationwide. It's not, it's not just for the states nationwide. They spend schools they suspended on places of worship.

666
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:52.710
Richelle Direny: They are recommended that people don't travel outside the US they shut down cruise ships. I mean, restaurants, there are encouraging that you don't go to anywhere for with gatherings over 50 people

667
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.840
Richelle Direny: Just to kind of

668
01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.250
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's kind of like some degree there quarantining everyone so they can get ahold of

669
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.880
Brandon H: You know what's going on. Yeah.

670
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.670

Yeah.

672
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:33.210
Richelle Direny: No, I would just recommend that, in the future, like when, if you're not going to be able to make it group like

673
01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.940
Richelle Direny: If you're not feeling well, if you just kind of shoot send us send the message.

Mom.

722
01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:45.540
Richelle Direny: Okay. So since we last met. I know the last time that we met individually. We touched a little bit on um

723
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:48.600
Richelle Direny: You know, you talked about

724
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:56.850
Richelle Direny: Talks about you identified in the character traits of your parents, you talked about

725
01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:16.800
Richelle Direny: You know, Christianity, like kind of your happy place. But then, and why you stepped away and kind of how that was so um, is there anything that you want to share like since the last time we've met. Did you, you know, is there anything that's new that has changed that he was implemented.

726
01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:24.060
Brandon H: Well, I want I'm gonna do laundry Sunday.

727
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:33.480
Brandon H: And just gonna get into it about politics, my parents. I forget how they brought it up, but they're a TRUMP FAN. I'm not

728
01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:35.610
Brandon H: So,

729
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:44.820
Brandon H: They really can push a republican stuff towards me and I don't accept it very nicely kind of in the middle, then I kind of lean more towards a conservative Democrat.

730
01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:48.720
Brandon H: Might have complete liberal I allow

731
01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:54.450
Brandon H: People are people's way I looked at. I don't put certain groups of people down or anything.

732
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.040
Richelle Direny: So you say you went to the laundry with them.

733
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:05.490
Brandon H: Yeah, hit their limit. Mr. Nicholas they sold her home. Recently, the one I was in for a lot of years with them.

734
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.380
So,

735
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:14.070
Brandon H: I'm kind of glad it is so because I spent so many years there when I was using drugs. It was ridiculous.

736
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:15.450
Richelle Direny: So,

737
01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:19.050
Brandon H: Childhood memories. It was memories of doing drugs.

738
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.850
Richelle Direny: So you think that was a good move for them.

739
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:30.540
Brandon H: Yeah, I hope everybody out they need to downsize, and everybody needs to let go of that place and

740
01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:33.270
Brandon H: Move into their own new things.

741
01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.210
Richelle Direny: Now is it closer to where you are.

742
01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:48.180
Brandon H: Nervous about a couple miles from where they used to be. There is that my uncle's house for temporarily so they buy a new home, or they might build as well. And it's brand new Bible a lot Minerva

743
01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:59.970
Brandon H: They might build a ranch or buy a ranch MY BROTHER LIVES ON like Mohawk which is like a huge lake and a huge community of mostly upper middle class and beyond.

744
01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:05.160
Brandon H: And they have a lot of ranch homes there, they might move there, which is just

745
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.390
Brandon H: 10 minutes from a nerve. So they're they're saying the same area.

746
01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:14.280
Richelle Direny: YOU ALL YOU SAY YOUR PARENTS main is close to where your brother is

747
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:20.310
Brandon H: They might move to LA mo gets is a huge community outside of Melbourne.

748
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:27.450
Brandon H: Big huge lake and there's I mean there's million dollar homes, there's regular homes or summer homes. There's all kinds of things out there.

749
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.180
Richelle Direny: And so you're gonna know how far away. Would that be from you.

750
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:36.960

Brandon H: He said he might try and make it, but I never heard back. So I didn't work outside the kids would enjoy seeing spider man.

781
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.350
Richelle Direny: Oh,

782
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:25.440
Richelle Direny: So you think like what is what is for you at this juncture of your life at this point in your sobriety in what you're working for. What is it that you would like to

783
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:33.480
Richelle Direny: What would, what is it that you would like to see different in your life that will help you because I do see

784
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.940
Brandon H: A History of the question.

785
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:46.380
Brandon H: Yeah, I haven't been really depressed lately I joined Planet Fitness and it's haven't got down. I'm gonna get it. They have free physical trainers. I think so.

786
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.120
Brandon H: My get hooked up with one of them just to get me going.

787
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.850
Brandon H: Let's get the get go on with it.

788
01:22:55.470 --> 01:23:00.810
Brandon H: Is Mr. You get shave them over way don't feel very confident my logs right now.

789
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:06.690
Brandon H: And it is when you work out and make sure that he'd be holding the level of confidence.

790
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.760
Richelle Direny: You said, what was the last part level of why

791
01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:17.310
Brandon H: A lot of confidence.

792
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.170
Brandon H: Again, it makes you feel good about yourself.

793
01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.830
Richelle Direny: So you think your confidence level is a really low.

794
01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:31.110
Brandon H: It's not as low as it has been in the past. I mean, I'm getting more confident, who I am just want to get more

795
01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:33.720
Brandon H: Competent my whole self.

796
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:46.350
Richelle Direny: And in your mind. What is your idea of what does confidence will quiet for you because sometimes our expectation and make us think that, you know, could create what we think it should look like.

797
01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:47.790
Brandon H: Well,

798
01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:56.730
Brandon H: And we should add sweet stuff you know I lay around a lot. That's not going to create much good stuff.

799
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:07.920
Richelle Direny: I know one of the things that we talked about before in one of our session was your you somewhat isolate because you feel

800
01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:13.200
Richelle Direny: You're not good at socializing and in the past.

801
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.280
Brandon H: I think

802
01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.570
Richelle Direny: Under the influence that was what helped you to kind of

803
01:24:19.050 --> 01:24:20.640
Richelle Direny: It helps your social anxiety.

804
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:24.540
Brandon H: Yeah, that's one of the main problems it

805
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:26.820
Richelle Direny: Is your social anxiety.

806
01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.180
Richelle Direny: Is it that you fear being accepted amongst your peer group.

807
01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:34.560
Uh huh.

808
01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:42.570
Brandon H: I usually am wild accepted running buddy I hang out with people like me, but I don't like myself or well

809
01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:44.160
Richelle Direny: You don't like your

810
01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:48.060
Brandon H: Work always worried you know that I'm not good enough or

811
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:52.920
Brandon H: I'm on the right thinking track or I'm not

812
01:24:54.210 --> 01:24:56.940
Brandon H: I don't notice where I'm worse enemy when it comes to that.

813
01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:01.620
Brandon H: I psychoanalyze myself to death. I don't do it as much as I used to.

814
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:09.300
Brandon H: But I used to sit and analyze myself with the psychology and learn in college and just tear myself apart.

815
01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:23.370
Richelle Direny: What you said a lot of that that lack of self confidence and the social anxiety has always been there since you were a kid, right.

816
01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:24.870
Yeah.

817
01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.040
Brandon H: People always writes me a hell on friends from school and

818
01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:32.670
Brandon H: All that stuff was popular

819
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:36.270
Brandon H: In high school was easy. I got good grades.

820
01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:39.060
Brandon H: I was honor society.

821
01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:44.940
Brandon H: Been football party hung out with kids were smart.

822
01:25:46.680 --> 01:26:01.710
Brandon H: Nice LD kids, nice to everybody college and is really went out there. They're Lana was Jennings that really changes your whole. It's hard to explain it. There's no other drug that will change you like a hallucinogenic. Whoa, especially acid.

823
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:08.730
Brandon H: That causes that drip. I was talking about last time in the back of your spine and nobody else has unless you've done acid.

824
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:16.350
Brandon H: So what's your pin down your spine is brain fluid you snap your back the wrong way. You can flash into an acid trip and never come out of it.

825
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:19.620
Brandon H: For real.

826
01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:30.990
Brandon H: You know I never had that happen but I tripped over a lot of dumb stuff for a long time that if I hadn't done it as a prayer wouldn't be, you know,

827
01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:34.650
Done that.

828
01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:43.500
Richelle Direny: What is your eyes. So in your mind. What is your idea of a good time are fun, or what you

829
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.800
Richelle Direny: On outside of your home.

830
01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:55.860
Brandon H: I really don't have openings right now. I wanted me to lift And maybe I'll socialize there. Hopefully me some people

831
01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:58.710
Brandon H: Nothing.

832
01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.200
Brandon H: Huh.

833
01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:03.150
Richelle Direny: He said, That's why you want to get were

834
01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:11.640
Brandon H: To the Planet Fitness because it might might help me and socializing being around others going the same thing. And maybe talk to some people.

835
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:14.730
Go to the gym.

836
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:19.710
Richelle Direny: Or you go to their class one of the classes at the gym now.

837
01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:25.230
Brandon H: I need to get a physical trainer I signed up and paid all the money into it and the monthly fees like $10 but

838
01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.040
Brandon H: I just haven't got down there and got down to brass tacks here with it.

839
01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:32.670
Richelle Direny: So what's stopping what's keeping you from going down there.

840
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:36.960
Brandon H: Laziness anxiety.

841
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:38.910
Brandon H: Just

842
01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:44.040
Brandon H: Putting it off saying, well, it's already halfway through this week. Oh, we're starting next week.

843
01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.180
Richelle Direny: What would you say you're anxious about when it comes on to

844
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:54.360
Brandon H: What are you anxious about socializing well

845
01:27:57.210 --> 01:28:00.960
Brandon H: When you don't have to go there and talk to anybody, but I'd like to be able to be sociable, at least.

846
01:28:02.130 --> 01:28:05.250
Richelle Direny: Well, what about one to one of the classes at the gym.

847
01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:12.510
Brandon H: I don't know, I might try that out. I think about getting a personal trainer to and

848
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:17.340
Brandon H: Kind of, they might introduce me to people that are in the same track. I'm in or

849
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:30.720
Brandon H: I don't know, they might have a class that I'm interested in. I haven't looked, I haven't got there I signed it once before. I only went twice, but this time I'm going to try to get serious about it. I have no other options you have to do something.

850
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.350
Richelle Direny: So I'm going to challenge you that maybe

851
01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:44.130
Richelle Direny: The end. We could talk about like maybe identifying one barrier. Yeah.

852
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:47.220
Richelle Direny: Like so, like when we talked about, like,

853
01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:57.180
Richelle Direny: When we talk about now is it seems like you are you isolate a lot, don't you, you don't really go anywhere. You just pretty much working home.

854
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:59.790
Brandon H: For the most part, yeah.

855
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:08.340
Brandon H: I want to get back to walk in the park last spring. When I was an insurance program. I started walking the parks around areas, a lot of Parks and Kim.

856
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:18.210
Brandon H: And the surrounding areas. I was walking in my lost weight and was feeling better about myself and walked every day for like three months or four months.

857
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:23.130
Brandon H: And I got real hot. Oh, no sweat so bad as what walking

858
01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:29.580
Richelle Direny: Well, I know, I know when it's hot outside, it's very discouraging to go out there and

859
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.430
Brandon H: And suddenly I was I sweat easily. I was drenched right time I walked a mile.

860
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:44.310
Richelle Direny: What but then that's a good thing because if you're sweating. It means that you're burning calories, aren't you huh

861
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:46.560
Brandon H: Yeah, but it just

862
01:29:48.210 --> 01:30:01.590
Brandon H: I was this get discouraged with it because I was a mess. Last time I got home, we know when the sprinters nice out when it's not too hot. You can walk and not really break a sweat like it when it's like that.

863
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:03.600
Richelle Direny: So what about

864
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.540
Richelle Direny: What time do you get off work.

865
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:15.660
Richelle Direny: So what about, like, after you get off work going to the gym straight from work for like an hour.

866
01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.730
Brandon H: It may not be my plan is. That's right.

867
01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:18.450
Exactly.

868
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:23.550
Brandon H: To do right after work that way. There's no excuse. And I get seven to one in the morning.

869
01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:32.940
Richelle Direny: Just go in the morning, go to maybe one of the if they have like a really early class, um, cuz sometimes these gyms, they have classes.

870
01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:34.800
Brandon H: Yeah.

871
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:42.720
Brandon H: Yeah, they do. They have yoga. No, no physical, they have a new dancing stuff that but

872
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.900
Brandon H: They certainly have I'd be interested in

873
01:30:48.840 --> 01:31:08.670
Richelle Direny: So maybe you could look into the gym that you go to, uh huh. See, when they have the classes that they offer and challenge yourself maybe going one time before I next session that you'll go at least one time to see what it's all about. And then you can share here.

874
01:31:08.670 --> 01:31:08.880
Brandon H: What

875
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:09.990
Was like

876
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:14.340
Brandon H: Yeah I plan to be there. I was going to go today and I overslept.

877
01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:21.210
Brandon H: Tomorrow, a mop. But as I go down, or anytime goddess up to get my membership cards already signed up online, and then

878
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:32.520
Brandon H: Ask them about personal trainers and then they'll get a sheet of stuff for their classes. They can be last time, see if there's anything I want to sign up for some manner that first time I got to get to where

879
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:35.250
Brandon H: The first time I heard is

880
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:41.190
Richelle Direny: So what what stature, you said that you were tired. That's why you didn't go the last time he wants to go.

881
01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:50.670
Brandon H: Well, Monday is like my first day of freedom. I know I don't have to work the next that night so Talladega a Saturday morning for me. Monday morning.

882
01:31:51.960 --> 01:32:00.780
Brandon H: I mean, I work Sunday night, but when I get out Monday morning. I have two days of freedom. So I don't, I kind of love it as my weekend.

883
01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:08.640
Richelle Direny: No, you said that they pretty much at your job they pay you to sleep. So you get some sleep at your job right.

884
01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:12.570
Brandon H: Yeah, usually actually pretty decent not always usually

885
01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:15.120
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then

886
01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:25.890
Richelle Direny: Okay, but it's not too, too, you're basically saying it's not too, too, tiring. After you get off work for you to go

887
01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:32.550
Brandon H: Back and say, I actually am obering a friend of mine, son. He works in Canton and Elizabeth alliance.

888
01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:44.040
Brandon H: Four days a week now or after work, and then two days, I have to get up on my own. See where he needs to be Tuesday and Wednesday, which I'm off. So I'm going to be getting up at 6am every day of the week now.

889
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:49.920
Brandon H: You're going to get the extra money.

890
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:55.320
Richelle Direny: Also, when you leave, you're going to be going somewhere else to work. You're saying

891
01:32:55.950 --> 01:33:01.260
Brandon H: No to pick somebody go from work to take them to their home and he pays me to move room.

892
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:03.540
Richelle Direny: Oh,

893
01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:09.360
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then after that, maybe you could try. One thing you got every day.

894
01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:20.790
Brandon H: I'm doing it Tuesday through Friday so even my days off. I'm saying I'll be still been getting up at 6am because Tuesday and Wednesday normally don't have to get up, but now I do

895
01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:23.940
Richelle Direny: So,

896
01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.350
Richelle Direny: But then with the gym everything there is continuous.

897
01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:45.360
Brandon H: Yeah I know if I get into that going in at 6am, the least five days. Even the days about lifting I go in, do a treadmill or a bicycle or something. After I do my obering and so that's my plan exactly how you you started out, I thought it out that way to

898
01:33:46.980 --> 01:34:01.200
Brandon H: It makes most sense. Because then I have no excuse. If I go straight from work or straight from, you know, straight there after I'm done with everything that I have no excuse. And I haven't done in my sleep. Most today, Alicia did some. Mm hmm.

899
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.950
Brandon H: But my plan.

900
01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:15.690
Richelle Direny: But I just want you to be able to just think, you know, if you do it. Let's say you know you pick a day you go. The first time you see how that feels.

901
01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:32.190
Richelle Direny: Like outside of the ring and everything else. What would stop you. Like, what part of your anxiety when you think about the idea of having to push yourself to go to the gym and stay there for these 20 to 30 minutes well

902
01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:39.420
Brandon H: I worry about, you know, the more I meet people are less sociable, I get

903
01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:43.440
Brandon H: I'm not really good was in depth.

904
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:57.780
Brandon H: I'm not really good at fake friends. You know, I have some friends or family that I talked to. But as for the icing and just casual conversation, getting to know people on as acquaintances. I'm not good at.

905
01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:07.890
Richelle Direny: Do you think that some of it is part of how you created in your mind like you feel obligated to say more than the required amount of things that one needs to say

906
01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.610
Brandon H: Yeah, I'm not a big talker, unless I really know somebody in

907
01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:21.690
Brandon H: Me know if I know sometimes equations is high, but I don't really want to be s about anything man may improve on that at the gym. I don't know.

908
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:26.730
Richelle Direny: But remember the gym. You're really not talking to anybody.

909
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:38.460
Brandon H: Well, I mean, they're here if you did here at the same time with somebody else or like five other people are kind of get to know each other is at least passing by. You might talk to people eventually

910
01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.800
Richelle Direny: Remember, you're going to the team for your health. So to work out. Do you want me to talk to anybody.

911
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:47.160
Brandon H: Want to see anybody. Yeah, you're right. I don't have to speak to anyone but

912
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:53.640
Richelle Direny: I'm not the only person that you may have to get in conversation with is maybe the, um,

913
01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:57.900
Richelle Direny: What does it call the trainer.

914
01:35:57.930 --> 01:35:59.760
Brandon H: Trainer. Yeah, they have free

915
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:05.610
Richelle Direny: And your, your conversations. There are very intentional. It's very

916
01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:06.750
Brandon H: Very normal. Yeah.

917
01:36:08.190 --> 01:36:11.340
Brandon H: That'd be a normal conversation. Yeah, I won't have to be a slaughter.

918
01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.660
Brandon H: Do you think that it's not good. A casual conversation. I don't

919
01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:16.980
Brandon H: Know why I'm just not good at it.

920
01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:25.050
Richelle Direny: Do you think that's some of your anxiety. Maybe it's how you see yourself in comparison to how much you

921
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:29.760
Brandon H: Guys don't like to be yes. I don't like to

922
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.880
Brandon H: Talk about an awesome I'm not good at. I don't like it.

923
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:34.530
Richelle Direny: But how

924
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:39.180
Richelle Direny: How do you see yourself.

925
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:43.110
Brandon H: I see myself as a quiet person is nice and

926
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:47.190
Brandon H: I'm a nice kind, caring, giving person who

927
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:53.400
Brandon H: I know easily get mission news to people take advantage of the Kindness. Kindness is a weakness.

928
01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:55.710
Richelle Direny: But then

929
01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:10.530
Richelle Direny: Outside of the the kind giving person when you stand and you look in the mirror. What do you see, who do you see, are you happy with the person that you see. Are you satisfied with the person that you see.

930
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:15.630
Brandon H: No cuz I'm not living out my full potential. And I know that

931
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:21.750
Brandon H: I'm not even close, not even halfway there.

932
01:37:22.650 --> 01:37:27.660
Richelle Direny: But if you see yourself that way, then you're going to see the world around you CZ the same way.

933
01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.330
Brandon H: You're right. I do.

934
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:51.000
Richelle Direny: So that's a, you have to start with the way you see yourself because the word of the Ranger sees you just, you know, exactly like I see. But then if you see yourself as unworthy. If you see yourself as someone who, you know, if you're if you're a

935
01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:54.540
Richelle Direny: Where are where our own biggest critic.

936
01:37:56.310 --> 01:38:07.860
Richelle Direny: And if you're judging who you are your capabilities and if you're doing all of that, then you're going to think the world around you and see you the same way. And so that's where you come from.

937
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:14.760
Brandon H: I guess I'm to the point where I'm starting to not care as much as what the world thinks of me. I just gotta do.

938
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:17.430
Brandon H: I gotta follow through with it.

939
01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:23.220
Brandon H: I mean, here he says I want was, but I still have those tendencies.

940
01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:36.960
Richelle Direny: You still have the remnants of it in the tendencies and that's fine because, I mean, if you've been anxious for the last 30 years. I can tell you right now, I can promise you this, you ain't gonna get rid of that anxiety in the next 10 minutes right you're

941
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.040
Richelle Direny: Taken it's taken 30 years to perfect

942
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:43.290
Brandon H: Actually 40

943
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:46.830
Brandon H: Actually 40

944
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:49.650
Richelle Direny: There you go. It's taken 40

945
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.630
Brandon H: Even nervous and kindergarten. I remember it.

946
01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:57.600
Brandon H: Was an intellect and really sit, but just learn to adapt.

947
01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:06.810
Richelle Direny: Well, if it's taken 40 years so perfect. There's no way you're going to get rid of that sense of anxiety and you know the

948
01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:09.210
Brandon H: Time. It's kind of

949
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.220
Brandon H: An effort in

950
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:27.120
Brandon H: Time and make an effort. I don't make much effort. I just take it as, oh, whoa, I am who I am and we'll do it again. Do you, but I gotta be happy to have to learn to compromise and learn to adapt and learn to get involved.

951
01:39:30.090 --> 01:39:34.560
Richelle Direny: You become complacent with who you are. You become super comfortable you've

952
01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:41.520
Richelle Direny: Become and though there's nothing wrong with it. But the question is, do you like being the way you are.

953
01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:45.930
Brandon H: No. Neither am I happy got the one anything

954
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:50.520
Brandon H: I gotta have some activity, something to look forward to some very proud of.

955
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.220
Brandon H: Something I can say I do

956
01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:57.870
Brandon H: Something I can feel I can do something I some live for.

957
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:06.630
Richelle Direny: Do you think that you feel inadequate because at this stage of your life where you ever married

958
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:16.410
Brandon H: No, I was in two relationships where I was like a step to add one was seven years. One was eight years, both and two kids.

959
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.830
Brandon H: They were older kids to so when

960
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.160
Brandon H: The one girl one to call me her dad when I was, she was too far long

961
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:35.040
Brandon H: I felt for because her dad was a real piece of work and abusive and all forms of abuse to her mother.

962
01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:36.720
Brandon H: But

963
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:40.230
Brandon H: Take that name from him. It wasn't mine and take

964
01:40:43.050 --> 01:40:46.890
Brandon H: I treated her like my daughter, but I didn't. I still do. I still talk to her, but

965
01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.260
Richelle Direny: How old are they

966
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.250
Brandon H: She's 23 now I think 22 or 23

967
01:40:54.390 --> 01:41:04.200
Brandon H: They her sister, it'd be a couple years older. She's probably already 26 years old. And then the other two ones probably

968
01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:12.420
Brandon H: He's probably the same as what he's about 26, it has to be about 21

969
01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.170
Brandon H: The one. It was one of them out of the four

970
01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:30.720
Brandon H: And then is leverage them and I wasn't like abusive or anything that is there was times that mothers wanted me to discipline. But what am I supposed to do, so I'm not going to discipline your children and my mind.

971
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:37.860
Brandon H: That might have been looking at me that way is, I'm the type renovo step dad. He just wants to abuse and no no no no.

972
01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:51.180
Richelle Direny: You find that, um, that some of your isolation and your social anxiety is due to you, not

973
01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:56.070
Richelle Direny: Further in life than where you are right now.

974
01:41:56.130 --> 01:42:12.330
Brandon H: Yes, Vegas. When I was in chance and just wasn't doing anything with going ISP and all that stuff. And I op and all that and just go on a our time I wake up crying. I haven't gotten very far in life.

975
01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.700
Brandon H: Now I'm mistaken, as I am or am

976
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:24.840
Brandon H: Whatever happens, happens. Hopefully it's good if I stay good it'll be good or a bad will be bad.

977
01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:32.910
Richelle Direny: So it caught you kind of like settled with you kind of forced yourself to settle with how what life has is

978
01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:33.780
Brandon H: Now, yeah.

979
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.130
Brandon H: Change password change you.

980
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:39.000
Richelle Direny: Can't change the

981
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:42.840
Richelle Direny: Past, you can definitely change the future but it starts with what you do today.

982
01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.250
Brandon H: Right, yeah. I mean, my future depends on every day, what I do.

983
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.470
Brandon H: In my life.

984
01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:55.410
Richelle Direny: But it sounds like you're a prisoner of your own anxiety.

985
01:42:56.190 --> 01:42:59.790
Brandon H: Yes, and a prisoner my own my own

986
01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.200
Brandon H: I guess I'm a bigger than myself.

987
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:10.080
Brandon H: I put myself down no matter what I do, I do it wrong no matter how I do

988
01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:19.800
Richelle Direny: You think yeah you've imprisoned yourself. So each day you strive to you think about ways to

989
01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:22.980
Richelle Direny: Step out

990
01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:24.630
Brandon H: Yeah.

991
01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:26.010
But then

992
01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.710
Richelle Direny: You enslave yourself.

993
01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.270
Brandon H: Yes, I do.

994
01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:37.140
Richelle Direny: You imprison yourself with things. So it's like you have like these invisible shackles around your feet and hands.

995
01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:38.490
Brandon H: Yes, I do.

996
01:43:38.850 --> 01:43:39.930
Richelle Direny: Have blinders on.

997
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:41.190
Richelle Direny: And you

998
01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.020
You've imprisoned yourself.

999
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:49.140
Richelle Direny: To experience what is out there and what the world has to offer, simply because of

1000
01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:56.460
Richelle Direny: Who you look when you stand in the mirror and you look at yourself. You are not pleased with the person you're looking at

1001
01:43:57.450 --> 01:44:01.080
Brandon H: Right, I said to them, when I haven't, please move

1002
01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:11.370
Brandon H: At work, I'm willing to accept that my where I'm at. But I'm not happy with it completely at all my clothes.

1003
01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:14.580
Richelle Direny: And so the question then becomes,

1004
01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:22.290
Richelle Direny: What is it about us that you're not happy with what, like what are all the things that about you that you are not happy with.

1005
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:33.930
Brandon H: That I'm not that person is stress of a conversation that I'm not the person is outgoing I don't come off as pleasant all the time even though I really enjoyed. I really am close

1006
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.800
Richelle Direny: When you say not pleasant. What do you mean

1007
01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:44.940
Brandon H: Let us come off as I view myself as Columbus area again are too good for Steve or

1008
01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:47.250
Brandon H: Don't talk

1009
01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:53.430
Richelle Direny: So because you don't talk. It's you're not very pleasant.

1010
01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:05.400
Brandon H: Well, most people look at as your standoffish. If you don't speak or don't follow him the conversation. I look at it is, I don't really need to know that vs. Listen to you, but I'm not gonna

1011
01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:07.230
Brandon H: Say much

1012
01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.010
Richelle Direny: Because you don't feel like whatever he's been talks about is something that

1013
01:45:15.090 --> 01:45:16.350
Brandon H: Man, he

1014
01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.240
Richelle Direny: Or you can add to the conversation.

1015
01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:21.990
Richelle Direny: I mean, that's

1016
01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:27.360
Brandon H: Not a big fake PR i don't i don't flatter a lot, unless somebody deserves me fly or, you know, I don't

1017
01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:40.410
Richelle Direny: Know, so I think taking baby steps to counter act or at least come try your best to come face to face with your anxieties, I would definitely say starting off with

1018
01:45:40.890 --> 01:45:41.580
Brandon H: Make you

1019
01:45:42.570 --> 01:45:45.780
Richelle Direny: I think you know I think making like these daily

1020
01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.020
Richelle Direny: positive affirmations to yourself.

1021
01:45:51.840 --> 01:46:06.210
Richelle Direny: A help. I think it will help you making, and I will definitely encourage you, until we meet again is to make these positive affirmations to yourself daily what tell yourself. One thing positive about yourself.

1022
01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.910
Brandon H: Yeah, I try. I will try to remember that from last time I'm trying to do that.

1023
01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:16.860
Brandon H: Trying to find an example of something to be grateful for.

1024
01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.900
Brandon H: Someone to be happy about or something to be proud of or something to be

1025
01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:25.950
Brandon H: I don't know, meaning to be happy about.

1026
01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:43.800
Richelle Direny: And you talk about it in group like what we talked about, like, what are you happy for in the day, but I know one of your things was to be back in the program. But, I mean, I want you to be able to identify during our next time. What is it that Brandon likes about Brandon

1027
01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:53.100
Richelle Direny: If Brandon was supposed to have an out of body experience. What is it that he can say to him. So what is one thing he can say

1028
01:46:54.630 --> 01:47:02.160
Richelle Direny: Knowing what you've known about your past knowing where you are today and what is it that you would like

1029
01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:05.190
To say to you. Oh.

1030
01:47:06.690 --> 01:47:17.760
Brandon H: I'm a fair person I know. And I'm kind of others. I don't do my I don't judge wrestling and I don't I try not to judge anything at all. The older I get, don't even look at it like

1031
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:24.120
Brandon H: Somebody is doing something with it if I feel that we're off the assessor business, you know,

1032
01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:30.990
Brandon H: And I'm look I'm a kind person. I'm a fair shot. I'm a good person doing bad things were used to say.

1033
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:40.320
Brandon H: In a bad game. I was going good. And on top of bad, even though it's on drugs. It wasn't that Stephen or wasn't out, putting people down

1034
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:45.750
Brandon H: I would help a person, a common adage, especially to try to find themselves.

1035
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:49.200
Brandon H: They don't do well. I'll be myself I myself.

1036
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.360
Brandon H: I give a lot of good advice that I don't take my own

1037
01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:55.830
Richelle Direny: You don't know how to apply it.

1038
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:59.130
Richelle Direny: Because you don't believe in yourself.

1039
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:00.450
Yeah.

1040
01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.100
I know

1041
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:10.350
Richelle Direny: That's where your low self esteem. This where your depression. This is where your isolation. This is where your self sabotage comes from

1042
01:48:11.010 --> 01:48:12.120
Brandon H: Yes, we're

1043
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.230
Richelle Direny: Good. You like I said you're a prisoner you you've imprisoned yourself.

1044
01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:17.370
Yes.

1045
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:20.970
Richelle Direny: So, um,

1046
01:48:22.590 --> 01:48:32.550
Richelle Direny: As I said, You know I would. What will stop you in doing saying one positive thing about looking at yourself. Each morning and saying one positive thing about yourself.

1047
01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:34.590
Brandon H: What would I do

1048
01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.960
Richelle Direny: What would stop you from doing that.

1049
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:38.100
Nothing.

1050
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:42.270
Brandon H: I mean, I mean nothing should stop me, but

1051
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:45.870
Brandon H: I'll find some negative before if I'm so positive.

1052
01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.980
Richelle Direny: So I would, I would recommend that each day. You start off with saying one

1053
01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:54.000
Brandon H: Positive thing about

1054
01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:57.930
Brandon H: Let's start right now the idea

1055
01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.790
Richelle Direny: What is one thing that you let's start right now. What's one thing that you can say positive

1056
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:09.990
Brandon H: For today, I showed up for the meeting and been cooperating very well and being open

1057
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:11.820
Brandon H: And

1058
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.120
Brandon H: Read more focus and I was

1059
01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:17.910
Brandon H: The whole week last week, you know,

1060
01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.120
Brandon H: Much more on point.

1061
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.330
Richelle Direny: So I'm every frame that then for you.

1062
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.900
Richelle Direny: What you're saying is

1063
01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:35.400
Richelle Direny: You're proud of yourself or keeping your commitments, so you keep commitments.

01:49:44.130 --> 01:49:46.500
Richelle Direny: You brought your full self to your session.

1066
01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:54.090
Richelle Direny: And not only did you bring your full self to your session, you were able to

1067
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.230
Richelle Direny: Be open and honest about what your struggles are

1068
01:49:59.460 --> 01:49:59.910
Brandon H: Yeah.

1069
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:10.890
Brandon H: So that's the first time I can play. I've been in the Council game, a long time. And so characters and all that I can be s all day long and play give you the right answer and whatnot but

1070
01:50:12.570 --> 01:50:21.000
Brandon H: YOU GET YOU GET YOU BRING IT OUT OF MAN pretty good and I agree with a lot of what you're saying and I just go on textbook, you're actually a sincere about it so

1071
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:26.400
Richelle Direny: So what. So you're saying that's a little bit different, where you're saying

1072
01:50:27.930 --> 01:50:30.450
Richelle Direny: You see, you're, you're feeling challenged

1073
01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:39.420
Brandon H: Yeah yeah well challenges. Try to complete, you know, not just to appease you would appease myself as well.

1074
01:50:42.030 --> 01:50:50.130
Richelle Direny: I will definitely I challenge you. I really truly challenge you daily to and I check in with you on Thursday.

1075
01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:51.600
Okay.

1076
01:50:52.710 --> 01:51:04.500
Richelle Direny: Um, that you are. Do you know what is you. What is something positive that you've identified about yourself at least one positive things because you see how I reframe everything you know

1077
01:51:04.890 --> 01:51:09.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, committed you are willing

1078
01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.520
Richelle Direny: And able to identify what your challenges are

1079
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:18.750
Richelle Direny: But outside of that, you know,

1080
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.190
Richelle Direny: You. I think you i can i can

1081
01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:36.300
Richelle Direny: Each time that I've met with you. I see that you you have low self esteem you isolate a lot and you, you have a lot of anxiety when it comes on to people.

1082
01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:37.440
Yes.

1083
01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:46.590
Richelle Direny: And it's not just and this is the thing. It's not just in crowds. It seems like even one on one. There is there is there still anxiety there.

1084
01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:49.590
Brandon H: Yeah.

1085
01:51:51.210 --> 01:51:54.120
Brandon H: I just always worried about offending people. I don't want to

1086
01:51:55.530 --> 01:52:00.900
Brandon H: Meet person when it comes out. I kind of off to the big baritone big guy and do whatever he wants. But I don't feel that

1087
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.940
You know,

1088
01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.270
Richelle Direny: You. It's so you

1089
01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:09.990
Brandon H: Know up that way. But I would I would hate myself if I did that.

1090
01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.810
Richelle Direny: But again, like I said, we become our worst enemy. We imprison ourselves.

1091
01:52:15.810 --> 01:52:16.170
Brandon H: Yeah.

1092
01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:18.690
Richelle Direny: And your what imprisons what

1093
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:23.370
Richelle Direny: What has kept you imprisoned is your anxiety.

1094
01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:26.280
Brandon H: Yeah, for all my life.

1095
01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:39.360
Richelle Direny: And fear and fear is ultimate that trumps at all. So there is anxiety, there is you know all this different stuff, but it's the fear of what you are capable of doing.

1096
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:40.890
Brandon H: It and wishing

1097
01:52:41.670 --> 01:52:47.490
Brandon H: And I'm smart enough to know what my my capabilities are. And my potential ways, but I just don't reach out for it.

1098
01:52:48.210 --> 01:52:50.490
Richelle Direny: Because you fear you fear your fear your

1099
01:52:50.490 --> 01:52:58.710
Brandon H: Fear, I fear responsibility to better job more responsibility, a whiteboard responsibility and kids more responsibility.

1100
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.890
Brandon H: Possibility to. Yeah.

1101
01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.390
Richelle Direny: You see here, so

1102
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:10.860
Brandon H: You know, care about my drug problem as interfering with that not and i can collapse, any one of those situations.

1103
01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:17.730
Richelle Direny: What is it safe to say that you fear what true happiness feels like

1104
01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:19.860
Brandon H: Yeah, I do.

1105
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:24.120
Brandon H: I mean I what I wish for it, but I don't accept it.

1106
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:39.630
Richelle Direny: Because you can hear you fear what you see it, you see everybody enjoying it, and you want it, but you fear for yourself what that would look like you fear what it feels like. And what it would look like, and how you

1107
01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:41.850
Richelle Direny: Would

1108
01:53:42.930 --> 01:53:48.450
Richelle Direny: You know how you would be accepted, how you would embrace it. You fear a lot you fear the unknown.

1109
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:54.210
Brandon H: Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah. Not a lot. I like to know.

1110
01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:57.000
Richelle Direny: Well, you know what

1111
01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.990
Richelle Direny: Too much knowledge is what got a whole lot of us in trouble.

1112
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:05.700
Brandon H: Yes, true history too much knowledge is trouble so

1113
01:54:06.630 --> 01:54:08.010
Brandon H: Dire do too much noise.

1114
01:54:10.290 --> 01:54:12.630
Brandon H: Many martyrs have died have too much knowledge.

1115
01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:21.540
Richelle Direny: Much knowledge. I think we all, we all having too much knowledge is not necessarily a good thing. We think it's a good thing, but it's not a good thing. So

1116
01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.700
Brandon H: Back to the Genesis

1117
01:54:24.150 --> 01:54:25.410
Brandon H: One, do I supposed to know

1118
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.910
Richelle Direny: There you go.

1119
01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.590
Brandon H: 10% of our brain for a reason.

1120
01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.920
Richelle Direny: He only give us 10% reasons.

1121
01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:36.150
Richelle Direny: So it goes back to exactly Adam and Eve.

1122
01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:37.980
Brandon H: Don't

1123
01:54:38.010 --> 01:54:41.370
Richelle Direny: Eat knowledge because it brings best to you right

1124
01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:43.440
Brandon H: Yeah, exactly.

1125
01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:47.610
Richelle Direny: All right, but too much is just oh

1126
01:54:48.330 --> 01:54:57.240
Brandon H: Yeah I search for wisdom now and how to use knowledge wisely instead of as power or anything like that exists. Exactly, exactly.

1127
01:54:57.690 --> 01:55:06.180
Richelle Direny: So we I, you know, like I said, fear, fear has become your, your mastery.

1128
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:07.740
Yeah.

1129
01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:18.300
Richelle Direny: Fear has become your master that has led you for many years, but then you have to take it back and you because you know what, there's only so much we can control.

1130
01:55:19.170 --> 01:55:32.580
Richelle Direny: And we're not even even full control of ourselves. That's it, that's within itself limited, but what we can. What we're given ability to control. We really don't know how to utilize that. Yeah.

1131
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.710
Brandon H: So yeah, you're exactly right.

1132
01:55:35.670 --> 01:55:47.760
Richelle Direny: So I think, I think we all are victims of our expectations we create these expectations on our own. And then we we don't need it. We become depressed, we come

1133
01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:59.250
Richelle Direny: You know what isolate we self sabotage, simply because of our expectations and we have to learn to identify what is our expectation and kind of lowering them so that you can eat it, or you can attain it.

1134
01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:00.930
Mm hmm.

1135
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:10.560
Richelle Direny: So, um, I think, like I said, between now when when when we meet individually. Again, we'll talk

1136
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:30.300
Richelle Direny: We'll get more into it but I definitely want to challenge you, even in in our group meetings weekly. I'm going to still check in, you know, not just gratitude. But what is your affirmation. What's your self affirmation starting off what what is your self affirmation for today.

1137
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:32.880
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

1138
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:37.770
Richelle Direny: All right, let me see, when we're going to meet again, hold on. Yeah.

1139
01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.500
Richelle Direny: You can meet on

1140
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:13.440
Richelle Direny: We meet every other week.

1141
01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:17.880
Brandon H: Now we made about maybe once a month.

1142
01:57:18.630 --> 01:57:20.490
Richelle Direny: Okay. So then let's go
