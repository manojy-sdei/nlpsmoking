00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:30.690
Dr Jameson: It doesn't get, let's see, they save it until the transcription goes through and kind of rights on everything. And then, and then it gets like you can't pull up the video, a year from now, but for the time being, there is a technically a video on record.

Dr Jameson: Has alcohol been a problem that any pointer.

174
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.410
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I kind of crazy but

175
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.370
Sydney Kent: Nothing like drinking every day and

176
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.270
Dr Jameson: Uh huh.

177
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.820
Sydney Kent: Do you drink.

178
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.290
Sydney Kent: At all now know

179
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.620
Dr Jameson: And are you working or in school or

180
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:46.500
Sydney Kent: At the moment I enrolled in school online. Yeah. Yeah. What

181
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.550

182
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.020
Sydney Kent: Yes. Okay.

183
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.400
Dr Jameson: So you're doing college

184
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.490
Dr Jameson: Do you have like an area that you're focusing on

185
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.570
Sydney Kent: Something to do with

186
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.450
Sydney Kent: Like in the medical field, whether it be you.

187
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:19.500
Sydney Kent: Know, helping people like are being. I don't know what it what I'm going for. And so I just want to help people i don't i don't know how

188
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. Well, that's very nice.

189
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.150
Dr Jameson: So,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.460
Dr Jameson: Cool. There's lots of ways, I'm sure.

192
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.300
Sydney Kent: Um,

193
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:47.970
Dr Jameson: I think it's, I think you'll figure it out. I guess it's harder when it's all online. I guess when you do like more hands on clinical stuff is kind of when you people often get kind of an idea what appeals to them if like physical therapy or nurse nursing or assistant

194
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.440
Dr Jameson: Yeah thing where

195
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.110

196
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.970

Sydney Kent: Around on a daily know honest. No.

200
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.020
Sydney Kent: I mean, I probably could, but no.

201
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.890
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it's you leave.

202
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.630
Dr Jameson: well enough alone, you know,

Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

205
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:20.310
Dr Jameson: And legal issues related to all this, or no.

206
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.980
Sydney Kent: Yeah, in the past, okay.

207
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.690
Dr Jameson: Everything's sorted out. Now did you were you ever incarcerated or

208
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.460
Sydney Kent: Yeah, few times.

209
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.090

211
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.210
Dr Jameson: Okay.

212
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.460
Sydney Kent: And you have a license. Yeah.

213
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.600
I'll settle down. Good.

214
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:50.160
Dr Jameson: We see as you can imagine, given that we're from, you know, telemedicine, we see a fair number of our patients, you know, can't drive for

215
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.900
Sydney Kent: Oh yeah, you know,

216
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.910
Dr Jameson: Another

217
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.730
Dr Jameson: Okay, any other drug history cooking now.

218
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.390

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.770
Sydney Kent: And she's supportive. Oh yes, very supportive. Okay. Sometimes people don't

222
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.730
Dr Jameson: Share this with their

223
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

224
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:31.440
Dr Jameson: Not, not always guaranteed, sometimes they don't get it really people that aren't haven't lived it. You know,

225
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.960
Dr Jameson: Is your family. Do you have a relationship with family at this point.

226
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.430
Sydney Kent: Just my grandma.

227
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.920
Dr Jameson: Or your parents living or do you know

228
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.460
Sydney Kent: No, I don't know, my father, but my mom died.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Was it

232
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:07.710
Dr Jameson: Was there any history of addiction. The reason I'm really what I was going, as you know, family history of addiction or alcohol problems.

233
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.260
Sydney Kent: Yeah, my mom had addiction.

234
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:21.210
Sydney Kent: I mean my grandma's house early told me much. But I know she had issues with alcohol and heroin and she was a she had bipolar disorder.

235
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.400
Dr Jameson: Bipolar that we said

236
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.050
Sydney Kent: I pull it. Yeah, yeah.

237
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.840
Dr Jameson: Not surprised me.

238
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.160
Sydney Kent: Things tend to be

239
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.040
Dr Jameson: No. No. Okay.

240
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.280
Dr Jameson: Did she die from overdose, or you don't know

241
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:44.520
Sydney Kent: She died from alcohol. I just found this out, two weeks ago. Wow. All this time I thought she died of heroin by now.

242
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.200
Sydney Kent: So I

243
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.480
Dr Jameson: Like her liver, I guess.

244
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.200
I don't know.

245
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.170
Fishing.

246
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.650
Dr Jameson: Or you know if your dad had

247
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.070
Dr Jameson: Don't know anything. OK.

248
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.470
Dr Jameson: And then do you have

249
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:12.060
Sydney Kent: I have a brother and I have a sister in foster care or she has different parent

250
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:14.850
Sydney Kent: A doctor. Yeah.

251
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.540
Sydney Kent: Do you

252
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.030
Dr Jameson: Have any contact with either family. No.

253
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.290
Sydney Kent: No.

254
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.290
Sydney Kent: With my brother. Yeah, but he doesn't talk to me.

255
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:23.820
Dr Jameson: Okay.

256
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.650
Dr Jameson: Does he have any of this stuff.

257
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.090
Dr Jameson: Bipolar addiction.

258
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.630
Dr Jameson: Oh my goodness, this is just our glass and again. All right, I'm just get out of here.

259
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:46.410
Dr Jameson: let it do its percolating okay so they explain to you how our program is structured with the weekly group and

260
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.930
Sydney Kent: Really. OK. OK.

261
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.100
Let me tell you.

262
00:17:51.150 --> 00:18:01.440
Dr Jameson: So we have this initial visits, which is a lot less complicated when you've already been in treatment because he kind of probably know the drill. Though we happy to

263
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:10.590
Dr Jameson: Answer any questions if you have any about how the medicine works and all that. And then we find a weekly group that fits your schedule.

264
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:27.420
Dr Jameson: And that's a obviously a group. So there's other patients MYSELF AND WELL AS PRESCRIBING person and counselor and that's we call them on recovery skills or relapse prevention or

265
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.620
Dr Jameson: But basically we talked about different subjects that have to do with

266
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.140
Dr Jameson: coping skills and dealing with adversity and

267
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.110
Dr Jameson: Mindfulness and

268
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.310
Sydney Kent: Okay, so

269
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.150
Dr Jameson: That kind of stuff. Probably so. I assume similar to what you

270
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.920
Dr Jameson: Know, yeah it before but

271
00:18:49.980 --> 00:19:06.540
Dr Jameson: Then you have at least one visit with a counselor for a one on one sort of assessment. Do you do a counseling. Well, he just moved, I realized, but before you move. Were you doing any individual work separate from them and it can be done that in the past or

272
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.790
Sydney Kent: In the past, until then.

273
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:24.870
Dr Jameson: So if you are seeing someone currently locally, we wouldn't necessarily insist that you also be seeing, we'd have the one visit but you know you could continue with your local councillor. If you don't have a current counselor, we generally

274
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:44.520
Dr Jameson: require at least a course of so many. I don't know, a couple months worth of counseling sessions with with one of our counselors, up until sometimes more sometimes less just depends on the individual, but until basically you both agree, not much here to talk about anymore.

275
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:56.730
Dr Jameson: And then we can put it on to a more of a like an as needed. You know something's going on. I need to check in, then fine, but so we start out with a plan of you doing some

276
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.360
Dr Jameson: You know, individual work where you can get a little

277
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.290
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

278
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.880
Dr Jameson: We're into the weeds about

279
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.230
Dr Jameson: Stuff that you might not want to

280
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.450
Dr Jameson: Throw out into group.

281
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.470
Yeah.

282
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:18.660
Dr Jameson: And then, well, you have the initial lab that's includes blood work as, as well as the urine and then after that we just do monthly

283
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:27.630
Dr Jameson: urine drug screens. So, and the details on that we can get they they mail you a cup and its own anyway but

284
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:33.570
Dr Jameson: Okay, yeah. So the only time you have to go to a local lab is for the original the initial

285
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.840
Set of of labs.

286
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.960
Dr Jameson: And you have a plan on that located a place you're going to go

287
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.890
Not yet.

288
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.680
Still seriously.

289
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.400
Yeah, okay.

290
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.260
Dr Jameson: The only thing I can think of. Did you do blood work when you were in your other

291
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.240
Dr Jameson: Program.

292
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:09.720
Sydney Kent: OK.

293
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.720
Dr Jameson: OK, so I'll just

294
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.820
Dr Jameson: I'll ask, Jamie. Have you met gene. Who have you been working with so far.

295
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.310
Sydney Kent: Knowing

296
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.320
Dr Jameson: Well, like who did your intake and all the paperwork with you.

297
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.040
Sydney Kent: I see was her name is Maria

298
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.340
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we have what's called

299
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:45.660
Dr Jameson: Honestly, it's still confuses me sometimes how everything gets organized. But anyway, there's some we have something called care navigator, and they sort of are your sort of point person for

300
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:58.140
Dr Jameson: Whatever stuff. And so my care of navigators name is Jamie. Jamie barber. I think her last name is she's the one that you know when somebody needs something I

301
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:05.070
Dr Jameson: I messaged her so I just did messaged her so she should be in touch with you at some point, usually what we do is

302
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.380
Dr Jameson: Find

303
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:18.210
Dr Jameson: A local lab. Usually we use quest. But if there is no question your area, they sometimes use the local hospital. Anyway, they send out an order for you and then you go and

304
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.070
Dr Jameson: Do your thing. And then after that, like I said, we

305
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.670
We don't we just do that with them the monthly urine.

306
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:37.560
Dr Jameson: So that's how that works. My. What's your schedule like as far as

307
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:45.540
Dr Jameson: Like on when like during the day, or do you are you in class at certain times, are you kind of flexible or

308
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.160

309
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.600

Dr Jameson: Yeah, you don't. That's your I don't wanna

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:54.540
Dr Jameson: I will call you.

325
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.860
Dr Jameson: Like to be called and then you do that you sorry, did you say films or or tablet.

326
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.650
Sydney Kent: Films. Okay.

327
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.670
I just have to

328
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.220
Dr Jameson: look you up in the little database.

329
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:17.250
Just require so second

330
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.550
Dr Jameson: When was the last time you filled a prescription

331
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.910
Sydney Kent: My day is it

332
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.330
Dr Jameson: Today is the third of March.

333
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.760
Sydney Kent: So,

334
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.460
Sydney Kent: I'm gonna say

335
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.630
Sydney Kent: Sunday not last Sunday.

336
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.030
Sydney Kent: Linda week before. Okay.

337
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.300
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

338
00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.700
Dr Jameson: And then

339
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.190
Dr Jameson: You got that from the hospital.

340
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.350
Sydney Kent: Okay.

341
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.330
Dr Jameson: And it looks like they were giving you a month supply

342
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.890
Sydney Kent: Dr. Ross was, it was

343
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:11.550
Dr Jameson: Doing here.

344
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.010
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

345
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.830
Sydney Kent: Yeah, yeah. Doctor us and

346
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.200
Sydney Kent: They just gave me a

347
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:25.020
Sydney Kent: I think it was seven days where it's like a week and they told me to to find someone in a the resources.

348
00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.550
Dr Jameson: Um, alright, so

349
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.320
Dr Jameson: Tony, so you're pretty much out. Now, I guess.

350
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.740
Sydney Kent: Yeah, maybe two.

351
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.610
Sydney Kent: Oh wait, no, I have enough till tomorrow.

352
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:48.180
Dr Jameson: Okay. Yeah, it looks like you what this says as he thought he felt a week ago today on the

353
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.620
Sydney Kent: 23rd. Okay. Okay.

354
00:25:53.430 --> 00:26:03.390
Dr Jameson: So a couple little. It's a lot all at once. So I guess I don't want to overwhelm units okay if you don't remember all this but for group. We ask that you not be smoking during group.

355
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.960
Dr Jameson: Of people. Some people are quitting or have quit recently.

356
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.050
Dr Jameson: watched somebody else.

357
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:18.300
Dr Jameson: We asked. I don't really care when we're on the individual here because whatever your whoever if there is somebody else in your room.

358
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:27.090
Dr Jameson: Obviously you're comfortable talking in front of them and I don't have any problem for them hearing me, but in the group when we have multiple people and privacy is is

359
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.410
Dr Jameson: At most, we require headphones of some kind.

360
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:38.700
Dr Jameson: Your, your bugs or whatever, just so that we're sure that nobody else behind the cameras listening and

361
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.160
Dr Jameson: So if you can just plan on having those available and

362
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:54.930
Dr Jameson: That's really the only way we'd like you to be, you know, not multitasking and

363
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.500
Dr Jameson: Then quietly in a quiet place.

364
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:06.090
Dr Jameson: In general, the thing to remember is, you're always going to start a virtual clinic, like you did today so

365
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:18.540
Dr Jameson: That's all you have to remember. And then when you get there, they'll check you in and then give you the meeting ID, which will change every week. But if you just all you if you just remember to go to virtual clinic and then you'll be

366
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.240
Dr Jameson: they'll, they'll help you from there.

367
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.290
Sydney Kent: Okay, perfect.

368
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.800
Um,

369
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:38.070
Dr Jameson: So, I mean, I guess if you're free. Then I would, you know, encourage at the welcome you to come to group tomorrow I'll write your prescription for the week today, but that way you can sort of meet everybody and get into the get into the swing.

370
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:38.820
Sydney Kent: Okay.

371
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.850
Dr Jameson: It's a mixed. You know, we have people who

372
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:50.040
Dr Jameson: Have been in treatment, a long time. Some people that are just, you know, never literally just stopped using heroin last week.

373
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.880
Dr Jameson: And then kind of in in the middle so

374
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.920
Dr Jameson: You're

375
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:05.730
Dr Jameson: Anytime, even when you're not brand new to group if it's just not a good day and you aren't feeling up to it. You don't have to like always share and

376
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.130
Dr Jameson: divulge, you know, but

377
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.600
Dr Jameson: Certainly when it's your first day you know

378
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.900
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

379
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:29.940
Dr Jameson: You're welcome to just kind of watch john is the counselor. He'll probably ask you if you'd like to share and, you know, he won't you what I just want you to know is it's okay if you're like, I'd rather wait another you know

380
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.820
Dr Jameson: Not today. Yeah. Someone passed today or something.

381
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.290
Dr Jameson: Rather list. Totally fine.

382
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:48.240
Dr Jameson: You'll just play it by ear. However, you're feeling is fine. And then the only thing we usually end every week with everyone saying something you're grateful for. So I like to let people know that so you're not

383
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.800
Dr Jameson: Completely apart if you want it.

384
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:50.580
Sydney Kent: Okay.

385
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.890
Sydney Kent: Cool, cool. Yeah, I've already doing that. So that's cool.

386
00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:00.570
Dr Jameson: Okay, so hopefully that's not too hard of a question to you, and that's how we typically wrap up each group so

387
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.620
Dr Jameson: Just a heads up on that, um,

388
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:13.590
Dr Jameson: Do you have any questions about how the medicine works or anything, anything about it that you have had problems with or side effects or any issues with

389
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.320
Sydney Kent: Questions with that.

390
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:29.700
Sydney Kent: With that nobody. I have a question of how this thing works. But think of the group thing. Do I have to have my video on

391
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.760
Dr Jameson: I'm we prefer

392
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.330
Dr Jameson: It why

393
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.060
Why are you asking

394
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.530
Sydney Kent: Okay, I didn't, I just didn't know how it works. Yeah.

395
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:43.950
Dr Jameson: I mean, we

396
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:46.620
Go ahead.

397
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.600
Sydney Kent: Yes. Okay.

398
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.550
Dr Jameson: Um,

399
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, we generally do because we kind of, you know, want to see that you're awake and

400
00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.010
Sydney Kent: Not annoying.

401
00:29:59.040 --> 00:29:59.940
Dr Jameson: Or whatever, but

402
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Dr Jameson: Um, sometimes, like if people have a bad connection or something. And we're not getting a good signal. Sometimes people will turn their video off or like when they're not talking, they'll have it off so they can hear better but

403
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.480
Sydney Kent: Okay.

404
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.190
Dr Jameson: To talk, they'll turn it on, but

405
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.320
Dr Jameson: Are you

406
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.650
Dr Jameson: self conscious or what we're

407
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:26.430
Dr Jameson: Here. Yeah, we have a lot of patients who have kind of like social anxiety. Is that something you

408
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.360
Sydney Kent: Yep.

409
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.060
Dr Jameson: I even have it a little. I think so.

410
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:32.940
Yeah.

411
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:42.300
Dr Jameson: So I mean it. I guess it is some of our patients find that this is less uncomfortable because you're still in your own space and you know

412
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.620
Dr Jameson: Yeah, separate, you know,

413
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.230
But certainly

414
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:55.350
Dr Jameson: You know, just even if you don't have social anxiety, meeting new people for different in a new environment, a new anything new is usually a little

415
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:03.300
Dr Jameson: anxiety provoking. So yeah, I think you're that sounds pretty

416
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.720
Dr Jameson: You know par for the course.

417
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:17.040
Dr Jameson: I've me. I think your urine everyone, everyone is, you know, some similar to us on that sense I think some obviously more more than others. For some people, but

418
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.860
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we have mostly

419
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.870
Dr Jameson: Mostly ladies and this group actually but

420
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.220
Dr Jameson: There's a couple guys for one, not one of them doesn't come every week.

421
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.570
Dr Jameson: One just had a baby like a month ago.

422
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.440
Sydney Kent: She's okay

423
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.670
Dr Jameson: In treatment with us. So, you know, all through her pregnancy and

424
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.960
Dr Jameson: Let's see.

425
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.680
Dr Jameson: We have another lady who's

426
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:57.690
Dr Jameson: Thinking about live in Oregon story and then we have Kareena is

427
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.070
Dr Jameson: Actually don't have a couple months she was taking pills.

428
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.930
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so there's a variety. But I think, I think.

429
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:14.040
Dr Jameson: Hopefully you'll find it. It turns out to be less bad and you expect. Yeah, look at it that way.

430
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:25.230
Dr Jameson: Do you have any other questions about we do ask that you check in. Start the check in process, about half an hour before group is scheduled to start

431
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:38.340
Dr Jameson: At 730 that's just because with the group of people all checking in simultaneously. You know, they can only do so many at a time. And sometimes people are due for their drug screen. So I got to do that on the spot, and there's

432
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.990
Dr Jameson: Did they already have you fill out any survey type

433
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:45.570
Sydney Kent: Okay.

434
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:54.420
Dr Jameson: So there's the only other weekly requirement. Besides, Larry mentioned, I'm not really involved in it. So I always forget about but they they have they're really into data for

435
00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:04.620
Dr Jameson: The guys, the guy that runs that started the company and the medical director, they love it. So they like to track how are you doing today. So they have

436
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.210
Dr Jameson: surveys and ask people to feel. I think it's 10 to 15 minutes or so, and I believe you get it by email.

437
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:20.460
Dr Jameson: So I guess people don't enjoy filling them out. So they leave it last minute. So a lot of people have to fill their surveys out before they get the

438
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:31.020
Dr Jameson: Meeting ID. But if you see the survey earlier in the week. Feel free to just fill it out on the you know there. And then so that it's done before. Here in the checking in process.

439
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:42.570
Dr Jameson: But I think those are pretty much the main things you know my personal kind of request ask is that you

440
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.810
Dr Jameson: First of all, I mean we're not, we don't expect

441
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:58.020
Dr Jameson: We hope for, but we don't expect people to be 100% sober, from the moment they enter treatment. I know you've been in treatment for longer. So hopefully this is becoming a little less

442
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.360
Dr Jameson: Touching go but

443
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:15.090
Dr Jameson: You know, if you haven't had an abnormal finding on a drug screen. We don't kick you out. We want to talk to you about what's been going on and how are you gonna, you know, what are you going to what changes do you feel that you

444
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.380
Dr Jameson: Need to make and that's happening, that kind of stuff. But we're not like a punitive kind of

445
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.800
Dr Jameson: Program.

446
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:35.310
Dr Jameson: The things that can get people in trouble are either missing appointments through, you know, commonly and not calling and then, you know, calling Friday night. I'm not a medicine like it's a crisis now.

447
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.650
Dr Jameson: Not testing positive for the box. Oh no, it's not.

448
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.670
Dr Jameson: And that's

449
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.490
Dr Jameson: You know, basically you know what you want to make sure that our patients are taking the medicine and not

450
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.020
Dr Jameson: Having something else happened to their pills or medication. So

451
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.980
Dr Jameson: Really, it's about communication and being

452
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.810
Dr Jameson: Adult

453
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:05.550
Dr Jameson: Keeping appointments and that's hard for some people, you know, especially people that really kind of got into this

454
00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:23.010
Dr Jameson: Lifestyle or whatever issue problem when they were in their teen years like never really kind of figured that stuff out. So that's kind of like part of our initial, you know, work is like set an alarm makeup on time.

455
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.490
Sydney Kent: Were

456
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.410
Dr Jameson: You know, that's okay too. But, but

457
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:41.340
Dr Jameson: If it becomes a it becomes, you know, like a recurrent problem, then we have you know sometimes been known to like

458
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:50.520
Dr Jameson: Drop a prescription from we usually start one week at if I was starting from scratch. I might just do a couple days and then follow up with you but you're on a stable though so that

459
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.030
Dr Jameson: You don't need to that with you. But we usually start a week at a time.

460
00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:05.280
Dr Jameson: And as you build kind of a track record and you're showing up and you're or, you know, calling when you can't make it, and rescheduling and doing, you know, kind of the, all the appropriate

461
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:15.900
Dr Jameson: Expected things. Eventually, it usually two, three months down the road we can extend your prescription to two weeks at a time. And finally, six weeks, you know, six months in a month at a time.

462
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.220
Dr Jameson: But we can always go backwards do if we need

463
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.650
Dr Jameson: Sometimes we end up with three data points prescriptions and

464
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.630
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so

465
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.100
Dr Jameson: Hopefully we don't have to do that but

466
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.760
Dr Jameson: We, we have our carrots and sticks basically

467
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:45.780
Dr Jameson: Anyway, that's really my biggest like pet peeve is people that don't keep their appointments and you know it's me or the counselor sitting here, you know,

468
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.350
Sydney Kent: We're here in

469
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.910
Dr Jameson: Our day to be here and then the patient can't bother to show up or call that they can't make it, which is

470
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.030
Sydney Kent: Yeah, that is

471
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.710
Dr Jameson: Frustrating, as you can imagine.

472
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.070
Yeah.

473
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:06.540
Dr Jameson: So that's really kind of my biggest like you know expectation is that we're all kind of mature.

474
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.150
Dr Jameson: And then

475
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:18.930
Dr Jameson: You're not offered it now. So we in you know about the whole if you took it to cluster when you've taken something else it would make you sick. Instead of making you better

476
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.940
Sydney Kent: Where that whole thing. Okay.

477
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.110
Dr Jameson: Do you do any WHERE WERE YOU DOING. How long ago did you move

478
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.830
Sydney Kent: To go. Okay, so it's still kind of new so

479
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.860
Dr Jameson: Were you doing any other local meetings before you will

480
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.020
Sydney Kent: Oh yeah, I was good to a day.

481
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.880
Sydney Kent: Okay, and

482
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.660
Dr Jameson: Have you found any in your new area yet.

483
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:44.490
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I've been trying to hit on every day. Good. We found

484
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:47.790
Dr Jameson: That seems to be a good match for you.

485
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.000
Sydney Kent: Yeah, there's one. Okay. You know, sometimes they're not always, ya know,

486
00:37:54.270 --> 00:38:05.550
Dr Jameson: And then since we're an online thing I would, I don't know if you've ever heard of the there are some online support groups to. Are you familiar with in the rooms or find another one.

487
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.510
Sydney Kent: No, I'm not familiar with that.

488
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.990
Dr Jameson: So that it's a website, I believe they have an app also

489
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:17.430
Dr Jameson: But I think they're like 24 hours a day, you can log in there and find

490
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:29.820
Dr Jameson: It's just a good reason. Anyway, they have a, it's a, like a clearinghouse like they have a list of all the local meetings in your area to I'm sure you have other places to find that, but they have the app, but they also have different

491
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:41.430
Dr Jameson: It might be worth checking out. Because I know I looked at. I looked up the one near where I live, and they have people. I live in Florida. So there was like the silver foxes or something they call themselves but like

492
00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.700
Dr Jameson: older folks and then yeah, was that there was an LG

493
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:51.360
Dr Jameson: BT Group and there's, you know, they kind of break it down into sub sub sections or clubs or whatever.

494
00:38:52.980 --> 00:39:01.110
Dr Jameson: But that might be, you know, might be something that that might be appealing or not. But anyway, it's, it's also another option if if you've only found the one that's

495
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.930
Dr Jameson: Feeling like a good fit. So

496
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:06.660
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

497
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.930
Dr Jameson: Well, so that might also be helpful, then

498
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.550
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm

499
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:17.790
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then I will let you did you give them the pharmacy that you wanted to use

500
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.420
Sydney Kent: I don't know if you see what I have. I think I did. Yeah.

501
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.750
Sydney Kent: And I talked to Maria I did. There's a Walgreens. Okay.

502
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:37.350
Dr Jameson: So are they aware that while you're kind of new to them. Anyway, I guess, because he just not there. Yeah. On Shaw Avenue.

503
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:38.880
Yeah, okay.

504
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:48.270
Dr Jameson: The sometimes some of the it's usually okay in California. They're generally okay but every so often.

505
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.160
Dr Jameson: They get a little upset when they find out that we're telemedicine.

506
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.510
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Oh.

507
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.450
Sydney Kent: Kind of what I was worried about and

508
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:04.980
Dr Jameson: Usually with we call them or they Google us and they see like we're not just, you know, I think they just worried that we're some kind of scam or something.

509
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:14.760
Dr Jameson: So, um, but once they see that we kind of are we were legit. Usually it's okay but sometimes it needs a phone call and some reassurance so

510
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.910
Dr Jameson: Are you self pays that right

511
00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.640
Sydney Kent: Yep. Okay.

512
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:24.540
Dr Jameson: So use like a good Rx coupon or something.

513
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:25.980
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

514
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.890
Sydney Kent: Yeah, are you sir. Okay.

515
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:35.700
Dr Jameson: And i think i guess i the generic films about the same as the tablets, as far as cost. I thought the tablets were a little less

516
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.760
Sydney Kent: I've never been on the tablet.

517
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.620
Dr Jameson: It's totally up to you. I

518
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.270
Dr Jameson: Just let me look it up.

519
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:53.280
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I think the generic films. They're I think they're just $10. I don't know. No, I don't have insurance.

520
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.850
Dr Jameson: It hasn't been too bad for you. Good. Okay. That's pretty good.

521
00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.460
Dr Jameson: For a week with that.

522
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:06.720
Sydney Kent: Well no actually, no, I didn't like almost $100 for two weeks. Whereas, so

523
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:08.160
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

524
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.310
Dr Jameson: Cause this phobics

525
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:20.970
Dr Jameson: Okay, let me look and see what it says. Because sometimes not to make it all nice, but sometimes one pharmacy is less than another to maybe you know that, but

526
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.660
Yeah.

527
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:38.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it looks like for 14 films at Walgreens. It's 45 so that would make sense. That's for one week if we switch it to the tablets, just for curiosity.

528
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:41.520
Dr Jameson: Is

529
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:50.880
Dr Jameson: The same at Walgreens. But some of these places. Save Martin Ralphs and Costco. It's $24 for a week supply

530
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.120
Dr Jameson: So I don't know if you

531
00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:02.520
Dr Jameson: even want to switch to a different thing, or you want to just leave well enough alone, but I just, just to throw that out there.

532
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.350
Um,

533
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.190
Sydney Kent: I don't know this Suboxone tablet.

534
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.000
Sydney Kent: Or those like the subjects are no less.

535
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.980
Dr Jameson: Nope. They have, um,

536
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:28.680
Dr Jameson: There's the film strip which there's a brand name or generic and then there's a generic tablet, but there is the subtext tablets. But there's also Suboxone generic equivalent tablets.

537
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.610
Dr Jameson: So some people don't like one or the other. And some people like it it's not always the same.

538
00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:44.760
Dr Jameson: If the tablets get gum dummy in there, like, kind of, there's more bulk to them. So some people don't like them but some people find that

539
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:53.520
Dr Jameson: They don't like the taste of the film and makes them, ya know, so different people seem to have different preferences I doesn't make any difference to me.

540
00:42:54.120 --> 00:43:06.060
Dr Jameson: But since your footing the bill. I just, you know, like I want to give you that option, since it might be less costly for you. Are you going to be self pay or. You definitely are you in the process.

541
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.760
Sydney Kent: I'm waiting for that account to come

542
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.430
Sydney Kent: Yeah, like March seven,

543
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:13.230
Sydney Kent: Oh see coming soon.

544
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.310
Dr Jameson: Maybe it's not worth. Let's just do the week supply at this

545
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:17.880
And then

546
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:25.080
Dr Jameson: And then going forward, then I think they actually prefer the brand name.

547
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:32.340
Sydney Kent: But yeah, I was just yeah just strangely enough, yeah, we're seeing such a thing. But anyway, yeah, they wouldn't back if I don't say

548
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.740
Dr Jameson: Brand only dispenses written, they won't, they won't give it to you. It's stupid. But anyway.

549
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:50.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I will send what you've been on and just make sure you do bring your good Rx coupon so that you get the the discounted rate. Otherwise, it's like 80 bucks. It looks like so.

550
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:51.330
Sydney Kent: Yeah, okay.

551
00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:02.430
Dr Jameson: Um, so I will send this right now. And then I texted Jamie the care navigator about getting your lab order sort sorted

552
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.410
See

553
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:10.380
Dr Jameson: And I usually just ask people to do that within the first week like it's not. It doesn't have to be today but

554
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.630
Sydney Kent: It seems like if we go too.

555
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.490
Dr Jameson: Long without doing them then they get harder and harder to get people halfway. I don't know why.

556
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.070
Dr Jameson: It just becomes less top of mind, I guess, I don't know.

557
00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:31.050
Dr Jameson: Um, so just to get it out of the way, is usually the best seems like, um, how tall are you,

558
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.860
Sydney Kent: 566 he says yeah and you know

559
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.420
Dr Jameson: About how much you weigh these days.

560
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.410
Sydney Kent: Out one AD.

561
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.710
Dr Jameson: You and I are extremely similar in size, it sounds like

562
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:57.480
Dr Jameson: And then I didn't really ask like you have like overdoses. And that sort of did you have

563
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.180
Sydney Kent: No, I haven't. Okay, good. Let's especially

564
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:04.200
Dr Jameson: Lately the

565
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.780
Dr Jameson: fentanyl is creeping in there so

566
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:14.250
Dr Jameson: And you said you never really did a rehab or an inpatient thing for opiate per se was mainly for the math right

567
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.670
Sydney Kent: Yeah, the only time I did it was last year. Yeah.

568
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.330
Dr Jameson: That was right before you went on, or when you did they start you on the Suboxone or

569
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:25.530
Yeah.

570
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.390
Dr Jameson: Oh my gosh, I came in 801 new ok

571
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.600
Dr Jameson: OK, so that's how you started and then transition to that way. Okay, perfect.

572
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:47.130
Dr Jameson: And we kind of talked about, I think all the rest of it. Alright, so I guess I'm done with my million questions.

573
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.060
Dr Jameson: And any others that you've thought of since we

574
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:53.130
Dr Jameson: And talking

575
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.740
Sydney Kent: Um,

576
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.170
Sydney Kent: Um,

577
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:09.630
Sydney Kent: Do I often see like a doctor to to like refill my will be interested in my other stuff.

578
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.390
Sydney Kent: Like out

579
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.470
Sydney Kent: Of the depression. I've been

580
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.420
Sydney Kent: Okay, yeah.

581
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.950
Dr Jameson: I think I guess he left that one. I'll see your

582
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:20.100
Dr Jameson: On

583
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.030
Dr Jameson: Your channel so

584
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.920
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I forgot that I was on it.

585
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:30.540
Dr Jameson: Yes is the answer. But if you're out. I can send like a bridge to help you. So you're not

586
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.310
Dr Jameson: Stranded while you. I mean, you need a local primary care right

587
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:35.730
Yeah.

588
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.240
Dr Jameson: Are you on the XL extended release.

589
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.850
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I'm on the actual the word 50 okay

590
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.210
Dr Jameson: Alright, so you were you need a refill on that.

591
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.990
Dr Jameson: Have you been, have you looked yet for any local doctors yet.

592
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.470
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I've been looking and

593
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.690
Dr Jameson: If it's hard, without the insurance.

594
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.760
Sydney Kent: Yeah yeah yeah

595
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:11.250
Dr Jameson: So hopefully that'll be a that'll be sorted out, but it might take a couple of months because how long have you been on the Wellbutrin

596
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:17.580
Sydney Kent: Two years.

597
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.710
Sydney Kent: And it's been working

598
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.660
Sydney Kent: For you. Yeah, it's been working

599
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.230
Dr Jameson: And that's, I guess, also for the bipolar.

600
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.100
Dr Jameson: Man happy helping you quit smoking, too.

601
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.030
Sydney Kent: Yeah yeah

602
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.160
Sydney Kent: Yeah, they had me on that will be featured in Tokyo back to the same time.

603
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.590
Sydney Kent: Uh huh. And I quit for a while.

604
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:48.690
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. Well, there's, you know, that's the there's that and

605
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.390
Dr Jameson: I can think of.

606
00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.270
Dr Jameson: To Q Cynthia.

607
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.360
Sydney Kent: Balta

608
00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.660
Dr Jameson: Know there's a weight loss, like, oh,

609
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:08.670
Dr Jameson: Like multiple things together, but it's I believe Wellbutrin and Toba max.

610
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.100
Dr Jameson: And then a stimulant. But anyway, that they are both used to kind of decrease

611
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.650
Dr Jameson: Desire for

612
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.350
Dr Jameson: Food or alcohol or

613
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:20.790
Dr Jameson: cocaine or whatever.

614
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.440
Sydney Kent: I couldn't even drink soda on it.

615
00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:28.620
Dr Jameson: Well, the top of Max can decrease appetite for sure and even sometimes causes nada, but it also

616
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.640
Dr Jameson: Makes it hard to remember

617
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.900
Sydney Kent: Things. Yeah.

618
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.320
Dr Jameson: Word finding problems so

619
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:34.980
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

620
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:42.930
Dr Jameson: That can be that can be a downside, but okay so yeah I sent some of your turn for you. How are you with the circle.

621
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.810
Sydney Kent: Um, I think I'm good.

622
00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:52.680
Sydney Kent: I had, I kind of want to cut down circle because it's a lot and it's just making me really groggy

623
00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.820
Dr Jameson: Have you tried. Can you break it.

624
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.260
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I can break it.

625
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.860
Sydney Kent: I guess you could try. Okay, might be hard to

626
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.520
Dr Jameson: Break it into thirds, but

627
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.490
Dr Jameson: You could try doing a half

628
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.630
Dr Jameson: Or three quarters.

629
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.150
Dr Jameson: And see if that works still works but doesn't make you Braga finding that sort of

630
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.240
Dr Jameson: Just right doses sometimes

631
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.260
Dr Jameson: So yeah, I mean, I think as long you know the down the risk is that you're bipolar x up so

632
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:31.320
Sydney Kent: Yeah, it's been acting up. Oh.

633
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:35.550
Dr Jameson: So I don't know, maybe, maybe not the time.

634
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:50.940
Dr Jameson: To rock the boat any further and you know that's not that does not surprise me at all because you've got a big transition and lots of uncertainty, trying to find a new program and find a new doctor and you know just find your way around town and everything else like

635
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.450
Sydney Kent: Times are definitely stressful. So

636
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.420
Okay.

637
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:07.020
Dr Jameson: Well, maybe the counselor or counseling will be helpful.

638
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:19.830
Dr Jameson: All right, well, I sent that the Wellbutrin for you. And yeah, just keep on as soon as you get your medical in place, I would say, you know, start

639
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:29.220
Dr Jameson: Trying to book something and sometimes the first available appointment is some time away. So I sent I sent a couple months worth on the wealth of Wellbutrin for you just to give you a little question.

640
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:30.540
Thank you.

641
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:45.630
Dr Jameson: I thought you were going to ask. So, so the way that the weekly groups is I'm there the counselors there. We do a check in. Who needs refills. And then while the group is going on. I'm listening piping in sometimes but

642
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:46.980
Dr Jameson: Sending me bills and checking

643
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.280
On

644
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.920
Dr Jameson: You know, checking on labs and frogs means and sort of just

645
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:54.330
Dr Jameson: You know,

646
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.620
Sydney Kent: The administrative stuff so

647
00:50:55.650 --> 00:51:00.690
Dr Jameson: So it's a twofer. As far as the med refill visit in the group and counseling.

648
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:02.970
Sydney Kent: Okay.

649
00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:09.180
Any other questions before we wrap up.

650
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.600
Dr Jameson: I just wanna make sure you know President so

651
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.530
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right. Well, it's nice to meet you.

652
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:31.650
Dr Jameson: You should. And yeah, we'll see you tomorrow. And then, Jamie will be in touch about labs and then we'll get the initial

653
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:36.360
Dr Jameson: Count for evaluation or assessment or whatever setup.

654
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.120
Sydney Kent: Because I do need to see counter

655
00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.750
Dr Jameson: All right, well, I'm just check one other thing.

656
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:55.980
Dr Jameson: I get doing damage when I any history of suicide sort of thinking or action or attempts or anything.

657
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:56.640
Mm hmm.

658
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:58.950
Dr Jameson: How long ago was that

659
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:05.070
Sydney Kent: Must have been 17

660
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.290
Sydney Kent: It was the last one.

661
00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.680
Sydney Kent: 2000 I mean are you were 17

662
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.980
I was 17

663
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.410
Sydney Kent: Okay.

664
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.800
Dr Jameson: That's fine. So who are you and did you end up hospitalized and all that.

665
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.400
Dr Jameson: Did anybody. No.

666
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.610
Sydney Kent: No. Okay.

667
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.500
Dr Jameson: So you had several attempts

668
00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.050
Sydney Kent: Yeah, okay.

669
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:35.550
Dr Jameson: Any

670
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.690
Dr Jameson: Thinking about that subject lately.

671
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:40.950
No.

672
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.380
Dr Jameson: You have more

673
00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:49.770
Dr Jameson: Support present now like somebody, you'd be comfortable talking with if you were thinking

674
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.920
Sydney Kent: I don't have someone to talk to.

675
00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:53.430
They were

676
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.850
Dr Jameson: You do or do not do said okay

677
00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.640
Dr Jameson: Your girlfriend wouldn't be

678
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.980
Dr Jameson: No. Okay. Okay. Well we're here.

679
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.590
Dr Jameson: To answer the phone 24 hours a day.

680
00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:19.410
Dr Jameson: Definitely obviously get you connected with the counseling anyway. And since it's not actually happening. Anyway, that's okay, but yeah. And then, did you have a sponsor back when you lived

681
00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:31.320
Dr Jameson: Yeah, get where he said, so I know you just got here. So, maybe not. Not a new one yet. But hopefully eventually you'll connect with somebody that seems like a good fit for that.

682
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:32.100
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

683
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.070
Dr Jameson: That might also be a source of support.

684
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:48.330
Dr Jameson: And then I you know what I would ask you then to go and look, it's called in the rooms.com. I think if you can just log in there and look around and see see just you know what's there.

685
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:55.800
Dr Jameson: That might also be a resource if it's, you know, just a bad day or something and you need to connect somehow

686
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.990
Dr Jameson: But that might be another another avenue for you.

687
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.330
Dr Jameson: Um,

688
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.460
Dr Jameson: I know that that especially in that adolescent time period, but

689
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.720
Dr Jameson: Particularly in the LG

690
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.890
Dr Jameson: What is plus stand for, can I ask you to do, you know,

691
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.170
Sydney Kent: I think it's plus

692
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.550
Sydney Kent: I don't know.

693
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.370
Sydney Kent: Maybe gender fluid all that

694
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:30.780
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

695
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.710
Sydney Kent: I'm like, I don't know.

696
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:32.130
Sydney Kent: It just

697
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.150
Dr Jameson: Say just added that

698
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.680
Dr Jameson: Recently, and I'm like, Okay.

699
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:36.930
Dr Jameson: Anyway,

700
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.350
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

701
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:37.980
Sydney Kent: I know that

702
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.360
Sydney Kent: I know that there was you

703
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:48.690
Dr Jameson: Know lots more higher rates of suicide for sure in the adolescent years. I don't know. I want to make any assumptions about what was going on for you, back then, but

704
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.190
Sydney Kent: I'm sure that typically please some some role, but

705
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.510
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I'm glad. Things have settled themselves.

706
00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:59.670
Out on that end.

707
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.470
Least somewhat

708
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, um, anything else that

709
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:14.310
Dr Jameson: I'll send a note to Jamie to about the counseling appointment so we can try to get that on

710
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.280
Dr Jameson: On the books as well.

711
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, anything else that we can help us.

712
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:28.440
Dr Jameson: Here. Okay.

713
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:29.160
Yeah.

714
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.040
Sydney Kent: What's that look for

715
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.330
Dr Jameson: I don't know, you just

716
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.100
Dr Jameson: You have this very, kind of like

717
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.310
Dr Jameson: I don't know, or a sad. So I just want to make sure you're okay.

718
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.900
Yeah.

719
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.460
Sydney Kent: Everyone says I

720
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:52.800
Dr Jameson: Know, it was just the way and I

721
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.090
Dr Jameson: Asked the question. It was just kind

722
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:58.950
Dr Jameson: Of a slow or answer like okay I just wasn't the most convincing.

723
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:06.030
Sydney Kent: Yes, okay. I'm okay. Now, I just thought about yesterday is not doing good. Okay, now

724
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:07.710
Yeah.

725
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.570
Dr Jameson: What made the difference you think. What's different today.

726
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:19.440
Sydney Kent: I don't know. Nothing particularly good night's sleep.

727
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:27.930
Sydney Kent: Are you sleeping much, you said, yeah. Oh, I know what it is because I have sleep paralysis and actors and I didn't. How about last night.

728
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.380
Sydney Kent: I haven't like every night, but

729
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:38.430
Dr Jameson: OK, so maybe you got a better restful restful sleep. Yeah, which makes a huge difference.

730
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:46.410
Dr Jameson: The other thing that makes a big difference. Strangely enough, is well first of all

731
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.360
Dr Jameson: Exercise.

732
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.040
Sydney Kent: Or yeah, like every day.

733
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:50.910
Dr Jameson: Good.

734
00:56:51.090 --> 00:57:06.660
Dr Jameson: And then nutrition, which is, of course, everybody says that, but it actually has been shown eating as few processed food as possible and basically as many fruits and vegetables as possible, like natural, you know, real food.

735
00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.420
Dr Jameson: Is also

736
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.940
Dr Jameson: Like the higher fiber intake that you get, the better your mood tends to be as well.

737
00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:16.170
Sydney Kent: Oh really,

738
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.630
Dr Jameson: Which is so weird to me. I'm like, how is that

739
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:21.390
Dr Jameson: Possible, but I just was reading a book about it and

740
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:30.720
Dr Jameson: It may, if I finally got an explanation. That makes sense. So when you hear about this is what they keep saying the microbiome and the gut can affect your mood and I'm like,

741
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:50.100
Dr Jameson: I don't get that what they were saying is that that's what actually the bacteria in our intestine is actually what digests the fiber because we can't with our enzymes and stuff. But in the process of that digestive process, they create these short chain fatty acids, whatever little

742
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:52.410
Dr Jameson: Modules.

743
00:57:52.500 --> 00:58:06.390
Dr Jameson: And anyway, there we have our body apparently has receptors for these short chain fatty acids all over the place. And so that that actually becomes kind of like a hormone where it's like a signal for all sorts of other things.

744
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.620
Dr Jameson: So that's how that works. Strangely enough,

745
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.040
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I think

746
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.760
Dr Jameson: Trying to focus on fiber.

747
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.460
Sydney Kent: Never thought about that. See

748
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.840
Dr Jameson: Those good bacteria.

749
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:24.420
Dr Jameson: And

750
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.280
Dr Jameson: So yeah, I mean, that would be another thing to try to

751
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:37.410
Dr Jameson: Work on reading labels. Although foods that even have labels are usually not as healthy for you, but

752
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:41.730
Dr Jameson: I'm trying to do you ever track like in

753
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:46.230
Dr Jameson: My Fitness how or any of those

754
00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:47.490
Sydney Kent: I used to. Yeah.

755
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.690
Sydney Kent: Because you can

756
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:55.020
Dr Jameson: You can track your fiber intake that way because otherwise, like how much fiber does a carrot up. I don't know.

757
00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.460
Dr Jameson: You can add it into that app and keep track that way.

758
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.720
Dr Jameson: Even just for a little while, till you kind of learn because

759
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:21.060
Dr Jameson: Once you know what it is, then you don't have to keep track. But anyway, the average the bare minimum intake were supposed to have which apparently is like a very low bare minimum is 30 grams of fiber a day. They said the average American gets like two or three

760
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.820
Dr Jameson: So not doing very well.

761
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.200
Sydney Kent: So,

762
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:26.940
Sydney Kent: That might be something to play.

763
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:33.090
Dr Jameson: With and just see if you notice a week or two of that of that if, first of all, might help your part part two.

764
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:37.080
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Second of all, sometimes people notice their modus better

765
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.350
Dr Jameson: Which is crazy to me still, but

766
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.590
Dr Jameson: Worth a try, good for us anyway so

767
00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.130
Dr Jameson: Anyway, all right.

768
00:59:50.310 --> 01:00:02.280
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, alright, so I will send a note to Jamie about getting that counseling appointment started but if anything is not going well, between now and then please reach out anytime

769
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:03.600
Okay.

770
01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.770
Dr Jameson: Sleep paralysis and sleep terrorists I what you said.

771
01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.620
Dr Jameson: Mm hmm. Have you seen a sleep specialist

772
01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:15.510
Sydney Kent: I was going to. But my insurance couldn't afford it.

773
01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:17.100
Okay.

774
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:21.270
Dr Jameson: That's a funny ways people usually my insurance.

775
01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.940
Yeah, exactly.

776
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.740
Sydney Kent: Yeah.

777
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:34.290
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right. Um, I will see you tomorrow and

778
01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:40.110
Dr Jameson: Yeah. If you have any other questions in the meantime virtual clinic is, you know, kind of a place to go.

779
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:45.810
Sydney Kent: I have a hard time finding here. I don't either call. I don't know how to get there.

780
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:47.520
Sydney Kent: Um,

781
01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:53.880
Dr Jameson: I think now that you've been there, you might have like a history in your little meeting ID.

782
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.990
Dr Jameson: Like if you go join

783
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:06.000
Dr Jameson: You will get like a drop down of options and places you've previously been

784
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:07.980
Dr Jameson: Should be there.

785
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.380
Dr Jameson: That's a good question.

786
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:33.660
Dr Jameson: No, but when on my phone when I just went in. I had a history, you know, one of my meetings from Rome speaks up. So try that you might find

787
01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:36.120
Dr Jameson: It's in there.

788
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.960
Dr Jameson: So this is my meeting room, but I'm not in this except when I'm

789
01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.640
Dr Jameson: Like the, the group meetings will be not in my personal video. There'll be in the

790
01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:08.640
Dr Jameson: The we change the meeting ID is different, every week. So kind of white part of why you have to start go through virtual

791
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.680
Sydney Kent: Okay, gotcha.

792
01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:11.580
Alright.

793
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.160
Dr Jameson: Alright, well, I will see you tomorrow. Hang in there.

794
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.140
Dr Jameson: You Got You Got one one.

795
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.760
Dr Jameson: box checked finding a new treatment program and

796
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:27.120
Dr Jameson: Yeah course the prescriptions that should alleviate

797
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.410
Dr Jameson: Stress right there so

798
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.050
Okay.

799
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.020
Okay.

800
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:40.680
Dr Jameson: All right, seem like you're crying. I guess that's what's making me or like you're holding in tears. No.

801
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:43.440
Sydney Kent: No, I'm okay. All right.

802
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.990
Dr Jameson: You're like, you're like holding them back or something. Okay.

803
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:51.810
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right. I feel like we said goodbye five times. All right.

804
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:57.180
Dr Jameson: Now you know how to get out of here. You kind of toggle your screen a little in there should be a leave meeting red

805
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:01.380
Sydney Kent: Letters should come. Okay, see you. Okay. All right. Thank you.

806
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.330
Dr Jameson: You're welcome. Bye.

807
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:04.320
Bye.

808
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.990
Dr Jameson: Sydney Kent.

809
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:22.440
Dr Jameson: She's presenting today to establish care with our program.

810
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:29.340
Dr Jameson: She can sense to use of telemedicine. I confirmed her name and date of birth.

811
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:40.110
Dr Jameson: Well, you heard what we also had but she's been treated with Suboxone successfully for approximately 10 months.

812
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:45.780
Dr Jameson: She started on that during an impatient rehab stay

813
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:55.620
Dr Jameson: She's moved within the past month to a different part of California and therefore needs a new program.

814
01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:07.800
Dr Jameson: She was attending two groups, a day before she moved and currently she's doing one group a day, she hasn't found a new local sponsor quite yet.

815
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.760
Dr Jameson: She's done individual counseling in the remote past, but not

816
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.210
Dr Jameson: Not more recently, and not part of her previous

817
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:27.360
Dr Jameson: Program, per se.

818
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:42.480
Dr Jameson: I guess I'm going to finish this dictation after I see the next patient. But I put the past medical history, I put the mental status and physical were normal FX a little flat, but

819
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.650
Dr Jameson: Otherwise, she denies suicidal.

820
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.720
Dr Jameson: ideation.

821
01:04:49.980 --> 01:05:00.810
Dr Jameson: She does have a history of multiple suicide attempts in her teens, but it's been a number of years since she's had any suicidality, and I'll come back, but it'll

822
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.300
Dr Jameson: Hello.

823
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:09.840
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

824
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.180
Dr Jameson: Are you there out there. You like

825
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.010
Dr Jameson: The sound took a minute to pop in

826
01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.160
Dr Jameson: How are you today.

827
01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.200
Brittany Dingess: How are you

828
01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.450
Dr Jameson: I am fine. Thank you.

829
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.360
Dr Jameson: I appreciate your

830
01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:30.300
Dr Jameson: Flexibility here where this

831
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.930
Dr Jameson: Crazy, crazy appointment scheduling system situation here.

832
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:40.560
Dr Jameson: Alright, so I think we did you get your prescription. All. All right.

833
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.640
Brittany Dingess: I actually haven't had a chance to pick it up, they

834
01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:48.570
Brittany Dingess: didn't send me the text message that it was ready.

835
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:54.300
Brittany Dingess: Okay, until this morning after hours already gone. I'm doing a

836
01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:02.790
Brittany Dingess: Like an internship for school. Hmm. So I was a counseling agency and I actually, I just lift their

837
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:06.330
Brittany Dingess: Way to go to Walgreens now.

838
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:08.670
Dr Jameson: Okay, but they did say it was ready. So that's a good

839
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:12.570
Brittany Dingess: It's ready now. Yeah, it's red. And there's only $6 so

840
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:13.560
Great.

841
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.810
Dr Jameson: Bonus

842
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.940
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, absolutely.

843
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:25.920
Dr Jameson: Um, okay. So I think I wanted to ask more about

844
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.500
Dr Jameson: Sort of like things like do you smoke and that sort of

845
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.080
Dr Jameson: That kind of stuff.

846
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:39.090
Brittany Dingess: Smoke.

847
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:48.090
Brittany Dingess: Smoke a pack a day and I have since I was 17 so 16 years

848
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:49.020
Hmm.

849
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.160
Dr Jameson: OK, so maybe someday. Oh.

850
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:56.190
Brittany Dingess: I think we had a few times.

851
01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:03.690
Brittany Dingess: Always. It's always been good. I'll be around people, you know, that are spoken.

852
01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:05.370
Dr Jameson: Very hard.

853
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.230
Brittany Dingess: Part that is really hard for me.

854
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.900
Dr Jameson: Do you live with someone else who smokes.

855
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:20.520
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, my husband smokes and he's had cancer and I'm trying to get him to, you know, to quit and even through all his cancer stuff he's still smoke. Yeah.

856
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:22.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

857
01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.450
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's that question and do smoke anything else.

858
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.340
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay.

859
01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:31.980
Dr Jameson: And how about alcohol. Is that a

860
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:37.110
Brittany Dingess: I used to drink a lot and

861
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:45.180
Brittany Dingess: I was an alcoholic actually in my early 20s, I would drink like a fifth day

862
01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:46.890
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, and

863
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.570
Brittany Dingess: I'm

864
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:59.670
Brittany Dingess: Eventually, no one wanted to be around me because I just get so depressed when I would drink. Mm hmm. So I stopped drinking

865
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:02.760
Brittany Dingess: I just quit cold turkey.

866
01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:05.880
Brittany Dingess: Difficult, but

867
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.220
Brittany Dingess: I've had, I think, since like 2015

868
01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:18.720
Brittany Dingess: Or 2014

869
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:25.770
Brittany Dingess: I've only had a couple of drinks like I had a glass of champagne on Valentine's Day.

870
01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:26.610
Huh.

871
01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:30.930
Brittany Dingess: I had a glass of wine. A couple months ago.

872
01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:44.340
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, and I had like a mixed drink last year. And that's been about it and I just know it. Honestly, just the smell alcohol makes me sick to my stomach now.

873
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:45.450
Well, good.

874
01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:48.840
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I don't really enjoy it.

875
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:54.780
Dr Jameson: At all. Okay. Well, that sounds like a good, good thing because that

876
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.290
Dr Jameson: That volume is enough to really cause a lot of medical problems too so

877
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.370
Yeah.

878
01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.730
Brittany Dingess: I agree a todos pancreatitis, the law.

879
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:04.230
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

880
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.410
Brittany Dingess: And elevated liver enzymes.

881
01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:19.590
Brittany Dingess: And at one point, my liver enzymes were so high, and this was kind of bright, but I think it was right before or right after I stopped drinking

882
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:30.180
Brittany Dingess: My liver enzymes were so high they thought I had like hepatitis or something, you know, kept getting tested and it wasn't you know like

883
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.490
Brittany Dingess: They took

884
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:38.460
Brittany Dingess: It wasn't hepatitis. Yeah, there was nothing there wasn't anything wrong. It was just

885
01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:40.110
Brittany Dingess: Angry

886
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.230
Dr Jameson: Hepatitis is actually a term for inflammation of the liver. If you're going to be like technical about the meaning of the term we

887
01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:56.790
Dr Jameson: Often it's an infection. The virus hepatitis A hepatitis B hepatitis C, but there are certainly other

888
01:09:57.810 --> 01:10:02.730
Dr Jameson: Other things and alcoholic hepatitis is the thing. So that sounds like probably what you had

889
01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.200
Brittany Dingess: I mean,

890
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.650
Brittany Dingess: Aside from something obvious like something viral

891
01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:16.530
Brittany Dingess: Really the only other thing was like Tylenol. Mm hmm.

892
01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:26.160
Brittany Dingess: God knows I have been in pain management and I mean there's plenty of times I've technically overdosed on like acetaminophen and I

893
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:35.250
Brittany Dingess: Never had thankfully never had any significant side effects. I mean other than

894
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:49.350
Brittany Dingess: Other than now that that one time and then a couple of other times my liver enzymes have been like slightly elevated but not any any thing that was really a causal concern. Yeah.

895
01:10:49.380 --> 01:11:03.480
Dr Jameson: I think it's it's really good to you stop drinking because I literally was just listening to a thing on my listen to NPR a lot, but they were. It was like a story about the ginormous increase in the number of young mostly young women who are

896
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:05.940
Dr Jameson: Developing serious liver

897
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.380
Dr Jameson: Disease sometimes dying or needing transplants because of

898
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:21.930
Dr Jameson: liver problems and they say the combination of alcohol, which has become women in general drink more alcohol now than they did 34 years ago and also well

899
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:38.940
Dr Jameson: It's in combination with obesity, which is something. And there's a non alcoholic. Anyway, there's a liver disease, we're seeing a lot more of which has to do with processed foods and eating too much fast. So anyway, the two things together, seem to be creating quite a a monster. So

900
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:46.650
Brittany Dingess: I actually just went to a funeral. A few weeks ago of a girl. I went to high school with her and she was less than

901
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:57.810
Brittany Dingess: A year older than me, she's like nine months older than me. And she died of cirrhosis, like she had been sick and she would I worked with her.

902
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:05.370
Brittany Dingess: For like four or five years and I go to high school with her. I didn't know her high school but I husband's really good friends with her brother.

903
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:14.730
Brittany Dingess: And I guess she something happened and she went to the emergency room, and by the time they found out that she was sick. I mean, she was pretty much did she leave for like

904
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.090
Brittany Dingess: 10 days or something on hospice

905
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:25.020
Brittany Dingess: It the Medical Center. And that was it she done just 34 years old.

906
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:34.800
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I actually went to a funeral last month for a neat my neighbors brother who I didn't know at all. But I just want to know, solidarity for my neighbor.

907
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.070
Brittany Dingess: But

908
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.060
Dr Jameson: His second brother. The first one died a year before.

909
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:43.500
Dr Jameson: This one, both of them died of liver failure from drinking

910
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:48.150
Dr Jameson: Young. So anyway, I'm glad you quit.

911
01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:56.220
Dr Jameson: And then any other like marijuana math anything else that's been had.

912
01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:15.060
Brittany Dingess: I did math for a little while. For like six months that was 11 years ago now. I didn't really care for it. I just did it because it was around at the time. Yeah, and marijuana. When I was in high school, I would smoke very, very rarely

913
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:20.220
Brittany Dingess: And I mean, I wasn't partial, you know, either way like it you know

914
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.140
Brittany Dingess: They were bought it.

915
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:32.550
Brittany Dingess: But it didn't have any. I didn't have any adverse effects with it. And then, as I've gotten older, there's been a couple of times I have tried to smoke.

916
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:44.880
Brittany Dingess: And it makes me so paranoid. Then I can't stand myself like one and one. And I literally locked myself in my broom closet, because I just couldn't handle

917
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:47.340
Brittany Dingess: Yeah. Well, it sounds and

918
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.020
Dr Jameson: They keep saying it's getting stronger and stronger and

919
01:13:53.280 --> 01:14:05.670
Dr Jameson: You know, one of the, one of the things that that is starting to come to light as more states are legalizing it is that there's been a giant like in Colorado, which is one of the first states that legalized that there's a real

920
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:13.800
Dr Jameson: Draw. I mean, jump in, like psychosis salute you know paranoid delusions like

921
01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.290
Dr Jameson: So it does have that effect and on more people than we realize.

922
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:25.080
Dr Jameson: So will you know it'll probably be talked about more and more as there's more

923
01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:33.480
Dr Jameson: Studies done you know you're it's hard to do a study on an illegal substance like that requires a whole lot of extra paperwork, so

924
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:43.980
Dr Jameson: Now that it's becoming legal like actual medical sciences is starting to do more studies and I think will in the next couple years probably hear all about it. So,

925
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.300
I'm sure

926
01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:48.570
Dr Jameson: And then how much school did you finish.

927
01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:50.730

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:58.920
Brittany Dingess: I made it to my junior year when I first the first one to college right out of high school.

929
01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:04.140

930
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:06.150
Brittany Dingess: Trying to get these two

933
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.450
Human Services.

934
01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.720
Dr Jameson: So what do you think

935
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.400
Brittany Dingess: Concentration in addiction.

936
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:33.810
Brittany Dingess: Um, I mean like the end goal is to be a substance abuse counselor. Mm hmm. Um,

937
01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.140
Brittany Dingess: I hope

938
01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.850
Brittany Dingess: I have a felony.

939
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:49.230
Brittany Dingess: I don't, I know that like my subs my counselor when I've gone to inpatient rehab one time it was court ordered. But I asked for it.

940
01:15:51.630 --> 01:16:00.180
Brittany Dingess: And he was a convicted felon. I mean, you know, it was like 25 years ago or whatever. But that's when I kind of realized that

941
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:13.500
Brittany Dingess: Like I could be something more than, you know, a cook, good a restaurant when I went to the University of Tennessee my entire life. I got straight A's and I worked for one go to be a doctor.

942
01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:15.780
Brittany Dingess: To be a medical examiner

943
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:17.490
Actor interesting

944
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:19.800
Brittany Dingess: And

945
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:29.820
Brittany Dingess: And my junior year I was on a full academic scholarship and junior year I had several surgeries. I'd like five surgeries.

946
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:49.770
Brittany Dingess: And I lost. I lost my scholarship and appealed and got it back once and then I lost it again. And I guess at the time, like I was too broken hearted to think clearly about trying to get everything together to appeal it again. And when I moved back home.

947
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:57.240
Brittany Dingess: Which was a night going our way home was like an hour away. I moved back home and I ran into a bunch of people that I went to high school with

948
01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:13.770
Brittany Dingess: That's when I started doing math and I had done match for like six months before I had an ex boyfriend. Follow me when I went to visit someone and call the cops just like hoping that there was something there, you know, trying to get me in trouble.

949
01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:27.630
Brittany Dingess: Apparently my friend had a meth lab and a stolen loaded gun and a whole bunch of stuff. I didn't have anything on me. Not in my purse or anything, but they told me

950
01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:33.300
Brittany Dingess: They charged hand with the same the friend of me with the same charges.

951
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:51.930
Brittany Dingess: And then they tried to get me to be like an informant. But, I mean, I didn't know anything because come to find out the guy that I got arrested with was already an informant for the county. Oh yeah, he shared that with me as they were putting us in the back of the police car.

952
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.530
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I saw, I didn't know anything. They didn't already know and

953
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:08.220
Brittany Dingess: Then the district attorney told me that they would make an example out of me and forced me to choose either

954
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.190
Brittany Dingess: A drug felony or the

955
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:25.680
Brittany Dingess: Was a like in the illegal possession of a firearm or something with intent to arm, because at one bullet in it. Mm hmm. So I chose the drug failing is more like a violent nine so

956
01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.380
Brittany Dingess: I finished probation I violated probation.

957
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:41.580
Brittany Dingess: As I got a couple of you guys are not alcohol related, but I'd take a prescription medicine and then drove. Mm hmm. And

958
01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:49.320
Brittany Dingess: My probation officer told me that if I ever had enough money, I'd be able to get that felony removed from my record but

959
01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:53.760
Dr Jameson: Wow, so maybe someday.

960
01:18:55.110 --> 01:19:01.980
Dr Jameson: Hopefully. Okay. And then you're almost done with college you have you're married, do you live with anybody else besides your husband.

961
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:02.820
Brittany Dingess: Oh,

962
01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:06.060
Brittany Dingess: You have kids. No, no children.

963
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.780
Brittany Dingess: Hate well he had testicular cancer. So as far as we know, he is

964
01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.960
Brittany Dingess: Very pretty infertile.

965
01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.380
Brittany Dingess: But then I carry

966
01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:27.450
Brittany Dingess: That will see me in Syria. So I don't want to have a kid and I know, chances are it will have it.

967
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:29.580
Brittany Dingess: So,

968
01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.380
Brittany Dingess: I've always been like my concern is always been

969
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:44.850
Brittany Dingess: You know, I don't want to have a child. And then, you know, have to watch that child die because I gave it a disease, you know that there's no here for so

970
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.960
Dr Jameson: And then, sorry. You probably told me this yesterday, but what you what kind of work do you do

971
01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:55.290
Brittany Dingess: Right now work in a factory. Okay.

972
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:59.850
Dr Jameson: Do you do that full time and then the school or your part time on factory.

973
01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:02.880
Brittany Dingess: Full time in the factory and and then the school to

974
01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.120
Dr Jameson: Them.

975
01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:03.990
I'm trying

976
01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:08.580
Brittany Dingess: No kidding, it's not it's not working so well.

977
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.440
Brittany Dingess: And then I'm getting like no sleep.

978
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.590
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, because I work third shift.

979
01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:19.830
Brittany Dingess: Theory. It sounds like a good idea, you know, work during the night. And then I have the time to do

980
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:30.240
Brittany Dingess: whatever I need to do. But it's asleep. What's actually happening is I'm working at night and then doing stuff during the day and I get like an hour or two of sleep and then I have to go back into work and

981
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:37.710
Brittany Dingess: I'm trying to find a job like a part time job that still has good pay because i mean i make

982
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:44.010
Brittany Dingess: $15 an hour and the work is fairly easy for $15 an hour. Mm hmm.

983
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:57.990
Brittany Dingess: But I'm having to call in so much. I mean, I'm hardly ever getting full paychecks anyway. Hmm. So yeah, trying to find something that will give me a little bit better schedule.

984
01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.080
Brittany Dingess: Money and part time. Yeah, that sounds

985
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:09.630
Brittany Dingess: That sounds painful. Yeah, it's not it's not fun. My body does not handle those like it used to.

986
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:10.320
Nobody's

987
01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.620
Dr Jameson: How much further. How much longer do you have in school.

988
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.360
Brittany Dingess: I do this.

989
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:22.020
Brittany Dingess: See I'm projected graduation date.

990
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:40.290
Brittany Dingess: And June 1 of next year because my classes are normally 15. I mean, I'm sorry, my classes are normally five weeks. But these two field experiences are 15 weeks apiece. So it's added on wow lot yeah

991
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:45.330
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then tell me where

992
01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:50.040
Dr Jameson: Where did opioids come into your

993
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:52.110
Dr Jameson: World.

994
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:53.250
Um,

995
01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:01.770
Brittany Dingess: When I was a teenager, my grandfather, my grandparents adopted and raised me

996
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:17.490
Brittany Dingess: And my grandfather had lymphoma. And so the very first time I can remember ever trying any or anything. He would keep his purpose in the refrigerator. I don't know why.

997
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:21.690
Brittany Dingess: Anyways, I got curious and I tried one

998
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:31.770
Brittany Dingess: So over the next year or two I stole probably maybe 10 in total, very rarely, you know,

999
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:41.280
Brittany Dingess: Because at that point, you know, I have a five milligram Percocet and I was pretty much done you know

1000
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:51.000
Brittany Dingess: When I was. That was when I was like 15 he passed away when I was 16 when I was 17

1001
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:55.920
Brittany Dingess: I had a really bad car accident.

1002
01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:19.140
Brittany Dingess: And immediately, it was like Tramadol just came out on the market. So it was like I was getting samples of ultra set darvocet bottles of darvocet and hydrocodone stuff and I didn't break my neck. But I tour, all of the soft tissue in my shoulders and neck.

1003
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:25.470
Brittany Dingess: So like Aaron I for physical therapy and I was

1004
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:38.190
Brittany Dingess: I didn't turn my head for several months and I legitimately needed something. And at first it started out. Like I wouldn't abuse them. I would actually take them less often than I was supposed to

1005
01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:50.010
Brittany Dingess: But as I was on them longer and longer. And I didn't work as well. You know, I figured, well, if I can take on and feel, you know, like this, and then I take two, then I'm gonna feel

1006
01:23:51.360 --> 01:24:11.520
Brittany Dingess: Twice as good, you know, and I mean that's what I did for years and then eventually I didn't want to have they offered to do a shoulder surgery but it was like a pretty major surgery and I was barely 18 when they offered to do it. And I didn't want to do it.

1007
01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:31.260
Brittany Dingess: So the only other option was a medicine. And then I was in and out of pain management and stuff. I would take a whole month supply of pain pills and two or three days like 120 hydrocodone or whatever in two or three days.

1008
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:51.630
Brittany Dingess: I mean, and I was still functioning and then I started you know I'd run out, I'd be in pain. So I would like. I mean, you know, working in restaurants. There's always drugs and, you know, or somebody who knows where to get them around. So I started by morphine and then

1009
01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:55.530
Brittany Dingess: I

1010
01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:06.330
Brittany Dingess: See I when I started doing math people would just give me math and our trade it for pain medicine.

1011
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:16.140
Brittany Dingess: And I mean that continued all the way through. End of 2014 I went to rehab.

1012
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.780
Brittany Dingess: And I did realize like a

1013
01:25:21.210 --> 01:25:32.040
Brittany Dingess: Five STEP program I 12 STEP program kind of based, you know, rehab. I did really good being completely just totally sober.

1014
01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:41.910
Brittany Dingess: And I got out in about six months after I got out. I was going to meetings and stuff and then they stopped having meetings around where I live, and then

1015
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:44.970
Brittany Dingess: I had to have some dental work done.

1016
01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:53.490
Brittany Dingess: And, you know, they had to have some teeth pulled so they gave me pain medicine like immediately.

1017
01:25:54.330 --> 01:26:11.670
Brittany Dingess: I wanted more. And I wanted more. I mean, in it and that's it took me forever to get into Suboxone Dr around me and by the, by the time I got in at. Well, I started going to the Methadone clinic. Good. I mean, that was so expensive and everything. And so far away.

1018
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:18.000
Brittany Dingess: It took me forever to get into a private doctor around where I live, but

1019
01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:24.420
Brittany Dingess: By the time I did, I stopped going to the clinic and I was waiting on my appointment with my

1020
01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:35.220
Brittany Dingess: Suboxone doctor, like I was I was buying a pan and I mean just whatever you know I could find and

1021
01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.700
Brittany Dingess: Our take it in two hours later, I would still be, you know, I'd start withdrawing and it

1022
01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:55.230
Brittany Dingess: I've had since I've been on somebody went out from the time I started on the box, until now, I guess I've had four surgeries.

1023
01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:09.570
Brittany Dingess: Have to sign a surgeries. I had my thyroid taken out and then I had a spinal fusion in November and you know they've given me pain medicine, every time, but

1024
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:12.630
Brittany Dingess: I just, I mean, I don't

1025
01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:21.600
Brittany Dingess: Especially before they switch me to the had to the surgeries before they switched me to the sub located

1026
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:37.560
Brittany Dingess: With those two or I had the Suboxone I like I didn't even care about the pain medicine. I mean you know it was there, whatever, like if I hurt really, really, really bad. I'll take one. Now, since they switched me to the sub located

1027
01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:49.320
Brittany Dingess: Became a little bit trickier. Like I was on pain medicine for a little bit longer than I feel like I normally would have been because I I kind of started to want it.

1028
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:51.600
Brittany Dingess: Again,

1029
01:27:55.020 --> 01:28:03.270
Brittany Dingess: But I mean, still like when I my back surgery that was the hardest and I knew it would be a painful surgery.

1030
01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.040
Brittany Dingess: I was on pain medicine for like two, three weeks or something.

1031
01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:20.310
Brittany Dingess: But like I was taking them. I wasn't taking them as prescribed. I was taking them a lot more frequently and everything. And so I just told him.

1032
01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:30.960
Brittany Dingess: I was like, look for my own benefit, you know, please don't give me anymore. I don't, I don't want them because I can already see where this is going. And I don't like it.

1033
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:36.570
Brittany Dingess: You know, I'm not. And one of my biggest triggers has always been anxiety.

1034
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:55.080
Brittany Dingess: And my anxiety has never really been very well controlled and pain medicine was always one of the few things that curb my anxiety, like I was on Xanax and so for many years, Xanax Klonopin I had a man And you know that whole whole

1035
01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:56.940
Dr Jameson: Prescribed

1036
01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.330
Dr Jameson: Where they prescribed or you were just taking them.

1037
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.100
Brittany Dingess: Another prescribed

1038
01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:20.400
Brittany Dingess: And they were prescribed. I didn't really. I mean, I didn't care for him. Like I could take a half a Xanax and sleep for 12 hours. I had no tolerance. I couldn't function. If I took him, so I mean it just never know. You know, I needed something to help with my anxiety.

1039
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:34.470
Brittany Dingess: I got anxiety, like at work and stuff, you know, so like if if I'm going to take it and it's gonna make me fall asleep and I can't take it. When and where I needed to what good does it do me. And it just so I

1040
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:43.980
Brittany Dingess: I stopped that was you know I haven't gotten anything like that, and years. But even as a teenager, they had me on Xanax

1041
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:51.060
Dr Jameson: Sorry, remind me when you started the Suboxone. It was like four years ago or something.

1042
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:55.980
Brittany Dingess: I'm a little over four years it was November 2015

1043
01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.480
Dr Jameson: And then last spring is when they switched to the supplicate right

1044
01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.490
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, last April. Yeah.

1045
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:03.570
Dr Jameson: It's almost a year.

1046
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:04.590
Mm hmm.

1047
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:13.290
Dr Jameson: All right, and then besides those four surgeries. You mentioned any others you had your thyroid out

1048
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:21.030
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, so the the Tucson surgeries. The spinal fusion the thyroid surgery.

1049
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.280
Brittany Dingess: I've had my tonsils appendix and gallbladder removed.

1050
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:31.980
Brittany Dingess: I broke my left hand and had to have that fixed surgically.

1051
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:36.060
Brittany Dingess: And I had lifted trip. See, for a kidney stone.

Brittany Dingess: And then I have my wisdom teeth removed.

1053
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:45.210
Brittany Dingess: Think that's everything. It comes all together like 10 surgeries. I think

1054
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.070
Yeah.

1055
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.860
Brittany Dingess: I've always had health issues.

1056
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:55.770
Dr Jameson: Okay, gallbladder and then tonsils and then

1057
01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.160
Dr Jameson: What about

1058
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:04.380
Dr Jameson: Did you tell me yesterday. Do you do anything for birth control or I guess your husband's

1059
01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.180
Brittany Dingess: Instead of date, but I still take

1060
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.010
Brittany Dingess: It Home Depot since I was 16

1061
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.510
Brittany Dingess: And honestly, I just, I mean I like not having a

1062
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:17.760
Brittany Dingess: Hearing anymore.

1063
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:20.400
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, so I mean I've just stayed on it.

1064
01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:28.830
Dr Jameson: So even with the blue box in the loose bar, you still have anxiety or is that working better now.

1065
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.340
Brittany Dingess: No, I still have a lot of anxiety.

1066
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:38.100
Dr Jameson: Do you have a history of PTSD, you think

1067
01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:44.460
Brittany Dingess: Um, I was recently diagnosed with it. Yeah.

1068
01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.570
Dr Jameson: I asked, because that's common

1069
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:50.280
Dr Jameson: The common

1070
01:31:53.010 --> 01:31:59.580
Dr Jameson: Diagnosis in our patient population. So, and, and people that have a hard time with their anxiety, no matter what they do.

1071
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.280
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it's because of sort of

1072
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:06.180
Dr Jameson: Stuff that hasn't really been fully

1073
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:18.270
Brittany Dingess: Work through. Yeah, I had a couple of sexual assault, but it got really noticeable. I was like, see.

1074
01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:21.000
Brittany Dingess: About a year and a half ago.

1075
01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:26.850
Brittany Dingess: October 2018 I was walking my dogs.

1076
01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:38.970
Brittany Dingess: And we got attacked by to stray dogs. Hmm. And like they beat me and I had a hairline fracture in my arm and fail like 40 feet down the side of a mountain.

1077
01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:56.610
Brittany Dingess: We got her they ripped her apart and like I couldn't do anything. You know, they were on top of me at one point, I couldn't do anything to get them off over so I got they eventually they rolled her another hundred and something yards down the side of a mountain and

1078
01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:03.330
Brittany Dingess: I clawed my way back and beat on the bedroom window to wait my husband.

1079
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:19.590
Brittany Dingess: And I had a panic attack. I couldn't breathe. I just, I've managed to tail and, you know, to the point until the dogs were killing her and he came outside and went down there and kill both of them. And she lived

1080
01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:20.700
Dr Jameson: Oh,

1081
01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:32.040
Brittany Dingess: But like just seeing that seeing her be attacked like that I haven't slept in the bed sense I sleep in the in the living room. My dogs. I mean, it's funny.

1082
01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:46.380
Brittany Dingess: Because I know that it's you know i i i had a hard time, not with maybe an attack like that didn't bother me, but with her seeing, seeing something I love you know she'd been through so much. You're so old.

1083
01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:59.070
Brittany Dingess: To seeing her be attacked like that just broke my heart. And so like I know I got in my mind I feel my rationale for not sleeping in the bedroom.

1084
01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:10.770
Brittany Dingess: Is like I won't hear something happen and like the dogs are one of the catcher something will get hurt, and I won't. You know, Hear, hear him to be able to help

1085
01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:21.780
Brittany Dingess: Them a super light sleeper. And so you know when they get up, I'm awake. You know, they start playing I wake up, so I just feel

1086
01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:39.240
Brittany Dingess: Like she took one hill. The beaten for me. I mean, they they tore her art. It was so beautiful, so I want to do everything I can. While I have her because she's. I mean, she's so old. Anyway, you know, to make sure that she stays safe and healthy and whatnot.

1087
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:45.210
Dr Jameson: I think that lack of the loss of power like being unable to

1088
01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:47.970
Dr Jameson: In that can be a very

1089
01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.010
Difficult

1090
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:53.370
Dr Jameson: Feeling to get past

1091
01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:56.730
Dr Jameson: Have you done any counseling.

1092
01:34:57.810 --> 01:34:58.530
I have

1093
01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:10.350
Brittany Dingess: There's an issue where I live right now. I've had such a hard time finding a counselor that will take private insurance.

1094
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:15.120
Brittany Dingess: So the few that are have found

1095
01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:21.300
Brittany Dingess: You know, are scheduled out weeks and weeks and weeks in between appointments

1096
01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.070
Brittany Dingess: And

1097
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we have cancer. So we can we can help with that, I think, but

1098
01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:40.800
Dr Jameson: I'm just, I just got a message from Jamie that she was going to schedule your initial counseling appointment. As a matter of fact, but she got pulled into a meeting so

1099
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.130
Dr Jameson: Should I was just gonna say, should I tell her, you'll call her.

1100
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.350
Dr Jameson: We'll see what she says.

1101
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:56.520
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we have a we have counseling. I just wasn't sure how much you had already done. So it's, I think it you know

1102
01:35:57.690 --> 01:35:58.230
Dr Jameson: Part of

1103
01:35:58.530 --> 01:36:05.850
Dr Jameson: Part of the treatment. I feel like is is not just supply, you know, replacing the, the opiate in your brain. It's like

1104
01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:16.590
Dr Jameson: Fick figuring out what was calling you to them in the first place and trying to get to that so that we can you know make your long term success that much more

1105
01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:31.230
Dr Jameson: Likely. You know what I mean like if and or helping with coping skills and just other ways to deal with discomfort of whatever sort it is whether it's emotional or physical. So I think it's really all part of part of the

1106
01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:39.390
Dr Jameson: Healing and then the recovery is to get to all you know the reasons why not just band aid, you know,

1107
01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:41.490
Brittany Dingess: So anyway, so

1108
01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:56.100
Dr Jameson: We'll work on that. And that can, you know, that can be hard. So sometimes it takes a long time and little bits by little bit as you're comfortable. So that's okay, but I just, you know, I think it will be good to be working on that project anyway. And there are some specific

1109
01:36:57.270 --> 01:37:03.120
Dr Jameson: There's something called how we say the letters wrong em, Dr. I think it's called I'm movement.

1110
01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.280
Brittany Dingess: reprocess VA.

1111
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:06.690
Dr Jameson: You know cuz

1112
01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.600
Dr Jameson: I see. I said it wrong again anyway.

1113
01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:18.330
Dr Jameson: Has been. I know a number of people that I like in professionally that I've had it done and had really good success. So there's

1114
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:24.030
Brittany Dingess: One. I've never had. I'm only ever had, like, just cognitive behavioral therapy.

1115
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:25.710
Dr Jameson: Which is good too.

1116
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:27.390
Brittany Dingess: Yeah yeah

1117
01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:35.730
Dr Jameson: But, but to be able to, and you may know more about it than I do from your studies, but to be able to kind of separate the the memories from the emotions that they

1118
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.870
Dr Jameson: Have been triggering

1119
01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:38.610
Dr Jameson: So that you can kind of

1120
01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:49.260
Dr Jameson: slip into your head again, maybe, but you know there's, you know, some of this this like kind of anxiety that just keeps bubbling up you know sometimes if we can

1121
01:37:50.970 --> 01:38:01.650
Dr Jameson: You know, help you process through some of that stuff and ground, you know, get yourself. Anyway, that may, that may be the answer to some of the anxiety, too. So

1122
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:07.710
Brittany Dingess: Maybe I mean I know, I know that there are a lot of things going on in my mind that I'm

1123
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:22.920
Brittany Dingess: not privy to like when I try to sleep. Sometimes I'll scream in my sleep. Yes. And you know everything. And I don't remember anything. So I don't know. You know, if it's something I'm remembering or what

1124
01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:24.600
Brittany Dingess: I'm

1125
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.610
Dr Jameson: Like maybe. Yeah, yeah.

1126
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:27.150
And

1127
01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:33.690
Dr Jameson: Repressed memories to, like, I mean I don't you raised by your grandparents. Right.

1128
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:39.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah, where your. That was the last little section I'm going to have to run again but I'm

1129
01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.540
Dr Jameson: Family History of addiction or

1130
01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:45.090
Brittany Dingess: Alcohol. My grandfather was an alcoholic.

1131
01:38:46.650 --> 01:39:00.150
Brittany Dingess: But he was not abusive to me, but he was like he was loud and like yelling all the time, but he was verbally and a few times, physically abusive to my grandmother

1132
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:03.660
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, so I mean there's a whole

1133
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:13.140
Brittany Dingess: There's a whole lot of stuff that I can and I don't care to talk about it to anybody because it is what it is you know

1134
01:39:14.850 --> 01:39:19.500
Dr Jameson: Maybe you don't have to tell me either, but that exactly thing, ding, ding, ding, ding, like that.

1135
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.170
Dr Jameson: Might be that stuff you're carrying around with you is

1136
01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:23.910
Dr Jameson: Part of what keeps you

1137
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:33.450
Brittany Dingess: There's a lot of saying you know i i do like I can tell you, you know, I know this is bothering me. I know this has bothered me like I know this has some impact on me.

1138
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:47.460
Brittany Dingess: And then there's some things that I'm just figuring out as I get older, or having an have had an impact on me that I previously didn't think mattered or didn't think had an impact on myself.

1139
01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:48.720
Brittany Dingess: And sometimes

1140
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:50.460
Brittany Dingess: We don't even remember. Yeah.

1141
01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.250
Brittany Dingess: Explain like I can

1142
01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.760
Brittany Dingess: I know I can't tell you why certain things or

1143
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:00.420
Brittany Dingess: Whatever make me feel the way they do.

1144
01:40:00.570 --> 01:40:03.660
Dr Jameson: Where your parents. What was the situation with them.

1145
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:14.700
Brittany Dingess: And my biological father was abusive to my mother. So when she had me. He didn't want man there was, I don't know if he

1146
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:26.370
Brittany Dingess: I think he put her like he beat beat her up pretty badly. And so, like, put me in protective custody of my maternal grandparents, and then they adopted me

1147
01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:37.530
Brittany Dingess: I have met my biological father and he says that everything they told me growing up that had happened is not what happened. Okay. So, I mean, I don't know.

1148
01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:39.630
Dr Jameson: Obviously happen so

1149
01:40:41.490 --> 01:40:43.740
Brittany Dingess: He claims they basically stole me

1150
01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:59.880
Brittany Dingess: Like, you know, not my mom has always been in my life. My biological mother. She's always been in my life. They just raised me when I was really little. They told me she was my sister. Mm hmm. Even though she had me when she was 21. Mm hmm.

1151
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:04.020
Dr Jameson: Did either of them have drug or alcohol issues.

1152
01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.350
Brittany Dingess: Hey, yeah. My biological father is an alcoholic.

1153
01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:14.310
Brittany Dingess: Is a long line of alcoholism that runs in my family long line. I mean, and I don't

1154
01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:23.580
Brittany Dingess: I only really know half of my family's history pretty well I've got half sisters and stuff that don't have any issues.

1155
01:41:24.690 --> 01:41:34.410
Brittany Dingess: But my my biological father, the whole time I have, you know, man. I get any kind of contact with him. And I actually lived up there. He lives in Indiana.

1156
01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:51.720
Brittany Dingess: I lived up there for a few years after I got in trouble with all the math stuff I move away to get away for everyone. And he drinks like a half gallon of whiskey in two nights every 90 days he's drunk and smokes pot every night, every single night.

1157
01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.000
Brittany Dingess: So,

1158
01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.250
Brittany Dingess: You know, so

1159
01:41:57.630 --> 01:41:59.370
Brittany Dingess: There's a few of the pieces of the puzzle.

1160
01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:01.980
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, everything is I don't like

1161
01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.010
Dr Jameson: Lost your grandfather. I mean, there's anyway so

1162
01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:05.880
Brittany Dingess: There's a lot of

1163
01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:06.690
Brittany Dingess: Yeah.

1164
01:42:06.810 --> 01:42:14.220
Brittany Dingess: And that's and then go into therapy and our therapy every three or four weeks is not helpful for me. I mean, it just doesn't

1165
01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:21.660
Brittany Dingess: Have time. Like, I can't go to an inpatient program know as much as I have thought about it.

1166
01:42:21.690 --> 01:42:23.700
Dr Jameson: Well look at you will get you on to a

1167
01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:29.430
Dr Jameson: Program. I don't know that. It'll be every week depends on the on the availability, hopefully, but

1168
01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:36.390
Brittany Dingess: Not every, every, yeah. Better than every. Mm hmm for six weeks or whatever.

1169
01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:49.530
Dr Jameson: The group every week, which you know you probably won't want to get into the weeds on all this stuff right in the group. But still, it will be some some some support last two questions before we go. How tall are you,

1170
01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:52.320
Brittany Dingess: Have 10 you're tall.

1171
01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:54.030
Dr Jameson: And how much do you weigh about

1172
01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:56.640
Brittany Dingess: 175

1173
01:42:59.130 --> 01:42:59.580
Alright.

1174
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:07.020
Dr Jameson: So you're going to pick up your prescription and then do we talk about yesterday, the group for tomorrow.

1175
01:43:07.770 --> 01:43:08.490
Brittany Dingess: Yes, at

1176
01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:12.960
Dr Jameson: noon eastern but you're going to check in about half an hour early

1177
01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:14.460
Dr Jameson: With the virtual clinic again.

1178
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.120
Brittany Dingess: Now, how long does that last is that three hours.

1179
01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:19.140
Dr Jameson: It's one hour.

1180
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:20.040
Brittany Dingess: One hour.

1181
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.700
Okay, yeah.

1182
01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.780
Brittany Dingess: The other brands that on the website about

1183
01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.290
Brittany Dingess: Like the I O P is like three three.

01:43:28.650 --> 01:43:29.670
Brittany Dingess: hour sessions.

1185
01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:31.290
Dr Jameson: So I was actually

1186
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:33.540
Dr Jameson: That might be the eating disorder wing of the

1187
01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.080
Brittany Dingess: Baby

1188
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:39.150
Dr Jameson: I don't know anything about it because I don't deal with it. But yeah, that's no we do in our group once a week.

1189
01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:40.650
Brittany Dingess: So I'll

Dr Jameson: Which

1203
01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.630
Dr Jameson: Suggests you'd be a great candidate to continue

1204
01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.470
Dr Jameson: I ran a curious report, which

1205
01:44:54.150 --> 01:44:55.680
Dr Jameson: Confirms her her

1206
01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.380

01:45:00.150 --> 01:45:01.140

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:11.550
Dr Jameson: We will start eight milligram film twice a day. I sent a week supply number 14 or refills, she will begin group tomorrow.

Dr Jameson: Will get a bio psychosocial scheduled you'll have her initial labs done

1210
01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:27.090
Dr Jameson: reviewed the structure of our program expectations rules for group, how to check in for group.

1211
01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:33.150
Dr Jameson: She's already quite familiar with Suboxone hasn't had any side effects.

1212
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:38.040
Dr Jameson: Doesn't have any questions regarding how it works.

1213
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:50.580
Dr Jameson: I sent a refill on her Wellbutrin tied to bridge her until she can find out new LOCAL PRIMARY CARE sounds like

1214
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:53.520
Dr Jameson: Anxiety and depression are still

1215
01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:03.600
Dr Jameson: Issues that are affecting her and I I definitely have a strong sense that she will benefit from individual counseling.

1216
01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:10.680
Dr Jameson: She's a remote history of suicidality, which has not been active for

1217
01:46:12.210 --> 01:46:13.440
Dr Jameson: At least seven

1218
01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:25.860
Dr Jameson: 414 at least 789 years or so.

1219
01:46:27.570 --> 01:46:27.990
Dr Jameson: She has a

1220
01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.010
Dr Jameson: Limited support system.

1221
01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:42.630
Dr Jameson: Which could potentially be a risk factor, but I provided her with several resources, including our virtual clinic.

1222
01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.350
Dr Jameson: encourage her to look into in the rooms.

1223
01:46:47.730 --> 01:46:51.570
Dr Jameson: And greater than 50% of this

1224
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:59.550
Dr Jameson: Visit was spent in counseling and discussion discussion of addiction treatment.

1225
01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:05.250
Dr Jameson: Also

1226
01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:09.330
Dr Jameson: As well as well as nutrition, exercise.

1227
01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:21.600
Dr Jameson: As treatment modalities for both addiction and depression. Then we had Brittany.

1228
01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:28.770
Dr Jameson: dingus back for the conclusion of her extreme physical from yesterday.

1229
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:32.700
Dr Jameson: So I completed I finished.

1230
01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:37.140
Dr Jameson: Teaching her her history.

1231
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:52.290
Dr Jameson: Mental Status and physical our normal. I feel like we should just make one big note and maybe bill it for today because

1232
01:47:53.880 --> 01:48:02.520
Dr Jameson: It was really kind of an incomplete visit yesterday. I mean, I don't think we should build it twice. Anyway, so I'm going to just kind of add to the the note from yesterday.

1233
01:48:04.530 --> 01:48:06.600
Dr Jameson: Mental Status and physical or normal

1234
01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:09.300
She has

1235
01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:11.040
Dr Jameson: Like

1236
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:20.100
Dr Jameson: Previous scars from previous piercings along her upper lower lip.

1237
01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.830
Dr Jameson: otherwise normal o u d severe number one.

1238
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:28.290
Dr Jameson: Number two.

1239
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:33.990
Dr Jameson: Anxiety.

1240
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.070
Dr Jameson: Plan.

1241
01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:53.250
Dr Jameson: Patient has had inadequate control of her cravings and withdrawal symptoms on support supplicate over the past nine months.

1242
01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.340
Dr Jameson: Felt that the box on Mark Mar completely for her.

1243
01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:02.820
Dr Jameson: I

1244
01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:10.890
Dr Jameson: Recommend she start with a half tablet, a day since her last supplicate injection was less than a month ago.

1245
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.130
Dr Jameson: And she may have a lower need for

1246
01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:22.350
Dr Jameson: Additional buprenorphine at this time she's going to start in weekly group tomorrow.

1247
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.930
Dr Jameson: And

1248
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:49.140
Dr Jameson: We'll get her a bio psychosocial she's gonna have our initial labs done I discussed the structure of our program, I guess all the same stuff that I said for the last one, and I agree. Again, that will benefit greatly from counseling to help deal with some unresolved PTSD and anxiety issues.

1249
01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:02.010
Dr Jameson: And that is the she has a prescription ready to be picked up at the pharmacy that I had sent yesterday.

1250
01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:08.190
Dr Jameson: And that is

1251
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.370
Dr Jameson: The end for her.
