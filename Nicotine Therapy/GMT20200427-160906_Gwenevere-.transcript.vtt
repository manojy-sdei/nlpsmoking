00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.880
Jaime C: My walls are still empty and my new bedroom.

3
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't sure if that was like an empty hotel room or something or what

4
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.360
Jaime C: Oh no, see, there's my bed.

5
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We got you.

6
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.340
So I'm gonna

7
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Open up a note here. I apologize for my tardiness I should just make it 10 after and I just forget I just forget I forget because that group makes me late

8
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.710
Jaime C: Okay. I mean, I

9
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the one that's late because I want to address issues, you know,

10
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.150
Yeah.

11
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

12
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a note open here, just take some time, as I'm doing this kind of busying administrative part to just think about kind of what you want out of today and see if we can help you.

13
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that whether it's an emotion or maybe relief. Or maybe there's specific work on a topic that you want to do.

14
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You can focus there.

15
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And just notice if you need to use the restroom, if you need something to drink can take care of that now. Good timing.

16
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.540
Jaime C: Yeah, okay.

17
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you had that extra time to

18
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.320
Yeah.

19
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I've got a note open here and I'm

20
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Smiling. All right, so what's kind of React right now. What's it like to be you.

21
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.460
Jaime C: Um, everything seems really good

22
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.150
Jaime C: Really good right now I'm

23
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.560
Jaime C: Really the only thing that I am a little stressed out about his work.

24
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.590
Jaime C: I just opened an email this morning when I woke up at the general managers will be taking a 20% salary cut

25
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of knew this was coming.

26
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but seeing it can be quite a shocker. Huh.

27
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.060
Jaime C: Yeah, I was really hoping wasn't going to happen, but

28
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.970
Jaime C: But

29
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.450
Jaime C: They're saying it's only till June. So that's only three paychecks.

30
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.670
Jaime C: So I think, I mean, I still be okay.

31
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.400
Jaime C: Just stressful.

32
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to impact your life do you think that 20% cut

33
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.020
Jaime C: Um,

34
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.140
Jaime C: Well i mean i i did a I rewrote a budget last week when they told us it could possibly be happening.

35
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:47.880
Jaime C: And it's just me all my bills and everything are still going to be paid just fine, just going to type not going to have extra money to do anything.

36
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.200
Jaime C: So just going to be very tight.

37
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.350
Jaime C: But it'll it's totally doable.

38
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's yours. Your son know you're going through this

39
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.680
No.

40
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.930
Jaime C: No.

41
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.690
Jaime C: No, he seems to

42
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.370
Jaime C: I don't know i. He seems like he stresses way too much on my life and things that I do. So I just

43
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.200
Jaime C: rather not.

44
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

45
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, things are going pretty well for him.

46
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.700
Yeah.

47
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It seemed like is he able to still keep

48
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: His job and what he was doing, or is that changed.

49
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.450
Jaime C: Yeah, he's still doing

50
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what kind of work is he doing eating, eating get for loader.

51
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.050
Jaime C: And he well he's working in the in the shop.

52
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.770
Again,

53
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A car shop.

54
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.800
Jaime C: Yeah.

55
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go.

56
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.280
Jaime C: And I guess his, his girlfriend has been working too. So I think that kind of

57
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.590
Jaime C: Is helping him.

58
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.730
Jaime C: Want to work, I guess.

59
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She said,

60
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.820
Yeah.

61
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about your

62
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your heart is your heart doing as far as the loneliness of that breakup.

63
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.740
Jaime C: It still bothers me.

64
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.190
Jaime C: And I guess it bothers me more than I thought. Because now I feel emotional about it right now. As soon as you asked.

65
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.340
Jaime C: But I have been making it a point to

66
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.900
Jaime C: You know, talk to my family more every day and

67
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.510
Jaime C: And trying to reach out to just kind of friends that I know around here. I'm trying to keep myself busy.

68
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.800
Jaime C: It doesn't know. Like, I've had, I've had heartbreak in my life before but

69
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.540
Jaime C: This is the first time that it has gotten worse the longer it goes on.

70
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.920
Jaime C: Yeah.

71
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you remember some of the

72
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Things you talked about last time that were kind of unique about this particular breakup to

73
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.250
To remember

74
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

75
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

76
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to jump in here on the note.

77
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I would have thought about that before confronting him clients sort of realize as possible causes and concurrency. I have a lot of regret lets you

78
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.770
Know,

79
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't feel like he hates me. I feel he thinks he's doing me a favor wants me to be with someone who can be there every day.

80
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, different. It's a different kind of break up.

81
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: He does not like it when I feel bad when I talk to him about it. He shuts down

82
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Invited contemplation on needs and changing physical presence would be nice but I was happy with our relationship did not feel like I was missing out on anything.

83
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that didn't feel I was missing out on anything. And I'm not with him.

84
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: He thinks I needed with someone else. I wasn't missing out on anything he thinks I need to be with someone else. This is getting worse.

85
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you thinking about those parts.

86
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.390
Jaime C: I guess.

87
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:51.210
Jaime C: I don't know what I'm thinking. I feel like I'm going 100 miles an hour. And I thought, so much about it, that it just

88
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.140
Jaime C: None of it even makes any sense anymore.

89
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if there's something unsaid to him. I'm wondering if you had it to do over again and you heard that he had talked to his daughter. What would you say to him.

90
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.440
Jaime C: I mean, it would definitely wouldn't have gone that way, the way that

91
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.330
Jaime C: It would have, I would have been 100% fine.

92
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It would have been 100% fine.

93
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:24.870
Jaime C: Yeah.

94
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, well, there you go. That's why you're so miserable. You are you blaming yourself.

95
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.560
Jaime C: I think so.

96
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But 100% fine is the outcome. And what I've asked you is if I'm him. What would you said

97
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:57.720
Jaime C: If he would have told me I was talking to my daughter, because I only have so much time, I would have just said, Okay, well I'm glad to hear from you and I'm glad you're okay.

98
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That isn't how you seal.

99
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:20.640
Jaime C: I will that at the time that it happened that was my issue was that I was worried sick about him my keys in the middle of Mexico hunting. These guys I was worried

100
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:28.710
Jaime C: And so when I jump on the other app and see that he is online. I'd like my mind just

101
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.290
Jaime C: went straight to negative straight to negative something he's doing something wrong to me.

102
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.950
Jaime C: If my emotions.

103
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.220
Jaime C: went through the roof. Okay.

104
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.880
Jaime C: So notice it wasn't hearing anything that he was telling me.

105
00:09:50.880 --> 00:10:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes people will act down to no show how they feel, by having this other person feel the distress that we're feeling that way. They have empathy and they can relate to us.

106
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But this time.

107
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you shared with him. You know how you said, My emotions were going through the roof.

108
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you actually think that it's okay to say that

109
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: My emotions are going through the roof. I was thinking, this and this and this and these 10 different things.

110
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But

111
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed you didn't say that. You said, well,

112
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: glad you're okay, right. But when I dug a little deeper, you are going through a lot

113
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And had to do over, you would just have done what with your emotions going through the roof, they still would have been there, you get that

114
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.190
Jaime C: I do, I do get that I just

115
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.010
Jaime C: I felt at the time I felt like

116
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:20.820
Jaime C: I was worried to death about him and he had the I. The way I saw it was he had the ability to take that from me to help me not worry anymore and

117
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.580
Jaime C: And he chose not to. That's how I thought at the time.

118
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So I he could have helped me and he didn't

119
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.580
Jaime C: Yeah.

120
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And what meaning to make out of that he sitting with that don't explain it away. Just the meaning about what that says about you.

121
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you did something with it.

122
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.620
Jaime C: I just go wrong all the way around, like everything I just

123
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.890
Jaime C: He doesn't deserve to have somebody to take their emotions out on him all the time. So,

124
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why we bother to be in relationships with people.

125
00:12:49.980 --> 00:13:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so we can share and have a witness to our journey. That's not taking your emotions out on him. It's inviting him on the journey with you.

126
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But

127
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the same thing.

128
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a burden to hear what you're going through. It's a privilege.

129
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine that this relationship. I don't know what it is but

130
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If both of you have a misunderstanding. What if both if you have a misunderstanding. But if you're not together because of a misunderstanding.

131
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.810
Jaime C: That would be ridiculous.

132
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder why it keeps getting worse a longer and longer year away.

133
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.430
Jaime C: Right, like there's so much like it just shouldn't be this way. It shouldn't

134
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:59.340
Jaime C: Every other breakup. I've had my life or, you know, heartache. I've been through, like, it makes sense. I get it. And it just it

135
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.120
Jaime C: Like there's ending to it.

136
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.840
Jaime C: This one just doesn't make sense. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't make sense at all. I can't I just

137
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.520
Jaime C: Don't get

138
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.400
Jaime C: I don't get how we go from

139
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.690
Jaime C: Five years of being in each other's lives to just, bam, nothing.

140
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.000
Jaime C: Over what

141
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell. Jamie if it's that each of you has a shirt. He has when you should be with someone that you have close contact with

142
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's making up that story and you're making up story. You should be with a woman that doesn't take their emotions out on you. And he's like, you don't

143
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're both maybe sitting here. That's what I mean by what's the meaning that you're making out of these things that might be what a misunderstanding is or it could be any number of other things.

144
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe right. I don't know the guy seeing someone else.

145
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he, is he really trying to protect you in some way. And this is what protection looks like.

146
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All you have is your truth. And I don't know that you've even told him fully

147
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been privileged to it.

148
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But a lot of good that does

149
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:25.740
Great.

150
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If we stop saying, I don't want to hurt your feelings I I shouldn't be it, you just stick with the part you do know you stick with your truth which is

151
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I was so worried

152
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were dead.

153
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I spent hours and hours and hours.

154
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And the shock of seeing that you've been communicating with someone

155
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is the part I want you to tell me what did it mean to you.

156
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: When I saw them. What did you say about you when you saw that

157
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.420
Jaime C: I was just

158
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.500
Jaime C: An insecure.

159
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's a judgment.

160
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not it either. You're almost there.

161
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: When you saw that he was communicating on that app to his daughter, and you had to worry

162
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the I Am. That's the belief about the self. That's what I'm trying to get out. Is the meaning I'm what

163
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit there a little longer, I think, I think it's their

164
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. You can you can go to the solution. I'm just, you can judge yourself with insecure.

165
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What does an insecure person believe about themselves.

166
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: In that moment.

167
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.170
Jaime C: I'm not good enough. And I'm not

168
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.570
Jaime C: Important

169
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not important.

170
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You had to choose on who to take care of who to help

171
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you picked someone else doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong, his daughter, you and I, we already. I already know you get all that second level stuff. But this is a, I think a trauma event just got

172
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Button got pushed on that one. I'm not important. It's too intense you're worried about someone safety you're worried about someone else's life like are they helping your care UK so much going into that fret during that day and then to see this.

173
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I think an old an old register of that that experience of having to care about someone else and they're not meeting that basic need of Karen about you. I think it just got pushed

174
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and so the reaction was, what you said emotions through the roof. Just this mixture of maybe sadness and fear and anger and like sad and maybe even jealousy or whatever. I mean just complicated stuff coming out yet.

175
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. Great.

176
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And your recipe between you two is not a direct line of communication, being able to say

177
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That which is the confusion describing, to the best of your human ability to very difficult thing to explain to someone emotional confusion.

178
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And they thought that you're both having an in the moment reaction to what's happening and registering some awareness that the dial is up higher because of your family of origin.

179
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are hard to do.

180
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to do for really bright people really people that are psychologically minded, we can't do it because we're hijacked by the emotion because emotions are through the roof, which you've had time

181
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, time has passed, and you're not together.

182
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not, why not telling me why couldn't we just

183
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you learn

184
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To share with him.

185
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: After reflection, which you think was going on.

186
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.270
Jaime C: If you

187
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If you detach from outcome if you said, I just want to

188
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Share with him my confusion and the emotions that were all over instead of

189
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to solution which is we can't be together. If you're going to be like this and you're going a bit of a bit of everybody but everywhere, right, you go to solution because you're, you're a problem solver and it's an amazing skill you have

190
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But it was, it means you don't sit very long with. Notice how how hard I've kind of like, well, what does it say about you. What does anybody. It's taken us a bit right to get there.

191
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's really uncomfortable. It's a lot easier to just go, well, if we just have already a solution in place. I don't have to feel this. I've already got some in place. So just dealt with this lovely villa.

192
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you kind of do that with him to, well, what would I do differently. Well, everything would have been just fine. Well, but you still would have been met with all of this shock.

193
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.340
Jaime C: Yeah.

194
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of us don't know what to do right in the moment. That's what shock is we're not expecting it. We're shocked.

195
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But this more skilled you're catching it right right in your body in the chest and the gut and finding it. Oh my gosh, it's happening. I got to take a minute. Let's talk later or I or you take

196
00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It. I'm just taking a breath. This is getting some really shocking information kind of work through this right now. You know, we don't really talk like that we're used to being very bright very smart with a quick response.

197
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start over. Now that we did all of that. Notice we did all this work. Now, let me go back to my original question.

198
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm Greg.

199
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you do differently ever so slightly.

200
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.600
Jaime C: Made me feel

201
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. That's the one.

202
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And we don't we don't do it because we're trying to manipulate someone we're trying to persuade them to move, what their, their experiences. His, His experience. And we might be missing big chunks of information we do it because

203
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's feels good to be authentic, it feels good. Like, I met that moment with integrity and I didn't act out. I, I just, I love this with clarity. I was clear to the best of my human ability. I said it like it is.

204
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah and if that's the piece that's missing. If you can detach from outcome, meaning. Maybe he'll just say, Okay, thanks for sharing.

205
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But at least you were clear because guess what he can't make a choice. Kenny when it's based on faulty information.

206
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, he might see you as angry jealous. I don't know how we would see it, but he's basing his on on that, on that behavior and then each of you are doing. He

207
00:22:45.690 --> 00:23:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that's not a relate shin ship that's not a relating that's two pieces of misinformation making solutions and decisions on Miss information. And I'm wondering if that's why this continues to sit there

208
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: As. Why are we apart. Why we apart, where we don't get it. I don't get it.

209
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you think enough

210
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.900
Jaime C: I mean, it just makes sense. A it all.

211
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:26.880
Jaime C: Makes sense why it would still be sitting with it. It just feels like there's so many loose ends to it and so much regret that.

212
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.040
Jaime C: I don't know how to let that go.

213
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.480
Jaime C: I don't want to feel this way anymore.

214
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What harm on it if you told them what you're really going through Z worst case, let's do the play at plan all the way through scale.

215
00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Get all the way through it. Worst case he hears it, worst case, he says, what

216
00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.400
Jaime C: The worst case is that he would totally not even say a word and I feel rejected. Yeah.

217
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So he'd be silent, and I would feel rejected.

218
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

219
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what let's play it all the way out. Most people stop right there. It's catastrophic and then stop speaking here, but go all the way forward, then I'm rejected, then one

220
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.930
Jaime C: And then I got to sit with that rejection for however long I don't know.

221
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:42.210
Jaime C: Shortly after this happened. I did reach out to him and asked him if we could just talk about it and he read the message and never responded so I'm scared to death of that rejection

222
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.430
Jaime C: I don't want to tell somebody how I feel. And it not matter to them.

223
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To have a belief.

224
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

225
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So there it is not mattering you're looking

226
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: At the face you're looking at words or the absence meaning no response.

227
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You said your truth and it looks like what you're going through. Doesn't matter to the person

228
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what

229
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.870
Jaime C: Is it just have to wait for it to be over to vilify anymore.

230
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let time he'll wait you let time

231
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let time pass me

232
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what

233
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:55.650
Jaime C: I don't know. It's hard to think past that it's hard because it's been such an ache and my chest bird is three months now.

234
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this is difficult, but that's what this this particular technique does is it pushes hard at the imagination.

235
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So, time has passed months have passed and you have had to sit with this sense of my truth doesn't matter, based on what I see, or the absence

236
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Of any response. My interpretation have to sit with this meaning my interpretation of someone's behavior as I don't matter what I'm going through doesn't matter. I'm sitting with it. So anyway, then again and again and it passes and what happens after six months have passed.

237
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

238
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you guess that's what this whole thing is we're guessing. So then what so time has passed. It's seven months now and then what happens next.

239
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.550
Jaime C: Hopefully I would be over by then.

240
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What will take its place that ache in the chest. What will take its place.

241
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.390
Jaime C: No idea.

242
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.460
Jaime C: What we take it.

243
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That ache in the chest. Is this the same ache.

244
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: since you were a little girl, and no one understanding and not understanding, no one really

245
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing Right Mom not seeing it that ache that it matters as if somehow you're the crazy person.

246
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're going through doesn't matter.

247
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.490
Jaime C: Yeah.

248
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.580
Jaime C: I'm not sure why would even go away and six and seven.

249
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.560
Yeah.

250
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We gotta get out that original eight

251
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What nothing about a Greg a me a girlfriend, a friend, a man is going to get affiliate going to fix it. Gotta

252
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Address that core ache.

253
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to say something else. If we move if we keep doing this technique, all the way through that we digress for a moment. Let's come back to this technique which is playing it.

254
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:36.960
Oh,

255
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep going. I know it's uncomfortable and it's unchartered feels like I'm not giving this woman, the right answer, but you are

256
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're doing it perfectly. So now it's seven months and it's eight months.

257
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what

258
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.240
Jaime C: hopefully by then I could just move on. Maybe start dating.

259
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What does this say about

260
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You

261
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.200
Jaime C: What does that say about me.

262
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You've moved on. So I've moved on. I'm dating.

263
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can find the I Am the belief about the self projecting eight 910 months forward.

264
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.200
Jaime C: Don't know. It's hard to, it's hard to

265
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:55.920
Jaime C: It's hard to go through it all the way, because I don't want to. I don't want to date. I don't have it. I just don't good with where I'm out. But hey,

266
00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, I'm good with that. What is that I am what

267
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.010
Jaime C: I am

268
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.190
Jaime C: Okay, being single.

269
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm just okay

270
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with that I'm okay. Right. I'm not too, too. Sneaky, but that's definitely a direction I was fine. That's the destination. You're right there. You just got to it. I'm okay.

271
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right catastrophic catastrophic awful, awful, awful and we stop right there instead of pushing all the way through, because

272
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You have been

273
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Shown by people's faces. Their inaction that what you are going through is not important. That's what has happened.

274
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're okay.

275
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

276
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: single mom, and yeah, kicking ass at work and 20% drop and you're still going to show up to work and you're going to kick ass and you started today saying things are pretty good. My son's very well.

278
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you have ever imagined playing out what you did in your life. Did you ever think you could play that out like that.

279
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: No, and you're okay, you're okay.

280
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Some days are better than others. Some days are hard so hard.

281
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:32.130
Jaime C: Yeah.

282
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna be okay.

283
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: whichever direction.

284
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Decide to tell your truth that will be a different version of okay

285
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You already faced

286
00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The responsive. I'm not important. You've already lived it. You fixed it, you lived there for years as a little girl and as an adult. Your mother hasn't changed much from that position.

287
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You have of all the people all the skills necessary to handle someone's reaction or the lack of reaction.

288
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But you could do it conscious this time.

289
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is different.

290
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you went unconscious, meaning you are emotionally hijacked during that call because you were in shock.

291
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.130
Jaime C: Yeah.

292
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you rather this relationship ended with false data misunderstandings, or that it ended.

293
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Or he knew exactly

294
00:32:53.820 --> 00:33:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth. And then he could make a decision. At least his response could be based on accurate information.

295
00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Life's not dumb down to just two choices. But those are the ones that I'm kind of bringing up right now.

296
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.870
Jaime C: I don't know, I just feel

297
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:31.230
Jaime C: I almost feel like if I would have been honest with him about how I truly felt and it still ended, I would have hated that. I hated that.

298
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.160
Jaime C: I want to hate it.

299
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Even worse.

300
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Truth.

301
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And the truth about me was rejected. Like, even worse, like that.

302
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:45.750
Yeah.

303
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that makes sense. At least this way. There's room that there was just this misunderstanding and and maybe

304
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We would happily ever after it.

305
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: sounds logical

306
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It might also keep you from falling in love again know

307
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I worry

308
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.770
Jaime C: No, sorry, I can see that.

309
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I notice how part of your, your, I'm okay process was in the ammo can, you know, buddy.

310
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:30.780
Jaime C: Yeah.

311
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard that in there that concerned me

312
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.220
Jaime C: Was definitely not a good. I want to feel again.

313
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple of things on that.

314
00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

315
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Some reprocessing of that so it can live more in the past might be convenient. But this one, maybe a combination of living all of those aches all at once, in real time, and a new fresh one and a catastrophic feeling that it has a life threatening feeling

316
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But even if we do all of that work. I'm still going to say to you.

317
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Tough shit.

318
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I going to say, don't fall in love. What am I going to say the richness of

319
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in love with your son, it'll show up there, it'll still be it, we can't bypass or our need to love and be loved and you you're born with it.

320
00:35:48.540 --> 00:36:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What conformity meeting a marriage looks like, No, I don't mean that I just mean love what in its many forms, it means there's going to be a horrible ache.

321
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Same way, losing your animal was like this, who wants this. This is awful. It was awful.

322
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.560
Yeah.

323
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But none of that even in the sort of fantasy that projection that we were doing.

324
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm guessing, because this one isn't done. There's no closure to it. It's just

325
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So when there's this one. How I something else, opening up

326
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be okay. Even if you tell the real truth and he still doesn't want it.

327
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But then, you know, it's done.

328
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.750
Jaime C: Scary here to think about

329
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What about using other assumptions and conclusions. What about that as an idea that

330
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This conclusion that you've come up with the one where he rejects you

331
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Know why that conclusion over the one where he can't

332
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Get past the fact that he's made up his mind about what you need and he's not yet I could really be that one.

333
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: He's made up a story about what you need. And he knows he can't give it to you. And he's saying goodbye made this like an excuse, but it's just a convenient one for him.

334
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not that one.

335
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the 100 million others.

336
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice automatic. One is the year not good enough. You're the rejected party.

337
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:26.670
Jaime C: I mean that that is how that's how I feel when I put that emotion away and just think about it logically and just knowing him.

338
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:37.830
Jaime C: I do think that I do think that he thinks that, you know, with his job and everything. He can't give me the kind of relationship that he thinks I deserve and therefore, he's done.

339
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.780
Jaime C: Logically 100%. That sounds like him.

340
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.000
Jaime C: Is we would have that conversation, specifically

341
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is your comfort zone, your normal

342
00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It is what is familiar to you to want that exact person that is unavailable to you. It is just the paradox of the way your childhood has shaped what you want and expect from a romantic relationship.

343
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to want the thing

344
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can have unavailable to not because of a flying you there was never any flaw in you. There's nothing wrong with you.

345
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's so familiar to be wanting to be leaning towards and

346
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Have it be unavailable.

347
00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:01.230
Jaime C: Just trying to keep myself busy and occupied. It was kind of hoping things will that

348
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about some ways that you're important to tell me

349
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.160
Jaime C: I run a multimillion dollar business every day.

350
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.240
Jaime C: I have about 30 people on my staff that rely on me every day.

351
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Else.

352
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In other areas, besides your work for how important

353
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.840
Jaime C: My son, my son, definitely reliance me right now.

354
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: For what

355
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.600
Jaime C: For his

356
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.860
Jaime C: His emotional stability, he relies on every day.

357
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.980
Jaime C: In financially and all that other stuff, but

358
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:42.690
Jaime C: Emotionally that kid definitely is at a place where he's relying on me.

359
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

360
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Son

361
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you, important to you.

362
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I was what you want what you need.

363
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Important

364
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you recognize that piece that's missing. Would you recognize it in your son, if he wasn't attend to it.

365
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:12.660
Jaime C: Yeah.

366
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: ourselves a lot easier to see it already, so

367
00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If you, if you are watching him. You'd be like, oh,

368
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What would he be doing

369
00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.120
Jaime C: Just terrible internal dialogue. I'm sorry, I noticed

370
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.300
Jaime C: Like is is still talk is just terrible.

371
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what to see me.

372
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because negative self talk. What does the end up doing or not doing

373
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.200
Jaime C: Overly

374
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:11.100
Jaime C: Emotional. Emotional about certain situations, just like silly things and it's like

375
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:20.070
Jaime C: They don't got, like, he'll be fighting with his girlfriend or something and then he just goes off about how terrible person he is, and he doesn't deserve to live and

376
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:22.800
Jaime C: Yeah.

377
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.480
Jaime C: It goes from zero to 100 is so talk

378
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.290
Jaime C: Negative way.

379
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:32.280
Right.

380
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, what's that

381
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What I was doing earlier. I'm

382
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: No good.

383
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: He goes there.

384
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Early

385
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: checking in on yours to see where years went right and you went to sort of this. I'm not important.

386
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see it in your son.

387
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if it's similar to emotions to

388
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero to 100

389
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that if you don't see

390
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Your importance if you don't really truly believe it.

391
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Then emotion can be that register that something's really off.

392
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see it in your son, it's harder to to know it in itself.

393
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you

394
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: kind, compassionate self soothing.

395
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Understand understanding of you. Where does that show up.

396
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.520
Jaime C: I don't feel like I really worry about myself very much

397
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.920
Jaime C: When it comes to the bad parts.

398
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, that's really familiar.

399
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, not worrying about you.

400
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what Greg did right he didn't worry about doesn't care and that all comes back.

401
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To making sure that you know deep down inside that you're important

402
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're experiencing.

403
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is equal to what I'm experiencing equal to his and hers. It is not an exchange.

404
00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: They happen at the same time. If somebody gets the attention the spotlight gets to be on them for a second, but it doesn't diminish your important men, the spotlight gets onto you and you're giving it away to someone else.

405
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it.

406
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

407
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're experiencing is important, even if no one else thinks

408
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really, really find out if you have positive self talk

409
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see it happening in your son. And boy, I bet you wish. Boy, where she thought better himself.

410
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.230
Jaime C: Yeah.

411
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And look what he does, we hurt himself. Oh, he almost like suicide. Oh, that's so scary. Oh dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. And you can see it in our children and we can worry. Oh.

412
00:47:51.150 --> 00:48:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But look, when I asked you to do the same thing, right. Do it. You go in and see how you're doing in there and you're like, well good at this. I'm good at this and I'm good over here.

413
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But that containing that that holding space and compassion for you.

414
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That call might have gone down differently because she would have known deep inside what I'm frickin going through is really important. Right now I'm in shock.

415
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I completely

416
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this through the roof.

417
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so confused.

418
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might have asked different questions you might have asked questions at all. I don't even know.

419
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You would hold on to you.

420
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And not went to a solution which is right, maybe an ultimatum or something, I don't know how the conversation went

421
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: These things these quarterly saucy. I'm not important.

422
00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: They creep up in the oddest of places know expecting them to be there. They just like how could this still be operating. I'm so mature. I'm so responsible. You are all those things.

423
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But you do them for others. She gave it away.

424
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe get some fun if you want to. For homework about if you did know deep down inside that you were important truly meeting all of whatever you were gone through in the moment. Wonder how that conversation might have gone

425
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.630
Jaime C: A whole lot different.

426
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And we already know you're going to be okay.

427
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. Like that one out.

428
00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But also my mean

429
00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: More than okay right you got to read the story. One of those sort of pivotal childhood moments where have a choice I either stay in my truth or divert to someone else's needs again this might have been maybe a healing moment.

430
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Jamie

431
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Did a lot of talking today.

432
00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I talked a lot at night.

433
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe kind of what you're noticing about today as we bring this session to a close.

434
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.920
Jaime C: I feel like I just have to figure out

435
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.450
Jaime C: How to be better to myself. Yeah.

436
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be a great big, you know,

437
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All your favorite stuff. It can be nice and slow. Like, no thank you. I, I really prefer to go to a different restaurant when there's a choice with someone, or no, I prefer this it can be nice and easy can be just slow, but they can nourish the soul.

438
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Speaking your truth I would prefer this. It's not a bit selfish. It's and I prefer. It's a little

439
00:51:50.280 --> 00:52:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll get back to you in 15 minutes or right. It's that it's protecting that space, you had set a schedule. Stick with it. It's all it comes up like that like a little ways where you are, what you need, what you want.

440
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you hold on to it and you don't give it up.

441
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It reinforces that mean what's important to

442
00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be a big grand gesture, they can be a little

443
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But they added to a lifetime of sending a message to yourself to your son. You matter.

444
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what he can model it to

445
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you could say.

446
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been working on it. Have you seen me sign DC it. I've been doing it here and there and there will be. Yeah, you were. I was

447
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

448
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you might say, you can do that to

449
00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Love doesn't mean 100% sacrifice. It means a little bit of it's this ebb and flow.

450
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to schedule a meeting or for follow up.

451
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.110
Jaime C: Yeah.

452
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing this five weekly thing.

453
00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.610
Jaime C: Yeah yeah

454
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:30.990
Jaime C: So when I sat down and figured out my budget. I'm not sure. I mean, well, I have no idea what's okay with you guys. But if I do

455
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:38.070
Jaime C: So if I in four week period. If I do a one on one with you and a group

456
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:43.890
Jaime C: And pay for my meds. That's $315 a month still

457
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:50.910
Jaime C: But that's doable for me. Would we be able to get away with doing that for just the month.

458
00:53:53.760 --> 00:54:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I do see a little something here. I think some someone in California, the scales trying to hold a meeting on May 11 from 1030 to 1130

459
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.790

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to just put I got to think about whether that really is a meeting, I need to attend. But I'm going to put your name in here for May 11 to 10

462
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:31.680
