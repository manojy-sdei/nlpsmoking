8
00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:05.100
Serenna Beers: That's really embarrassing, especially when you get to know someone and then you realize, as you're speaking with them and you go to set them up for a follow up and you realize you're not their therapist.

9
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.920

17
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:15.420

20
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:35.550
Christopher Freeman: Wow. And then they like that was just like, good to go for like seven years straight. He just sort of danced around these issues in my back and never really got anything done. And then, uh,

21
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:45.150
Christopher Freeman: The one day is to people that didn't work. There's my doctor's office. I was there. They were testing the urine testing everybody and there's

22
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.390
Christopher Freeman: Like they got in trouble. There was

23
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.040
Christopher Freeman: Wow. Yeah. I drove for something and then they just went through and they didn't have the right amount of them. The pills in my system.

24
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.490

Serenna Beers: Okay.

27
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.790
Christopher Freeman: So I just left.

28
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:18.720
Christopher Freeman: Is a raging junkie. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know heroin. I didn't want to do hairline know heroin. Was I just did the toe game around heroin is like recently.

29
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.920
Serenna Beers: Where that's where you at,

30
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.460
Now,

31
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.700
Christopher Freeman: That went on, then that kind of a see ruined first marriage.

32
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.400
Serenna Beers: Make sense. Right. Yeah.

33
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.010
Christopher Freeman: I

34
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.110
Christopher Freeman: Pretty much stabilize with a different doctor, lot less medication and then got rid of him to after a while, moved. Moved out of area and then I

35
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:53.190
Christopher Freeman: Want to go find the Methadone clinic in Modesto what I moved closer like kids. So then down here. I didn't, I just was looking around, I know this is methadone clinic and

36
00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.630
Christopher Freeman: I checked it out and they does ages and as I said I was there for about three years. And I got, I can't go there every day, my, my legs shot back shot.

37
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:14.220
Christopher Freeman: They um it's too much back and forth going to ride my bicycle everywhere. And it was just too much of a big hassle to go there with all the people that stuff all the time.

38
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:24.990
Christopher Freeman: So I just started trying to find something different. I completely wean myself off of ages down to one milligram of methadone per day and I just walked out of there. And I started anxiety.

39
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:44.160
Christopher Freeman: And I stayed pretty clean for about three or four months and and I just, this is like nagging like underlying pain and nagging you know for opiates is kind of just flooding back to smoking heroin, a little here and there and that turned into smoking heroin every day and

40
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:57.270
Christopher Freeman: So now I need to curb that before it gets way out of hand. It's a good I know my my times is there's there's no limit to went on. It's like a can just go as high as it can go. I just, I don't want to get anywhere in here like what I was

41
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.830
Serenna Beers: Yeah. Wow.

42
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.610
And

43
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.740
Christopher Freeman: I start waking up sick again and I got Jesus, I gotta do something. Yeah.

44
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:15.690
Serenna Beers: Yeah, so what are you on now. Like this. So are you established with our doctor, I saw that you see Dr. Jackson. So what does she have you on now.

Serenna Beers: Okay.

47
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.450
Serenna Beers: Awesome. Okay. And how is that working

48
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.710
Christopher Freeman: It's um it was a little much at first one is fine. Now, it was pretty good for this. I can't take anymore.

49
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.150
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

50
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.050
Christopher Freeman: Fall Asleep over

51
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:46.140
Serenna Beers: Well, I just noticed. And that's the reason that I asked is, like, how long because I noticed that you that that your eyelids were kind of doing this they imagine that you're adjusting which I wanted to ask

52
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.140
Christopher Freeman: That was, that was, she was really

53
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.450
Christopher Freeman: Focused on pain to

54
00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:04.800
Christopher Freeman: Taking care of pain to send. So that was it kind of makes it a different approach for me, like, like, which we're going to go like and via an ag being treated or am I going to actually get my painting care of a little bit. So with the painting here a little bit. I mean it.

55
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:14.310
Christopher Freeman: feels, it feels nice. I mean, I have heard, for I have a couple of slip disc in my neck and gnosis in my neck and it, it hurts, all the time. So,

56
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.690
Serenna Beers: Oh God, this

57
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.220
Christopher Freeman: Wave of it once in a while.

58
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.430
Serenna Beers: What is your, what is your daily like so what is your baseline pain.

59
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.320
Christopher Freeman: Baseline without anything is probably the seven eight. It can be more

60
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:39.690
Christopher Freeman: It can be off the chain, it can be like if I did something strenuous or twisted funny. I can be end up for a couple days, but usually it's about if I don't, before I take anything I wake up at about seven

61
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.300
Christopher Freeman: Rather annoyed.

62
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.550
Christopher Freeman: And irritated and in a bad mood with it. It's just like, it's like someone drilling.

63
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.940
Christopher Freeman: Something that my neck. Oh.

64
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.080
Gosh.

65
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.570
Serenna Beers: Oh, that that's the

66
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.860
Christopher Freeman: End of my shoulder blades.

67
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:12.690
Serenna Beers: Um, so do you. Well, I, I assume that you you attend a week, a weekly group. When is that, you know, like how you do a pain management group or

68
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.260
Yeah.

69
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.080
Christopher Freeman: It's, um, I'm not sure. I went to. I went to the first one and

70
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.800
Christopher Freeman: I can tell you it was just

71
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.850
Christopher Freeman: We just talked about stuff we do a little art exercise.

72
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.770
Christopher Freeman: And it's every Thursday. I know that every Thursday. You're every other

73
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.260
Christopher Freeman: Every other week.

74
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.970
Serenna Beers: Do you know, D. Do you know who the physician is

75
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:58.140
Serenna Beers: No. Okay, I just wonder, because I'm trying to think if you're in my groups or not. And I don't remember seeing your face, because I do a Thursday 4pm group. But if yours is every other week, then I don't think it's the same one. So,

76
00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.880
Serenna Beers: In any case,

77
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.400
Christopher Freeman: The first one is rough to get ahead of the

78
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.450
Christopher Freeman: Date wrong so

79
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:16.590

Christopher Freeman: Like my dad was a pain in the button everything and I really didn't have any problems with my parents until I was later on in my 30s. It was business problems we partnered up and we had a granite shop later on. And that's really what hurt my neck.
