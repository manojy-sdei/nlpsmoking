17
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.040

18
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.930

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.440
Joan Kandel: That's good.

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
Joan Kandel: I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. Do you have headphones.

22
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.960
Joan Kandel: I don't, you don't. Okay, did they tell you that you'll need to get have some

23
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.430
Gabriella Bernal: No, they didn't.

24
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.160
Joan Kandel: They didn't. Okay, so, um,

25
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.620
Joan Kandel: The way we

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.000
Joan Kandel: The way we do this program is through zoom and we have a group meetings every week.

27
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.780
Joan Kandel: And

28
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.080
Joan Kandel: And it's really important to wear the headphones that have a microphone so that just for confidentiality and privacy so that

29
00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:06.330
Joan Kandel: So that other people aren't hearing what's happening in the group because everyone you know is talking about their story and about themselves and their feelings and stuff. And so we don't want anybody. So we need to have people alone and with headphones in.

30
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
Joan Kandel: Okay, so, so before your group.

31
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.330
Joan Kandel: Your homework is to get headphones that have a microphone on it.

32
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.680
Gabriella Bernal: Okay, cool.

33
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.150
Joan Kandel: Yeah. And when you and when you get that you can call the virtual clinic and do like a test to make sure that everything's working okay

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.840
Joan Kandel: Okay. Yeah. Okay, so, um,

35
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.730
Joan Kandel: Tell me about you and what's going on and why you're here.

36
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.910
Gabriella Bernal: Okay. Um, well, I'm here, I'm I've done several program and I'm

37

Joan Kandel: Got it. Yeah. Good. Well, yeah, this is, this is really perfect this bright heart health, because you're just at home, and it's just so it's perfect for this.

165
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.200
Gabriella Bernal: Right. I'd heard about it before through one of my friends like a while back.

166
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.070
Okay.

167
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.080
Joan Kandel: Good.

168
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.600
Joan Kandel: Well, I'm glad you found us.

169
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.890
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah, me too.

170
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.450
Joan Kandel: Yeah, that's good. So, when was the last time you used

171
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.200
Gabriella Bernal: Um, yesterday. Oh.

172
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.190
Joan Kandel: Not, not today.

173
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.540
Gabriella Bernal: No, not yet.

174
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.820
Joan Kandel: Not yet, what time yesterday.

175
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.200
Gabriella Bernal: Oh well, like, well, I guess maybe yesterday, today, like, like, three o'clock in the morning.

176
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:32.100
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Okay 3am. And usually if you weren't doing this program.

177
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.300
Joan Kandel: You would have already used by now. Right.

178
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:43.680
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. Like if you use it 3am when would you use again, when would you need to use again.

179
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.100
Gabriella Bernal: When I wake up, so like seven

180
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.140
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Yeah. Okay, so are you feeling. Are you feeling withdrawals. Yeah.

181
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.950
Yeah.

182
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.230
Joan Kandel: How bad is it right now.

183
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.270
Gabriella Bernal: I'm pretty bad, like my eyes. I can do.

184
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.500
Joan Kandel: It's like water.

185
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.520
Gabriella Bernal: Do

186
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.240
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

187
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:06.960
Joan Kandel: What else

188
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.910
Gabriella Bernal: I'm like all sweaty.

189
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.050
Okay.

190
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.600
Gabriella Bernal: Like nauseous like

191
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.100
Joan Kandel: Got it vomiting.

192
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:21.870
Gabriella Bernal: Not yet.

193
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.480
Gabriella Bernal: No, not yet.

194
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.210
Joan Kandel: Okay, those things come a little bit later.

195
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:36.300
Joan Kandel: Yeah, okay, good. So when you were on Suboxone before what was a good dose for you that you felt stable at

196
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.700
Gabriella Bernal: You give me three of the eight milligram

197
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:42.810
Uh huh.

198
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.510
Gabriella Bernal: And

199
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.300
Joan Kandel: And and you've you've felt like you are stable on that dose.

200
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.220
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah, back then. Yeah.

201
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.990
Joan Kandel: Back then, right, yeah.

202
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.960
Joan Kandel: Did you ever try to to be on just to have the eight milligrams 16 milligrams

203
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.260
Gabriella Bernal: They tried it at first, but it wasn't enough.

204
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.090
Joan Kandel: It wasn't enough. Uh huh.

205
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.600
Okay.

206
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.490
Joan Kandel: Okay, um,

207
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:35.730
Joan Kandel: Alright, yeah, usually a lot of people are stable at at two of them a day at 16 milligrams, but some people aren't most people at 24 milligrams. Most people are stable. We don't usually need to go more than 24 milligrams, which is the three a day so

208
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:54.000
Joan Kandel: Given the fact that you're using as much as you're using. I think I'd like to start you at three a day and then see if we can kind of just get you stable and then maybe kind of go down a little bit, you know, by like a quarter strip, you know, in the weeks to come.

209
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.950
Joan Kandel: Okay, how you do with that.

210
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:07.230
Joan Kandel: Because 24 milligrams is sort of a high dose, but it sounds to me like you're probably going to need to be on a bit of a high dose. Just, just because you've been using so so much recently.

211
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.210
Joan Kandel: Because that sound to you.

212
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:22.470
Joan Kandel: Sounds good. Yeah, okay, good. So, um, so that's what we're going to do and and i'll i'll prescribe it today so that you can go like after we get off the phone.

213
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:29.790
Joan Kandel: I'll probably prescribe it by like the end of the morning so that you can go over and

214
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.360
Joan Kandel: And be able to pick that up at the pharmacy.

215
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:49.410
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you're welcome. And what I would suggest that you do is when you first start is take one strip and cut it in half and just take the half of a strip and make sure that it doesn't make you feel sicker.

216
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.970
Joan Kandel: Okay um you know about that, about the precipitated withdrawal.

217
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:54.840
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah.

218
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:55.620
Joan Kandel: You do.

219
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.850
Joan Kandel: Okay, you know about it.

220
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.530
Joan Kandel: Did you learn that the hard way.

221
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.270
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right. So we want to say, you know what I'm talking about.

222
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:10.800
Joan Kandel: We don't want you to take it too early, you need to be pretty good and sick before you get it into your system. And if you take a whole bunch of it.

223
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:20.280
Joan Kandel: It could. I mean, even if you take a little bit if you're not sick enough, it could make you feel really crappy and much worse. So by taking just half of a strip you know that

224
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.500
Joan Kandel: Half of a strip at first, then you can kind of see, you know, within like

225
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:37.320
Joan Kandel: 15 minutes to half an hour. You can see, okay, I'm not getting sicker. I'm actually feeling a little bit better. So I can go ahead and then when you start to fit. So if you if you feel

226
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:47.640
Joan Kandel: Worse after you take that four milligrams. What that tells us is that you didn't wait long enough and you just need to not take any more, and wait a few more hours before taking the other half.

227
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.820
Joan Kandel: Okay, you take that half and you feel like

228
00:14:50.910 --> 00:15:01.500
Joan Kandel: Okay, this is actually helping I'm feeling a little less sick then then you can still wait and kind of when you start to feel like you're getting sick again, then you could take the other half.

229
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:02.580
Gabriella Bernal: Okay.

230
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:13.560
Joan Kandel: And then, and then I'm assuming that you'll probably will need the full 24 milligrams. So then, later in the day you could take a full strip and later in the day you could take another full strip

231
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:20.340
Joan Kandel: Okay, so you're going to be the judge of that of how it's how you're doing. But that's

232
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.060
Joan Kandel: How to

233
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:27.120
Joan Kandel: interpret it. If you've if you take that first half and you feel really sick. Just wait.

234
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.380
Gabriella Bernal: Okay.

235
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.270
Joan Kandel: That all makes sense to you. Right.

236
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.370
Joan Kandel: Yeah okay, it seems

237
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.520
Joan Kandel: Okay. All right.

238
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.290
Joan Kandel: So, but that's the safest way to kind of ease yourself onto it so that you don't get super sick.

239
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.730
Joan Kandel: Okay, um,

240
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:53.370
Joan Kandel: How old were you when you started using heroin 1515 and we're using other things before that.

241
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.060
Gabriella Bernal: No, I think I actually read before, but that was it.

242
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.050
Uh huh.

243
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.910
Joan Kandel: And so you've been using heroin kind of off and on, since you were 15

244
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.650
Uh huh. Yeah.

245
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.650
Joan Kandel: Who turned you on to it.

246
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.190
Gabriella Bernal: One of my friends that I have met

247
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:15.750
Joan Kandel: Her

248
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.460
Gabriella Bernal: They were older they already. They did it them and their mommy and boyfriend.

249
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.620
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah yeah

250
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.470
Joan Kandel: And what did you think of it.

251
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.900
Gabriella Bernal: Um, I thought it was all right because they did it, you know.

252
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.110
Joan Kandel: Yeah. What did you think of how it made you feel

253
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:35.910
Gabriella Bernal: Um,

254
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.840
Gabriella Bernal: Alright, yeah. I guess I threw up.

255
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.580
Uh huh.

256
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.030
Joan Kandel: Yeah, the first thing he did was throw

257
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.430
Joan Kandel: Yeah, and then you kind of liked it.

258
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:55.050
Joan Kandel: Yeah. And did you feel. Did you get. Did you get hooked on it pretty quickly.

259
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.270
Gabriella Bernal: No, it took a while.

260
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.060
Joan Kandel: I took a while. Uh huh. Yeah.

261
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.790
Joan Kandel: And how about other drugs like math or speed or

262
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.570
Gabriella Bernal: I've tried. I've tried a mom.

263
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:10.860
Uh huh.

264
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.800
Gabriella Bernal: But those just weren't making

265
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.620
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. So, um,

266
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.790
Joan Kandel: Math was never you never really got

267
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.800
Joan Kandel: Interested in math.

268
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.250
Okay.

269
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.450
Joan Kandel: Um, and how about alcohol.

270
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.460
Gabriella Bernal: No I don't drink.

271
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.130
Joan Kandel: Never that was never an issue for you.

272
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.320
Joan Kandel: Huh. Okay, how about tobacco cigarettes.

273
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:38.460
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah, I smell.

274
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.530
Joan Kandel: You do, how much do you smoke.

275
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.510
Gabriella Bernal: Like I guess like

276
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:44.940
Uh huh.

277
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.930
Joan Kandel: Do you feel addicted to that.

278
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.140
Gabriella Bernal: Um, yeah, I guess. So I like to swim.

279
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.040
Joan Kandel: Haha, yeah. So that's it. That's a pretty tough addiction.

280
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.450
Joan Kandel: And

281
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:05.670
Joan Kandel: I would I want to plant a seed in your brain that we should really work on stopping smoking.

282
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.760
Joan Kandel: Because that is a nasty, nasty addiction and it has horrible effects on your body.

283
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.760
Joan Kandel: And that's not cheap either

284
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.220
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah, it is expensive.

285
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.730
Joan Kandel: It's expensive. So have you ever quit smoking.

286
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.490
Gabriella Bernal: Anyone, I have to

287
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.090
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. When did you have to, when you're pregnant.

288
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.840
Gabriella Bernal: I'm going on to jail. Yeah. When I was pregnant.

289
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:31.770
Uh huh.

290
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.720
Joan Kandel: Was that hard for you.

291
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.500
Gabriella Bernal: I'm trying to again.

292
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.330
Gabriella Bernal: Like

293
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.080
Joan Kandel: You missed it.

294
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.040
Yeah.

295
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:52.980
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so, um, so, yeah, I think that would be a really good thing to to work on. What do you think

296
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.180
Yeah.

297
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.320
Joan Kandel: Do you think you want to quit smoking or not really

298
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.490
Gabriella Bernal: Um, I think I need to focus on one thing at a time.

299
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.460
Joan Kandel: Fine. That's fine. Yeah, that's fine. So, so, like I say, it's just planting the seed.

300
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:09.930
Gabriella Bernal: Okay.

301
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.510
Joan Kandel: It's springtime. So I just planted a seed.

302
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.100
Joan Kandel: Do you take any medications.

303
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.150
Joan Kandel: No. No. Okay. Are you allergic to anything.

304
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.130
Gabriella Bernal: Just lead to

305
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.030
Joan Kandel: Latex what happens with latex.

306
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.950
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah, you get

307
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.760
Joan Kandel: To get like

308
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.570
Yeah.

309
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.780
Joan Kandel: Okay. Um, do you have any medical problems, besides addiction.

310
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.590
Joan Kandel: No, no. Otherwise, pretty healthy

311
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:42.360
Joan Kandel: Okay.

312
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.600
Joan Kandel: How many times total. Have you been pregnant.

313
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:47.580
Gabriella Bernal: For

314
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.160
Joan Kandel: For and how many kids do you

315
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:56.190
Joan Kandel: Three. Three. And the other one was it abortion or miscarriage.

316
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.210
Gabriella Bernal: Or no, and

317
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.930
Gabriella Bernal: She passed away when she was four and a half months old. She stopped breathing.

318
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.700
Joan Kandel: Oh, I'm so sorry.

319
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.650

434
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.230
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You definitely don't want to do that.

435
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.030
Gabriella Bernal: Okay, yeah.

436
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:43.230
Joan Kandel: Don't do that. There's a lot of structures in there that you don't want to be messing with so I'm glad to hear that you're not

437
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.140

Joan Kandel: So,

440
00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:02.880
Joan Kandel: So, like I say, I'm going to be prescribing the meds for you after we get off of this of this call.

441
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:12.300
Joan Kandel: And I'm going to prescribe this Suboxone and will prescribe it for three strips of the day and we'll get you stable on that.

442
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:24.510
Joan Kandel: I don't think you did any more of that. But you may find and you can feel free to try this. You can try taking two and a half and see how you do. Because you may be fine on two and a half.

443
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:25.890
Joan Kandel: So,

444
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.300
Joan Kandel: You can kind of see

445
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:35.430
Joan Kandel: How you do with that. And then once you're stable on that for a while, we could talk about maybe going down a little bit if we if we can

446
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:43.830
Joan Kandel: And then the other thing I'm going to prescribe for you is a narc can do you have an arc in

447
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.390
The spring.

448
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.780
Gabriella Bernal: I don't know. I think I ran out my car got stolen. So I had in my car, but yeah.

449
00:28:51.840 --> 00:29:04.710
Joan Kandel: Oh yeah, well, so you're going to have a fresh one. And so that's a really good thing to have with you. You should have it with you at all times. Just in case you run into somebody who's odd and you want to feel in the mood to save a life.

450
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.700
Joan Kandel: You can do that. Yeah, so I'm

451
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:21.780
Joan Kandel: Solving prescribing that to you. And if you ever were to use it or you lost it, or your car got stolen or whatever. You can go back to the same pharmacy, there'll be refills of that for you. If you need another one.

452
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.950
Gabriella Bernal: So, okay, well,

453
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.800
Joan Kandel: I'll prescribe both of those things for you. There'll be at the pharmacy whichever pharmacy, you gave us which pharmacy is that

456
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.910
Joan Kandel: OK, so that's where I'll be prescribing that and then

457
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:55.620
Joan Kandel: In terms of how the program works. Since you haven't done this program before we do everything, like I say on the on the zoom. So you. Your homework is to get some earbuds that have a microphone.

458
00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:01.080
Joan Kandel: Okay, so maybe when you go to Walgreens to pick that up. You can get that over there today.

459
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.400
Gabriella Bernal: Yeah, okay.

460
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:14.250

Joan Kandel: Because that's the number you call for everything. If you have any questions, if you've, you know,

470
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:40.230
Joan Kandel: If you need to make arrangements for something. If you need to cancel an appointment reschedule an appointment. That's the number to call

471
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:47.490
Joan Kandel: Okay, when you when you call when you come when you call them for an appointment whatever appointment. It is

472
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:57.870
Joan Kandel: Call in about 30 minutes before so that you have time to get processed and checked in every week. They'll have you fill out a self assessment on how you're doing.

473
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:10.440
Joan Kandel: And how you're feeling and so that takes a little bit of time. So, so, like, on Tuesday, this coming Tuesday at 530 that's when you're going to call the virtual clinic because our group is at six.

474
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:23.520
Joan Kandel: Okay, and you'll meet all the people in the group. There's a really good bunch of people and and they're really great and I think you're going to really get a lot out of that. So that's every week to come to group.

475
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.140
Joan Kandel: And group is

476
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:41.430
Joan Kandel: Group is where I prescribe people's refills, so I'm giving you on prescribing now enough meds to get you through Tuesday evening so you'll have Tuesday's dose, but then you won't have Wednesday's dose until you come up. You showed a meeting and then I'll prescribe it them.

477
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.660
Okay.

478
00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.150
Joan Kandel: And

479
00:32:46.500 --> 00:33:00.990
Joan Kandel: One thing about group is we already talked about the confidentiality and not, you know, being alone and having your headphones in. The other thing about group is that there's no smoking allowed in group. So make sure that you're that you don't smoke during that hour

480
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:02.550
Gabriella Bernal: Okay.

481
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.080
Joan Kandel: So prepare for that.

482
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.460
Gabriella Bernal: All right.

483
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.140
Joan Kandel: However, you need to prepare

484
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.730
Joan Kandel: Oh, the other. The last thing to tell you about groups is

485
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.340
Joan Kandel: Is that we do need to go. Have you go to lab, they told you that

486
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.090
Joan Kandel: We need to have you get some labs drawn at some point.

487
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:31.710
Joan Kandel: I would advise you to call that lab before you go down there to see if they're if they're accepting patients for routine labs right now because a lot of labs are kind of closed.

488
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.050
Joan Kandel: But yeah, stay at home stuff so

489
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:48.630
Joan Kandel: So if you find that that's the case, then you can just let us know that that's what they told you and we'll put it off until whenever this blows over. But maybe the maybe the lab that you're going to doesn't have that. So, give them a call and see

490
00:33:49.320 --> 00:34:06.660
Joan Kandel: Okay. Um, and so when you when you go to lab, they're going to do a urine drug screen and they're also going to do blood work to kind of check for us just to kind of see how things are, have you ever tested positive for hip seed you have Pepsi or HIV.

491
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.370
Gabriella Bernal: I used to have Pepsi, but I don't know my body cured itself.

492
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:19.500
Joan Kandel: Oh, I see. Well, that'll be interesting to to check that again. So that's one of the tests that we check. So we'll see what the status of that is so that'll be good.

493
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:20.580
Okay.

494
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:22.800
Joan Kandel: And

495
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:31.500
Joan Kandel: So, but in the future to do our urine drug screens, you're not going to have to go to the lab every month.

496
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:42.930
Joan Kandel: What we do is we send the send that to you in the mail, it'll be in like a bulky envelope, you know, go to your mail. And when you get that envelope. Don't open it.

497
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:49.560
Joan Kandel: Until you call the virtual clinic just call them and say, Hey, I got this in the mail. What am I supposed to do and then they'll

498
00:34:49.920 --> 00:35:01.980
Joan Kandel: They'll walk you through it. They'll have you open it and on camera in front of them and then they'll say you had to do that. They're not going to watch up but they'll tell you to go to the bathroom and they come back with the p

499
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.470
Joan Kandel: Okay and and they'll read it on this.

500
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.610
Joan Kandel: On the on the camera.

501
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.470
Joan Kandel: With you.

502
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.610
Okay.

503
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.100
Joan Kandel: So that's how that works.

504
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:12.870
Gabriella Bernal: Okay.

505
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.510
Joan Kandel: Um, what questions do you have for me, Gabby.

506
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.690
Gabriella Bernal: Um, none right now.

507
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.020
Joan Kandel: Okay, that was a lot of info so

508
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.760
Joan Kandel: Next steps are

509
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:37.800
Joan Kandel: You're going to get your meds from pharmacy, you're not going to use anymore today. Right. Nobody Using and then you're going to get your meds and then you're going to when you feel sick enough. You're going to start with half of a strip

510
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.570
Joan Kandel: And see how you feel, make sure it doesn't make you sicker.

511
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:55.740
Joan Kandel: And then, and then you'll take that every day. You can take up to three strips a day. Don't take more than that because you'll run out early. But I don't think you're going to need more than that. But see how you do on two strips or two and a half strips.

512
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:05.340
Joan Kandel: And kind of see how you do. And then on Tuesday, our group is at six, but check in at 530

513
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:19.650
Joan Kandel: And then we'll be in the swing of it. And then, you know, those are the things to really remember and got and Dominique is going to get in touch with you to set up an individual therapy session, which will either be this week or next week.

514
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:20.880
