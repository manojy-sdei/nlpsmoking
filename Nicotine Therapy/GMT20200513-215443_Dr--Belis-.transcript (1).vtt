00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.340

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good.

296
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.640
Akinwande: Personality, so it was bad for me.

297
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So you did you introduce her to cocaine.

298
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.570
Akinwande: Or you're talking about mental she she she had that

299
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: She had the cocaine already and

300
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: You guys kind of met up and you were doing that, but then

301
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: You producer to math and

302
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Then things got out of hand for her with that.

303
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:24.540
Akinwande: Yeah.

304
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:33.930
Akinwande: Got it from there. That's what brought me down because I was trying to go and get it for her, make sure she was cool and happy, then I just fuck my own stuff up at the same time.

305
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Tell me about that. What do you mean by that, what happened what we

306
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:45.540
Akinwande: Know, like I say we be going through a lot of stress and I got a lot of things that I'm going through right now. So just all the drama or the stress.

307
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:56.460
Akinwande: You know, you only got a little bit of time for you to like, calm down and think so, no. The only time we were able to sit down and talk and think without having anything getting away was then

308
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:11.910
Akinwande: Yeah, we ain't even kind of like even tripped off our kid dying because we had so much stuff going, like I said, we gotta still move have problems at my house today. And I just had to go through a whole bunch of stuff.

309
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

310
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.620
Akinwande: What police with everything. But like I said, I never been to jail, anything like that. I never been in trouble by the law.

311
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's good. At least you have that that's a blessing.

312
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:31.110
Akinwande: Oh yeah but you know I get stereotyped all the time because how I look. I got a lot of tech tools. I got trade. So when they see me. They call me over.

313
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:32.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh,

314
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.620
Akinwande: Yeah, I get harassed by cops.

315
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's cool. That's

316
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:43.140
Akinwande: Good. But I'm used to it, though. Ever since I started getting tattoos and everything. That's when I knew everything was real.

317
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:44.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

318
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:48.840
Akinwande: Yeah.

319
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.670
Akinwande: First question.

320
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.420
Everything.

321
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Interesting.

322
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you know, it's, I guess part of human nature or whatever but

323
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.180
Akinwande: There we go. Types

324
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Stereotyping

325
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.820
Akinwande: Because everybody like bro, you don't be like all the other black people. I'm like, Yeah, I know.

326
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:12.150
Akinwande: That's the difference between me and then I don't act like that that's ratchet. I got kids. I got

327
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:13.680
Akinwande: I got

328
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:22.260
Akinwande: My kids when they hear them my number one priority. I don't smoke when they hear nothing. When I do smoke weed. I go outside.

329
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:28.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, good. So, okay, and you have your mom there and you have other

330
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.400
Akinwande: Moms there. My sisters here, my nephew's here his brothers here.

331
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:38.010
Akinwande: So it's not just me. Here is a whole bunch of people to kids are never alone. There's always somebody within

332
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Monitoring and making sure

333
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.070
Akinwande: They're safe.

334
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good.

335
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:48.900
Akinwande: And I'm not in the living room where we sleep at so we can watch it, even if we're standing outside. We can still watch him because the cameras.

336
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. Yeah. Cuz there's so little. You have to know what's going on with them.

337
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.770
Akinwande: Then we got gates up so we can block them off so they can run throughout the whole house.

338
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.280
Akinwande: So I pretty much got all that handle. Okay.

339
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good, good.

340
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:21.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: And, you know, as a dad, you should always be extra careful because, you know, I hear from patients, I hear you know I see so many patients that have over the years I hear stories of, like, yeah, I was just a kid and nobody knew what was happening, but I was molested or I would you

341
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:21.960
Know,

342
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.110
Akinwande: Yeah. And whenever people are around my kids, I'm always telling

343
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.270
Akinwande: My kids aren't allowed to go nowhere with nobody and they know. They better not talk to anybody that they don't know

344
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you have to be vigilant, because it's just such a weird world.

345
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:42.630
Akinwande: Yeah, cuz they happen to my girlfriend when she was younger. So like I tell my girl. Like, I don't want my kids around that.

346
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:52.560
Akinwande: Like because she wants to take them to go see the other side. I'm just like, oh no hospital about that because the stories you've been telling me and the store your sister was selling me on think that's cool.

347
00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:03.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you have to be very careful and I would if she's gonna do that either go with her. Or, you know, I don't know, have a promise that she's gonna beat with them the whole one

348
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:10.650
Akinwande: I don't approve of them even going over there like that because I just don't think that's cool or smart at the same time.

349
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:23.790
Akinwande: Yeah, but you know how you people are when you talk about their side of the family. Oh no, fuck that they're my side, you can't do my people like that. So that's the kind of thing we'd be going through. Sometimes. But, I'm, like, Bro, you're not using your head.

350
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:32.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah, let's think about it from the kids perspective, right, like we get all ego our ego gets in the way. Well, my family, your family, whatever. It's like, but it's about

351
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.140
Akinwande: I've been disowned as a kid like my whole family song.

352
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:39.450
Akinwande: So,

353
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:47.640
Akinwande: Just ever since we were kids, they did to me, my sister, my brother. Everybody did we just not want it in

354
00:26:48.510 --> 00:27:01.740
Akinwande: That my mom. She was adopted. So, you know, my mom, she only talk to them. Every once in a while. So I think that's what kind of happened from them, not really talking to us when we were younger, being around them and growing up with them. It's just like a fucking

355
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:10.800
Akinwande: So I don't really talk to them on the person. I talked to them. I know and talk to them about. Yes, my name our kids is my family.

356
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. Yeah, that's hard. That's hard.

357
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:27.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you mentioned your back pain. Is there anything else in your body like review of systems like any you'd like

358
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.780
Akinwande: To wear my shirt that I had to get cut out

359
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: In your throat.

360
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:32.940
Yeah.

361
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:34.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, wow.

Dr. Belis Aladag: When you say that. Are you talking about like pain or just the stress or the

371
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.180
Akinwande: Pain, everything is just all in one.

372
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.880
Akinwande: Yeah.

379
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's not, it's not a father figure

380
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.710

390
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:55.920

Dr. Belis Aladag: OK. OK, so there's stress, just with that relationship to

Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh boy. When did she get

396
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:15.480
Akinwande: A when she kept getting all these blood clots. They put her on blood thinners, and the blood clots kept coming

397
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:26.490
Akinwande: Happened after my daughter died, the same day on the way home, she was coming up the stairs and she was getting out of breath. She had to go to the hospital. Sure enough, she got blood clots. They did a test and it came back positive

398
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so just just February, then you

399
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.630
Akinwande: So like I said, it's

400
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.680
Akinwande: Just a whole bunch of life events that just kind of drove us to it.

401
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:46.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, you got a lot going on ovarian cancer. That's not a. That's no joke. Is she did she have the staging surgery and everything.

402
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:54.300
Akinwande: Right now, she's on she's got to do chemo, but they won't let her in. Right now, because of the corona. And she could get sick quick and easy.

403
00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:10.500
Akinwande: So she's on a breathing machine because she has problems or even like a see pat machine which you go to sleep at he has a machine that she stays with all the time now because she gets out of breath moments kind of age, she's like 550 or some so she has a lot issue.

404
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:26.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, I'm so sorry, that's tough. That's tough. So she's going through physically she's going through a lot. So yeah, I mean, I'm not that surprised that mentally. She's like, I can't have this but you know she might need you actually

405
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.130
Akinwande: Doing my girl was her caregiver.

406
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:35.640
Akinwande: Because at first I was going to do it. But then I felt bad for my girl, because I know I can always get a job. Whenever I wanted

407
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:49.470
Akinwande: So I was just like, here you could go on and do it. But she didn't do her job and she was supposed to send my mom's side well either. You can do it. Or I'm gonna have my mom do it but that's my mom. Well, if we're leaving. Then why am I going to do it. I may not even be around here.

408
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so

409
00:31:52.980 --> 00:32:01.050
Akinwande: Yeah I don't know what's going on. No, I'm leaving. Because what my mom's one day she scored the next minute she's not she's blippy floppy.

410
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's too much.

411
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:09.120
Akinwande: Yeah, but it's, I think my mama some going on with her right now. They just got to find out what it is.

412
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.280
Akinwande: Like sometimes she remember shit. Sometimes you don't. It's just weird.

413
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: They do a full body scan.

414
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: After the candle.

415
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:31.890
Akinwande: I know that she's still got them in touch her lungs right now. And then she been she had a stroke like four different times. I've got a whole left side of her paralyzed. She's been to hell, but just

416

482
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.530

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.070
Akinwande: Are they do they actually work though because I tried on

485
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:48.900

492
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:17.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like a proven thing that works. It's nicotine replacement i mean it's it's the candy that you you soak on and it gives you the same chemical that the cigarette gives you so you get that like craving curved

508
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:31.890
Akinwande: So,

509
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:39.180
Akinwande: One side to the other. So I just be out here. I got plants that are growing and growing like a tangerine tree a plum tree potatoes and I got

510
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.080
Akinwande: Right, I got cactus. I got all different kinds of fun.

511
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:47.670
Akinwande: Oh wow, I used to grow wheat. So that's what got me into growing a plant.

512
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's cool. You're going to growing, growing the plants and

513
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:53.880
Akinwande: That's what I

514
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.110
Akinwande: Learned from my dad. He a grower. And then my sister worked at CB CB

515
00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.320
Akinwande: And she was the manager over there. So it kind of just all

516
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.190
Came together.

517
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.470

518
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.910

521
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's cool. That's good. So you do that and you get some relief like okay

522
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm starting

523
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.260
Akinwande: On Monday.

524
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:17.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes.

525
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:32.190
Akinwande: Actually, like right now. I just got these auto start plants and they're getting pretty big right now, but they're growing hello quick. I'm like, Well, why do they grow so quick. They're like, because it's half the time.

526
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:39.810
Akinwande: Because they auto start like a regular plan take six months. These only take three months.

527
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:40.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, wow.

528
00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:46.920
Akinwande: But you get half as much though, but I'm just like, it's okay. I just tried this time it seems to be doing good.

529
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:58.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, okay, so what was I saying I was gonna say that, okay. So for the smoking will try the candies.

530
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: For the the main issue, which is the math that's why you're coming to us. Right. You're like,

531
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:05.010
Akinwande: Do you

532
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Want us. You want to stop right

533
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.540
You don't want sound good.

534
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:30.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's not good. You don't want it. So for that, we do a weekly group where we check in and we see where everyone's at, you know, and everyone's trying to get sober from one thing or another. I got to tell you, the majority of my patients right now are opioid users.

535
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.190
Akinwande: Yeah, I don't think

536
00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:40.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: downers yeah those downers yet, but I have people that use meth and heroin or

537
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.000
Akinwande: Those that get you sick, like when you start messing with the needles and stuff. That's all bad.

538
00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:45.870
Akinwande: I don't do

539
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:52.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. So yeah, obviously, you mentioned the needle thing. I know you're not injecting are you smoking or you

540
00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know snorting it or

541
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.560
Akinwande: Yeah, both of you.

542
00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:56.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

543
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:03.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, and I have people that are just there with meth methamphetamine to so like

544
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: There's different types of people in the groups.

545
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:20.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you would come in and like it's a weekly thing and we do a check in, like, hey, can, how was your How Was Your Week, like what's going on. Were you able to stay sober what's what's been helping what's been hurting you, you know,

546
00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:30.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's like that. And then there's a whole group of people, so people can chime in if you say something and someone's like, oh, that I went through that they can like chime in, you know,

547
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:43.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's like supportive and good. So you would do that every week and then you get an individual therapist. So you would get somebody that sees you just you.

548
00:43:44.250 --> 00:44:00.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: To talk about and anything you know everything that's going on. You have a lot of stressors. So, you know, all the stuff with your mom's health and you're moving and her personality changes and all this. That's a lot of stuff and then your children's mother and her things and

549
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, I think it would be good for you to do the individual therapy and talk through some of this stuff, you know,

550
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:21.240
Akinwande: I'll think I will do to good inside a group because I just get quiet. I won't say nothing. I just be sitting up kind of awkward because our so I didn't learn how to read and write, till I was in the third grade. I had a problem.

551
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.580
Akinwande: Because the teacher shows your skin.

552
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:36.210
Akinwande: Issues like she's probably stupid, all that stuff. So there was another teacher that sat there and actually worked with me and taught me how to do it. So I never finished school that was my downfall, but I know a lot of different trades.

553
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:37.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that's

554
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:45.210
Akinwande: So I don't feel comfortable like talking around people, and stuff like that don't know, I just be just fine.

555
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: You think you'd be quiet.

556
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:56.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's okay. It's up to you. I mean, you do what feels good for you, but I would say that's kind of

557
00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:58.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sorry.

558
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.330
Akinwande: I said that people are trouble.

559
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:10.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I mean, you may want to just join if you're curious, I think if you want to give it a chance.

560
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:23.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could join one group. And if you're like yeah I don't think I can. I don't think I want this, then you don't do any more groups, but give one group a chance if you want. If not, it's OK. Regardless, I think.

561
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.170
Akinwande: You guys do it.

562
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.530

575
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.850
Akinwande: Only started working here though because I had to find a job because my mom left for Africa.

576
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.180
Akinwande: Oh right, for her why she was gone.

600
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:02.850
Akinwande: All right. Sure.

601
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:08.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's just good I think in the beginning of your recovery. Have you ever tried to stop before

602
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:13.980
Akinwande: I tried a lot of the times and then, like I said, through all the stuff that's been happening in my life, my

603
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:20.310
Akinwande: Unfortunate Events, it just jumping back down at him or girl. She just showed me down.

604
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah. You have you have some things, you know,

605
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:34.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you've never actually been in an official program or treatment thing before. So, so hopefully this will be a really good thing for you. Something that will kind of

606
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:42.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know support you in the way you need so that you do what you need to do, which is stay away from that stuff, you know,

607
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:48.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: And remind you that that's your goal. Like, that's what it does, by, by meeting with US Weekly or

608
00:49:49.140 --> 00:50:00.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know as frequently as you can, you're reminding yourself like yeah I'm doing all this work. I'm sitting here with these people or doing this individual therapy because I don't want to be doing that anymore. You know,

609
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:10.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: I want to deal with my stress and my problems differently. I don't know how but differently. And so with the therapy. Hopefully you'll think of different ideas, you know,

610
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.380
Akinwande: It's hard. I won't give me a problem die smoke week, though, right.

611
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, I mean, I think, you know,

612
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.990
Akinwande: I have a medicinal car to as well.

613
00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:33.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so as an addiction. Doctor, you know, I'm, you know, obviously, I'll I prefer if you didn't smoke, but I understand that for you. You've kind of utilized it in a way for a long time now.

614
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.730
Akinwande: That my daily routine.

615
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: That it's your routine. You feel it's not the problematic chemical for you. You

616
00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:40.860
Akinwande: Know like

617
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:44.310
Akinwande: Honestly, I never been in trouble over it, no nothing.

618
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm not what led you to know cocaine or math.

619
00:50:48.840 --> 00:51:06.390
Akinwande: Nope. Nope. I told us to people that be around me. Okay, like, you know, like I said, my dad. My dad comes my dad got to Paki for me. And I was like, Come on, let's go. Like, I got my other friends what you're doing. Come on. So it's more my influences around

620
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:12.180
Akinwande: That's not me going out my way to go and get it. It's just the people around me or my girl.

621
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:34.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. Yeah. So. So for you, so. So to answer your question, so it doesn't seem like at least right now that the marijuana is a core problem or, you know, so, so, no. I mean, I think you can put that aside and maybe in the future work on reducing your use or whatever, if you want to but for now.

622
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:36.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Stop. Yeah.

623
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:43.110
Akinwande: Because this is what keeps me sane. Give me a peace of mind and give me time to myself to think about everything.

624
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: That I can actually sit down and jog stuff down and focus on what I need to focus on

625
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.590
Akinwande: The guy ADHD, too. So I'm always hyper and moving around, like right now.

626
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:55.110
Akinwande: I'm talking to you want to know.

627
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:55.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I got

628
00:51:56.130 --> 00:52:15.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Busy. Okay, so you got ADHD and the bipolar two. Okay. Yeah. So I would just be clear about it with the therapist and say, look, you know, I'm joining this program because my goal is to stay away from meth and anything else but but the marijuana

629
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.620
Akinwande: Don't do nothing else.

630
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:26.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you don't do anything else, right. So, just say and but the marijuana. I just don't want to really touch that right now that's not going to be things. So I want to talk about the math problem and

631
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:27.330
Akinwande: This one's

632
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:43.050
Akinwande: Hard enough for me to even come and do like this right here because I don't like people all in my business because I'm more to myself because like I said I've got people to talk to, like that. So I just more to myself. So this was a big step for me to even come and do this.

633
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:55.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think so. I mean, I think that's awesome, and I thank you for all that you've shared because, yeah, especially if you're not used to talking so much about your own stuff and your problems.

634
00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:02.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like it's it's a big deal. So I appreciate that. I think you did a great thing by showing up for yourself.

635
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and take your time.

636
00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:15.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: And, you know, you're being a responsible father to you know you're setting an example, even though they don't know what you're doing. You're really setting an example for them.

637
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:17.040
Akinwande: Okay, even when

638
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:21.900
Akinwande: Even when I do smoke. I don't have none of that stuff in my house.

639
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:28.950
Akinwande: Because I can say I don't want my kids to know nothing about it on my kids see that, oh, this none of their business.

640
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.160
Akinwande: Stuff grown folk stuff you worry about your own

641
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:33.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly, yeah.

642
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: You want to show them.

643
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.700
Akinwande: Because annoying.

644
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:42.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: The cat is very attached, for sure.

645
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.780
Akinwande: That's how she use like this, the kind of breed. They are they like they're the most load is pit ever

646
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:56.850
Akinwande: Oh, she sleeps with me. She sleeps with my dogs, if I don't pay attention to start. Now I'm going to be an all in my face, see, oh,

647
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.200
Akinwande: No, I

648
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, man.

649
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.400
Akinwande: 6000 bucks for a headache.

650
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:09.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: She is intense. Okay. So, okay, so I think

651
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.260
Akinwande: Another reason why I got pets to keep me focused and keep you busy.

652
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, not

653
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.040
Akinwande: So much tripping off of one thing

654
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, that's a good

655
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:21.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Healthy

656
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.160
Akinwande: Huh.

657
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you have allergies to medication.

658
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.390
Akinwande: Nope. No.

659
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:38.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: All right, and then i like i said i think that if you try to quit the four or five cigarettes a day. That would be good for you. So I'm going to

660
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:45.930
Akinwande: Come here. I'll make a sandwich right now, since you're about to do this. And I guess I'll just go buy a pack of cigarettes. I got right now.

661
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:48.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I like it.

662
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:54.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay so lozenge, so I'm going to order the lozenge, I'm going to say

663
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: One lozenge

664
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:59.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: By mouth.

665
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: As needed for cigarettes.

666
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and not exceed

667
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:20.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: 10 per day because each lozenge each candy has enough nicotine equal to this one cigarette.

668
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:21.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's like

669
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:27.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: You don't want to have 10 if normally only smoke five cigarettes. You don't want to have 10 candies. That's

670
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:30.480
Akinwande: Too much

671
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.140
Okay.

672
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:39.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. So I'll so I'm ordering it and it's going to this Walgreens on monument Boulevard. Yep.

673
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.830
Akinwande: This one, okay.

674
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.010
Akinwande: I know some cool about these cats.

675
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:44.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so

676
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.510
Akinwande: If you look at her feet. She got a thumb.

677
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh yeah, I see that

678
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:56.370
Akinwande: Yeah, she got done even on her back there like 24 toes or something like that.

679
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:57.450
Akinwande: Oh, wow.

680
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.850
Akinwande: That's how you know when they're the real cat or not. And they all have stripes on her head in the spot.

681
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:09.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh wow, yeah. Her spots kind of look like a like a cheetah or

682
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.280
Akinwande: She's been several

683
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:12.810
Akinwande: You know what that is right.

684
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:23.340
Akinwande: No. So she's African several and Siamese cat. So the spots come from the African several and several they're like links and something else.

685
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.590
Akinwande: But that's what the polka dots come in.

686
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, that's why she has that

687
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.070
Akinwande: Yeah. And then she got the clingy thing from the sorry mishka

688
00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:35.550
Akinwande: Talkative from the time needs.

689
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:39.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god, she definitely is a friendly one

690
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Around you

691
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:50.790
Akinwande: Well know when other people come over, like friends or whatever she don't talk to she only talk to the people that you know like it took her a really, really long time to get used to us.

692
00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, okay. So she has to

693
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.400
Akinwande: Pay attention. Yeah, she rubbed me typing here.

694
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh man, she is really something.

695
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:02.040
You selfish.

696
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:17.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're bipolar disorder. Do you tend to have like mania, like where you're like up all night and stuff like that, or you tend to go depression or you do both.

697
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, okay.

698
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:23.430
Akinwande: Um, I have ups and downs and it could just happen.

699
00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:28.830
Akinwande: From nothing okay Linda was saying to just make me switch

700
00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:38.370
Akinwande: Okay. Sometimes I black out and don't remember nothing because I'd be so mad like so I try to do a thing. Now when I get pissed off. I try to go for a walk.

701
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:42.270
Akinwande: Okay, take my dog and go for a walk and try to distract myself sound.

702
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.290
But

703
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:50.310
Akinwande: I know sometimes I see it working in. And sometimes it don't because the problem still doesn't get resolved.

704
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.410
Akinwande: Now look, this guy.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:41.040
Akinwande: I just got to have some to keep me busy and focused and distracted.

730
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:46.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah, you need to have that. And so

731
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:50.970
Akinwande: But let's say that I tried to really keep myself busy and focused like

732
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:55.050
Akinwande: So this I'm on my backyard patio right now. Uh huh.

733
00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:57.600

00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:08.010
Akinwande: See like I really like got all these bikes, I'd be working on. I really try to keep myself focused on trees.

735
01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you're doing all that

736
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:17.610
Akinwande: Yeah, so it's like some, like I said, I really be trying to keep myself busy so I don't get distracted and get trouble or nothing like that.

737
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, good. Yeah. You have to be tinkering with things and being productive and feeling like you're yeah in the zone.

738
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:29.850
Akinwande: You're busy. Otherwise, I'm gonna just don't off and just do whatever

739
01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:35.700
Akinwande: Yeah, whatever catches my attention at the time. So I tried to stay busy all the time.

740
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a good thing with with good stuff, you know,

741
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.790
Akinwande: Yeah, because you know like I tell my mom.

742
01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:46.800
Akinwande: I tell my mom anytime I Pittsburgh shipper can their own stuff. Anybody know nothing else.

743
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:47.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so

744
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:55.020
Akinwande: Bikes. They got video games they got everything they got they own TV I make sure my kids are taking care of the first before I take care of myself.

745
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:56.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's good.

746
01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:05.820
Akinwande: My number one priority. Like, I tell my girl like it's okay if you do what you do but you always need to make sure that you take care of your main things first.

747
01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly. Your children come first. Right, that's

748
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:20.310
Akinwande: When you think about it, your kids is the only thing you got when you die you tell me they're the only ones that are going to be there like that and they're stuck with you forever. What do your kids wrong when they got to still come back to you.

749
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:27.180
Akinwande: Exactly. You don't want your kid not to want to be there because you want to be an asshole or dig and not do for them.

750
01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:39.210
Akinwande: Exactly what my dad. Like I said he, my friend, like my dad, he can tell me whatever he wants. But don't listen to him. My dad got hella kids you got like 17 kids. Oh 16 different baby mamas.

751
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.440
Akinwande: No, yeah, and his real name, no lie is the man.

752
01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, no.

753
01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:51.720
Akinwande: That's his real name. I didn't believe it either. I was like, let me see your ID and your question. You know, this is real name.

754
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god, it's

755
01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:01.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Crazy. That's crazy. So yeah, so you you know what it's like not to have that strong dad figure

756
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:07.950
Akinwande: You're being there for your kids with them. Yeah, that's my mom always want to be some

757
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:24.240
Akinwande: Somebody or something that my kids can look up to and not be like oh yeah Danica he's just as a we didn't care about anything I want to have when they talk about me. Be happy to say something about. So that's why I do what I do, I do it for them. Oh.

758
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:37.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm so proud of you. I think that's awesome. I think it's really, really important that you remember that in your mind yourself of that even when things get hard that you know what it's worth it because my children are going to remember me.

759
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:54.210
Akinwande: Like I saw my girl dough like she makes it hard, because not understand why they say some guys, don't be around because of the baby mama. It's not the kids because like she joins me to the point. Sometimes I'm just like, man, don't want all this, I'm don't even want to do it.

760
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.490
Akinwande: Now she just takes

761
01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:02.730
Akinwande: Everything or the funding everything out of it by just either. I gotta deal with her, or I don't know nothing.

762
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:04.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see.

763
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:09.120
Akinwande: He uses them as like love rage or something because every time she gets mad. She takes and

764
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.590
That's

765
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.630
Akinwande: So that's why it's not going to finish doing this thing. So I know I'm all good.

766
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:16.620
Akinwande: And then I'ma

767
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:18.930
Akinwande: Go to court and I'm gonna try to get him full time.

768
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:28.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah. That's smart. That's smart. You want to clean up. Make sure you're 100% before you go to court and yeah exactly.

769
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:43.170
Akinwande: Even my mom and my dad and everybody else that be around like that actually interact with us all said, What's the best thing to do, but then she go back, like when she gets mad because you know when people get mad. They don't really tell the whole story did stuff.

770
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:44.880
Akinwande: With like

771
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.970
Akinwande: The dog situation. Right. Yeah.

772
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:59.610
Akinwande: The reason why I got mad is because they got stuck three different times. I left where the store the dogs. I left and talk to my lawyer outside on the patio. Right now, the dogs were stuck. And she was sitting right there.

773
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:12.750
Akinwande: Like what if the dog is pregnant. My mom is going to kick us out. We have nowhere to go. You don't think about the stuff like that. But then she went to tell her mom I just told her to get rid of the dog.

774
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that's

775
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:27.450
Akinwande: Me. Look at me weird now because she get mad and like a run off over there for weeks and then just go over there and say, whatever. So not a look at me where so now I'm to the point now I don't even really talk to her family anymore.

776
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:31.320
Akinwande: Because she messed that up and like I told her, like,

777
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:44.190
Akinwande: I ain't mad at them mad at you because you lied and you do whatever. So you can have your way and they felt bad for you. It's not good for people always feel bad for you, because if you go back for yourself all the time. And what are you going to do

778
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:45.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly.

779
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.600
Akinwande: So, oh no.

780
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:52.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Go ahead.

781
01:04:53.100 --> 01:05:00.390
Akinwande: I guess like I tell my mom God put us in these kind of situations because we were built for it if we weren't built for it. They wouldn't do it to us.

782
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:17.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's true. You can you will. And you can and you have handled the stresses that have come to you, thus far right, even though you felt like, Wow, I can't get through this. You've gotten through every single time, despite all this stuff.

783
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:20.370
Akinwande: But it drove me to understand

784
01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.270
Akinwande: And that's why I am where I am now.

785
01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:32.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: I know, but so we're not, no one's perfect. But

786
01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:44.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: The important thing is not being perfect. The important thing is that you get up and you try and you say, you know what I wanted. I think I want to change this around for myself. And that's what you're doing, you're trying

787
01:05:44.670 --> 01:06:02.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: So this is, this is going to be. I think you have all the good intention of doing this, you have your children as a huge motivator and you're surrounded, even though you don't feel like you have place you can really talk to at least you're surrounded by family you know you have some family.

788
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:10.890
Akinwande: You know we bump heads. So like me and my mom were cool that we could bump heads and just be cool right after the most is the bellows just up and down.

789
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:19.200
Akinwande: So like, I don't really talk to her like even though we all live together. We don't really interact I interact with your son because I helped him when he was little.

790
01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:24.780
Akinwande: Like I stopped working. Everything came back to my mom's house to help take care of them because she didn't want them at the time.

791
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.760
Akinwande: And then he came back with her.

792
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:30.540
Akinwande: So he kind of give me my way how to work with kids.

793
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:36.840
Akinwande: Pick them up from school up and with his homework and stuff. So he kind of gave me my own practice with mom.

794
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:38.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

795
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:41.310
Akinwande: So that's why me and him are so close.

796
01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: I gotcha.

797
01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.540
Akinwande: Gets it was a good thing.

798
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:56.820
Akinwande: Yeah, for her. We don't really talk to then she just had her new baby like I'm in a couple months ago. Like, I think he's like five or six months, right, new

799
01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.450
Akinwande: Mm hmm. So, no, no.

800
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:03.450
Akinwande: We'll see how this plays out.

801
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:13.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, we'll see. We'll see what happens. But remember, set your intention. Okay, I'm not going to us from this point forward.

802
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:28.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or what do I need to do. Okay, I don't want to hang out with my dad or I don't want to hang out with these people or when they call. I'm going to say, oh, you know, I'm busy or whatever. Just figure out a way that you're going to avoid as much as you can. The influences

803
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like

804
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:39.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm work it out in your mind before the interaction, because that will happen. I mean, your dad is going to call or come over well.

805

836
01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:13.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Give yourself a little reward, maybe even if it's like something small like I don't know a $5 bill, put it in a jar, you know, and say at the end of like a month. I'm going to use this for something that I really want for myself.

837
01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:28.230

Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god.

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:55.320
Akinwande: And then my friend wanted to buy it. She said, No, that's my mind. Maybe you don't even write it. Oh, yeah. So I think I'ma sell it and you

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you should sell it and you know

843
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.680
Akinwande: She doesn't deserve the stuff I do

844
01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:06.450
Akinwande: Because it all comes back and bites me man is like right now.

845
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

846
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.290
Akinwande: Well, that's why I'm

847
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.840
Akinwande: Trying not to be gone. Yeah.

848
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:19.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, anyway, getting back to you reward yourself in a small way, even if it's a

849
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:30.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Chocolate. I don't know, something small, but good to remind yourself every day that you stay on the path, which is not using you give yourself something

850
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:40.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you show up to your individual therapy. And then if you can do your tribe at least tried doing the groups with us. You can try doing the groups with us. Okay.

851
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.290
Akinwande: Mm hmm. So I got a question.

852
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:53.100
Akinwande: Mm hmm. So are you talking about all these different kind of things right so shrooms, you know, shrooms are legal and Oakland. Right. And they have a shoe store out there.

853
01:11:53.610 --> 01:12:03.540
Akinwande: Okay, well why is that if they, you can't have them anywhere else. And they're illegal to sell. But you still sell them at the store. It's a shame. Students flash Kennedy School

854
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:09.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hmm, I did not know honestly, I did not know that they could sell shrooms

855
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.550
Akinwande: Liga from there all the time.

856
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:22.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. Well, I, I don't know. I don't know about that. Um, I do know that state laws and federal laws like the country wide laws are different.

857
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.740
Akinwande: That's why I said it's a bad law so

858
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:26.970
Akinwande: Why do we want to have it.

859
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:32.280
Akinwande: Because you can't have shins out here and conquered and it's only

860
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:34.290
Akinwande: 20 minute drive away from open

861
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's weird.

862
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:37.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I don't know how they did that.

863
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:38.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't know.

864
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: If there's nothing in

Dr. Belis Aladag: With medical use intent.

866
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:47.070
Akinwande: Probably, are they using it as a touch type thing. It's a religion.

867
01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:51.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh yeah, maybe because it's a hallucinogen you know

868
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:56.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, um, perhaps, I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.

01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:57.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: But a
