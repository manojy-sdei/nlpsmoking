00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.680
Joshua Reyes: I'm sick. So, don't mind me.

4
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.350
Mary Kastner: How are you sick.

5
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.900
Joshua Reyes: I woke up like two days ago with a sore throat and then yes, we're just a little bit coughing. So I took Roberta's

6
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.300
Joshua Reyes: Sunday. Cool.

7
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.190
Mary Kastner: Did you go to work.

8
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.840
Joshua Reyes: I was off off Sundays and Mondays. So

9
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.840
Joshua Reyes: Oh yeah, that's right. So I had this time just rest of vocal. Oh, good.

10
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.120
Good, good.

11
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.460
Mary Kastner: Sorry, you're sick.

12
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.490
Joshua Reyes: I know I

13
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.890
Mary Kastner: I have a few questions for you.

14
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.810
Mary Kastner: Yes, I'm

15
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.260
All handy here and then all of a sudden, I didn't. So let me get it again.

16
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.810
Mary Kastner: So when do you

17
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.220
Mary Kastner: Go to the Philippines.

18
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.050
Joshua Reyes: Was plus hospice, I was supposed to go.

19
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.870
Joshua Reyes: Last

20
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:57.180
Joshua Reyes: Last week where obviously you're not my situation. So my grandma's more memorial is on the 27th so

21
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.310
Joshua Reyes: That's it. So we I mean I'm I

22
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.920
Joshua Reyes: Don't know when to go yet because, you know, I just wanted to talk to you for stuff like that.

23
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:23.160
Mary Kastner: Well, um, I talked to the medical director and he suggests that we put you on liberalism, which is a longer acting benzodiazepine

24
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.900
Mary Kastner: And he gave me the dosage, that would be equivalent to the advantage that you're taking

25
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.750
Mary Kastner: Which would be 25 milligrams three a day.

26
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.310
Joshua Reyes: And

27
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.420
Mary Kastner: Then what how I use the libertarian is different.

28
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.460
Joshua Reyes: I use it for

29
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.680
Mary Kastner: Alcohol withdrawal basically

30
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.570
Joshua Reyes: Do anything

31
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.080
Mary Kastner: Well, it is something

32
00:07:59.310 --> 00:07:59.940
Mary Kastner: That

33
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.610
Mary Kastner: Is so long acting

34
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.310
Mary Kastner: That you don't get the feeling

35
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.070
Mary Kastner: Of instant relief because it takes a while to kick in.

36
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:22.500
Mary Kastner: Then the other thing that he suggests is that you get into some individual work.

37
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.650
Mary Kastner: With

38
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.520
Mary Kastner: Somebody you can see in the office, not online.

39
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:42.600
Mary Kastner: So he wants me to issue you a ladder telling you that we're going to, um,

40
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.990
Mary Kastner: Have you not, you know, closer to our services in a month 30 days from today.

41
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.990
Mary Kastner: So that you've got 30 days to find yourself another provider.

42
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.340
Joshua Reyes: Only um

43
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.130
Joshua Reyes: Let me close it out.

44
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:11.400
Mary Kastner: Yet that your, your service to the behavioral health will no longer you know will close your case.

45
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.010
Mary Kastner: That you need to that you're better served with somebody that you see in person.

46
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:31.260
Mary Kastner: And you suggest giving you liberate them 25 milligrams three times a day. Until then, we'll order you a week's worth and then you can get

47
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.480
Three refills.

48
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.650
Mary Kastner: very potent medication.

49
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.680
Joshua Reyes: What Dr casner

50
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:47.400
Joshua Reyes: I want to be honest with you, like, I tried them that did not work at all.

51
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:48.990
Joshua Reyes: And

52
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:58.140
Joshua Reyes: And honestly, the way that we're going is I really like how you working with me is where work tapering off.

53
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.810
Mary Kastner: Slow. No, we're not tapering

54
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.380
Mary Kastner: Were tried to taper but you overuse each time.

55
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:14.010
Mary Kastner: When we did the pill count. You were down 10 from what you should be. So I don't think right now that you're able to taper.

56
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.840
Mary Kastner: Actually

57
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.740
Mary Kastner: Libertarian and or values.

58
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.880
Mary Kastner: Are used to help people taper.

59
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.700
Mary Kastner: Because they're longer acting

60
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.260
Mary Kastner: They stay with you, longer, and they'll stay in your system for weeks.

61
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.690
Mary Kastner: So my questions have to

62
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.530
Mary Kastner: Do with

63
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.550
Mary Kastner: We know that you're taking the sedative hypnotic

64
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.190
Mary Kastner: In a larger amount than then prescribed

65
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.740
Mary Kastner: There is a

66
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:32.970
Mary Kastner: Are you attempting at all, or do you have a desire to cut down or control that your sedative hypnotic use

67
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.100
Joshua Reyes: Yes.

68
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:37.980
Okay.

69
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.710
Mary Kastner: I'm

70
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:50.430
Mary Kastner: A great deal of time is spent in your mind and in your activities in order to obtain this sedative hypnotic

71
00:16:52.740 --> 00:17:00.600
Mary Kastner: Or recovered from its effects. We know that that's true because you call and stay in a virtual clinic and

72
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.370
Mary Kastner: insist upon appointments. When the answer is the same.

73
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:20.280
Mary Kastner: So I think you're spending a lot of time and and thought in trying to get your sedative hypnotic. Do you have a craving or a strong desire to use the sedative hypnotic

74
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.400
Joshua Reyes: Craving

75
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.410
Mary Kastner: Um,

76
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:41.490
Mary Kastner: Do you have your use of the said hypnotic results in any kind of failure of you to be able to do your work.

77
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.910
Mary Kastner: Or your home responsibilities.

78
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:45.960
No.

79
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:47.700
Okay.

80
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:57.060
Mary Kastner: Despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused by your use of the sedative hypnotic

81
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.700
Mary Kastner: Or exacerbated by the effects of a sedative agnostic.

82
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:11.790
Mary Kastner: Like, do you have any problems where you feel intoxicated or you get in physical fights or into difficulty at work.

83
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.060
Mary Kastner: Okay.

84
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:30.930
Mary Kastner: Do you have important social, occupational recreational activities that are given up or reduce because of your use of it or your inability to get it. No.

85
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.280
Mary Kastner: Do you have

86
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:43.860
Mary Kastner: You use of it in situations which is physically hazardous for instance driving

87
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.330
Mary Kastner: Is your use.

88
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.090
Mary Kastner: Do you continue to overuse it despite having

89
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.640
Mary Kastner: Persistent physical or psychological problems due to use a bit

90
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:07.860
Joshua Reyes: What was it

91
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.090
Mary Kastner: You have a craving or need to have this things realistic all the time.

92
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:25.470
Mary Kastner: And to have a certain amount of it, despite your knowledge of having persistent psychological problems, meaning withdrawal symptoms if you don't get it.

93
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.010
Mm hmm.

94
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.520
Mary Kastner: And have you built up a tolerance to where you need more to get the same effect.

95
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.050
Joshua Reyes: No.

96
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.740
Mary Kastner: Need for markedly increased amounts of it.

97
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.740
Mary Kastner: To achieve your effect.

98
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.360
Mary Kastner: Then why are you overusing it

99
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.460
Joshua Reyes: I don't want to call myself very

100
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.470
Joshua Reyes: I don't want to kill myself.

101
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.320
Joshua Reyes: You know, I have so much

102
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.850
Joshua Reyes: tolerance of it is

103
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.660
Joshua Reyes: You know, but as the

104
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:32.640
Joshua Reyes: As you know that I've been using it for seven years, if I if I want to say if I because I've been using this for seven years. If I have very big tolerance of it. I would be taking

105
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.670
Joshua Reyes: Six or seven or eight to eight to eight milligrams a day if I

106
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.520
Mary Kastner: And how many are you taking now.

107
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.770
Joshua Reyes: Like the past two days because i mean i don't know because I've been sick. The past two days I've been taking

108
00:20:52.320 --> 00:21:02.910
Joshua Reyes: One at 12 O'CLOCK IN THE ONE at six o'clock and fall asleep. So just brings to a day because i mean i don't know because I've been. I've been. Since, but I just get

109
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.950
Mary Kastner: Up and how about before that.

110
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.110
Mary Kastner: Before you been sick.

111
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.540
Joshua Reyes: Before that is

112
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.300
Joshua Reyes: Honestly, run.

113
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.410
Joshua Reyes: The most I've been taking this three year I hadn't even took four in a day. So I don't want to call myself.

114
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:26.280
Joshua Reyes: I have a big tolerance, because I would take more

115
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.880
Mary Kastner: Than how do you account for the 10 that are missing.

116
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.360
Joshua Reyes: Maybe I've been taking

117
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:51.870
Joshua Reyes: I don't really count it. Dr. Katzen or maybe I can take maybe a half more day, but I don't. Besides that, I don't feel myself just oh I'm I'm addicted to it. I am slowly tapering off and I'm really, really.

118
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.590
Worth a year.

119
00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:01.350
Mary Kastner: Cars. Are you ready to you're at three, sometimes three and a half a day except when you're sick, you

120
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:08.400
Joshua Reyes: Know not never been a half, maybe three in one one court so but never three now.

121
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.150
Mary Kastner: Okay.

122
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.420
Mary Kastner: Do you think is giving you the same effect it had previously.

123
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:19.470
Yeah.

124
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.830
Mary Kastner: Okay. Do you get any withdrawal from it.

125
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:33.330
Joshua Reyes: Yes, I do. Sometimes I'm so that's it feel like mine, hey, my hands are shaking. Yeah.

126
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.320
Mary Kastner: So I would

127
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.300
Mary Kastner: That would be a better reason to take a longer acting one

128
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.190
Mary Kastner: So then you would take one when you start feeling that way. Is that correct,

129
00:22:51.780 --> 00:23:05.190
Joshua Reyes: So once I once I kind of like, feel like that. And then once I like to, like, Oh my God, I feel like I'm having a panic attack and not take one milligram out of there and then

130
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.920
Mary Kastner: So it just seems to me like sometimes that withdraw is confused a little bit with the panic.

131
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:31.830
Mary Kastner: So right now, from from this little survey that we did you have a sedative hypnotic gangs you elliptic use disorder, it is actually severe and that would be your diagnosis that will put down

132
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:38.730
Mary Kastner: That's three or 4.10 parentheses F1 3.20

133
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.490
Mary Kastner: And so that's all the more reason

134
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:52.080
Mary Kastner: To give you a longer acting benzodiazepine and in order to really work on

135
00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:10.020
Mary Kastner: Helping you taper. You really need to be in an office face to face with somebody as our. This is our the BHA recommendation.

136
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.060
Mary Kastner: So,

137
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.420
Mary Kastner: You're going to be receiving a letter.

138
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:30.810
Mary Kastner: That tells you that in third within 30 days, you need to find yourself a new provider. So I can give you either the value or the live room. If you don't want the live room.

139
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.970
Mary Kastner: For a week with three refills until you find somebody

140
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.620
Joshua Reyes: Sorry, I can't stick with you or

141
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:54.750
Mary Kastner: Know, you'll be discharged from the bright heart health platform, you need to go into an office. This is all online service.

142
00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.280
Joshua Reyes: So who recommended this

143
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.430
Mary Kastner: Medical Director bright heart health.

144
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.980
Joshua Reyes: So, I mean, I don't know where else

145
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.670
Joshua Reyes: To go

146
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.530
Mary Kastner: Well, where do you live, pin. Oh.

147
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:19.710
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

148
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.980
Mary Kastner: I'll ask my care coordinator if she has some

149
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.050
Mary Kastner: A list of providers. You can also go into the

150
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.350
Mary Kastner: APA American Psychiatric Association and they will look for

151
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.560
Mary Kastner: They will, they can give you a list of people in your area.

152
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:58.560
Joshua Reyes: Said that you didn't give me the weeks where you are a nother. So how's How's my trip to know works. Yeah, that's, that's my thing.

153
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.490
Mary Kastner: Well, you still have some leftover correct

154
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.950
Mary Kastner: Here, Adam, and how many do you have

155
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.760
Leftover

156
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.890
Joshua Reyes: 30 something

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:53.820
Mary Kastner: So there's some medication options that we can try. I gotta tell you that

389
00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:10.830
Mary Kastner: The best treatment of courses therapy for PTSD. I think that's what you're suffering from and the other issue is, nothing's going to work that well until we get those pain receptors in your brain kind of calm.

390
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.760
Mary Kastner: Right now, you know, using the Norco about 100 milligrams a day.

391
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:26.760
Mary Kastner: Is nominal amount. And basically, I don't know if you've felt it. But sometimes you you need more to get the same effect.

392
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.310
Mary Kastner: I bet you when you started using our call you were not at 10 a day.

393
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.410
Curtisha’s iPhone: No.

394
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:42.330
Mary Kastner: No. So, pretty soon you know they're saying, Okay, this isn't doing it for me anymore. I think you need to get more and it's going to keep going.

395
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:44.940
Mary Kastner: Until you know

396
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.740
Mary Kastner: You don't wake up.

397
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.390
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay.

398
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:50.010
Curtisha’s iPhone: So,

399
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.140
Mary Kastner: I think for you to think about

400
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:58.680
Mary Kastner: Getting into treatment for that and getting on some kind of medication that will keep you from having that happen.

401
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.700
Mary Kastner: Okay, might be advisable that you get into

402
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:11.310
Mary Kastner: What we call opiate use disorder treatment and there is medication assisted treatment as well as therapy for that.

403
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.000
Mary Kastner: Until you reach that decision.

404
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:22.110
Mary Kastner: You know, I'm happy to give you something that might help you, you know, sleep better, and not be so

405
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.260
Mary Kastner: What we call fight or flight.

406
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.470
Mary Kastner: Do you know what I mean by that.

407
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.300
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah, the fight.

408
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.170
Mary Kastner: Fight or flight response. It's sort of like having your adrenaline up all the time.

409
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.430
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

410
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.790
Mary Kastner: And so what happens in is all this

411
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.280
Mary Kastner: Blood and nourishment goes to those organs that will help you run

412
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:45.690
Curtisha’s iPhone: And

413
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.690
Mary Kastner: Be alert, you know, they go to your vision.

414
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:58.230
Mary Kastner: They go to your, your muscle. So you can run and so guess what they're not going to your stomach.

415
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:05.760
Mary Kastner: And helping you with your digestion and not going necessarily to your heart and lungs are not going to your brain.

416
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:16.410
Mary Kastner: And so all those things get sacrificed because your muscles are already ready to go. And you're hyper vigilant and ready to go.

417
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.830
Mary Kastner: Well, of course, that's not a relaxed feeling

418
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:21.330
Mary Kastner: Right.

419
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:27.990
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so you're trying to mimic that relaxed feeling with opiates and volume.

420
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:35.070
Mary Kastner: Volume is very long acting. It'll be a long time for you to get off of that. And it's very difficult.

421
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:36.750
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay.

422
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:49.170
Mary Kastner: I'm telling you, you're going to go from three a day to for a day to five a day to six each skin is not going to stop because you get a tolerance built up. It's not the treatment. It's a bandaid

423
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.850
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay.

424
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:57.660
Mary Kastner: So just think about that. I'm not pushing you, because I I hear that you're not here for treatment of those

425
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.240
Mary Kastner: Those issues you're here for

426
00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.730
Mary Kastner: Your sleep and your energy and

427
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.400
Mary Kastner: Anxiety and depression.

428
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:06.690
Yes.

429
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:11.370
Mary Kastner: But I'd like to scare you. That way when you ready

430
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:12.720
Curtisha’s iPhone: OK.

431
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.550
Mary Kastner: OK, so today.

432
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:18.330
Mary Kastner: I just have to finish your intake. If you can bear with me on that.

433
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:26.370
Mary Kastner: So, um, do you have any withdrawal symptoms ever

434
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.010

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:46.500

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:02.670

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:19.080

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:22.710
Mary Kastner: You have

671
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:37.500
Mary Kastner: Some egg or phobia, meaning you staying in all the time because of the trauma it feeling on guard you have an opioid dependence with the prescription

672
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:41.310
Mary Kastner: Narcos and

673
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.430
Mary Kastner: Some sedative hypnotic

674
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.200
Mary Kastner: Dependence

675
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.740
Mary Kastner: I would like to see us be able to get you down a little bit, especially in the Valium.

676
01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:03.060
Mary Kastner: So that maybe this Zoloft would take the place and help you feel a bit more calm.

677
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.500
Mary Kastner: How tall are you, pretty sure

678
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:08.610

684
01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:36.840
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay. So I think the Zoloft might be the better. I was thinking of another one. But it could increase your appetite a little bit too much, but it definitely would help you sleep. It's called the grammar on

685
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:42.930
Curtisha’s iPhone: Remo make me eat a lot though. Right.

Brandon Smith: I'm now living in a sober living house with a other men, trying to do the same thing that I am

767
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:43.830

Brandon Smith: Yeah, when I always 25

773
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:08.430

775
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:34.140
Brandon Smith: Was working the steps and it was a successful for a period of time and I ended up moving away because I met someone and I stopped going to meetings and all that. And, you know, kind of gotten back to my old habits there and things ended up

776
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.620
Brandon Smith: And they lead to the same place, I guess.

With a

1293
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:17.580

1302
01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.150

1411
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:08.280
Mary Kastner: Uh huh.

1412
01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:10.920
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: Uh huh.

1413
01:56:12.810 --> 01:56:15.810

1414
01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.890
Mary Kastner: Program to work for me today pulses not working for me.

01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:24.360
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: Okay.

1416
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:35.790
Mary Kastner: So I am trying to put in a note to the care navigator Danielle and she is who you would ask for. If you call back in about your medication Danielle's her name.

1417
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:41.280
Mary Kastner: Okay. Eventually, eventually I will be able to hopefully get in there.

1418
01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:51.390
Mary Kastner: And center a message because I don't understand why you're not getting your medication. Have you had any self harm behaviors, since I saw you last

1419
01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:52.410
No.

1420
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:54.360
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1421
01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:05.700
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: But the, the other does all of that I have right now is what I'm taking in the morning.

1422
01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:15.690
Mary Kastner: Okay, and you only have one left. And we were talking about adding boost bar to a because you asked for something in addition for your anxiety.

1423
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:16.890
Mary Kastner: Yes. So what we

1424
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:17.280
Would

1425
01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.480
Mary Kastner: We would add is we spar 10 milligrams one three times a day.

1426
01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:27.570
Mary Kastner: And

1427
01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:30.780
Mary Kastner: As far as side effects or effect.

1428
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:34.320
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: Because they're gonna make don't

1429
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:42.210
Mary Kastner: I don't anticipate. You're going to feel anything. You know, it takes about six weeks for this to do anything.

1430
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:51.450
Mary Kastner: But believe me, like I said, people that have been on it once they go off they go. Oh, it was doing something so

1431
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:52.830
Mary Kastner: I thought it's worth a try.

1432
01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:57.420
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: Okay, but it, what is it like drowsiness or sedated or anything.

1433
01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.010
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: It was all logged

1434
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:05.040
Mary Kastner: In. So did you move that to the bed time

1435
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:13.860
Galaxy Note10+ 5G: No I didn't, because I thought that was. I thought you were going to prescribe that one. That was me different, but I was totally confused.

1436
01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:17.130
Mary Kastner: Okay, let me look and see what I told you.

Mary Kastner: Yeah, you're going to start getting sad.

1741
02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:03.720
Yeah.

1742
02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:07.530
XT1710-02: Okay, just processing everything, little by little,

1743
02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:08.430
So,

1744
02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:20.280
XT1710-02: Yeah, my anxiety really is really, really triggered by like unexpected change like like something that just pulls the rug from under your feet.

1745
02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:21.690
XT1710-02: I

1746
02:19:22.470 --> 02:19:44.370
XT1710-02: Process that stuff and I need a second. That's exactly why I got arrested in the first place, and why I lost my kid because I was in a very stressful situation like something I was very distressed by something and police officer just approached me wrong, and it just all went to hell.

1747
02:19:46.050 --> 02:19:54.210
XT1710-02: And my boss, did the same thing, which was just so strange because he knows me very well. He knows that I can't handle that.

1748
02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.610
XT1710-02: But whatever

1749
02:19:57.750 --> 02:20:01.200
Mary Kastner: It is. So would you say you have some sort of like intermittent

1750
02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:06.720
Mary Kastner: Rage reaction or anger or

1751
02:20:07.290 --> 02:20:07.920
XT1710-02: Yes.

1752
02:20:08.370 --> 02:20:09.600
Yes, like overwhelming.

1753
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.980
XT1710-02: Yeah.

1754
02:20:11.010 --> 02:20:13.590
Mary Kastner: In the old days they call it hysteria where you

1755
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:14.010
XT1710-02: Get

1756
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:16.170
Mary Kastner: Sort of at crazy

1757
02:20:16.770 --> 02:20:18.540
Mary Kastner: Yes, uh huh.

1758
02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:22.020
Mary Kastner: Oh boy.

1759
02:20:22.470 --> 02:20:24.180
Mary Kastner: And trick and it's

1760
02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:25.290
XT1710-02: always treated

1761
02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:28.500
Mary Kastner: This doesn't come out of the blue, it's triggered by something

1762
02:20:29.730 --> 02:20:41.730
XT1710-02: And I was just, I just knew what it was never going to end it was just so I just got done putting that stupid business to like a manageable.

1763
02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:48.240
XT1710-02: Like almost and basically I got everything to finally start running smoothly.

1764
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:55.980
XT1710-02: And I was going to take more meantime and focus on all the shit that I had going on in my personal life.

1765
02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:00.540
XT1710-02: And it just got all fucked up again and at the worst.

1766
02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:03.150
XT1710-02: Possible time and I completely overreacted

1767
02:21:04.170 --> 02:21:04.680
Mm hmm.

1768
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:15.810
Mary Kastner: And you realize that it is overreacting. And then you feel you know some guilt about that and and you have to keep rehashing what happened in your brain.

1769
02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:23.760
Mary Kastner: Sort of like a record just just keeps playing and playing and playing, you can't cut it off.

1770
02:21:25.050 --> 02:21:28.050
XT1710-02: Yeah. But the thing is, if I would have

1771
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:34.260
XT1710-02: Gone with it. Like if I could stop myself even if I could stop myself.

1772
02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:45.000
XT1710-02: Like, where do you draw the line of people taking not i guess i felt extremely taken advantage of.

1773
02:21:46.170 --> 02:21:46.560
XT1710-02: Or

1774
02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:49.440
XT1710-02: Violated for sure violated.

1775
02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:51.000
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

1776
02:21:58.890 --> 02:22:02.460
Mary Kastner: And you've tried Zoloft before and you just felt numb.

1777
02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:03.870
Mm hmm.

1778
02:22:06.330 --> 02:22:06.930
Mary Kastner: And

1779
02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:09.780
Mary Kastner: So,

1780
02:22:11.610 --> 02:22:14.460
Mary Kastner: Your sleep is seven hours.

1781
02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:17.880
Mary Kastner: Continuous routinely

1782
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:24.210
XT1710-02: Yeah, last night I didn't sleep well at all. I couldn't fall asleep for the longest time. Okay.

1783
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:28.650
Mary Kastner: But typically, you can get about seven hours on interrupted every night.

1784
02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.360
XT1710-02: No interrupted.

1785
02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:32.610
Mary Kastner: Interrupted

1786
02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:36.180
XT1710-02: Yeah, I usually wake up between, like, four and six for a minute.

1787
02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:39.660
Mary Kastner: And then you go back to sleep at six.

1788
02:22:40.290 --> 02:22:40.530
Hmm.

1789
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:43.470
Mary Kastner: And then, how long do you sleep.

1790
02:22:44.430 --> 02:22:50.010
XT1710-02: Well, my alarm is set for 830 so I usually get another two and a half hours.

1791
02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:52.560
Mary Kastner: Okay, and what time you go to bed.

1792
02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:54.630
XT1710-02: Nick around 11 ish

1793
02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:58.560
Mary Kastner: Okay. And how long does it take you to fall asleep.

1794
02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:01.320
XT1710-02: I don't know.

1795
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.170
XT1710-02: I don't really notice

1796
02:23:05.430 --> 02:23:06.450
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay.

1797
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:12.360
Mary Kastner: So any let's get into a little bit of

1798
02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:26.340
Mary Kastner: Do you ever have to or in again we're kind of doing a psychiatric review of symptoms. This is a VHS HMP continued visit and you referred by

1799
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:29.190
XT1710-02: Dr.

1800
02:23:29.850 --> 02:23:36.000
Mary Kastner: Jameson to do the psychiatric workup. So does it ever get to be

1801
02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:40.980
Mary Kastner: Where you have to order things in a Certain Way.

1802
02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:44.400
Mary Kastner: Or you have to count.

1803
02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:46.050
Mary Kastner: No or no.

1804
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:50.910
Mary Kastner: Okay, so no obsessive compulsive behavior.

1805
02:23:50.970 --> 02:23:51.450
XT1710-02: Ya.

1806
02:23:51.480 --> 02:24:11.370
XT1710-02: Know some obsessional. Ya know, like over exaggerated crazy stuff. Okay. But when when when I'm it's basically like this when something is really like not necessarily high stress, but has to work quickly and in in sync.

1807
02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:16.860
XT1710-02: Everything has to be lined up, so I don't start tripping over

1808
02:24:17.850 --> 02:24:36.930
XT1710-02: What's the next thing to do because Dad's gonna fuck me up and throw me into an anxious frenzy. So like at work. I'm responsible for I was responsible for my own self, and the rest of the girls and of course the condition of the spot. So everything had to be ready for me to

1809
02:24:38.490 --> 02:24:55.380
XT1710-02: Like handle whatever issue. It could be. So because of that, like, again, that had to be lined up like the little facial towels had to be folded just right. So I could enroll them with one move like this. And yet, like the examples.

1810
02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:57.600
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1811
02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:00.480
Mary Kastner: But nothing at home like that that you

1812
02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:04.290
XT1710-02: Know I'm completely disorganized.

1813
02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:08.490
XT1710-02: Because

1814
02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:23.760
XT1710-02: You know, I don't. There it was business like everybody had to leave our place, not realizing that absolutely anything wasn't running like a world world is a well oiled machine.

1815
02:25:24.930 --> 02:25:26.280
Mary Kastner: Did you get along with the other

1816
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:29.250
XT1710-02: Oh yeah, I loved everybody

1817
02:25:30.270 --> 02:25:36.690
XT1710-02: Okay, my boss. I was like shaking when he was firing me I have to get him water twice.

1818
02:25:40.470 --> 02:25:46.620
Mary Kastner: Okay, and you said you don't have over hallucinations or

1819
02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:53.670
Mary Kastner: Visions or hearing voices are feeling things crawling on your skin or smelling things that aren't there.

1820
02:25:54.570 --> 02:25:54.840
XT1710-02: No.

1821
02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:01.230
Mary Kastner: But there's a mile paranoid because you feel like you've been screwed so many times.

1822
02:26:02.610 --> 02:26:03.180
Mary Kastner: I say

1823
02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:11.730
Mary Kastner: A bit of OCD at work, but not at home and definitely some continued obsessive thinking around the past

1824
02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:14.220
XT1710-02: Mm hmm.

1825
02:26:14.460 --> 02:26:16.410
Mary Kastner: travesty said Have happened to

1826
02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:21.960
Mary Kastner: Any eating problems where you feel like you

1827
02:26:23.010 --> 02:26:31.650
Mary Kastner: Have lost weight unintentionally or intentionally or binging or purging or denying yourself food.

1828
02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:33.090
No.

1829
02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:35.250
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1830
02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:40.860
Mary Kastner: Um, is there any history of psychiatric illness in your family.

1831
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:42.270
XT1710-02: Oh, I think so.

1832
02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:44.340
Mary Kastner: Okay, tell me.

1833
02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:45.930
XT1710-02: My mom's side is

1834
02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:49.950
XT1710-02: Completely bipolar. But I can't, I don't know enough about it.

1835
02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:51.660
Mary Kastner: Yes.

1836
02:26:51.750 --> 02:27:07.440
XT1710-02: Your mother, your father know my mom with well anxiety runs in my family. I'm not the first one, but also have these weird mood swings from happy too angry older than

1837
02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:10.770
XT1710-02: Mm hmm. I don't know what the hell Douglas

1838
02:27:11.730 --> 02:27:14.070
Mary Kastner: And how about your sisters or brothers.

1839
02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:16.650
XT1710-02: She never gave me a sibling.

1840
02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:20.310
XT1710-02: Okay. So yo I injured her all alone.

1841
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:26.370
Mary Kastner: And not bother your grandparents statement.

1842
02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:29.010
Mary Kastner: I know my kids don't say that about me.

1843
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:31.860
XT1710-02: My grandfather

1844
02:27:32.850 --> 02:27:53.730
XT1710-02: So on my dad's side. I'd never noticed any mental illness on my mom's side now looking back at it. I feel like I heard that my grandmother great grandmother was really weird and would do similar things to my mom, where it was just from happy to completely ridiculous.

1845
02:27:54.750 --> 02:28:04.110
XT1710-02: And my grandfather. I can't say for sure because he was in world war two and he had shrapnel, and from a grenade exploding.

1846
02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:17.070
XT1710-02: And it went in to the back of his head. So, and with all the PTSD and everything like we were told to never approach him when he sleeping because he would, he thought he always started was the enemy.

1847
02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:26.970
XT1710-02: He had nightmares and I don't know how much came from what you know nature nurture.

1848
02:28:28.170 --> 02:28:28.590
XT1710-02: That yeah

1849
02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:31.650
Mary Kastner: And how about your father.

1850
02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:39.240
XT1710-02: My father is completely withdrawn, man. He's not bad, he's just not smart.

1851
02:28:41.250 --> 02:28:41.700
Mm hmm.

1852
02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:47.160
XT1710-02: My father betrayed me recently, well I found out about it recently.

1853
02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:50.460
XT1710-02: And I guess.

1854
02:28:51.930 --> 02:28:59.130
XT1710-02: I don't know. I'm still looking for good daddy figure, I guess. And then I felt really betrayed by my grandma by my boss.

1855
02:29:00.570 --> 02:29:02.400
How did your father betrayed.

1856
02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:09.060
XT1710-02: In a nutshell because it's such a weird story. It was a party.

1857
02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:12.090
XT1710-02: It have to be fancy.

1858
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:25.470
XT1710-02: My when I arrived with my son and just just getting there. I it was so hard. It was not in this city. We had to go to LA, I had to be all dressed up.

1859
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:34.710
XT1710-02: And I guess my dad being the jerk that he is made fun of me right when I arrived at this beautiful event.

1860
02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:50.760
XT1710-02: Like right at the steps and I just kind of was like what the fuck, and I, I didn't say that, but I didn't like say what kind of reaction is this to my arrival, like what I

1861
02:29:51.150 --> 02:30:03.300
XT1710-02: I do myself. I was thinking I did everything you asked for, like, I'm on time. I look fantastic your grandson looks fantastic. And this woman who is related to us.

1862
02:30:04.350 --> 02:30:17.940
XT1710-02: On his on my step family side so on his wife side misunderstood what was happening and grabbed me and grabbed me by the hair and yanked my hair out with extensions

1863
02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:35.160
XT1710-02: By the way, this is like Los Angeles elite behaving this way, this is no hillbillies, you know, and it was just shocking to me and my dad did absolutely nothing. And then some more stuff happened that made me kind of

1864
02:30:36.330 --> 02:30:44.130
XT1710-02: I, I was under the impression that something happened about this that it didn't just all get swept under the rug.

1865
02:30:44.700 --> 02:31:00.960
XT1710-02: Well apparently not only did it get swept under the rug. It was all blamed on me with my dad's knowledge and. Okay. And apparently, none of this happened and all of that was in my imagination. Because everybody always thinks I'm crazy.

1866
02:31:02.430 --> 02:31:05.730
XT1710-02: So it just got blamed on Dino being hyper whatever

1867
02:31:08.850 --> 02:31:16.650
XT1710-02: My dad stood right there. A him and and his wife, and they were both just shocked but what just happened.

1868
02:31:17.430 --> 02:31:31.410
XT1710-02: But nobody said a word. And they went with that story. And because of that, even though clearly nobody was a really good family to me since I haven't heard from them, but I know but everyone stopped talking to me after that.

1869
02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:34.680
XT1710-02: And my guess.

1870
02:31:35.310 --> 02:31:45.630
XT1710-02: Is everyone. Well, my entire family was my dad and his dad, my step family I we don't have anybody else. So that was that.

1871
02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:49.860
Mary Kastner: And they, you don't know why they acted that way you you look

1872
02:31:50.370 --> 02:31:53.760
Mary Kastner: Nice and you didn't say anything. And you're on time.

1873
02:31:54.450 --> 02:31:55.560
XT1710-02: Yeah, so

1874
02:31:56.010 --> 02:31:56.520
Mary Kastner: I did.

1875
02:31:57.090 --> 02:32:06.900
XT1710-02: YEAH, YEAH. MY DAD FELT THAT at that exact moment. So I don't know if you can see, like, imagine you're my dad and I'm me right we're looking at one another.

1876
02:32:07.350 --> 02:32:19.290
XT1710-02: And to this site down the stairs. Like, imagine like courthouse steps, kind of just like in the movie down the steps. Apparently my stepsister was taking a photo.

1877
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:24.480

1885
02:33:45.240 --> 02:34:02.700
XT1710-02: She, she didn't find it funny and the other lady, I don't think heard what had happened or heard something but wasn't she probably thought that he was reacting to something I was doing wrong and not the other way around. And she just went from me.

1886
02:34:06.210 --> 02:34:07.230
Mary Kastner: So then what you do.

1887
02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:15.630

1890
02:34:26.850 --> 02:34:29.520
Mary Kastner: And I was just wondering, all, all this

1893
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:52.800
XT1710-02: But then on the way home because we were supposed to actually stay in LA. It was quite late that we were driving home.

1894
02:34:53.430 --> 02:35:04.500
XT1710-02: But as we were driving home he was asleep. But then when he woke up when we got home, my Nanny nanny was still awake. It was like, midnight, and he didn't expect us home.

XT1710-02: They all took her side because she's the elder sibling, and she was my grandmother's caretaker. So everybody had to take her so

1924
02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:08.280
Mary Kastner: This is all very painful stuff.

1925
02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:11.190
XT1710-02: Yeah. Mm hmm.

1926
02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:17.790
Mary Kastner: Have you in. You said you had a couple years of individual therapy.

XT1710-02: I'm really, I'm really nervous about what's going to happen because my boss was my closest friend. I have a feeling that I'm gonna freak out soon.

1929
02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:34.320
Mary Kastner: You're gonna wet.

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:42.600
XT1710-02: Right now I don't miss him because I don't like I'm not in that place where he's my friend.

1931
02:38:44.250 --> 02:39:00.120
XT1710-02: So I haven't lost a friend. Yet, if that makes sense or know anything like I my friend is not available to me yet. But in a minute. Once I actually process that he's no longer in my life.

1932
02:39:02.730 --> 02:39:03.660
XT1710-02: I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1933
02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:05.040
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1934
02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:13.830
XT1710-02: Okay.

1935
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:18.990
Mary Kastner: You think you might hurt yourself.

1936
02:39:21.900 --> 02:39:24.930
Mary Kastner: Okay, you've never tried to hurt yourself.

1937
02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:30.720
XT1710-02: Oh no, I don't suffer from depression I I have not that I will

1938
02:39:32.010 --> 02:39:46.020
XT1710-02: But I'm just giving you a proportion that I would sooner like hurt, not another person, but whoever is causing me PAIN then

1939
02:39:46.620 --> 02:40:01.020
XT1710-02: Then hurt me because I don't understand why people cut themselves. I mean, I get cat, there's some sort of, I just, I'm I've been beat up so much now that I'm not gonna help people bring me any further down

1940
02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:02.160
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1941
02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:03.630
XT1710-02: I would never hurt myself.

1942
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:06.600
Mary Kastner: Would you turn to alcohol or any drugs.

1943
02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:07.560
Yeah.

1944
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:09.120
XT1710-02: Mm hmm.

1945
02:40:10.590 --> 02:40:14.370
Mary Kastner: Do you use alcohol in that way where you you just use it.

1946
02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:16.080
XT1710-02: I used to listen.

1947
02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:16.860
Mary Kastner: To feel better.

1948
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:24.300
XT1710-02: Yeah, but I mostly rely on marijuana when I'm really extremely overwhelmed.

1949
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:35.070
Mary Kastner: I see. And I haven't. When's the last time. Yeah, use medical marijuana. When's the last time that you had any medical marijuana

1950
02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:38.220
XT1710-02: Yesterday, okay.

1951
02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:40.980
Mary Kastner: And how much do you use at a time.

1952
02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:53.430
XT1710-02: We'll see. Not much. I got to be way less than before. But that's because I also kept myself very busy. And so it was a great distraction.

1953
02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:56.970
Mary Kastner: Yeah and now you're not so busy. Are you fearful.

1954
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.050
XT1710-02: Yeah yeah

1955
02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:02.730
Mary Kastner: How much was your highest use in a day.

1956
02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:09.150
XT1710-02: About four times so

1957
02:41:09.270 --> 02:41:13.110
XT1710-02: I usually smoke flour in the mornings, or I used to

1958
02:41:14.970 --> 02:41:17.040
XT1710-02: I would say, how about this, I would say.

1959
02:41:18.450 --> 02:41:33.120
XT1710-02: Three times a day with in between using a bake it like at work, but the way I would usually do this is I would smoke in the morning, but I recently stopped smoking mornings altogether.

1960
02:41:34.410 --> 02:41:35.910
XT1710-02: Probably within the last

1961
02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:40.020
XT1710-02: Three months or so I stopped smoking in the morning.

1962
02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:51.720
XT1710-02: And I would smoke in the afternoon on like up because it where the spotless. If you could get. And he did. He never cared.

1963
02:41:52.950 --> 02:42:05.850
XT1710-02: And then in and then again in the evening to help like kind of chill out for bedtime. But then I would carry my baby at work, but I noticed that when I carried my baby at work. I smoked bless

1964
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.800
XT1710-02: Because he was like

1965
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:09.120
XT1710-02: Interest security blanket.

1966
02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:10.440
Like a crutch.

1967
02:42:12.090 --> 02:42:13.200
Mary Kastner: And no alcohol.

1968
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.510
XT1710-02: Maybe

1969
02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:17.220
XT1710-02: Huh.

1970
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:21.330
XT1710-02: A while ago.

1971
02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:22.830
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1972
02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:31.590
XT1710-02: Like, I don't remember. Now, I guess. Oh, I should tell you that right about that whole thing happened. Due to the fact that

1973
02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:50.670
XT1710-02: I had ignored that whole like confrontation altercation with the police officer happened because I started bleeding and I had a very bad feeling about why I was bleeding. So I like I said complete overreaction but after that I found out that

1974
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:59.850
XT1710-02: It was a different thing that was making me be, but he was still very dangerous when I had a, I guess, have a blood filled cyst.

1975
02:43:00.390 --> 02:43:08.460
XT1710-02: And it ruptured, and it pretty much destroyed that ovary, because I didn't. I was supposed to be in the hospital and they threw me in jail.

1976
02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:30.390
XT1710-02: So it works, but it doesn't, it's not going to give me any babies. So I put all my efforts into keeping the other one afloat until I can extract the eggs and save them and I on an alkaline diet so I can have things like coffee or

1977
02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:35.280
XT1710-02: Tomatoes or citrus like that.

1978
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:39.930
Mary Kastner: Okay. And when was the police incident.

1979
02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:43.440
XT1710-02: April third 19

1980
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.990
Okay.

1981
02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:49.440
Mary Kastner: And do you have leftover

1982
02:43:53.100 --> 02:43:54.300
Mary Kastner: Legal issues from that.

1983
02:43:55.890 --> 02:44:00.750
XT1710-02: No trouble trying to get my kid back ok ok ok

1984
02:44:03.090 --> 02:44:09.930
Mary Kastner: OK, so let's just finish this sort of intake and I have an idea as to what we can do for you.

1985
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:15.810
Mary Kastner: To help with your anxiety. Number one, which seems to be the overwhelming.

1986
02:44:17.430 --> 02:44:18.330
Mary Kastner: Issue here.

1987
02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:24.420
Mary Kastner: 10 being the most anxious. You've been. Where did you put your

1988
02:44:25.530 --> 02:44:28.380
Mary Kastner: You put two out of 10 yesterday. How about today.

1989
02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:35.280
XT1710-02: It seriously when up while we were talking to snow. So I would

1990
02:44:35.430 --> 02:44:36.840
XT1710-02: Say, I'm sure it did.

1991
02:44:39.210 --> 02:44:42.390
XT1710-02: Three. Three to four depending on up.

1992
02:44:42.690 --> 02:44:44.190
XT1710-02: Yeah, and it's like

1993
02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:46.710
Mary Kastner: And how about depression.

1994
02:44:47.730 --> 02:44:49.200
XT1710-02: No, I'm not depressed. I know.

1995
02:44:50.220 --> 02:44:53.370
Mary Kastner: Okay. And are you having any physical pain.

1996
02:44:54.660 --> 02:44:56.250
XT1710-02: No. Okay.

1997
02:44:56.790 --> 02:45:03.540
Mary Kastner: So, um, you know, minor tranquilizers are addicting. And they are things like Xanax

1998
02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.360
Mary Kastner: Advantage Valium.

1999
02:45:08.610 --> 02:45:16.620
Mary Kastner: major tranquilizers are not addicting. And they stabilize the mood and

2000
02:45:18.090 --> 02:45:18.960
Mary Kastner: Can help you sleep.

2001
02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:27.750
Mary Kastner: So that's what I'm thinking because you didn't like the antidepressant it, it made you feel numb.

2002
02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:45.210
Mary Kastner: And no sex drive you felt like you were boring. Mm hmm. And I don't want to go there because you didn't tolerate that. No, it's hard for a lot of people tolerate some thinking you might want to try something like lead to de

2003
02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:57.480
Mary Kastner: La Raza don't is the generic name, it's going to kind of show you out without having to overuse your marijuana again.

2004
02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:09.240
Mary Kastner: And side effects rare, um, let me just read to you. Have you had any bloodwork done late lately.

2005
02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:12.960
XT1710-02: Yeah, when I started with you guys in November.

2006
02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:16.260
Mary Kastner: Oh, good. Okay, I'll take a look at that.

2007
02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:18.150
Mary Kastner: Um,

2008

XT1710-02: Okay.

03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:45.930
Mary Kastner: And you've been employed in that field.

03:01:47.730 --> 03:01:48.030
XT1710-02: Mm hmm.

03:01:49.170 --> 03:01:52.290
Mary Kastner: Have you do regularly exercise.

2192
03:01:53.220 --> 03:02:05.700
XT1710-02: I used to up until, like, July, August when all the crap with my house started and I didn't even know where I would live so I canceled my membership.

2193
03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:08.160
Mary Kastner: What happened with your house.

2194
03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:17.550
XT1710-02: I was supposed to rent it out then renter fucked me over and I was doing it all alone.

2195
03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:34.440
XT1710-02: But I made the house so beautiful and I already moved out because I wanted it to be sellable you know so renters would take it and this guy, my, my neighbor to so he was supposed to rent it. And then he backed out the weekend that he was supposed to move in.

2196
03:02:35.550 --> 03:02:53.130
XT1710-02: But I couldn't. It was the way my house is if you want to rent it. You need to rent it by the end of August, if nobody will rent it at that moment, it does. It's a long story. So I knew that the marketability and like that. The even debt debt, though.

2197
03:02:54.720 --> 03:03:14.100
XT1710-02: The pool of people who would be interested in a house like that. They're already done looking they found everything so I had to basically move back into the house to save money and then I put it on the market and I lived in the corner of my dining room on a mattress for two months.

2198
03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:26.220
XT1710-02: And I had to sell my house. I see. This is what is like pissing me off. Everybody keeps taking everything from me everything that as well. It just

2199
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:29.580
Mary Kastner: So where are you living now.

2200
03:03:30.660 --> 03:03:46.770
XT1710-02: So now I'm renting a room in this lovely ladies house and she lets me pay per month, month to month and she just wanted to help me until I find out what happens to my son tomorrow. In that case, if, if

2201
03:03:48.300 --> 03:04:00.120
XT1710-02: You're still praying. If he does get back right away if if he's returned to me right away, then he's going to live in the room next door for a minute and to live rent an apartment.

2202
03:04:01.350 --> 03:04:01.920
XT1710-02: By since

2203
03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:12.000
XT1710-02: We're all going to be in this neighborhood. So it's not going to be a problem with school or anything, but if I don't get him back right now. Then I'll remain living in in the cheap room until

2204
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:15.570
XT1710-02: I find out what's next. With my crazy life.

2205
03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:17.400
Mary Kastner: Oh my goodness.

Mary Kastner: healthy meals plenty protein is important for the

2209
03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:35.400
Mary Kastner: Because protein Brooks breaks

2210
03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:42.270
Mary Kastner: Down amino acids which break down to the neural chemicals that we use to stabilize our mood in the brain.

2211
03:04:43.290 --> 03:04:48.000
Mary Kastner: So this exercise. So it actually makes you feel better, actually.

2212
03:04:48.330 --> 03:04:49.050
XT1710-02: Supposed

03:04:53.730 --> 03:05:07.680
XT1710-02: Yeah, I'll get into a routine. The thing is my spa was on the second floor of a note elevator building. I don't know how we didn't get soon, but whatever. So I would run up and down stairs all day long. And then I would

2217
03:05:07.740 --> 03:05:15.720
XT1710-02: run back and forth in the spa. So I never like had any issues with cardio like my cardio was taken care of.

2218
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:17.310
Mary Kastner: Okay.

2219
03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:18.360
XT1710-02: So I just need to

2220
03:05:18.390 --> 03:05:21.210
Mary Kastner: Are you are you able to drive a car.

2221
03:05:21.450 --> 03:05:21.720
Yeah.

2222
03:05:22.920 --> 03:05:25.050
Mary Kastner: Okay, and you seat belts. When you're in the car.

2223
03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:27.720
XT1710-02: Always. I'm a safe driver. Don't worry.

2224
03:05:28.770 --> 03:05:29.580

03:05:34.770 --> 03:05:35.940
XT1710-02: good days and bad days.

2227
03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:40.290
Mary Kastner: Baking or cigarettes.

2228
03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:47.190
XT1710-02: Cigarettes. See, I could never get it get addicted to cigarettes. So it's more like

2229
03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:50.910
XT1710-02: I need, I need something in my mouth. If I'm stressed out, but

2230
03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.040
XT1710-02: If I'm not. I don't think about it.

2231
03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:54.810
Mary Kastner: Okay.

2232
03:05:55.020 --> 03:05:55.770
So I

2233
03:05:58.830 --> 03:06:01.050
XT1710-02: Will like yesterday. I didn't smoke.

2234
03:06:01.980 --> 03:06:07.470
XT1710-02: The DJ, or I didn't smoke on Friday I smoked a ton.

2235
03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:10.920
Mary Kastner: What's that, how much is a ton.

2236
03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:14.190
XT1710-02: Probably like six or seven or maybe even 10

2237
03:06:15.330 --> 03:06:15.840
Mary Kastner: Okay.

2238
03:06:16.890 --> 03:06:20.280
XT1710-02: While this do so firing me. We took three smoke breaks

2239
03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:22.350
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

2240
03:06:27.090 --> 03:06:29.580
Mary Kastner: That's so sad. I'm so sorry.

2241
03:06:31.320 --> 03:06:35.520
Mary Kastner: So what's your relationship status right now you in a relationship.

2242
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:37.170
XT1710-02: No.

2243
03:06:38.730 --> 03:06:41.370
Mary Kastner: Do you feel like you have a support system at all.

2244
03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:42.750
Yeah.

2245
03:06:44.730 --> 03:06:46.170
Okay, good.

2246
03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:58.020
Mary Kastner: Okay so physically. How you feeling today, any cold symptoms flu symptoms all your systems feeling like they're working

2247
03:06:58.590 --> 03:07:02.250
XT1710-02: Yeah, I'm a little sleepy because I didn't sleep well.

2248
03:07:03.630 --> 03:07:04.020
Mary Kastner: Uh huh.

2249
03:07:04.110 --> 03:07:04.710
XT1710-02: That's about it.

2250
03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:06.390
Mary Kastner: Okay.

2251
03:07:07.410 --> 03:07:08.940
Mary Kastner: Okay, so again,

2252
03:07:09.990 --> 03:07:12.810
Mary Kastner: What my conclusion is here is

2253
03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:23.910
Mary Kastner: A little bit of impulse control disorder wins when triggered seems like only when triggered.

2254
03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:29.520
Mary Kastner: Which could well we could rule out

2255
03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:43.590
Mary Kastner: Just say Intermittent Explosive or question of bipolar to because of your family history or panic disorder. Those are all possibilities.

2256
03:07:45.120 --> 03:08:04.680
Mary Kastner: As as could be just a how you've come over time because of your upbringing in your stress in your life more of a personality issue, not a, a state disorder. And if that's the case, and mixed personality presentation. You said you had some phobias.

2257
03:08:06.390 --> 03:08:09.600
Mary Kastner: mailbox small places being confronted

2258
03:08:10.770 --> 03:08:15.930
Mary Kastner: Which can lead to increased anxiety or avoidance.

2259
03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:38.250
Mary Kastner: Also right now some grief complicated grief reaction would be another possible diagnosis. So I'm again. My thought is more of a mood stabilizer major tranquilizer type medication non addicting.

2260
03:08:39.330 --> 03:08:41.670
Mary Kastner: hopefully help you sleep, lower your

2261
03:08:44.430 --> 03:08:46.380
Mary Kastner: Anxiety sleep is paramount.

2262
03:08:47.610 --> 03:08:51.900
Mary Kastner: To making you feel better. Let me take a look at your labs, real quick.

2263
03:08:54.660 --> 03:08:57.840
Mary Kastner: I'm so glad that next person didn't come so that you and I had

2264
03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:01.020
XT1710-02: Are you sure that person is not stuck in the waiting room.

2265
03:09:02.190 --> 03:09:04.560
Mary Kastner: I keep looking. And there's nobody there.

2266
03:09:06.330 --> 03:09:15.570
Mary Kastner: So, believe me. I've been looking and I think it was somebody that I had hoped would show and I wasn't able to confirm the appointment.

2267
03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:17.520
Mary Kastner: I'm

2268
03:09:19.410 --> 03:09:20.550
Mary Kastner: So,

2269
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:27.750
Mary Kastner: I don't care.

2270
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:32.040
Mary Kastner: Let me see. Maybe I do have it says pending.

2271
03:09:34.830 --> 03:09:35.340
Mary Kastner: Pending

2272
03:09:35.430 --> 03:09:41.490
XT1710-02: Oh my god. Do you know what do you know what's happening. Can I please share with you. Oh my god, I've now I need to smoke.

2273
03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:44.010
What happened.

2274
03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:51.930
XT1710-02: So my boss forgot very important thing that I have passwords to absolutely everything

2275
03:09:52.620 --> 03:10:10.410
XT1710-02: But I'm not opening anything but I get the notifications, right, whenever something goes on my phone, which my whole life was basically centered around the spot. My phone gives me all the updates and I'm watching my clients request cancellations right now.

2276
03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:11.880
When

2277
03:10:12.900 --> 03:10:13.110
Mary Kastner: I

2278
03:10:13.170 --> 03:10:35.280
XT1710-02: Watched Nikki come to her appointment today and then didn't want to be there apparently right after and as she after she paid maybe like 20 minutes later, while like so I last I checked, was when you and I started and it says that about 30 minutes ago. She wrote please cancel my membership.

2279
03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:43.560
Mary Kastner: So this is not reflecting well on his decision to get rid of you.

2280
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:58.080
XT1710-02: See I'm torn. That's what I can see everything, but I'm not opening anything with their personal information like I have no desire to steal clients from

2281
03:10:58.950 --> 03:11:15.480
XT1710-02: I just can see the feed of what's going on, but I can't, like, I mean I can through this go into like click on their name and go into their personal information, but I'm not doing that. I'm not even opening their emails and just reading the feed notifications.

2282
03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:17.160
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

2283
03:11:18.510 --> 03:11:24.150
XT1710-02: Oh my god. I'd like got chills. Do you see how impressionable. I am all of a sudden, I'm happy.

2284
03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:26.130
That

2285
03:11:28.410 --> 03:11:31.620
Mary Kastner: Yeah. So again, I think the

2286
03:11:37.740 --> 03:11:39.390
Mary Kastner: Mood stability is the issue.

2287
03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:47.010
Mary Kastner: And also, that's, that's kind of a normal reaction. Don't you think

2288
03:11:48.180 --> 03:11:49.350
XT1710-02: What that I'm happy now.

2289
03:11:50.190 --> 03:11:53.130
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that that he's getting some consequences.

2290
03:11:54.360 --> 03:12:03.330
XT1710-02: But he didn't. He, he was. He's not a he's not a bad guy. He just went about it wrong, and then pride got in the way.

2291
03:12:04.650 --> 03:12:09.390
Mary Kastner: Yeah, it's so you feel a little bit torn little bit ambivalent about

2292
03:12:09.450 --> 03:12:22.710
XT1710-02: I would do anything to help him. Uh, when he was when he was firing me. I was like, going around telling him where everything else is where everything is. And like his weekly shopping list and all this other shit.

2293
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:25.710
Mary Kastner: Yeah, cuz he's a friend of yours.

2294
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:27.270
XT1710-02: Yeah.

2295
03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:32.820
XT1710-02: The thing is, I think I was slightly in love with him.

2296
03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:36.510
XT1710-02: Like just tiny, teeny tiny

2297
03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:38.520
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

2298
03:12:38.940 --> 03:12:50.970
XT1710-02: And not in a romantic sense, it's so bizarre like I'm not physically attracted to him. But when when he's happy. My life is complete. I don't know what the hell that means.

2299
03:12:51.780 --> 03:13:01.530
XT1710-02: I've never liked a guy that much, but I've never also not been attracted to go to a guy this much. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

2300
03:13:02.820 --> 03:13:06.750
XT1710-02: So I just I he was so important to me.

2301
03:13:09.090 --> 03:13:09.480
XT1710-02: Whatever.

2302
03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:15.150
Mary Kastner: So I'm I'm adding in case you decide

2303
03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:30.780
Mary Kastner: To take this, the two dem adding a lipid panel and chemistry. I don't see that in your lab work.

2304
03:13:32.850 --> 03:13:36.210
Mary Kastner: So what I'll do is wait to hear from you.

2305
