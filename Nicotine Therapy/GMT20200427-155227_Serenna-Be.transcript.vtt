Yeah.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.110
Michael J: That's right.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.020
Serenna Beers: Okay, I, I knew I recognized your face and your and your

10

11
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.450
Michael J: Yeah.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:56.040
Michael J: Well, I, I'm I run a nonprofit and in our town, and we do life recovery classes and it's also a rescue mission and

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:15.480
Michael J: I founded that 15 years ago. And so, pretty much. I know everybody in town and matter of fact, the last meeting we had on Thursday. There was a guy from Crescent City in the meeting, and I'm on Suboxone for pain management.

14
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.520
Michael J: Not for addiction issues.

15
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.930
Serenna Beers: Huh, yeah.

16
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.050
Michael J: So that's one of the one of the battles we were having i i do have private meetings. Now,

17
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.010
Serenna Beers: Okay, so are you no longer going to be inside of our groups.

18
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.990
Michael J: I won't. I mean, I

19
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.090
Michael J: Cried there was actually somebody that I knew personally on

20
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.140
Michael J: One of the meeting.

21
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:51.570
Michael J: And and I shut out and I emailed Dr. Our dad told her what happened and that I actually new person. And it's a small nonprofit.

22
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
Michael J: We are just recently this year.

23
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.520
Michael J: grant funded but but there's two nonprofits that share the same space.

24
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.660
Michael J: And when a

25
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.430
Michael J: When a secular

26
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.640
Michael J: Mission Possible. It's called and that is to get us our building. We were supposed to shut down April 15

27
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:29.190
Michael J: Or for two and a half months while they did $200,000 worth of work to our building for facility which was going to put us in the 52 bed rescue mission facility and

28
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.880
Michael J: We still got our money and stuff like that. We got approval letter for the grant.

29
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.180
Michael J: But in a crisis mode.

30
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.910
Michael J: DHS has the ability to pull some of that money if they need it so

31
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:58.290
Michael J: We have built relationships and stuff. And we're not really too worried about it. We're still going to get it. But everything is absolutely you know pushed out probably another six months or so.

32
00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.160
So,

33
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.860
Michael J: But it will happen.

34
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.650
Michael J: So that kind of what it is. And then, so the two nonprofits.

35
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.280
Michael J: My Nonprofit that I've had for 15 years is privately funded and listen possible is grant funded

36
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.170
Michael J: So it's not like

37
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.990
Michael J: I'm going to benefit a lot. I mean, will benefit.

38
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:36.120
Michael J: Obviously our buildings going to get $200,000 upgrade and things like that. It's going to start happening and benefit in that way. And they'll pay perhaps utilities and get their own urine.

39
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:49.740
Michael J: There'll be benefits for us in that but scandal, like, you know, everybody thinks immediately appear on Suboxone you're an opiate addict.

40
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.460
And

41
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.520
Michael J: I was an addict for

42
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:10.920
Michael J: 17 years I was a meth addict. Yeah. And I got a deliverance, which I don't know if you're familiar with what a deliverance says, but I'm no longer I celebrated my 21st year last November of sobriety off of math.

43
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.840
Serenna Beers: Good for you.

44
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:37.620
Michael J: So, you know, we don't want any scandal happening. My wife is getting her associate's degree next year, she's on Suboxone as well. And she is for addiction. Basically, but we're gonna or five year plan is to build a new facility and turn our old facility into a 30 bed rehab.

45
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.560
Michael J: And she's going to be the director of that.

46
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:54.570
Michael J: Program. And so, you know, and we live in Mayberry basically our town is very small. And it's probably the third or fourth poorest city in the state. So pretty much

47
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:04.290
Michael J: You probably have a lot of people from custom city on the Suboxone program. And so we're just trying to keep a deal on it, you know.

48
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.670
Serenna Beers: Yeah, and and I totally understand as far as

49
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:20.310
Serenna Beers: It's almost like the stigma that goes with it. You know, I totally as a therapist. I totally understand and some of the folks that

50
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:30.390
Serenna Beers: That you work with are some of the hardest critics, you know, and so I told I totally get that. But I do believe in therapy and I do believe like just like my

51
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:43.680
Serenna Beers: Mindset of a good therapist has a therapist like therapy. It's really sad. It really gets a bad rap. And I don't care who you are. How far up the food chain that you are everybody can benefit from some sort of

52
00:05:45.390 --> 00:06:02.160
Serenna Beers: Therapy. It just, it's just good. It's good to be able to talk to somebody who can be objective. It's good to be able to talk to somebody who who doesn't know all your history so that they don't have a subjective point of view and an emotional attachment and so

53
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:19.080
Serenna Beers: The fact that you're not going to do groups openly. I totally understand. But I do hope that you're going to continue on with therapy at I think it's twice a month at least or something or once a month, that depends on what you discuss with Dr. Alan DAG.

54
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.130
Serenna Beers: Right.

55
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:30.150
Michael J: Yeah, and I have a meeting with her tomorrow. And you're absolutely right. The best recovery counselors or or former addicts, I believe.

56
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:39.390
Michael J: And you know the 15 years of marriage successful marriage has included about 10 years of marriage counseling.

57
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.920
Michael J: And we still

58
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.860
Michael J: We still get counseling occasionally because

59
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.910
Serenna Beers: It really

60
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.520
Michael J: It really helped Mary July, you know, me and my wife. So we've been through.

61
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.530
Michael J: Some rough roads, of course, everybody does up and coming

62
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.380
Michael J: You know, we all go through it.

63
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.400
Serenna Beers: I'm not trying to

64
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:11.790
Michael J: Say that we're special. I'm just saying that through marriage counseling is what gave me the pointers and kept her marriage, you know, good.

65
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:20.850
Serenna Beers: So are well. So then, with, with this bio psychosocial I know you're probably familiar with it. I just ask you a bunch of questions and

66
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:36.480
Serenna Beers: you've kind of taken well so you will have a little history with substances, even though you're not with us for substance abuse. Obviously we collect a history and then we can discuss, you know, things that maybe you might want to work on.

67
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:49.860
Serenna Beers: Because a again, you know, I've, I swear I'm an I'm trying to improve myself every day. I just bought this new book that's called the power of the mind.

68
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.100
Serenna Beers: I also bought this book called stop your stupid shit that's really the name of the book and you know because

69
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:09.420
Serenna Beers: I, it seems like it's a really cool cool book and I, you know, for, especially in this time with all the stuff that's going on that's happening in the world if anybody's ever battled depression or

70
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.090
Serenna Beers: Anxiety. I mean, those little things can start

71
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:20.880
Serenna Beers: rearing their ugly little head. And so to keep those things at bay. There's things like self help. There's things like meetings. There's things like this. And so

72
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:30.720
Serenna Beers: I, I think it's great, though, that you kept in an open mind and said, while I need to protect myself and what I do for a living.

73
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.450
Serenna Beers: I also know that I need this. So let's try to find a different ways so that's awesome.

74
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:46.680
Serenna Beers: So tell me your story then so so I'm just going to run down the list and this usually takes about 20 minutes and I just

75
00:08:47.370 --> 00:09:01.560
Serenna Beers: I want to start with just tell me your story with substances. I know you said that used to have an issue with math. Tell me when you first used at what point it got really bad and how it had progress to the point where you knew that you needed some help.

76
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:16.440
Michael J: Well, it's funny you say that. So my first thing, and I'm remember the cycle was yesterday. This is the weirdest part is I was well first I was raised in a

77
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:26.190
Michael J: Alcohol was always an acceptable drug in our family, a full blown working successful alcoholic family.

78
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.890
Michael J: All the way back to the 1900s chase it on down.

79
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.910
Michael J: Total dysfunctional family.

80
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.840
Michael J: Verbal abuse, physical abuse. I was molested that I

81
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:55.380
Michael J: was molested at the age of sex by a woman and were sexually active every point on after that. Now, I thank God every day because I'm not

82
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:14.520
Michael J: Gay that it was a woman. And when I told my wife, the story and she she was a rape victim and been through the block herself. She literally was weeping, you know, because me personally, being a man

83
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:29.640
Michael J: That so she was bawling. And the fact that molest as a molested don't matter if it's a girl or a boy and I totally get that I can, I can relate and I have children and and and i do relate to that.

84
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.960
Michael J: It was bad for me.

85
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.640
Michael J: Um,

86
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.350
Michael J: Where wAS I GOING AND SOMETIMES I rabbit trail, forgive me for that.

87
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.190
Serenna Beers: And and and I and I totally get that. So we were just

88
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:51.900
Serenna Beers: Talking about the story of your, of your use when it, when you were first exposed and how it progressed to the point where you knew that you needed to get help.

89
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:59.100
Michael J: So I was molested. And so that kind of and then my house. We were never protected when my dad.

90
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:19.440
Michael J: Would get drunk and violent. My mom went up and run to the bedroom and we were on our own as cats. So I lived in brought up in a, in a, you know, but everybody considered my family as perfect as salt of the earth type people THE NICEST MAN IN THE WORLD AND TELL he came home from work.

91
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.020
Michael J: And he was workaholic, and an alcoholic. So

92
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:30.780
Michael J: We had that to balance, but I was watching a TV show where this guy escaped and i was i think 13 years old.

93
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:40.740
Michael J: And he escaped out of a jail. I can Columbia and he was running in the cops and or the militants and their dogs were hot on this trail.

94
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:50.970
Michael J: And he was just totally were out. He ran like seven miles. Right. And he's done and I feel over and he picks a couple leaves of the tree.

95
00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:11.610
Michael J: And he starts to anonymous sticks it under his tongue, and then he runs like Superman for the next another seven 810 miles. That was my first and clinician. And I'll never forget that of what did he just do whatever he did gave him and he got away and

96
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.890
Michael J: That was my first curiosity to what he did.

97
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:27.900
Michael J: Why that gave him so much energy and power. And how did he do it that made me wonder, and I asked around until somebody said, Oh, that was coca leaves.

98
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:36.570
Michael J: That was the first thing. And I remember thinking to myself, I found out. Oh, that'd be cool.

99
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:46.860
Michael J: You know, that was the very first start. I love me watching a TV show at night watching that guy do that. That made me go huh

100
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:55.800
Michael J: And when I was 15 I was a I was in a wedding. My cousin's wedding.

101
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.330
Michael J: And like I said, alcohol was acceptable in our family.

102
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:16.110
Michael J: So I'm 15 years old drunk up my butt supposed to be in the wedding. And I ain't gonna make it because I'm wasted totally to the point where they're dragging me around. So my cousin puts us line out on a mirror and said, you're going to get this up your nose.

103
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:35.310
Michael J: That was my first experience with math, I get the math align and I was totally normal instantly. And I went, Wow, this is cool and then my course I was my heart rate was going, it was back in the day when it was really good drugs.

104
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:36.510
Oh,

105
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.190
Serenna Beers: No, I

106
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:46.590
Serenna Beers: I apologize. I'm moving around. I just need to fix my my chair because it needs to rock.

107
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.790
Yes.

108
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.020
Serenna Beers: My own chronic pain issues. And so it helps

109
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.510
Serenna Beers: Me, I can't find my little knob.

110
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.760
Serenna Beers: Right me just a second. Hang on.

111
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:03.120
Michael J: Not a problem. Not a problem. And I need a drink water as well. So this works out perfect.

112
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.620
Serenna Beers: Okay, good.

113
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.380
Serenna Beers: There we go.

114
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.130
Serenna Beers: It's not doing it.

115
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:18.300
Serenna Beers: My son. He fixed my chair and he showed me how to do it. And now I don't know how to do it.

116
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.830
Michael J: You're somebody that understands all that I might shoot from the hip type of guy.

117
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.640
Michael J: It was dumb ever tried to plan something that goes horribly wrong.

118
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.450
Michael J: Well, I just map. It works all every time.

119
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:40.380
Serenna Beers: Oh yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty laid back and one of the reasons why I think that

120
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:50.820
Serenna Beers: This works is, is, you know, not because I don't speak to you, just from an educational experience. I also, you know, everybody's path is different.

121
00:14:51.330 --> 00:15:02.160
Serenna Beers: But the common our commonality that binds me to the patients that I serve is my struggles with with them every day is different in the level of intensity

122
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:14.670
Serenna Beers: To the point of how it affects your mental, emotional state. You know what I mean, and not some days are better than others. And so yeah, so I appreciate your flexibility so

123
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.110
Serenna Beers: That's when you know good

124
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.170
Michael J: Good drugs Provo all that

125
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.960
Michael J: Number 15 day process to make it and it was literally

126
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.970
Michael J: You know, not nothing like the stuff that they have on the streets today, which is, I call it instant tweak. So you're

127
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:46.560
Michael J: You do it for one day and you feel like you've been up for 10 days. I used to literally step for 15 days at a time. And people really didn't notice that I was on that because the pH balance was so good it was clean.

128
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:54.750
Michael J: drugs are drugs. It was disgusting. No matter what you looked at it, but it was a higher quality and didn't have to come down.

129
00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:03.930
Michael J: And you could literally hide yourself behind it for quite some time before people would start recognizing that hey, this guy's on speed so

130
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:15.060
Michael J: Anyway, that was then. And so I did my first line or two, but in the back of my mind and my psyche. I wanted to know what cocaine was

131
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:24.150
Michael J: So I met a guy that was a cocaine dealer and I did my first shot of cocaine and

132
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:42.750
Michael J: Loved that literally like under the tongue I remembered flashback to that that never left my mind, to this day, after all these years of sobriety and although I found math in my thrift store before I turned it over to the police.

133
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:54.360
Michael J: I see people on it all the time. It doesn't have any control over me anymore. And when I said deliverance, the deliverance that I got.

134
00:16:55.050 --> 00:17:05.580
Michael J: Was I didn't believe in God or wasn't spiritual my parents said hey you should go to church on Sunday. We want you to check it out if you don't like it, you don't have to know more.

135
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.960
Michael J: I went one

136
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:19.200
Michael J: Said, Okay, that's it for me. I don't want to do that. No more. I was a Lutheran service. And I was like, Okay, so basically I was a non believer in God and all that. And so after

137
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.400
Michael J: Cocaine got too expensive and I couldn't still enough fast enough to

138
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.470
Michael J: Keep me satisfied.

139
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.230
Michael J: I ran into through my criminal behavior ran and do

140
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.610
Michael J: The math guy and got locked into that.

141
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.420
Michael J: And it was cheaper. I could afford it more

142
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:56.580
Michael J: And then I just. But what it did to me like a lot of people like I'm high strung as you can tell. Now I'm a strong person, people used to tell me, I'd hate to see you on math. Right. Well, when I would do math. It would call me down.

143
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:12.780
Michael J: It was weird. Yes, I'd get high. And I would talk a mile a minute for a while, but for the most part it was settled me down. So turns out that I was ADHD extreme at a very young age and diagnosed. So

144
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:21.870
Michael J: Went through all the stuff. Basically, not even knowing that I had so much other stuff in my life. That was crazy.

145
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:43.830
Michael J: That I didn't even think I ever had anything I really believed, up until my motorcycle wreck that I was, and then some will never going to die. I've never had hep C i use needles with three people that asked him FC. I never caught know STDs. I've never used the condom.

146
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:53.310
Michael J: My girls of choice were prostitutes for many, many years, and the more sleazier they were the more I was attracted to them.

147
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.060
Michael J: How I did not get noticed TVs did not

148
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.950
Michael J: Contract

149
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.360
Michael J: Have. See, I'm just absolutely like I didn't know. So I didn't know

150
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.520
Michael J: I just thought I was bulletproof. I thought that I could live forever and nothing was ever going to really affect me.

151
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.270
Michael J: When I got in a motorcycle wreck.

152
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.700
Michael J: I guess it was probably like closer to 10 years ago now.

153
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:43.620
Michael J: No, actually my son's 14 he was on his seventh birthday, so seven years ago, and I was in a real serious motorcycle accident. A didn't have a helmet on. I flipped the bike one by 100 PV

154
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.860
Michael J: ended up in the hospital unconscious and pick up

155
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.080
Serenna Beers: Where your chronic pain.

156
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.940
Serenna Beers: Call comes into play.

157
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.730
Michael J: Okay, net net but middle back and lower lower back is just like totally gone

158
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.610
Michael J: But I learned a lot of stuff through the process because I went on.

159
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.400
Michael J: What do they call it.

160
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:20.430
Michael J: five milligram Narcos and I was on that for a year and a half, and you know it quit working at Suboxone to me is

161
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:37.590
Michael J: Absolutely, and I wasn't taking it right in the beginning, either. I would take three strips in the morning and I would suffer paying through the night, and I was totally not sleeping totally waking up, didn't know why.

162
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:50.610
Michael J: I just done, but it was pain in would wake me up on that roll over in bed until I learned how to take it. You know, I take two steps in the morning and one about four or five o'clock at night.

163
00:20:51.180 --> 00:21:06.270
Michael J: And I sleep. I have my sleep back for last two or three months. I literally sleep like more than I ever have in my whole entire life. And I can't even begin to tell you what that's done for my mind.

164
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.170
Michael J: And I'm 100% pain free.

165
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.450
Michael J: Usually right around four or five o'clock I start having pains.

166
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:24.660
Michael J: Mm hmm. And then I take that another step and then I am good and I wake up in the morning. I'm in pain getting out of bed. But I sleep. The whole night.

167
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:41.910
Michael J: I think nine o'clock. It was the latest i'd slept, and I'm usually up at, you know, four or five in the morning and usually the pain would wake me up and I'm the type of person once I wake up fully sometimes that'll happen just from going to the bathroom and coming back.

168
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.660
Michael J: I don't usually go back to sleep. But I've been able to

169
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:59.340
Michael J: Go to the bathroom, come back. Go to sleep. It is. It is like a miracle for me. And really, I'm so grateful for it because I'm living a pain free life now. So anyway, back to the other.

170
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:08.520
Michael J: I would take math and turn into the most brazen successful thief, you could ever imagine.

171
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.850
Michael J: I used to steal one car every day.

172
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:21.480
Michael J: Used to they used to call me marble, Mike. I used to sell 50 cartons of cigarettes a day.

173
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:29.070
Michael J: 10 bucks a carton back then 500 bucks right there. That's how I supplied my habit.

174
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.110
Michael J: I was into everything criminal, you could think about was a major shoplifter

175
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:55.740
Michael J: Booster. And it was all driven does literally I would see money and I didn't see money I seen drugs. Mm hmm. I would have. I was making $80,000 cash every six months, I wasn't saved in any of it. I just, the more I made the more better. I love that. Guess who would if he can even say better

176
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:15.180
Michael J: More drugs. I mean I had so much drugs because everybody wanted me to work for them because I was so successful. And I probably got caught for about a third of what I actually did my whole criminal career. So I was lucky. We'll call it lucky.

177
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.950
Michael J: I think ultimately not catching the STDs.

178
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:29.100
Michael J: I was in a car wreck and 20 miles an hour, one time and better scratch on my arm about three inches long. That was at

179
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:40.980
Michael J: Running from the cops. I got away and you know look at it like you know a lot of people when I was, I was always a thrill seeker. So when I was 13

180
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:51.990
Michael J: We built a homemade raft and we're surfing the waves and a big storm came in at sucked me in three of my buddies out to the ocean or the restarts and helicopters.

181
00:23:52.500 --> 00:24:06.180
Michael J: From the Coast Guard had to come rescue us so always doing stuff people. My dad's friends would be like betting they didn't think I'd love to be 18 and he so that's kind of how about went and

182
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:14.010
Michael J: I went to prison for I was locked up either in gels or presence for about a long period of time.

183
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.350
Michael J: I have three state numbers.

184
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:31.710
Michael J: On and when I got my deliverance God totally took the taste of it out of my mouth and within a year. I still had four months left on parole. I started our daily bread ministries. When I cried out to God.

185
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:43.680
Michael J: I didn't believe existed. And so I was getting loaded behind a rest stop in folks will California which is by Gerber. Well, I don't know where that is.

186
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:51.270
Serenna Beers: I mean, I'm from Sacramento County, but it's been, I haven't been here for 30 years so

187
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.890
Michael J: I'm sure you've heard of humbled.

188
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:53.820
Serenna Beers: To fail. Yes.

189
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.440
Michael J: Marijuana capital of the world.

190
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.810
Michael J: So mountain, which is

191
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:08.070
Michael J: Little Town in between Garber real and Eureka, and those that's kind of where I ended up but

192
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:15.570
Michael J: So I was going down that road. Here's where I lost it. Remember what was I saying initially

193
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.290
Serenna Beers: We're still on your history.

194
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.260
Michael J: Yeah so prison when two presidents started getting in trouble. They're going to prison.

195
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:33.300
Michael J: They I did that for in and out for three different state numbers I had

196
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:42.840
Michael J: Got out once I got my deliverance. A year later, I got my head on straight and I started focusing my energy and stuff.

197
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.710
Michael J: Well, first off, I told God if you take away this addiction. I'll serve you the rest of my life.

198
00:25:50.280 --> 00:26:07.200
Michael J: Soon as I got that I left that part out. I don't know where you're at, spiritually, doesn't really matter. I'm probably one of the most liberal pastors, you'll ever meet. I don't believe in pulling people in, I believe that they'll be drawn in through your testimony or through your fruit.

199
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.460
Michael J: What they say your fruit.

200
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:17.460
Michael J: What positive going on around you, people will want to come to that. I don't believe in anybody that ever tried to grab me and pull me and because

201
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:38.160
Michael J: Literally, I was restraining order to get to my parents because they got the blame for everything that was our fault that I was this way and I stole from them. I robbed them I stole from their business. I had literally nowhere to turn my mom tough love green

202
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:50.190
Michael J: wouldn't take the lead. I sent a letter return to sender. If I tried to make a phone call. I didn't hang up and that went on for a long period of time and

203
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:59.220
Michael J: Then I, you know, was starving for this thing called Love general love because I burned so many bridges and hurt so many people

204
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:18.660
Michael J: Everybody did not want nothing to do with me, I'm a super toxic and so I would start rooting for love. So churches were a place where grandma would be their Bible studies or we could get soup and you know bakery goods and and when you're not doing drugs, you're hungry.

205
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:32.040
Michael J: So I was trying to starve. I was starving for food, but I was also starving for hugs and love and to try to rebuild the single life that I totally self destructed and

206
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.940
Michael J: Many times, so I had a wife and three kids.

207
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.000
Michael J: That I raised that that

208
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:46.530
Michael J: Were I wasn't in their life. I was a horrible parent. And anyway, I

209
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:56.370
Michael J: That's where I was, I was this just everything bad seeking to rebuild. How do you rebuild that

210
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.720
Michael J: Yeah, and

211
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:06.120
Michael J: You know, my, my family. I got what's called a temporary custody leave my dad had cancer and he had

212
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:16.650
Michael J: 90 days to live. I was in President, my aunt, called the governor. She was up there a little bit with them and got me a what they call a TLC.

213
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:27.720
Michael J: temporary custody. But I got to go visit my dad I got out of prison and eight hours later, I got arrested didn't make it to my dad's funeral. They spent about 10 grand get me.

214
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:37.080
Michael J: Out to see my dad and back in was very expensive. And so the rest of the family said we don't want nothing to do with you anymore either.

215
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:52.230
Michael J: But I think the pain of that because my dad. Finally, when I was 24 years old told me, You know, I'm an alcoholic. He was admitted that I was a horrible father. All I wanted to do is teach you

216
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.970
Michael J: Give you work ethic what she did, and

217
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.600
Michael J: I know how to work hard. I like to work hard.

218
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:09.390
Michael J: I worked 11 and a half hours yesterday and I don't know if you can see my hands, but I got pain all about me. I've been in my sense truck yesterday for him.

219
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.710
Michael J: At work, and we spent a lot of time on it.

220
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.370
Michael J: 14 year old has a car any

221
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:19.140
Serenna Beers: Night.

222
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:34.770
Michael J: Were started working on it and and so that's what I did yesterday. And anyway, so I was starving for live. I turn my back on God. Once I got what I wanted. But he literally took the taste away from me.

223
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:43.950
Michael J: I never used drugs again after that never use math again after that never use cocaine again after that was done completely

224
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.310
Michael J: Like it was controlling my whole life.

225
00:29:48.120 --> 00:30:00.240
Michael J: I remember probably two months before I got that deliverance that I said well I guess this is my destiny or I am sticking my arm again, you know, doing another shot after seven months clean

226
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.210
Michael J: The House got the job got the car.

227
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:15.180
Michael J: life's good got the girlfriend and your am doing a shot again. So I remember confessing out loud. I guess this is my destiny. I guess I'm going to die with a needle in my arm.

228
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:28.830
Michael J: So it wasn't long after that I'm doing shots behind the film will rest area and I felt like my heart was going to explode. And I felt like it wasn't from drugs, although I was doing good drugs.

229
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:42.780
Michael J: It wasn't the drugs. It was I felt like a spiritual thing. It happened and like God was like at the end of Israel open my next shot was gonna be my last shot. I really believe that

230
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:54.600
Michael J: And so I cried out to Him and I screamed and yelled, and the only way I can describe that is a woman getting ready to be attacked by a mountain lion. She lets out of blood curdling scream.

231
00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:05.070
Michael J: That's what it was and I screamed at him and I go, I don't believe you exist, but if you do you take away this addiction and I'll serve you the rest of my life.

232
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:14.490
Michael J: God audibly smoke in my ear. I was only up for two days and I wasn't tweaking, yet he spoke to me in my air audibly and said, dump it out.

233
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:24.270
Michael J: I dumped I stick my needles in the ground. I don't my drugs on the brown stuff come into the ground and I walked back to my house, which is about a mile and a half.

234
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:31.920
Michael J: And I remember, I'm not going to be able to eat for a few quite a few days, and I'm not even gonna be able to sleep for days on it and

235
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:49.800
Michael J: I went home, lay down on my bed went to sleep woke up the next morning I'm at my calendar. I'm eating donuts and drinking some chocolate milk out of the refrigerator thinking, oh my god. Okay, so I had needle marks and abscesses, because when I shoot drugs, it's, it's

236
00:31:51.060 --> 00:32:00.150
Michael J: It's serious so anyway I had bruises abscesses free not from a little bit of messes and

237
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:13.890
Michael J: I had been shooting dope two days. So I had a long sleeve white shirt on rolled up with blood stains on it. That was still there, but I remember going oh my god I'm eating. I'm drinking. But I remember

238
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:28.740
Michael J: You know I slept till I was I was weird. And so I start pulling up my sleeves and all my abscesses. We're gone all my needle marks are still blood on my arms.

239
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.780
Michael J: From whenever I shot.

240
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:38.250
Michael J: There are still blood on my shirt and the only thing I had was one part where I shoot, I had one little red.mm

241
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:48.990
Michael J: Hmm, and I believe that to be you know God took away all that to let me know that what really happened, really happened and I was totally

242
00:32:50.220 --> 00:33:08.460
Michael J: mystified I remember I went over to the bar and Garber Ville and Humboldt County. They hate tweak things they love on ads, but they hate speakers and I was accepted there because I I worked for the two richest guys in the community. For one thing, and secondly,

243
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.480
Michael J: I was a hard worker and everybody liked me and I hung out

244
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:22.140
Michael J: at a bar fight about and ate at Subway a lot. And that was a little mini mart. What's the subway attached and

245
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:37.590
Michael J: And I'd get rear after hours. You know, I had the hookups people like me when I did get tweaked out. I would stay away so I wasn't, you know, wasn't obvious. Everybody knew I was a druggie low and that's that.

246
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:44.010
Michael J: Um, let's see what else. And that pretty much defined all that so

247
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:53.340
Michael J: Finally, I'm on the run from Pearl and they catch me and Garber ville. And I got to go to prison.

248
00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:03.420
Michael J: I'm already been in and out of churches, I'd already started the process to get my life together. I had to go finish doing what I have and

249
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:15.360
Michael J: So what I got out. I came back to Crescent City. My mom, my dad had died years after that her roof started leaking and I had no place to go pro wanted me to go

250
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:25.140
Michael J: Move into the mission and Eureka, and I wasn't willing to do that. I said, send me back. I'll set my time out. I'm not going to mention, I'm not going to do it.

251
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:43.260
Michael J: And so anyway, my mom in a deal with me fix fix the butter damage inside the shoe rock, get the house cleaned up work on it. She gave me two weeks to visit was my three children, two and victim up for me and brought them to the House.

252
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.980
Michael J: Had to drive to your weekend a check in every month at that point in time and

253
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.900
Michael J: I'll help you, you help me get the house on the market or sell the house when the house sells. I'll give you 1000 bucks.

254
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:13.500
Michael J: Help you out by then I'd already built my relationship back up with my mom, and, was mending trying to figure out what to do. So I'm going to Bible study going to church every Sunday. I couldn't drink alcohol at my mom's house so

255
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:23.070
Michael J: Anyway, I met this biker Christian guy. And that's where I ultimately met my wife Rachel at a Bible study and

256
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:40.080
Michael J: I was a commercial fisherman. I had a job on a boat when Sam Cisco I made 40 grand and a crab season. And that was the money where we're going to use to get married, and she ended up getting pregnant and with my son Jacob.

257
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.940
Michael J: I had to get divorced from my first wife, we weren't together for 10 years 11 years something

258
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.420
Michael J: Like that.

259
00:35:49.320 --> 00:36:10.170
Michael J: She was still married to a guy that was abusive to her. She had one son. This was my second chance of being a father good doing it the right way, according to the word of God to be able to you know make amends make up for the crappy stuff that I did put my other family through

260
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.460
Michael J: My wife.

261
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:25.920
Michael J: Was $200,000 in debt when they started daily bread ministries, as soon as I registered my social security number is a bill that passed started coming out me like the fact that you can imagine.

262
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:40.920
Michael J: Went from fishing on a boat making big money to stopping that going on welfare going on going on food stamps going on medical going for notes.

263
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.840
Michael J: Basically

264
00:36:47.280 --> 00:37:02.190
Michael J: That lifestyle a decent money coming in, you know, Christian is feast and famine. So you weren't that two months doing grabs his and you make a big chunk. If you manage it right you do good, but course. I wasn't good.

265
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.120
Michael J: Enough and

266
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:10.770
Michael J: Money and CHILD SUFFER was all over me wanting me to pay for my hundred and 60,000 in child support.

267
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:26.160
Michael J: So anyway, started the ministry five years. Nobody got paid. We stayed on welfare, that whole time and finally figured out that we need to start getting paid. So my salary is 300 a week.

268
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:33.300
Michael J: Daphne that has her bachelor's degree that started with me. The ministry. A few years later.

269
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.850
Michael J: 300 a week.

270
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:45.180
Michael J: We've gotten some really fantastic donation since then we got our building paid off. We rented our building for seven years.

271
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.720
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

272
00:37:46.050 --> 00:38:00.840
Michael J: And then we had an opportunity I find somebody that was 35 grand down and we went into a contract and we bought them daily bread and and 837 we were paying 1050 a month rent.

273
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:20.790
Michael J: 837 a month for the mortgage we paid 2000 every month got it down to 52,005 years and got a phone call last November of a lady that wanted to pay off for building and so paid it off. So we got the whole thing done in five years, once we started

274
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.490
Michael J: We were getting regular paydays that is still my salary. To this day, of course, I have a few benefits.

275
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.450
Michael J: Sharon. But other than that, it's pretty much

276
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:40.530
Michael J: That's it's a labor of love. It really is what we do. And that's all going to be changing. You know, down the road.

277
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:50.850
Michael J: My wife, like I say she's got another year left at college, and then enjoy her associate's degree and addiction studies and that's her dream. She wants to be

278
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.190
Michael J: She wants to run around.

279
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.680
Michael J: rehab center, so that's that's the five year plan that we're working towards

280
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.480
Serenna Beers: That's very, very cool.

281
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:12.030
Michael J: Yeah. And so in the meantime, four or five years ago I got all my bills paid off and I bought my first house at the age of 52 I'm 32 now.

282
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.660
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

283
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.520
Michael J: Well actually 51 and non so I've been paying on it for a year.

284
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.560
Michael J: Very cool. Yeah, my mom ended up getting Alzheimer's particular refer year and

285
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:31.530
Michael J: She ended up passing away in our home. We were renting it and she had left us $100,000

286
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:38.460
Michael J: Mm hmm. And I put that money down on the house and I have a nine years left on my mortgage. Actually, it's

287
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.620
Michael J: Eight years and 10 months left on my mortgage

288
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:48.240
Michael J: Now, so we didn't. So are we blast. Absolutely.

289
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.770
Serenna Beers: That's so awesome.

290
00:39:49.860 --> 00:40:02.100
Michael J: Why do people have, you know, 10 your deals on their cars. So we're going to end up that we have good plans for the golden years might actually turn out to be golden

291
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.720
Serenna Beers: Hopeless sound wonderful

292
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:13.260
Michael J: Mission Possible ultimately on the new facility will on that my wife wants to turn the daily bread into a 30 bed rehab.

293
00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:18.480
Michael J: And I would probably rent that to her for about 7500 a month.

294
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:34.140
Michael J: And then I would have to be the cut because that's kind of what I do now at at the ministry. Now for the homeless in the community. Anybody hungry as and we do restaurant style gourmet food we don't

295
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.330
Serenna Beers: That so so so cool.

296
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:52.890
Michael J: It's not a soup kitchen by any standard. Matter of fact I fire volunteers that do not put their item, you can tell somebody you love them all day long. Pretty soon. It's just a word, but we show people that we care through the quality of our food that we put on the table.

297
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.450
Michael J: Or in the to go box as a last few months, so

298
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:03.870
Michael J: Mashed potatoes and gravy homemade cakes. We don't mess around. We really literally done it's

299
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.230
Michael J: All of our food is super, super good.

300
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:14.880
Michael J: Restaurant quality eggs was Sunday breakfast I did scrub. I did 40,000 eggs.

301
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:15.960
Very

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.950
Michael J: A power line eight bound machines for scrambled eggs, cheese and

303
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.790
Michael J: Oh, and then we throw in biscuits and gravy on top of that and I make my own gravy. So

304
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.410
Serenna Beers: That's so good.

305
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:36.780
Serenna Beers: Hey, I'm gonna have to interject, though, because I've got about 20 minutes left. And I've still got

306
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:39.240
Serenna Beers: Some questions that I need to get through with with

307
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:40.710
Serenna Beers: Asia and so

308
00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:49.980
Michael J: I can talk. I mean, I think that's okay. I totally get I could talk to outside of work, you know, I mean, I'm not so I understand you, hence why I was

309
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.300
Serenna Beers: Letting you talk to me.

310
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.160
Serenna Beers: As long as you wanted to talk

311
00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:00.360
Serenna Beers: But now we're coming down to the wire. And if I don't answer these questions, or get them. I'm going to have my boss and

312
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.560
Serenna Beers: Why did

313
00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:03.540
Serenna Beers: You. Yeah, so

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.830
Serenna Beers: So tell me,

315
00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.590
Serenna Beers: Tell me in a snapshot

316
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:14.010
Serenna Beers: Just what growing up was like for you. Were you raised by both mom and dad.

317
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.290
Serenna Beers: Do you have brothers and sisters or your

318
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:30.150
Serenna Beers: Parents together. I know that your mom passed. Did you struggle struggle with mental health or addiction. Growing up, or did anybody else. So as as as on track as you possibly can. If you could answer those questions.

319
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:36.960
Michael J: Yeah mom and dad, my mom going to tolerate my dad wine and

320
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.300
Michael J: There was like I said some physical abuse mainly verbal

321
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.530
Michael J: And I know there was more to your question.

322
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.340
Michael J: I'm trying to figure out, okay,

323
00:42:51.450 --> 00:43:00.750
Serenna Beers: Yeah so so growing up and maybe I'll just, I'll ask you them and then one by one. We'll just get through them because I probably through four or five out of it. Yeah, so just

324
00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:16.410
Serenna Beers: Growing up was was family life. Like what did. Did it seem pretty normal. You know, outside of the normal things that families have, you know, everybody has difficulties grown grown up, but was there anything significant that stood out

325
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:20.550
Michael J: Yeah, my dad was a complete full blown alcoholic.

326
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:21.960
Michael J: Can use upsell

327
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:37.530
Michael J: Outside during the morning you go to school. Everything's fine. So my dad was a complete asshole in the morning. It was like he never apologized. He just started out he was a good guy in the morning when he was sober. Actually, most of the time he was still drunk.

328
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:49.350
Michael J: But no, it was nothing really normal the outside world thought we were the richest people in town, and we were had the perfect life.

329
00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.290
Michael J: Inside the doors when the door shut, was

330
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.430
Michael J: A whole different ballgame.

331
00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:58.770
Michael J: Okay. Plus, they didn't take care of their children. So therefore I was wants to

332
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.880
You know,

333
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.190
Michael J: So it was this one channel house to the fullest extent of the word.

334
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.100
Serenna Beers: Okay. Um, what about. Did you notice any other type of

335
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:27.780
Serenna Beers: dicta addictive behaviors, besides yourself that you've experienced with your family life. Did anybody else. I know dad was an. It was an alcoholic. But did anybody else. Yeah, deal with food or sex addiction or anything like that.

336
00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:31.410
Michael J: So I have a sister raylene

337
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.560
Michael J: He tends to work. She's really dysfunctional.

338
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:38.970
Michael J: She

339
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:45.060
Michael J: Looked at her Facebook page looks like Mother Teresa her life does not represent that she tends to

340
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:57.270
Michael J: Fall in love. She's had many of our kids molested, but she tends to get with like a pile of people. So she's just function in a different kind of way. She don't drink Houston smoke, she quit smoking.

341
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.340
Michael J: He

342
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:16.710
Michael J: Are all our kids are they run away. She had a cleaning business, she was using them for slave labor and they get a team. They go to the military and all them are doing successful me personally. Yeah.

343
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:25.920
Michael J: They just got away from mom because my mom was like gonna put their hooks in them and and anyway other than hurts. She's like, really greedy.

344
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.790
And

345
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.750
Michael J: Doesn't make good healthy choices for kids.

346
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:41.280
Michael J: Relationships and sex addicts know I probably was one I used to still Buddhist from my dad. I was getting drunk do around 13

347
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.200
Michael J: Almost every single night.

348
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.130
Michael J: So, yeah.

349
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.150
Michael J: And I think that answered that part of it.

350
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:53.820
Serenna Beers: Yeah. And then what was school like did you graduate. Yeah.

351
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.060
Michael J: No. No, I did not.

352
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.800
Michael J: Okay, used to tell the lie, got my GED. But that was a lie and

353
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:07.830
Michael J: I, I made it. I made it to the night or not to the 11th grade.

354
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:16.980
Michael J: Mm hmm. Turned 18 and I left and went over the car and signed up with a GED. And when work and I never did complete high school

355
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:18.690
Michael J: Okay, and

356
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:20.760
Michael J: Okay, go ahead. Oh.

357
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.670
Serenna Beers: Had you struggled with any learning disabilities or was it just that you just didn't like school

358
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:36.690
Michael J: So I was supposed to wear glasses. I seen everything upside down, they discovered that I went to special ed class for a while and

359
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:44.400
Michael J: Was supposed to wear these glasses when I turned 16 I could get off the doctor said, No, you're gonna be wearing your whole life.

360
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:54.750
Michael J: I broke them through them away and said I never wearing them again. You lied to me basically look like a professor going through school got teased a lot to that.

361
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.690
Michael J: Basically

362
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:05.940
Michael J: Yeah, I had some issues there were totally and diagnose, but had a lot of issues.

363
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.490
Michael J: Mm hmm. And one thing that I've noticed that never happened and

364
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:22.410
Michael J: Just this last year, I've been noticing that like sometimes I'll cover up. Oh, I'm kind of having like some panic attacks and

365
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:28.800
Michael J: What else is it there's anxiety I have anxiety, now that I never used to have.

366
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.450
Michael J: Or I probably did I would drink it away whatever

367
00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.230
Serenna Beers: You know, never really noticed it. Now you're more aware of that because you feel it.

368
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:48.840
Michael J: Right and and and my wife has all these conditions and Houston. I'm like, I used to take, you know, you're, you're crazy, you know, and I don't have any of this, but

369
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:57.120
Michael J: As time goes on like covers on I'll be freezing cold and I'll cover up and then I'll wake up in the middle of the night thinking I can't read.

370
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:11.430
Michael J: Like admin window open right now. We keep it pretty cold in our house and we don't not our house. But in our bedroom, for sure. And so it's called getting the blankets feels like too much waiting

371
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:19.290
Michael J: Lately, and more so than ever before.

372
00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:28.290
Michael J: But, you know, and then I tried to get so security you know, because I wanted the free money, I

373
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:39.810
Michael J: Said I was hearing or seeing voices and trying to get the SSI thing going out of presenting and, you know, then one day I was like, I'm never going to just be able to live on $900 a month. What am I

374
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.380
Thinking

375
00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:44.310
Michael J: So I just and I just had too much energy

376
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:54.570
Michael J: And that was another thing with the accident. I thought I'm going to snap out of this literally two days after getting out of the hospital with a bandaid wrapped around my head.

377
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.680
Michael J: I'm working

378
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:56.550
Michael J: The next day,

379
00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.560
Michael J: And I was in a lot of pain.

380
00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:04.800
Michael J: And I didn't get pills for a long time because of my history. I was red flag to the hospital.

381
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.010
Michael J: Sure. And it was after a lot of years that

382
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:24.480
Michael J: You know they they gave it to me again. And then I realized opiates. They help for pet, but they stopped working quickly. Either you got to double up on him either. You gotta get the stronger doses.

383
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:33.540
Michael J: They literally stopped working and I was on him for a year and a half. And when they just called my doctor and said, Take me off, and I'm done.

384
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:43.770
Michael J: I'm going to live in pain for a while. I just, I got sick of it. I just not like it didn't like how it made me feel and it was not working. That's the bottom line.

385
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.000
Serenna Beers: And wasn't working for me.

386
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:56.700
Serenna Beers: What about Dragon know haha. Um, well, I mean you could office track it as as as anybody does because here I am, I'm through a throwing all these

387
00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:12.210
Serenna Beers: Questions and I'm asking you to talk about it, it makes sense to me that I what I like to call I squirrel out I squirrel out, so, so, so, so much so much to the point where my own kids will say, Mom. Okay, remember the question that I asked you. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

388
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:13.650
Serenna Beers: And I always call it

389
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.690
Serenna Beers: Meth brain like those are my permit tweet I that I have

390
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:33.000
Serenna Beers: A and and i I've, I've come to accept it. Over the years, but like there's some things that I still do some residuals from when I use because I use for almost 17 years straight and hardcore, just like you.

391
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:44.250
Serenna Beers: And it mess my brain up and and to think that I'm going to function like a person without that kind of history. I put holes in my brain. So yeah, you get off track.

392
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:57.510
Serenna Beers: It makes sense to me. So I, I want to say that and I hopefully I'm not coming off as like we need to stay on track. You know, it's just because I have a certain amount of time that that I can meet with you. And so I want to make sure we get everything

393
00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:06.840
Serenna Beers: Answered after this. Any session I have with with you. You can go off on any rabbit trail that you want, because that's for you. It's what you need to

394
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:15.690
Serenna Beers: Talk about it's what you want to discuss. I mean, it's really you drive the boat I i'm i always refer to myself as

395
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:28.050
Serenna Beers: A farmer, I might be a therapist with education and experience. But at the end of the day, I'm planting seeds because the I'm I can't help you change anything, whether it's, you just want help with dealing with your

396
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:42.240
Serenna Beers: Diet. Or maybe you want help, and how to center your thoughts. I can give you all the tips, but nobody does anything for us. We have to do it for ourselves. So true. I'm right there with you is what I want to say, Michael.

397
00:51:44.130 --> 00:52:01.920

Michael J: It's not

456
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.190
Michael J: As oh yeah one one just word for the, the thought.

457
00:57:44.790 --> 00:58:05.250
Michael J: Is Jesus never, you know, he gives you. He doesn't force it. He doesn't pull un he you're either drawn in or you're drawn away from him. He doesn't want to force anything, and he wants to give everybody that wants that self conscious choice. And that's how I believe about it.

458
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.160
Michael J: So when I say I'm the liberal is faster around

459
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.910
Michael J: Yeah, I bet. That's my only advice that I have

460
00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.860
Michael J: And I get good

461
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:20.070
Michael J: Every time I put I can have a new classical by my wife for new car today. I can buy me a new truck.

462
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:35.070
Michael J: And it would destroy the ministry days ago. He's already made it. You don't need us no more. But my point being, then that if I get new tires on my truck. My, my 30 YEAR OLD PICKUP, THAT I drive around a dodge. It's nice. Don't get me wrong.

463
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.440
Michael J: They tell me about it. Wow, those are nice tires. Yeah, I'm paying them off 50 bucks a month or less, Rob.

464
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:54.270
Michael J: You know, can I not have good tires. I kind of stuff. Oh, and don't wear a shiny. Watch. Oh my god, don't dress up i mean i can i can do at this point I dressed really nice. I

465
00:58:54.750 --> 00:59:10.500
Michael J: I wear a low rider jeans nice shirts and have a nice chain and I have a one and I got an $8 ring and they look at that ring and try to and I and I tell them right away or cost $8 I bought it on Amazon. Okay.

466
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:17.820
Michael J: But they'll look at my pants. Now, now it's the pants. Wow, those are hundred $80 jeans. Yeah, they are. And I love them.

467
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:21.510
Serenna Beers: You gotta be able to be you. Right.

468
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:26.250
Michael J: Yeah, yeah. And so once once the grant funding thing goes on in the rehab starts

469
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:32.820
Michael J: I can pretty much for me being my own person. And then what I want. I won't be relying on public funds like

470
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:45.540
Michael J: In that sense, you know, Mission Possible. She can buy a new car tomorrow and it's all good. Because she gets her money from other sources. So anyway, was great, talking with you and I'll
