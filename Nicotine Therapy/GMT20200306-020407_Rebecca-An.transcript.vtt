Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There you are.

12
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.960
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.550
Michelle: I didn't even realize you were on yet.

14
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.260
Michelle: How are you, I

15
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: am good. I could see you. I just couldn't hear anything and I see your mouth going. I'm like, I can't

16
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.680
Michelle: I was my phone. That wasn't on the screen. It was on a different screen.

17
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

18
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.850
Michelle: I didn't even realize you were on yet. I thought I was still in the waiting room because once it like comes on it like exits me out of that screen and brings you up so

19
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

20
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.280
Michelle: My God, I was

21
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.410
Michelle: Having an argument with my my ex landlord, I guess you want to call it.

22
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

23
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:33.390
Michelle: It's just petty drama BS, you know, she made an effort to put on our rent receipt today that we were two days late when my lease very clearly states that it's due by the fifth no later than the fifth and that after the next day, it would be then considered late

24
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:49.440
Michelle: And she was like, thanks for realizing your mistake. Do the math if you wanted to be math skills you're very mistaken. And I'm just like, God, then I guess it was your mistake for when you wrote out our lease because it very clearly says it's due by the fifth

25
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

26
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.430
Michelle: And I was like, you're welcome again for realizing your mistake.

27
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.010
Michelle: And just

28
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing after another.

29
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.480
Yeah.

30
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.400
Yeah.

31
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.790
Michelle: I'm just over it and I can't wait to get out of here.

32
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:16.410
Michelle: I can't wait to get out here so late. She's just super spiteful and vindictive and just any little dig or jab. And she just

33
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.750
Michelle: She lives with a drama. She lives through the argument. And that's, you know,

34
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.150
Michelle: It's really sad.

35
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's toxic. That's a toxic toxic environment for you. Yeah.

36
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

37
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What else been happening.

38
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.040
Michelle: Nothing really. You just been packing and just stressing on you know everything and

39
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.780
Michelle: Just

40
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.460
Michelle: You know,

41
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.660
Michelle: Same thing different day.

42
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any word from your dad.

43
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:02.010
Michelle: No, I haven't talked to him yet. And in a while I was going to call them later this evening and talk about you know what because

44
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:15.060
Michelle: I have to pay that $270 tears. I've already done like I've already called and Reese, you know, researched it and I have to pay that to 78

45
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.130
Michelle: So,

46
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.270
Michelle: But I don't know how I'm going to go about doing that because I don't have a debit card or credit card. So I'm either gonna have to

47
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:38.520
Michelle: give the money to my grandparents and have them pay it with their credit card, debit card or whatever or figure out a way to mail it down to Arizona to Alex his dad to see if he'll go in and pay for me and

48
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.520
Michelle: So that's stressful and

49
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:48.450
Michelle: And then studying to take the test, you know, as I have to take that test.

50
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.110
Mm hmm.

51
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The driving test.

52
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.080
Yeah.

53
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long has it been since you drove

54
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.260
Michelle: Not that long. I mean, I wasn't aware my driver's license was suspended, but

55
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.050
Michelle: Never gotten pulled over. I haven't gotten pulled over. Since 2014

56
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.160
Michelle: Wow, that's good. Yeah, and

57
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:19.590
Michelle: Before that I hadn't gotten pulled over gotten a ticket since 2012

58
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:32.430
Michelle: And I actually, I wasn't pulled over. I gotten in a car accident and they had cited me for dangerous left turn when it was, you know, that was a

59
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:42.780
Michelle: BS. They I was like 22 at the time I be so they PROFILED ME. And they made it as if it was my fault. And it wasn't

60
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.230
Michelle: It was making a left turn from the highway into my driveway and when I made my left turn.

61
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:59.190
Michelle: They were clear off the shoulder off this like on the side of the road off the shoulder with no lights on nothing like as if they were parked there.

62
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:10.260
Michelle: And they were older AND THEY WERE FROM STOCKTON came up to you know tourist or whatnot visit or whatnot. And when I had made my turn.

63
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:17.820
Michelle: Like I said they were clear off the shoulder with no lights on, like they didn't have their blinker on like they were merging back onto the highway or anything.

64
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:30.030
Michelle: So when I turned I am, you know, and I could see them in my peripheral other corner of my eye. And I kind of just gunned it to because I knew they were going to hit me. So I gunned it and they hit me.

65
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.590
Michelle: And then

66
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.710
Michelle: I was driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee

67
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.780
Michelle: And on the, on the right passenger rear rear side and when

68
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They

69
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:48.510
Michelle: Kind of spun my Jeep around and flipped it on the side and they hit me in my driveway and the cop just

70
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:55.260
Michelle: Like I said he made it as if it was my fault and everything. And I was like, well, how can you deem it my fault. When I

71
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:06.360
Michelle: What I personally believe happened was they were trying to merge on the highway. They weren't they weren't even like on the shoulder of the road. They were off the shoulder like

72
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:13.890
Michelle: Clear off the pavement in the dirt. What I believe happened was the older gentleman had to have been like

73
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:26.880
Michelle: looking over your shoulder to try to merge that on the highway didn't have his blinker on and I feel like he just done that to try to merge onto the highway didn't realize I was mid term and hit me because

74
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.590
Michelle: The speed limit where he hit me is 55 miles per hour.

75
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

76
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:38.550
Michelle: Well, the officer. He lied and told the officer that I I turned in front of him. And I was like, well,

77
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.330
Michelle: Number one, he hit me in my driveway. How can you say that I pulled out in front of you, when you hit me in my driveway.

78
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:59.850
Michelle: And if you were on the highway doing the speed limit 55 miles an hour and I pulled out in front of you. How come there's no break like skid marks on the highway. How are you in my driveway hitting me if I pulled out in front of you.

79
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

80
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:08.910
Michelle: You know what I mean, like some and they PROFILED ME AS YOU KNOW I was young and made it my fault, but not my fault.

81
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:16.410
Michelle: He didn't have lights on, like he was stopped on the side of the road. He didn't have as bleak wrong like he was merging so

82
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.260
Michelle: I made my turn, you know,

83
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.010
Michelle: Yeah, everything Mike my Jeep was total but my son and I walked away from it without a scratch on us.

84
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thank God. Yeah.

85
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:45.090
Michelle: I mean, he was still in his car seat hanging in the air. You know, like, and he was taking a nap, too. So that's probably another you know because they say like drunk drivers, because they're drunken it loosens you up, they end up, walk away from car accidents.

86
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

87
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.490
Michelle: I feel like my son was taking a nap. So that's probably why you know

88
00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:03.870
Michelle: He was relaxed. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz they hit me just just beyond the door his, his door. It was on just the back end just just passed his doors with it.

89
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. It's insane.

90
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.950
Michelle: That was back in 2012 yeah that was a crazy day

91
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:27.270
Michelle: We had a I was I just dropped my husband all for work and I was on my way back to meet with some people that were looking to buy our park model and we sold them to the result. The park model that day and then a couple weeks later, we moved to Arizona.

92
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.000
Michelle: Yeah, that was a crazy day

93
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it sounds like it big time.

94
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what else been going on.

95
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:44.880
Michelle: Just trying to pack in just dealing with my child, my child just really testing my patience lately.

96
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.490
Michelle: She I'm

97
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:56.100
Michelle: Like I don't, I don't know if it's just her age and whatnot, or I I honestly feel like she's got a little bit of ADHD.

98
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.200
Michelle: Or something's attention.

99
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:10.440
Michelle: Something or other because, I mean, it's probably your age. I mean, it's just, I'm having I guess because my son was so much different at this age. I mean, I know, boys and girls are different, but

100
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:21.930
Michelle: I feel like she's just more like she doesn't really listen, like when I tell her know she just kind of in one ear and out the other. And still, you know, or

101
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:36.600
Michelle: naptime and bedtime is just been exhausting mentally exhausting because she just does not want to lay down and be quiet and close your eyes and she just wants to piddle fart around and

102
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.730
Michelle: You know, and it's just it's aggravating because I'm like

103
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:53.880
Michelle: You know, like, because clearly you know come two o'clock one o'clock. She's clearly, you know, tired and grumpy and whiny and you know you can just tell she's an app and

104
00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:06.090
Michelle: She won't lay down on her own, like we took her in and say, take a nap time. You know, close your eyes go to sleep. We can't leave the room like so we have to lay there with her till she falls asleep.

105
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.140
Michelle: And right now I feel like

106
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.620
Michelle: You know, because we kind of take turns. Whoever puts her down for a nap. The other parts are down for bed.

107
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:29.220
Michelle: Well, I feel like when it comes to Dad She really doesn't want to like lay down and listen. But when it comes to me like I feel like I have less of an issue, you know,

108
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:35.940
Michelle: getting her to quiet down and sit still, they still and fall asleep.

109
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.680
Michelle: For us with God. It's just like a battle for him and I

110
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your day 30 you're the authority figure to her.

111
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.920
Michelle: I feel like so. Yeah, yeah.

112
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dad was over teddy bear.

113
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.190
The authority happy.

114
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.700
Michelle: It's just frustrating, you know, cuz

115
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:12.030
Michelle: I don't have time to sit there and and I mean sometimes like we go to put her bed at eight o'clock, we're in it and she doesn't fall asleep till frickin 10 3011 o'clock.

116
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:12.750
Michelle: Yeah.

117
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And still some

118
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.420
Michelle: crack of dawn.

119
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.980
Michelle: Right, how I feel like she's not getting the app which the sleep that she needs you know needs to get

120
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.740
Michelle: You know, because I know I know kids have to have like a certain amount of sleep or whatnot, and

121
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:46.800
Michelle: Like today she didn't have enough because I had, I had to do some running around I to go pay rent or whatnot. And so, Dad. Lay down with her and you know she she wouldn't go to sleep. So, you know, four or five o'clock comes around and it's you know it's too late.

122
00:15:47.160 --> 00:16:00.390
Michelle: Yeah you know and i and i and i just know come eight o'clock, nine o'clock when we go to lay her down, it's, it's going to be the same thing and then show me up at 748 o'clock in the morning, which is

123
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:08.250
Michelle: Normal. It doesn't matter if she goes to bed at 11 3010 o'clock. She's still up at the same time every morning.

124
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.030
Yeah.

125
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:23.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's a routine and she said she's at that age. And also, don't forget all the stress that you're under to write, you know, which plays a part in it too. And she probably feels that from you as well.

126
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We'll go deeper.

127
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, keep her awake, as well. Right. You know what I mean. Now,

128
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a pretty intuitive.

129
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.580
Michelle: Yeah, I feel like she's definitely smarter than she leads on and right now.

130
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:55.950
Michelle: The stage where she's at right now. I mean, she's just picking up. I mean, she's starting to communicate a lot better. She's learning the words every day. She's saying a new word and I mean she's at that stage right now where she's just learning so much

131
00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.100
Michelle: Yeah, I feel like, you know, and if she really does have some sort of hyperactive attention.

132
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.870
Michelle: Whatever you know

133
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:04.740
Because

134
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:22.440
Michelle: She'll be like, when we go to lay down either Napper bedtime. It doesn't matter. She's like, just constantly, you know, kind of like singing or talking or moving her fingers, you know, she does. The itsy bitsy spider and it's like she can't shut it off.

135
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:29.490
Michelle: You know, and then and then not. Not only that, but she just can't lay still. She's got a role and toss and you're

136
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.100
Michelle: Like, man, just lay still. Close your eyes.

137
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.690
Michelle: You know,

138
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, if she laid still she'd go to sleep.

139
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.140
Michelle: Huh, yeah. But I definitely feel like when we go outside and we take a nap or

140
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.210
Michelle: She definitely falls asleep faster if she's been able to go outside and play.

141
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:04.440
Michelle: But, you know, can't do that every day is when it's raining. Yeah, not an option. We just both got over the sickness and

142
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.110
Michelle: Not trying to get sick again.

143
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:07.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

144
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah. That wouldn't be good.

145
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:11.910
Michelle: Yeah.

146
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.900
No, no.

147
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:24.150
Michelle: Yeah, he was all paranoid. My grandparents are all paranoid to. Are you sure it's the gorilla values. And I'm like, No, it's just a common cold.

148
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.920
Michelle: Yeah, like

149
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just read that there were like there's like 53 confirmed cases in the state of California.

150
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.010
Michelle: Yeah, there's more cases to coming up in in Oregon.

151
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.160
Michelle: Get. It's funny you mentioned that there's, um,

152
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.910
Michelle: You know, the local Facebook pages. You know how they

153
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:58.080
Michelle: Move stuff and whatnot. Well, our one of our local Facebook pages I guess there was a group of students that just came back from Japan and

154
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:10.680
Michelle: One of one of the someone here in the community was like complaining about how they weren't quarantined or seen by a doctor before they really released out back into the public and

155
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:31.170
Michelle: So like everyone's all in panic mode right now. Like we shouldn't have game basketball games. No, no, no games, you know, and these kids in this, and I guess it was the principal to that, you know, the these kids need to be seen by a doctor or at least quarantine for a little while and

156
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:44.910
Michelle: Just like, Well, you know, like, I mean, it doesn't matter. You know, if they just got back from Japan or, you know, because I was reading on on the news here that um

157
00:19:46.470 --> 00:20:03.480
Michelle: I guess like the Seattle area, I guess. Um, it was it's been circulating for like the last month and in the Seattle area and nobody. They didn't know about it. So now more and more and more cases are popping up in the Seattle, Washington area.

158
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:17.640
Michelle: And you know everybody's all freaked out about that and i but i just, you know, I feel like if you wash your hands. You kind of try to stay away from you know populated areas or people or whatnot, then you know

159
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:26.550
Michelle: But I mean, you can't just not live your life, you can't not go to the grocery store and get your groceries, you can't not go to the doctor's office.

160
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:28.590
Michelle: But

161
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.410
Michelle: You know you can't not take the kids to the park because you're afraid of the coronavirus, you know, and

162
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:34.860
Yeah.

163
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:49.800
Michelle: And then there's people out there that are like, Oh, it's just a bunch of BS, you know, a hoax and whatnot. And I'm like, Well, I really don't feel like it would be a hoax or whatnot, when

164
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.580
Michelle: There are people that are actually sick like

165
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:53.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

166
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:59.790
Michelle: How can you say it's a hoax. When the President is talking about it on national TV.

167
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.780
And, you know,

168
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.330
Michelle: That doesn't make sense to me.

169
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.760
Michelle: But I mean,

170
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.880
Michelle: Yeah, people these days. Right.

171
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's almost a form of denial of what's going on.

172
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's easier not to believe that it's really happening and face the fact that it probably is. And then you have the people that you know have catastrophic thinking that. Oh my god.

173
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We need to close down the world because you know the suit, you know, the of the sickness and

174
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Reality. It's true. If we're washing our hands and we're we're being cautious, you know about it, then, you know, odds are, we're not going to get it. You know the odds are, for us, not getting it versus the odds of us getting it, you know.

175
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:44.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

176
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: definitely so. So how have you been doing this past week.

177
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.790
Michelle: You know,

178
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.730
Michelle: All right, I just

179
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:08.910
Michelle: I just, you know, I'm just, I'm all right. I'm just stressed and I'm irritable and

180
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.390
Yeah.

181
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got a few weeks left before you're out of there.

182
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. So there'll be one less stress, but a few more added on. And there's no clarity at whether or not you're going to get the band. When you get the van.

183
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:34.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have all these things that are still like lingering up in the air, which is a stressful situation for anybody.

184
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.630
Michelle: You know,

185
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and so you're going to call your dad tonight.

186
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And confirm that you're going to get the van.

187
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.780
Michelle: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and you're going to handle paying your fines, you can get your license. Right.

189
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. When do you take your test. When do you graduate.

190
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.460
Michelle: For the diploma.

191
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.010
Michelle: Well, I don't have to take a test for the diploma.

192
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:24.720
Michelle: Once I'm done with my schoolwork, then I'll, I'll be done and I won't get the actual diploma until June, but they're going to give me like a certificate that says I've completed it.

193
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:32.070
Michelle: And then the Dr. Test it. Was that what you're talking about. When do I take the DR test or the diploma.

194
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:38.310
Michelle: The diploma. Yeah, no, I don't have to take a test for that. It's just like basically like like school again.

195
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay.

196
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.230
Michelle: Yeah.

197
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.490
Michelle: Yeah, no, thank God I

198
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:52.620
Michelle: Know, I probably wouldn't even pass the GED test my math skills are terrible, terrible thing. I'm just like think thinking, God, I don't have to take a test.

199
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.920
Michelle: I would probably fail for sure because like I said my math skills. Yeah.

200
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:08.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah okay well they'll give you something to show that you've passed it anyways that you've completed it so that you've got prefer your dad.

201
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.410
Michelle: Yeah. What was that, sorry.

202
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I said, they'll give you something. Anyways, to show that you completed it so you can get your dad.

203
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.880
Michelle: Yes, yes, yes.

204
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She said she's gonna

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:31.050
Michelle: Be like a certificate or whatnot of completion and then I will get my actual Diploma in June when everybody else gets, you know,

206
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.960
Michelle: Their coma, like a high school and all that.

207
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.280
Oh, good.

208
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:36.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

209
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:43.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you had an opportunity to look in the area that you're moving to for any services that you can

210
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:56.220
Michelle: Yeah I know they have Orca, which is something I'm not familiar with, but I guess it's also and an alternative like help as far as like finding a place getting into a place. Yeah.

211
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every call them.

212
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:16.080
Michelle: No, I have not. No, I'm waiting kind of more closer because I don't want to really get too involved. I mean, as I shouldn't say involved. I don't want to get too ahead of myself when we're not up there because I want to be able to be like, you know, we're in the area.

213
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.040
Michelle: You know, because we're not in the area.

214
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.360
Michelle: You know, I feel like there's only so much I can do from here.

215
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know,

216
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:42.030
Michelle: Because they're gonna want like they're gonna want you know proof of, you know, income and, you know, they're gonna want all that kind of stuff. And we're not there yet. So I can't prove or show anything. Yeah, no, like, I can't do the interview with HUD, and unless I'm up there.

217
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.650
Michelle: Oh, she she says that it was my mistake to take you for a good renter

218
00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:00.660
Michelle: We weren't like, you know, that's your singular opinion which is meaningless and irrelevant.

219
00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.860
Michelle: I did.

220
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.630
Michelle: Please don't want to hear it.

221
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, don't I don't engage in it, just let her think whatever she wants to think say whatever she wants to say, you know what I mean, she's just trying to reel you in to get you all in and up or so that she can say, See, I told you so.

222
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the truth is something completely different.

223
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

224
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:39.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We don't give those type of people you know that our drama. Any time because it's just not worth it.

225
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

226
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you got enough to worry about.

227
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.000
You know,

228
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:50.640
Michelle: Yeah.

229
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.320
Yeah.

230
00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you been you've been feeling better, as far as getting over being sick but how's everything. How have you been doing on your Madden's everything going okay

231
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:20.580
Michelle: Right. Yes. I've been good. Good. I just got to refill yesterday. So, and I did talk to Dr. Jamison, and she said that she could more than likely do the month supply until I can figure out what exactly like what I need to do and who I need to speak to and where I need to go out there and

232
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.820
Michelle: But yeah

233
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

234
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:34.740
Michelle: But she did say that you were covered, but I don't know how that would work, because I would be on Oregon State insurance.

235
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.480
Michelle: But

236
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:45.870
Michelle: Yeah, I don't know how Oregon and all that one how that would work. Because like I was talking to Dr. Jamison, I was being, you know, I was telling her

237
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:51.330
Michelle: I would like to stick with you because I've already you know one thing

238
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.000
Michelle: I just, I hate

239
00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:18.420
Michelle: Talking to a new person and having to re dredge all my life, you know, and in trauma and I hate it. Right, absolutely hate it, just having a regional backup and to another person to judge me and another person, you know, I just, I hate it. And I don't want to do it.

240
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.750
Michelle: And more than likely, knowing myself. I won't

241
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:31.590
Michelle: Won't do it you know and I, but I would you know if it is possible, I would like to, you know, stick with you. And even if you know

242
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:45.270
Michelle: Even if it was just, you know, the, you know, just just talking and you know like how you know what we do, you know, if I can find a way to get the medication, you know, through somebody else or whatever and just stick with you.

243
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:50.640
Michelle: As far as counseling and therapy goes, I would much rather do that because I don't like I said, I know.

244
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I know that when you get there you have to you'll be on Oregon Health Plan and

245
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that you have to ask them arm.

246
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to get the authorization from them to be able to work with bright heart.

247
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:17.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let them know that you know the the counseling that you are seeing it bright heart is certified in the state of Oregon.

248
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At the highest level.

249
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:33.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see if they won't authorize you you know because of the circumstance and the move and everything to be able to continue services until we get completely certified in Oregon.

250
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm certified in Oregon but bright heart doesn't have a isn't a preferred provider yet in Oregon. I know it's in the works.

251
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:58.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I have somebody else that's actually working with Oregon Health Plan and go be to get that same authorization to be able to work with bright heart on to be able to continue to see me so

252
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just got to talk to them when you go apply and let them know

253
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:06.990
Michelle: Okay, yeah.

254
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:21.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But as long as you're covered in on you know your medical on what you have now you know that it's good. So, you know, until one state stops and one state starts, you know, you can have a completely in the works. So

255
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:32.160
Michelle: Would it be possible to just see you as a therapist is a counselor or does because it would break your heart not allow that, like, do I have been

256
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you have to go through the company that I work for

257
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense. Yeah, I don't have a private practice and for that to happen.

258
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's completely unethical and completely illegal for me to do that.

259
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that without authorization from your insurance company to work with Bret Hart.

260
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:04.290
Michelle: But

261
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just know when you go in there and you fill out your paperwork for Oregon Health Plan. Just let them know

262
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And

263
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See what it

264
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that you have to do.

265
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

266
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:27.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I have practice in Oregon. Before I lived there for 20 years all my most of my certifications are in Oregon. So

267
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It shouldn't be that hard.

268
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you still engaging in that toxic conversation.

269
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.070
No.

270
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just

271
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.430
Michelle: I just, I feel like

272
00:31:50.580 --> 00:32:09.480
Michelle: You know, when she was here that day and she was huffing and puffing and saying all of what she was saying and whatnot and her little digs and her little jabs. And you know, when you're in the moment. Me personally, as my you know what I how I react and how I handle things like it's like

273
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:21.870
Michelle: After it's all said and done, it's like you get that I should have said this, I, I should have said that, you know, I should have said you know I shouldn't have done this, I shouldn't have done that. And I feel like

274
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.700
Michelle: There's so much I want to say to this lady and I know it would be meaningless to her and I know it wouldn't even like

275
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.590
Michelle: You know,

276
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.550
Michelle: Get anything, you know, in just

277
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:51.240
Michelle: For someone I just, you know, for someone like her to just sit there and like try to be like, Well, you know, we were friends. You know, like, I mean, I was talking to my actual friend, you know, the other night about it a little bit and

278
00:32:54.210 --> 00:33:00.600
Michelle: You know she she made the point is, like, you know, if we were actually really if even if we were friends. You know, like

279
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.940
Michelle: Instead of just

280
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:17.100
Michelle: Giving us the eviction or whatever, you know, for you know she didn't talk to me, you know, as, as a real friend, you know, would and and should, you know, talk to somebody about, you know, what's wrong. And what's

281
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:35.190
Michelle: What's going on, and you know I that's, you know, a real fun you know talks to you, you know, this is bothering you know someone said this about you, someone, you know, regardless of what or he were whatever, you know, but to sit there and call yourself a friend.

282
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:37.800
Michelle: I just feel like

283
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.440
Michelle: How can you sit there and call yourself a friend when

284
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:58.260
Michelle: She didn't act like a friend. She certainly wasn't a friend when she gave me a 90 day eviction for some lies that her other friends that live here. You know, you know, like I just

285
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:13.050
Michelle: It blows my mind. It literally blows my mind how people, the thought process of people and what they, how they think and why they think the things. And the way that they do and

286
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.760
Michelle: I just

287
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:23.820
Michelle: it frustrates me to it just, it really frustrates me because I mean, you know, if I, if it was the other way around.

288
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:36.090
Michelle: You know, like I would have been like, you know, number two, said you were blessed me and music at six in the morning and I know that, ain't you, I know you would never lost your music. I know you're not even up at six in the morning.

289
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:43.140
Michelle: You know, or, or, you know, number one, said you had creepy people come in and go in and you know I just

290
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.520
As

291
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:57.000
Michelle: I just, you know, it blows my mind like who are you to judge who's creepy you know and and it's none of your business. You know, like

292
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:13.350
Michelle: You know, I wasn't like on the phone with Christian, as my friend living for the gossip to be like you know number ones ex husband came around here the other day and they were out there screaming, yelling at each other about

293
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:25.320
Michelle: Him being on meth and she didn't want the kids around him because he might be on meth and if he wants that visitation with his kids and he better go get a drug test and prove that he's not on that.

294
00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:26.160
You know, and

295
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.060
Michelle: You know, and, and number two, when her

296
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:41.910
Michelle: When he one weekend boyfriend was was being in and the whole neighborhood could hear it like it was a fucking porno being blasted through the neighborhood. You know, I mean,

297
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:49.230
Michelle: I just like you know as a friend. You know, I just like that. That just that triggers me but you know like

298
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:10.950
Michelle: It triggers me because like for me as a person. I feel like when I am a friend and I. And you know, I look at you like you are my friend and I tell you, you are my friend I act like a fucking front. You know what I mean.

299
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:21.360
Michelle: It just really, it hurts. You know, there can you sit there and call yourself a friend and then

300
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.420
Michelle: Completely change.

301
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:27.720
Michelle: You know, like

302
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.030
Michelle: It hurts, you know, and I feel like

303
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.090
Michelle: And when he likes Christian, you know, our landlord specifically you know I

304
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:52.950
Michelle: I knew from the very first moment I met her. I knew and i and i told Alex where we're going to have problems. They told him you know because

305
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.130
Michelle: You could just tell by people, you know,

306
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When

307
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.970
Michelle: When they interact with you and how they treat other people

308
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.660
Michelle: And I don't know how to how you call it what you like. How to call it or whatnot, but like

309
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:20.250
Michelle: When you sit there and you live. I mean like when we first met them. They were super, super nice super cool, super chill and accommodating and

310
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.590
Michelle: It was like

311
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:36.630
Michelle: I mean, because there was a bunch of when they, when they bought the property that we were living in and we were having issues with the neighbor means the lady was crazy. Like, literally, by definition, she was not like

312
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.750
Michelle: I'm 5150 like

313
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:49.560
Michelle: She just wasn't all there upstairs. She was mentally and I don't know if it was just her as a person, or if it was like years of drug abuse like

314
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me, you know, because

315
00:37:51.840 --> 00:38:00.060
Michelle: From experience of my mother, like my mother is severely like mentally like not right upstairs because of the years of drug abuse.

316
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of men and

317
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.620
You know,

318
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:19.650
Michelle: But it was like that's not yours. I feel like the only, like, the reason she called me a friend, because I would sit there with her and her you know just gossip about the drama that was going on over there because we weren't there anymore.

319
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

320
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:29.850
Michelle: You know, I feel like that's the only reason why she called me a friend because other than that, like we never hung out. We never like had coffee together or

321
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:44.190
Michelle: You know, it was just, it was strictly a relationship of like listening to her gossip, you know, and, and I'm not like that. I don't like to sit around and gossip and talk shit about people and put people down because

322
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.340
Michelle: My feels people do that to me.

323
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:54.840
Michelle: Oh, and when it comes to me it's, there's no in between, you either hate me or you love me.

324
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no in between.

325
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.440
Michelle: Because that's just my personality and me as a person.

326
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:08.160
Michelle: You know, and I don't judge people. I don't care how you dress. I'm not, like, I don't care. You know, I'm not, I'm not like

327
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.430
Michelle: Who are you tweeting like that. Like, I don't give a shit.

328
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:25.980
Michelle: Like you can use G for it. And I mean, you know, I've been on both sides. I've had money. I've had nice cars I've had that life, you know, of like being able to go out and buy whatever you want. And I found at the very bottom homeless living in a tent.

329
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.160
Michelle: You know, like I've been on both sides of the fence.

330
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.830
Michelle: You know and and how I grew up as well. You know, just

331
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:46.050
Michelle: I you know I don't judge people off of the clothes they wear or, you know, the way that they, you know, have their nails done, or you know their hair done or whatever and

332
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.080
Michelle: I honestly feel like

333
00:39:50.880 --> 00:40:00.420
Michelle: When I stopped associating with her because I just stopped. Like, it was like you know i i wasn't into it. I didn't like centered around and talking about

334
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:16.350
Michelle: People and putting them down and stuff like that. So I just stopped talking to her, and when she comes, and she'd stand outside and we'd smoke a cigarette and just talk or whatever. I wouldn't answer my door anymore. So I feel like after that is when she like

335
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.850
Michelle: completely changed her demeanor and everything you know and and when number two moved in, because

336
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200
Michelle: When they were fixing up the place that we live.

337
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:45.840
Michelle: She um she didn't go out of her way to, like, change the cup. The, the countertops, to the phone granite counter you know she didn't she didn't like zippy it up, you know, like when when number two before. Number two, moved in.

338
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:53.580
Michelle: I mean, it's like, I don't care about that kind of stuff, you know, but I mean there are people out there that care about that kind of

339
00:40:53.580 --> 00:41:04.080
Michelle: Stuff and when they were fixing number Two's place up just before she moved in. I mean, they completely like changed it like they put in the granite countertops, they put in the

340
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:19.530
Michelle: Nicer hardwood flooring, they put in more expensive nicer carpet for her. I mean, the vanity mirror in the bathroom is like all you know fancy, fancy. I mean, like they cater to her and her

341
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.220
Michelle: I don't know what you want to call it like her.

342
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:25.560
Michelle: Just

343
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:39.510
Michelle: It's hard to i don't i don't know how the word I'm looking for how to explain it or whatever. But they they literally catered to her like lifestyle of, you know, the finer things the nice

344
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:47.940
Michelle: Thing. Whereas when they were fixing up our place, they didn't do that and and when they were fixing her place up

345
00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:55.230
Michelle: I did. I had made a comment about how late you know you're going awful extra to

346
00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:01.860
Michelle: Fix this place up like much differently than ours. And number one and

347
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:16.470
Michelle: I just feel like that. Like that's that was that was odd to me and in and I had made that comment to her about how that was odd and why they didn't, you know, like, why wouldn't you do that to all the units you know like

348
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.940
Michelle: And I just

349
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:29.640
Michelle: I don't know exactly where I was going with this. But, you know, like I said, I just, I

350
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:34.860
Michelle: It blows my mind. The way the way people are and how they think and

351
00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:45.000
Michelle: And how they treat people and I just feel like it's wrong. Like, I personally honestly really would just love to get a piece of property out in the middle of nowhere and just

352
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:53.820
Michelle: I hate being around people like people are so rude. And so judgmental and I feel like

353
00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:15.300
Michelle: We're all human like we all are human. And I feel like nobody has any room to judge anybody you know and that and that way you know like as far as like your clothes or, you know, the car you drive or whatever. You know what I mean like I just feel like

354
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:25.290
Michelle: How can you judge people based on like their clothes or, you know, or whether you got teeth missing or whatever, you know, I just

355
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:25.770
Yeah.

356
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:36.270
Michelle: It really hurts me. It hurts me. It hurts my feelings, because I know I'm a good person. I know I'm a good person and

357
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.720
Michelle: I know

358
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:51.840
Michelle: You know, in my heart of hearts, you know, my conscience IS CLEAR LAKE. I did nothing wrong literally did nothing wrong 100% I did not have

359
00:43:52.560 --> 00:44:12.030
Michelle: I don't have creepy random people coming and going all day long. Nobody comes to my house, you know, and, and for her to sit there and call my dad creepy because he came on his Harley and he's got his do rag on and his leather jacket. Miss chaps, and he's a biker guy like I just feel like

360
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.590
Michelle: Like, wow, you know, it just, I

361
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:21.720
Michelle: Don't know.

362
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.280
It really well.

363
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is this the first time, these two apartment areas. This is the first time that they've had property that they've owned or tried to run and manage

364
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:42.450
Michelle: I don't think so. I don't know, though I know they moved up here from like the Modesto area or something like that. And I don't know if they had properties down here or whatnot, but

365
00:44:43.530 --> 00:45:03.330
Michelle: I mean, you know, and that blows my mind to because the person that was living here before us, literally trash the place I mean he threw a shovel through the front window here and I mean there were haul holes all over the place. I mean, like that's we've been here for over a year like

366
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:12.090
Michelle: There's a whole right there. There's a whole right there. And there's a whole up in her bedroom where the door not. I mean, where the door knob, you know, hit the wall.

367
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:21.330
Michelle: And it's like a perfect friggin square where clearly they have replaced it and repaired it before we moved in, you know, and, and my dad even said the same thing like

368
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:26.610
Michelle: We didn't trash this place. It's not trashed. I just

369
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:35.970
Michelle: You know, and for her to, like, you know, I'm just took you for a good renter, but I mean I could show you text messages from

370
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:46.470
Michelle: Eight months ago about how you know we're the best renters, you know, world landlords dream and it's just like a complete one at Lake

371
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:54.420
Michelle: You know, and you know, rent is my rent was paid on time every, every month, like

372
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:02.190
Michelle: We never had any complaints at all until she moved in next door here and

373
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:10.050
Michelle: Her i mean i just help you know as a friend. How can you sit there and believe somebody lies.

374
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:26.550
Michelle: I mean, because those were the only two complaints that I was blasting my music one day at six in the morning complete fabricated lie, I'm not even up at six in the morning, let alone blasting will use a six in the morning and the creepy people and

375
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:41.040
Michelle: Like, I mean, I mean like, you know, like, you know, there's nobody that comes to my house, you know, nobody comes to my house. So how are you going to sit there and believe lies and then try to say that I'm not a good renter, like I'm not, you know, like

376
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that it's you know that it's hurtful. But here's the thing is that

377
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, a lot of times, other people's perceptions of what being a friend means has different meaning than what we think it does.

378
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what your belief system is and how you believe your friend is or even a good landlord because a good landlord, you know, would take the complaint.

379
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:11.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And start monitoring and watching to see what they were talking about.

380
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and if that wasn't, you know, something that they saw that it would, you know, be thrown away. It wouldn't be just on a judgmental stance taking what other people say, and using that to evict you it just

381
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:32.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It shouldn't work that way. But, you know, based off of what you've told me she does, which tells you about her character.

382
00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:41.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right easily swayed she likes drama and you really don't have room in your life for that type of person. Anyways,

383
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

384
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:51.720
Michelle: Oh yeah. Well, like I said, I quit. I quit. Like I quit answering my daughter when she come over stand outside and smoke cigarettes and

385
00:47:52.470 --> 00:48:03.780
Michelle: Listen to her gossip about what's going on over there on Fifth street or you know what's going on where like, I just don't want you want to hear it because like I said, I'm just not that kind of person.

386
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.590
Michelle: I don't like

387
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:09.630
Michelle: Around and putting people down. No, I don't. I don't like that. I don't do that.

388
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not me. Just, just remember that you don't have time for that kind of stuff. And, you know,

389
00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that's not the person that you want in your life. Anyways, you know what I mean. And I know that it hurts. It hurts to be judged by people but you know i know that our society today is a judgmental society.

390
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, we have to do the best that we can. And live within it, and I agree. Give me a piece of property in the middle of nowhere, where I have no neighbors, and I'll be

391
00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, for the same exact reason because you know i i have my own life. I like to do things my own way and you know other people might not agree with it and that's okay with me, but you just got to get to a point that her opinion.

392
00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:07.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's not true. Right. And although it's her it's it is hurtful because of bashes out at your character and you know you're a good person.

393
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:15.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And and knowing that piece. Knowing basically your side of the street is clean. This is all on her.

394
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:27.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And she's going to have, you know, there's gonna come a point where she's going to have a rude awakening where you know these things that she's based her decisions off of are going to be minimal compared to what she's got left to deal with with other people.

395
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, it would have been easier just put it out on your door and say hey if you're up at 6am don't play music or you know what I mean.

396
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be easier to do that, to do that, but for some reason she's chosen to go this whole extreme route which is okay. That's her you know as the landlord or the owner or whatever. That's her right to do that, whatever, but don't engage in the banter back and forth because you're already hurt.

397
00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's just going to compact it. You know what I mean, it's just going to make it worse. You want to walk out of there at the end of the month with grace.

398
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Knowing that you you know did not engaged in the drama YOU LET HER OWN IT YOU LET HER. Keep it

399
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just stay completely out of it. You know what I mean. And just know that the minute that you meet somebody like her. And those red flags go off. Do what you did descent yourself because they're not worth being in your lap.

400
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:41.370
Michelle: I need to do that more. I really do. Because like I don't like confrontation really unless it's brought like you know like when she was like here in my face saying what you know I held my tongue, the best that I could for the sector, you know, and being

401
00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:43.140
Michelle: Hey,

402
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Look,

403
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:57.300
Michelle: You know, I didn't, I didn't want to, you know, like I was telling all its I should have just kept my mouth completely shut and not set a thing and just let her making you know make an ass out of herself and, you know,

404
00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:04.440
Michelle: And I wish I would have done that because you know with with people like that you really you really, you're not going to get anywhere.

405
00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:08.400
Michelle: Not gonna get anywhere. It doesn't matter what you say how you say it.

406
00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:13.290
Michelle: When you say it, you're not going to get anywhere. It's just going to be a repetitive never ending circle.

407
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:19.290
Michelle: You know, keep going back and forth, you know, and that is the type of person that she is, you know, just

408
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.030
Michelle: Any kind of petty dig she can make she's going to do, she's she

409
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:25.530
Michelle: You know, and

410
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:40.410
Michelle: I need to do that more, you know, I feel like I just need to just, you know, but but me on another on another part of me. I'm that type of person that like when something is wrong or unjust. You know, I have to

411
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:54.510
Michelle: And I need. I just need to just not do that and just walk away and keep my mouth shut, but that's that's really hard for me because something isn't right, or unjust. I have a really hard time of just keeping my mouth shut, you know,

412
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've probably been frightened for your space for, you know, a long time.

413
00:51:59.280 --> 00:51:59.700
Michelle: Oh, yeah.

414
00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:13.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but when it comes to to this kind of stuff where you've got to be there for a couple more weeks, make your life easier. This isn't about making her life easier. This is about making your life easier.

415
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Making the transition in the move as easily as you possibly can. And that's not engaging and, you know, in the drama. You know the truth. Yeah.

416
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And that's the most important thing you don't have anything to defend to anybody. The inspector came in. He's already you know made his you know report clearly, you know, and so you've got that behind you to, you know,

417
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:52.950
Michelle: Yeah, I don't know if it's legal or not. But my dad was like, and I'd love to do it this way. But my dad was like, you know, like just he's gonna like thinking about just showing up at like 910 o'clock at night and just loading everything up in the U Haul and just be gone.

418
00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:06.090
Michelle: I mean, I don't know if that's legal or whatnot, it probably. I mean, I don't see why it wouldn't be I feel like, because that's what I want to do. I don't even want to look at her. I don't want to see her. I don't want to say, I just, I just want to be gone.

419
00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

420
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:07.980
Michelle: You know what I mean, like,

421
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:08.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't play, man.

422
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:19.290
Michelle: You know, because I it's just, you know, with my dad here. I don't think that's going to be a pretty, it's not going to be a good situation because my dad's a lot like I am, as far as like

423
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.450
Michelle: Not being able to like

424
00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:27.540
Michelle: Hold your tongue, you know when someone thinks that's not right or you know

425
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:38.670
Michelle: defaming my character, you know, or in any way, shape, or form. You know my dad, my dad's a lot a lot like me. And that way, like where, you know, you have to

426
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:45.240
Michelle: At least have to try to make it right. You know, or you know whatever because

427
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's the thing.

428
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't, you don't have anything to make right

429
00:53:51.510 --> 00:54:07.950
Michelle: Right. Well, I mean, you know, in a perfect world, you know, if I really wanted to, you know, when she after she made her text about how the mistake of me being a good renter, I want to, you know, I really want to be like, and I really, really want to text. Check back and just be

430
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:08.520
Sure.

431
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.900
Michelle: That your opinion which is irrelevant and meaningless, but

432
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.690
Michelle: You know, I just

433
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.200
Michelle: I know it's not going to get anywhere. I know it's

434
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:28.740
Michelle: Not going to mean anything to her or change your mind or change anything. And, you know, because

435
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:35.220
Michelle: And I'm sure she'll come back with some other kind of vindictive dig or whatever because that's

436
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

437
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:42.540
Michelle: She does. You know, like when I told her about the mistakes. She made on their rent receipt, like after you know I told her you know

438
00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:52.020
Michelle: That's what she came back with she had nothing else to say. But, well, my mistake was for you taking you for a good run term. You know, like

439
00:54:55.170 --> 00:55:01.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I, you know, if I were in your position. I think my text back to her would be please stop texting me

440
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.270
Well,

441
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:11.010
Michelle: I don't, she'll text back and I haven't responded. I haven't responded and i don't i'm not going to

442
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:12.480
Michelle: And

443
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.930
Michelle: I don't show text back, I highly doubt it.

444
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But yeah, you don't. Again, you don't need it. It's her stuff. This isn't yours.

445
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the more you engage in it, your side, you know, your side of the fence starts getting dirty.

446
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't want that. You want to keep it as clean as possible. You want to be able to get your stuff out of there. And there's nothing wrong with you, moving out at night.

447
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your rents paid till the end of the month period. You know what I mean. You get to do you and you can have people come to your home.

448
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. That's it. You're allowed that you're home. You're allowed to have company, whether

449
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your dad and your dad's on a bike and

450
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:57.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Using leathers and a do rag. That is somebody else's opinion and they're judgmental, you know, stance. The truth is far from it.

451
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:09.960
Michelle: I don't, I mean right well that day when she said that I I told her that I because I asked her, I go, so we're not allowed to have Gaston. And she was like, I didn't say that. And I was like, well, you kind of art.

452
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:21.750
Michelle: Because if number one complains again about a creepy guy coming over. You're going to be here at my door with an eviction notice because she street out said one more complete and you're out of here.

453
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:32.940
Michelle: And we never got another complaint, she never came by and said, hey, number one, said you had another creepy person come by. She just was here on the first of the year. Here's your eviction

454
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:34.980
Michelle: You know cuz

455
00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:40.770
Michelle: I told I told I did. I told her that. Who are you to judge and who is she to judge who's creepy and who's not.

456
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.030
Right, you know,

457
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:56.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's, you know, there's no disputing the fact that it's an unfair situation, but it's an unfair situation at this point that you don't have any control over and

458
00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:04.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, if you can distance yourself from it and just focus on your move and focus on the things of in front of you that you need to do, you will find the peace in that

459
00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:14.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you leave there and you leave with no, you know, with no drama and no bantering back and forth, you're leaving there knowing you did the best that you could

460
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:15.960
Michelle: Write

461
00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:16.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

462
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's what's most important.

463
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:30.330
Michelle: And again, that's what we're gonna do. We're just gonna leave the place unlocked. I'm going to leave the key because that's good. I'm sure that's going to be a huge argument because Alex lost his key.

464
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:40.440
Michelle: To the house and I've got my key, but I feel like that's what we're gonna do. We're just going to leave the key right here on the window seal and we're going to be gone.

465
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:47.040
Michelle: Because I don't, I don't want to be here and I don't want to see your speaker ever again.

466
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.810
Michelle: I really don't. I don't.

467
00:57:50.550 --> 00:58:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know by rights. You don't have to, you know, the minute you're out of that apartment. You don't have to, you know, um, it's over. You don't ever have to worry about her again.

468
00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So listen, my next person is already here. So I have to go. So next week we'll meet at three o'clock or normal time

469
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, you're on my schedule. Okay. Okay, and just

470
00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just step step back and don't engage in any of the stuff

471
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

472
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just keep yourself.

473
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: free and clear of the drama, you know,

474
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:31.770
Michelle: Right. I think I'm actually going to block her so I don't even get a text message to even like

475
00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Myself.

476
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.070
Michelle: Apply right

477
00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would be a good idea because I get the defensiveness, and I get why you you know why.

478
00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your personality and why it's easy. I'm the same exact

479
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Way, but I know that when we don't have anything to defend

480
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's useless, nothing's going to change.

481
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's time to walk away.

482
00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:05.730
Michelle: Yeah, it's not gonna change anything. And like I you know I know, I know her, I know her tight, she'll just come back with another vindictive dig and it'll be just repetitive never ending

483
00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, and you'll get hurt more. And you want to avoid that.

484
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:10.050
Michelle: Yeah.

485
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:14.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're right. Yeah. Okay, so no engaging

486
00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.450
Michelle: No need. You know, I'm not going to know

487
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:22.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay. And you're going to have a great week.

488
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:24.810
Michelle: I hope so.

489
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and I will see you next Thursday at three o'clock. Okay, thank you. Thank you.

490
00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, hang tough.

491
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

492
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I will see you next week.

493
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alrighty. Okay. Hi, Michelle.

494
00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.370
Bye.
