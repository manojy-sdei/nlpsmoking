42
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.640
TCL LX: Or know what's necessary. It's obviously, you could probably get a little glimpse that my family's been in the

43
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.990
TCL LX: addiction field for a long time. I had 10 years clean

44

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.350
TCL LX: I got clean. When I was 19 when my mom died. And then I relapse with my dad came back.

TCL LX: I was having my own personal issues and stuff to it just added up but but this last time. I've never did heroin before. This is the first time I have been addicted to this and

52
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.860
TCL LX: I was wondering like about anxiety meds and stuff like cuz I'm it's just harder for me to do things for all people nowadays.

53
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.100
Katrina Groves: Yeah, it's really hard, as you know,

54
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:58.140
Katrina Groves: When you're in withdrawals, your brain is just kind of all over the place and all those emotions are really high because you're used to stuffing all your feelings.

55
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.520
TCL LX: Yeah, so

56
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.150
Katrina Groves: I will definitely get you medication to make you more comfortable today.

59
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:26.280
Katrina Groves: I used to work for Deloitte committee health center and I just transitioned over to this job. Instead, but it will be really important for you to keep going to her groups.

60
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.210
Katrina Groves: I assume you're not working right now summer.

61
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.990

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.150
TCL LX: Yeah, I worked with college, I was a librarian.

66
00:05:49.230 --> 00:06:02.310
TCL LX: Okay, yeah, that was my favorite. And I worked for shell, the gas station here in town, and I did a lot of students jobs at the college when I was going there and stuff, because I was always and all enrolled classes.

67
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.980
Katrina Groves: What were you going for degree wise.

68
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.980
TCL LX: Um, well, I wanted to get

69
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.340
TCL LX: I got my a behavioral science.

70
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.100
TCL LX: And I got my transfers and I wanted to get a bachelor's in

71
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.520
TCL LX: In psych but then they said that Sykes not really good field this to get it in. So they said that the best would be to be a social work.

72
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.860
TCL LX: So I'm going that that field is what I wanted to do.

73
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.020
TCL LX: And is that changed or do

74
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.040
Katrina Groves: You still want to do that.

75
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.070
TCL LX: I still planning to do, but I just don't know what the major would be now.

76
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:50.490
TCL LX: They can't get a BA in behavioral social science. It's not a thing. So I got my able social science and I got transcripts and stuff, but I wanted to work with juveniles. I didn't want to work with adult

77
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.720
Nice.

78
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.070
Katrina Groves: You have a lot to give to kids that have been through what you've been through.

79
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:04.260
Katrina Groves: Yeah. So how old were you when you started any drug of choice at all. I know you went through some of this already, but

80
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.670
Katrina Groves: I just wanted to get

81
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.890
Katrina Groves: To know you 12. And what did you use the verse. First time pot alcohol.

82
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.960
Katrina Groves: Methods.

83
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.820
Katrina Groves: Methods first drug

84
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.840
TCL LX: Yeah.

85
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.640
Katrina Groves: Okay, well, you didn't make a mess. Anytime around my for it.

86
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.620
Katrina Groves: All right, and

87
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.320
Katrina Groves: Then what happened after you started using math at age 12 kind of take me through the timeline.

88
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.690
TCL LX: I was first when I first got locked up as well.

89
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:46.680
TCL LX: So I went to juvenile hall. I spent every birthday from 12 to 16 incarcerated, like I was either on the run away from probation or because I, my main thing back then was, we

90
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:54.360
TCL LX: Legal and so if I wasn't on the run. I was in juvenile hall like every birthday. My birthday. I spent in juvenile hall.

91
00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:03.060
TCL LX: And then I got out of my group home when I was 16 and then I came back to Christian city. And then my mom passed away when I was 17

92
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:22.110
TCL LX: And then I had my daughter. I picked up my mom's ashes on my 18th birthday. And then I had my daughter when I was 19 and that's what I got clean. I had my son. When I was 20 and then I was clean for so it's not really 10 years but let's clean from 19 to 28 and I just turned 29

93
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.460
Nice.

94
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.940
TCL LX: So I've been back here. My relapse for a year.

95
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:44.250
Katrina Groves: Yeah, that's a hard. The good thing about for you. Summer is that you know what addictions like and you know what recoveries like and. And do you realize, geez, I you don't have a life like this. Right. I mean, you want to get back to where you remember having it be good.

96
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.860
TCL LX: Yeah, I have two kids. Yeah.

97
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.450
Katrina Groves: And what are your kids doing right now.

98
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.770
TCL LX: Or what their dad.

99
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.710
Katrina Groves: Is he clean and sober or Where's he

100
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.380
TCL LX: Yeah, he's clean and sober and he's a dick.

101
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.490
Okay.

102
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.390
Katrina Groves: So you don't want them to be with him very long. So you want your kids back, like, ASAP. Right.

103
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:12.210
TCL LX: Well, I was always the sole provider and stuff. And the reason what sent me into the relapse spiral was because my kids that I was with for 10 years

104
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:21.510
TCL LX: I lost my virginity to him when I was like 13 and I was with him. My, my whole life. And he decided to cheat on me and stuff. And so he was cheating. I mean, Israel abusive for like

105
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:29.340
TCL LX: And then all my friends and stuff knew about it and nobody told me that I thought retarded. And then he went not married and had another baby.

106
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:37.440
TCL LX: And because every time I come around like he likes to argue and fight with me in front of the kids and I don't want to expose my kids to that kind of

107
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:52.920
TCL LX: Stuff and I don't engage in conversation with them and stuff. And so I don't want them to see any of that. So I just have eliminated myself from the situation which fucking just allowed me to beat my heroine demon more

108
00:09:53.460 --> 00:10:02.520
Katrina Groves: Yeah. So what made you want to come back this time you said because was your dad passing did that now that actually made you relapse. So, what, what made you want to

109
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.160
TCL LX: I DIDN'T MEAN WE LOVE MY DAD passing it was really like dealt with.

110
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:22.800
TCL LX: Is just times passing and stuff. And yeah, I'm just tired of it. Yeah. And I've been wanting to I was hospitalized. About three months ago for this stuff and

111
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.770
Katrina Groves: I heard you had a pic line you had an infection in your heart right in your heart valve.

112
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.250
Katrina Groves: And you're on the antibiotics and

113
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.380
TCL LX: I know there's only there's only like a year. So if I continue down this road, you know, I'm gonna be dead.

114
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.670
Katrina Groves: Yeah, and your kids, your kids do need you.

115
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.780
Yes.

116
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.150
Katrina Groves: You don't want to leave them like your parents, unfortunately.

117
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.520
TCL LX: Yeah, exactly. To you.

118
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.830
Katrina Groves: So any other substances that you've abused in the past. I mean, cigarettes.

119
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.000
Fences

120
00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.010
TCL LX: Cigarettes.

121
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.410
TCL LX: I've never been real into the tilting at all. I've always left that to the doctors

122
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.220
Okay.

123
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.940
TCL LX: And math before was my drug of choice before I started doing

124
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:13.890
TCL LX: opiate

125
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.060
Katrina Groves: Words like

126
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.870
TCL LX: Ruin but you don't really mix it too expensive. So

127
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.650
Katrina Groves: Mm hmm.

128
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.830
TCL LX: And more money, I probably would do both, but I don't. I don't.

129
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.930
Katrina Groves: So you choose the heroin over the math.

130
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.430
Katrina Groves: And were you ever on Suboxone before I forgot to ask you.

131
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.070
TCL LX: Once or twice when I was in

132
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.930
TCL LX: The hospital.

133
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.770
Katrina Groves: Okay, and did it seem to work for you. Did you have any

134
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.750
TCL LX: Product like this.

135
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.400
TCL LX: Strips all

136
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.710
Katrina Groves: You don't like the strips. What's wrong with them.

137
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.300
TCL LX: It feels like crap.

138
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.290
Katrina Groves: Yeah, they do.

139
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.940
Katrina Groves: And

140
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.590
TCL LX: Therefore, I like didn't pick him.

141
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:58.650
Katrina Groves: Okay, well, so I would rather give you something that works. There's something called sub solve. It's a different brand but it tastes more like mint.

142
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.700
Katrina Groves: Think that might be. We will try it, week to week. And if you don't like it, we'll try something else, till I find something that works for you.

143
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:12.210
TCL LX: Okay, thank you. Okay, yeah, I would have been my one of my big concerns and stuff is because I'm not like

144
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:24.180
TCL LX: Pretty tough when it comes to pain and stuff. And as last time since I've been at the hospital, honestly, like it took a real big, big everybody that that's close to me realizes how much like a toll, it took

145
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:41.100
TCL LX: Like you know what the heart infection and then going centric and ahead monia yeah i'm not i'm not trying to be tired forever like my I seen what this should did my parents like I've seen them die a slow, painful death, like I get. I get it. Yeah. And so

146
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.880
Katrina Groves: I want to

147
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.090
TCL LX: I want to, I only want to be on the Suboxone for a couple like like maybe like a couple months tops that I want to get off of that as well.

148
00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:09.120
Katrina Groves: Well, that one huge kind of, I would suggest to play that one bite year. In other words, kind of take it, week to week because it's real easy to get off. Well, it's not easy, but getting off the drugs and staying off are kind of two different things and

149
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:15.060
Katrina Groves: Many people that we see that stop the Suboxone too early, they relapse again pretty quick. So

150
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.890
Katrina Groves: Try not to set yourself up for

151
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:28.650
Katrina Groves: Saying I have this. I got this goal. I gotta get off this stuff and few months, you know, kind of be easy with yourself a little bit. Give yourself some time like Tony says if you got a broken leg, you need to wear a cast for a little while.

152
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.080
Katrina Groves: And you need to let your body heal and your mind heal and your brain heal and that takes a lot of time.

153
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.330
Katrina Groves: But we'll, we'll work on it together will be with you all the way

154
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:51.810
Katrina Groves: You may want to, you may want to think about doing this sunblock head. It's a shot. I don't know if you've heard about it, but it's basically Suboxone and an injection, like, you know, how do you ever do Deborah prepare for birth control.

155
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.820
TCL LX: Yeah, I've tried it. Okay.

156
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.510
Katrina Groves: So it's not that at all. But it's the same kind of thing where it's a shot. And it's good for a month. So you don't have to put strips under your tongue, you don't have to have the taste. You don't have to mess with the saliva.

157
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.920
Katrina Groves: It's really awesome. So that's an option. We can go to if once you get stabilized on the on the

158
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.790
TCL LX: viewport our fence.

159
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.670
Katrina Groves: Right, so let me go.

160
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:22.140
Katrina Groves: Here into any other illnesses or injuries that you've had over the years.

161
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.770
TCL LX: I got my I got my tonsils taken out. I've had 14 breast surgeries.

162
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.260
Katrina Groves: Now, Lord, what's going on with your bras.

163
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:42.930
TCL LX: And they they were dying. So he says they were benign like tumors, pretty much after I had my son breastfeeding. My daughter and

164
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.910
TCL LX: So they said the old milk of the new milk may have bacteria and cause like foremost herbaceous this, but every time they removed one at one would come back.

165
00:14:51.450 --> 00:15:01.290
TCL LX: Insert then they kept doing that, like couple times each year to like the first started when I was 21 and I had one for about almost two years now, but

166
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:10.380
TCL LX: Until they remove one sticks data removed the whole cavity of all the infected spots. And then so as it came back. So this is a come back, we'll do a double mastectomy.

167
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.920
Katrina Groves: Their breast cancer and your family or do you know

168
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.970
TCL LX: It wasn't a breast cancer. It was

169
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.300
Katrina Groves: Right. I know it wasn't. Yeah, that's good.

170
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.320
TCL LX: So yeah, very weird. I don't know. But, um,

171
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.330
TCL LX: But that's occurred for like two years, but I have been under anesthesia. A lot

172
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.760
Katrina Groves: So tonsils to tubal ligation.

173
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.850
Katrina Groves: Did you have any other surgeries like history to me. Do you still have all your parts.

174
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.820
TCL LX: Okay.

175
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:51.810
Katrina Groves: No partner right now, but what you had your tubes tied. Okay, um, any venereal diseases or things in the past.

176
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.120
Katrina Groves: Um, any implants of any kind.

177
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.060
Katrina Groves: No metal in your body. No.

178
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:11.220
Katrina Groves: And then is there anything in your family you know about besides the addictions, such as high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks, diabetes, thyroid

179
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:18.840
TCL LX: Yeah, oh yeah, I had my cell laboratory gland removed. I have a scar from a year to myself about the one. Got it.

180
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:25.350
TCL LX: Yep. And I have a thing called the Wilsons disease genetic disorder where I have to do much copper my body.

181
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.910
Katrina Groves: Exactly. Okay. Thank you. Wilson's that one doesn't bother you too much. Do you have any brothers or sisters did it well.

182
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.600
TCL LX: That one I think does bother me a lot. And it just get under looked a lot

183
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.340
Katrina Groves: Ah, OK.

184
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:51.840
TCL LX: I think that's one of the main reasons why self medicate because if like all the information that I've learned about it and stuff. It's like a, it's like a more advanced thing of like hepatitis. Like what, like I compare it to

185
00:16:52.890 --> 00:17:02.430
Katrina Groves: So Dr. Pearson is one of the best one of the smartest guys there at the clinic and he looks like he's your primary care provider, even though he has MS. Have you met him.

186
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:10.920
Katrina Groves: Yeah, he's very brainy and he will work with you on your Wilson's disease as much as you want. So

187
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.770
TCL LX: I was gonna make an appointment with him after I got you guys perfect so

188
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.450
Katrina Groves: You don't have brothers or sisters summer.

189
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.820
TCL LX: I have. I'm the youngest of four.

190
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.940
Katrina Groves: And. Are they healthy or they have addictions as well.

191
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.340
TCL LX: We're all pretty fucked up.

192
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.990
TCL LX: My sister started was leukemia.

193
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.850
TCL LX: My oldest sister has leukemia, but all four of us have different died, besides Me and my brother, Brian.

194
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.650
Right.

195
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.840
TCL LX: And we look like when

196
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.810
Katrina Groves: Is your brother still using because I know he was off and on, and

197
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.570
TCL LX: Still, often on. Yeah.

198
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.850
Katrina Groves: So are you

199
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.550
Katrina Groves: Are you feeling sick right now like nausea.

200
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.930
TCL LX: Yes, ma'am.

201
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.440
Katrina Groves: Yeah, tell me. Um, how about diarrhea.

202
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:13.080
TCL LX: The I've messed up Bell since I've been out of the doctors because ever since I went septic it's been like

203
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.030
TCL LX: Like

204
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.740
TCL LX: I have to take a lot of schools officers and stuff to even be able to go to the bathroom.

205
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:31.950
Katrina Groves: Okay, so that's one of the things up prescribed for you being on buprenorphine or or Suboxone or themselves. They all concentrate you a little bit but not anywhere near like heroin. So that shouldn't get

206
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.070
TCL LX: So I've been pretty bad. I probably need

207
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:45.720
Katrina Groves: Some got it. I'll give you a stool softener for nausea, do you have anything that you've taken before like promethazine or So Fran. What could I give you for that.

208
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:53.190
TCL LX: Um, my sister sometimes gives me some of her knowledge at the medicine. And I think, though, friend. Okay.

209
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.320
Katrina Groves: I'll do whatever your insurance covers

210
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:08.940
Katrina Groves: Okay. Um, but as soon as you take the Suboxone you're going to feel better. So my, my goal today would be to get the script over to Walmart. Do you have questions about how it's taken

211
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.950
TCL LX: I've taken it before.

212
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:17.550
Katrina Groves: Yeah, and I know you hate the taste, but I'm giving you the the the sub sub brand which is their little

213
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:31.110
Katrina Groves: They come in a packet and you peel them open their like aluminum pouches and you just stick it under your tongue like a little breath mint and they taste mentee. You still need to have, I know you're on the saliva duct on that side.

214
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.820
Katrina Groves: But you have one on the other.

215
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.230
TCL LX: End you

216
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.090
Katrina Groves: Do you have trouble making saliva.

217
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.260
Sometimes

218
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:46.140
Katrina Groves: So put it under your tongue, try to eat before you do that, eat something release our so it gets like your taste buds going

219
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:55.500
Katrina Groves: State leave it under there 1015 minutes. Don't swallow it. When if you finally get a huge mouth like and spit a little bit out

220
00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:04.080
Katrina Groves: I'm going to try and keep it under as long as you can and then I'll give you probably you're going to do like a 5.7 milligram

221
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:16.710
Katrina Groves: Today, depending on how bad you withdrawals are probably maybe another one tonight, and then I'll try and get you to where you're taking three of them a day, which will probably feel pretty good.

222
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.600
Katrina Groves: Family, you got family. You got to put me on hold for

223
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.980
TCL LX: Know I was telling

224
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.470
TCL LX: Somebody to get out.

225
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.870
Katrina Groves: Excuse me, please. But I'm busy talking to my doctor

226
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.430
TCL LX: All right. Weird.

227
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.480
I know

228
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.150
Katrina Groves: It's kind of cool. Yeah.

229
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.190
Katrina Groves: Okay, cool. Um,

230
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.750
Katrina Groves: So any Fevers or chills or night sweats, or is that all gone since the antibiotics.

231
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.740
TCL LX: No nice way sweats, I get all the time. If I don't do like most of the I can't make it without for four hours without using

232
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.010
Katrina Groves: Four hours we did already your past that right now.

233
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:59.490
Katrina Groves: Yeah. Um, what about, let's see, where was I nausea and constipation.

234
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:09.690
Katrina Groves: tremor. Have you had Clonidine before. So that really helps with the withdrawal symptoms. Clonidine calms down everything it lowers your heart rate.

235
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.270
Katrina Groves: Never had that one.

236
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:21.720
Katrina Groves: I'll just give you a we call it a kick pack. It's to help you kick and it takes care of all your symptoms. You're having diarrhea. Well, you don't have diarrhea right now.

237
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.840
Katrina Groves: Yeah yeah that's coming though right

238
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:32.400
Katrina Groves: Later, yeah. So I'll give you something for diarrhea something for nausea something for constipation and

239
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.880
TCL LX: What about anxiety and stuff.

240
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:46.950
Katrina Groves: Right for the nausea medication. I'm giving you helps a lot with anxiety and so does the Clonidine I know that's not what you know people out there. They're like, oh, I want Bezos I want Valium or something but

241
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.450
Katrina Groves: I don't want to start you on a whole nother addiction. So the anxiety is going to be

242
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.700
TCL LX: Just for like I'm

243
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.730

TCL LX: Far, but too. I don't like to be inside. So I do a lot of walking and stuff and I'm lately I've been getting like light headed and stuff. I don't know why. Maybe, I don't know if it was because I was like

TCL LX: You're cutting down on the heroin. Yeah, I don't know if it's because I because down like crazy.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:12.060
Katrina Groves: Yeah, but do you, I mean I can prescribe it for you. But do you want to, is it worth the restless legs just to help you sleep for a couple nights or do you want to just try the Clonidine instead

TCL LX: Of you maybe just like for the next couple days because. Okay, I know that the next three days. Well, far i don't know what it's like with the medicine, but I know
