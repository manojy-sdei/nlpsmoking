Gwenevere Abriel: Get the sense that once you leave here. I think you forget all about it.

12
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.140
Anthony Garcia: I'm not really like forgetting about it is just

13
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.750
Anthony Garcia: Seems like I have a busy.

14
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.350
Anthony Garcia: busy schedule like pretty much work. And then, you know, I don't think in on nothing but work and then make it home I cook dinner.

15
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:11.520
Anthony Garcia: Talk to my daughter for a little bit shower up and then practically go to sleep and get ready for another day at work. So I tried to remember and things, you know, but it's hard.

16
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, even if it was remembered

17
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it as simple as just remembering or is there a part of you that is afraid to go to school.

18
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.730
Anthony Garcia: Parts of me sometimes wants to and then parts of me starts thinking like, you know, like

19
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.170
Anthony Garcia: What am I really going to do with it. Anyways, you know,

20
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.150
Anthony Garcia: Already reaching 42 types of Fallon and stuff. So I was just thinking

21
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.270
Anthony Garcia: Maybe this is my life, you know, doing tires, you know, thinking about that.

22
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.720
Anthony Garcia: I'm good at it. People my customers stuff. It allows me pretty much

23
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.400
Anthony Garcia: Just figure. You know, I've been doing this for 10 years almost.

24
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.010
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. Nothing else.

25
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but you just said you you can't know something until you learn it. So you can't use that one.

26
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know

27
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All for it.

28
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.180
Anthony Garcia: So, look it online and start seeing the things that I can learn and

29
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.910
Anthony Garcia: I know I just

30
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.200
Anthony Garcia: I was interested, like when I was younger. Now is like

31
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.300
Anthony Garcia: By the time I finished and stuff mean I'm not even really have much time to accomplish much, I guess.

32
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.930
Anthony Garcia: I'm already a pretty

33
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.690
Anthony Garcia: Good tire person.

34
00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you make of people that go back to school and change their careers. So what would you say to me if I said well I'm going to

35
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to drop my license. I'm not going to keep it and I want to go to law school. It's always something I wanted to do.

36
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that. Other side of my brain to sort of this, this kind of have that other piece that doesn't isn't in the gray because everything in psychotherapy is grey grey grey grey grey.

37
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if I did that. What would be your opinion because I'm 52

38
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.550
Anthony Garcia: Me, I'd be like,

39
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.610
Anthony Garcia: For you, it'd be it'd be great, you know, I'd say that's wonderful. You know,

40
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.280
Anthony Garcia: But when I look at myself, you know, I see a lot of

41
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:51.180
Anthony Garcia: hurdles. You know, I don't know, it's just, it's going to be tough for me because I can graduate and pass anything anything I I study I'll pass it.

42
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.890
Anthony Garcia: I learned. I'll pass it.

43
00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:09.060
Anthony Garcia: As far as like, I don't know, I just started thinking about interviews and and all this stuff and having to explain to felonies, you know, and I just, I get discouraged, I guess.

44
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.370
Anthony Garcia: Start thinking about

45
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.950
Anthony Garcia: You know what wasting my time, I guess, and money.

46
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You have just as much right to life satisfaction as anybody else does.

47
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You have just as much right because you have those felon felony record you have it.

48
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And

49
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I could be role playing, getting ready for the, what would be sort of this desensitization to being able to just say, Yeah, but let me just start right now. This is what happened.

50
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is what I learned from it, but I don't know that you have, like, what have you learned from your felonies. What, what did you learn from them. What have you learned from that history.

51
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.250
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. I just don't want to be that kind of person. I just don't want people to see me as a criminal, you know,

52
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.350
Anthony Garcia: I take care of my family, I take care of my daughter. I go to work every day.

53
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.180
Anthony Garcia: Just

54
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.790
Anthony Garcia: I don't want to be looked at as as criminal person, they won't even look at like the good things that I do.

55
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about the things. Tell me about the good thing to do.

56
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.420
Anthony Garcia: All right, help people. I have my friends who got both my friends that I helped out the stimulus, my cousin, that is to be lives.

57
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, hold on, hold on to that.

58
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you use to do. Now you help people. What did you use to do

59
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.980
Anthony Garcia: To help people.

60
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, I'm trying to help you out if someone's going to ask you what is up with those felonies.

61
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to need to know. Right. What did you learn from it. So I'm asking you, you helping people. Now you got it. Tell the truth. What was your worldview. Back then helping people.

62
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.140
Anthony Garcia: I was young, then. All right.

63
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's your age. What did you learn

64
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.250
Anthony Garcia: I learned that

65
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.180
Anthony Garcia: I learned that that's not a lifestyle that I want for myself. I don't want that for my daughter.

66
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a summary, what did you learn that now you help people. How were you before. What were you doing

67
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.740
Anthony Garcia: Hurting people

68
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now we're getting somewhere. All right, hard thing to say, isn't it.

69
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.990
Anthony Garcia: Yeah. Little bit, I guess, well,

70
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, do you like that about you that you hurt people.

71
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.230
Anthony Garcia: Know,

72
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, who's going to want it. You don't want to even say it in here you jump over those things, even with me. Don't want to say him.

73
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You're definitely not going to want to feel them on. I'm Sam. Nothing in an interview and then guess what your whole life.

74
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have this other future this none of this kind of optimism. Let's keep going.

75
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We're you selfish.

76
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.540
Anthony Garcia: very selfish.

77
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me how so I made that up. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE YOU WEREN'T but tell me how you were very selfish and what

78
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.920
Anthony Garcia: I made a lot of people believe like I was helping them even though it really was like benefiting myself.

79
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Me just give me a story.

80
00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that I'll take this money and I'll go over here and I'll do this with it, but really it was a bait and switch and you were doing. The other thing with it.

81
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.370
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, it was mainly with like the drugs and stuff.

82
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.970
Anthony Garcia: Kind of like dealing, I guess.

83
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.160
Anthony Garcia: You know I

84
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.240
Anthony Garcia: Had a lot of people that trusted me and

85
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.340
Anthony Garcia: I broke that trust with pretty much everybody else so

86
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.980
Anthony Garcia: That's, I guess that's what the main trust. I was. I wasn't trust trustworthy.

87
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trustworthy. Okay, and just so I know I want to distinguish the street life sort of Thug life from baby mamas and children. I want to separate family from that street life if we could. So I want to talk about and trustworthiness.

88
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Whereas the story where you misrepresented something to someone that really they trusted you.

89
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.580
Anthony Garcia: I'm

90
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.140
Anthony Garcia: Really like think about like a binary point story. It's been so long since this life.

91
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.480
Anthony Garcia: To me out a lot of people that

92
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.640
Anthony Garcia: trusted me with

93
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.600
Anthony Garcia: Things that

94
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.840
Anthony Garcia: Ended up pretty much using and making up excuses and lying.

95
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:23.910
Anthony Garcia: And

96
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.020
Anthony Garcia: You know, but the thing is about iPad that

97
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:37.500
Anthony Garcia: The thing about is I paid it back, but still it was hard for me to. I didn't tell the truth, I didn't tell

98
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.600
Anthony Garcia: The people that I was on on pills and stuff.

99
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.630
Anthony Garcia: Just kind of like kind of said that the guy lost or stolen.

100
00:10:51.360 --> 00:11:07.770
Anthony Garcia: And I pay you back as soon as I can. I, you know, I'm sorry this happened. I'll make it right. You know, give me some time when I knew in my head that I use that money to buy a bunch of drugs for myself, you know, because I was hurting

101
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, now let's. So I think that said, sort of in this category of

102
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So this dishonesty. I'm on trustworthy self serving that falls a lot under the umbrella of during that timeframe where you were selling and using drugs so right.

103
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.240
Anthony Garcia: That's correct. Okay.

104
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, let's just going to put that right there in that category. So we're just going to say active addiction. Okay.

105
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

106
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:50.250
Anthony Garcia: What it makes it. What makes it harder is because I've always been a trusting person, you can leave your stuff with me, you can

107
00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:02.940
Anthony Garcia: Give me your social security number, your bank account information, you can do all these things, and it'll be safe with me. You know, even like my daughter.

108
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.930
Anthony Garcia: She gave me a box. I don't know what's in it. She hasn't told me. Yes, she told me to hide it.

109
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.820
Anthony Garcia: And I was like, why would you need to hide something, what's in here, which is up, please don't look at it, are looking at

110
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.530
Anthony Garcia: We can look at it together later some my mom leaves or whatever.

111
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.330
Anthony Garcia: I'll show you what's in there.

112
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.790
Anthony Garcia: And I have not looked at so

113
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.390
Anthony Garcia: And I just feel like that's a good characteristic of media.

114
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It is indeed.

115
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:45.210
Anthony Garcia: And she crushed it to my daughter trust mula she trusts me she could talk to me, tell me things. And I don't want to break that so you know

116
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's one on the left side, I've got these kind of split. We've got. How about when she wants to talk to you just now, like you said, she talks to you.

117
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you kind of say, oh, I really, you know, talk to your mom about that or talk to one of your friends. I mean, I don't really want to hear you know like time for that. That what you do. Now if she wants to talk to you about her day at school or what do you tend to do

118
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:18.540
Anthony Garcia: Now it's mostly I'll listen, you know. Listen, I'll get I'll ask your questions. I'll

119
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.840
Anthony Garcia: Try to be more

120
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.430
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. I'm trying to practice like my communications.

121
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you think that you are emotional emotionally available to your daughter.

122
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:49.710
Anthony Garcia: I can't say all the time. Okay. But most of the times yes as long as I'm not having one of my episodes. Okay.

123
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: About how often is that

124
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.830
Anthony Garcia: Lately. Not very often.

125
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.370
Anthony Garcia: Things been very smooth.

126
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: 20% of the time you're not available.

127
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:25.980
Anthony Garcia: I will say maybe let's say 25%

128
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so 75% of the time you are emotionally available. So the things that you're doing currently are. Listen, I help people trustworthy.

129
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And

130
00:14:42.870 --> 00:15:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotionally available. And how about the word reliable, like if you say you're going to show up for work. You say you're going to do clean the dishes or make dinner or you're going to be here and other reliable means if I say I'm going to do this on their

131
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.330
Anthony Garcia: That's something I am I like that's one of my main

132
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Reliable. Hey,

133
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:17.490
Anthony Garcia: Because my dad. My dad always told me all throughout my life growing up. If you say you're going to do something, you better do it.

134
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:32.010
Anthony Garcia: No. And if you can't do it, say you can, you know, like, don't say you can do something and don't do it, too, because for some reason. That's like a pet peeve for my dad like he he can't stand the person that

135
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.690
Anthony Garcia: Says something and don't do it. And I've always been like myself. Also, I can't stand it.

136
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.420
Anthony Garcia: I

137
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:56.220
Anthony Garcia: I don't think I've ever missed a day of work in eight years like taking a day for myself, say, hey, today I'm going to take the day off. You know where the shop still stays open. And I'm not there is no such thing as that.

138
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:03.300
Anthony Garcia: My cousin's done it for three weeks. A couple other people that used to work there has done it.

139
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.360
Anthony Garcia: I've never had a damn. You know, I went to rehab because of the

140
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:22.950
Anthony Garcia: I guess addiction, but like to just say, Hey, I'm going to take a day off for myself. I've never done that. So I'm I work every day, no matter what. Even if I feel bad.

141
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.940
Anthony Garcia: Even from sick, even if I don't have my medication.

142
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.440
Anthony Garcia: So yeah, very reliable.

143
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear that

144
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I wrote, I put reliable. I also put

145
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: industrious. So there's this. I'm assuming you don't just take pride in showing up.

146
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also work.

147
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

148
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right.

149
00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's hit all the shadow side stuff. What else discuss you repulses you embarrasses you ashamed. You write that you did in the past.

150
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring it out.

151
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: In the past, it's not wasn't you. It was just the addict. But what what's the stuff

152
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.080
Anthony Garcia: Took money. That wasn't my

153
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.720
Anthony Garcia: Pen stole stole

154
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.560
OK.

155
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, what do you do

156
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.650
Anthony Garcia: I will still

157
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.820
Anthony Garcia: I won't even take a penny. If it ain't.

158
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, in fact, you won't even accept money when someone offers it to you. Right. Yeah. So there's independence is a real independence to it.

159
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you you're you are you're earning money you're going to just work for your money. Okay.

160
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

161
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

162
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you would have learned how to sort of be reliable be industrious emotionally available trustworthy pay people back help people, all of that. Do you think you would have learned it.

163
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If your life in Korea just was just kept going.

164
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: With that life, you think you would be talking to me today. Do you think that you would have the relationship you do with your daughter. Do you think that you would be these attributes. These character attributes. These positive ones.

165
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:50.220
Anthony Garcia: Um, I probably could have say for sure, but I don't think so.

166
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So look what getting arrested did for you just were just saying right in this isolated conversation of what you learned

167
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: From being held accountable.

168
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.220
Anthony Garcia: I think that it really did help me privately.

169
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:28.290
Anthony Garcia: Because I mean, at first. I mean, I was causing a lot of trouble. And it was minor, minor things a little bit of jail time. Some county attorney didn't really affect me. But when I went to prison and they put me in that cop car and I saw my daughter and

170
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.260
Anthony Garcia: That was the last time I seen her for a while.

171
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.560
Anthony Garcia: It did something to me. I don't know.

172
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.220
Anthony Garcia: It was have that weird feeling like

173
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:51.330
Anthony Garcia: You know I made the worst choice ever. I don't know missing that time with her just feels like I lost something I can't get it back to her.

174
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.660
Yeah.

175
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: How old was she

176
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:06.090
Anthony Garcia: She was just born. So she was, I would say about three months, four months. She's just a little baby.

177
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You looking out the cop car, who was holding her

178
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.040
Anthony Garcia: Robin her mom.

179
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:25.770
Anthony Garcia: And we were just moving sweater kind of change things and do better things, I guess. Finally, get out of there. You know that happened and I would

180
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:34.740
Anthony Garcia: Seem like it made everything worse since then I've never been able to put everything back together.

181
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do it, cause you to be arrested.

182
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.130
Anthony Garcia: assault with a deadly weapon.

183
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's the charge what you do.

184
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.410
Anthony Garcia: got pissed got mad lost my temper.

185
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.260
Anthony Garcia: wasn't able to control myself.

186
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.610
Why don't you read

187
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The description of it. What did you do

188
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.080
Anthony Garcia: Person, buddy.

189
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.160
What you to

190
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.000
Anthony Garcia: Cut them with a pair of scissors on his neck.

191
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard to say.

192
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.520
Anthony Garcia: A little bit. I mean,

193
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:27.300
Anthony Garcia: Before I guess I wouldn't mind, I'd be like, Yeah, I cut this guy's neck off, you don't you don't brag about it. But now it's, I don't know, it's kind of makes me sick that that's who I used to be and I was kind of proud of it, you know.

194
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.320
I'm saying

195
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me how your body's feeling as you talk about the specificity of this

196
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.970
Anthony Garcia: I tell you one thing, my stomach don't feel good at all.

197
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

198
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.370
Anthony Garcia: Oh, getting a little bit kind of, you know, when not feeling that great then

199
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well,

200
00:21:53.310 --> 00:22:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It was some avoidance, not wanting to get to it, not meaning to say what actually was not wanting to sit with the truth of it.

201
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.780
Anthony Garcia: It just, uh, I don't know, I just feel bad that

202
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:23.340
Anthony Garcia: You know, like I could say yeah what great tire guy, but once I said, Yeah, I went to prison because I cut some dudes neck. You know, people are going to, I don't know. They're not going to remember me being a tire guy, they're going to remember me.

203
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.010
Anthony Garcia: Person that hurt somebody on

204
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:35.160
Anthony Garcia: Stolen. I just don't want people to see me as a person that can easily harm you hurt. I don't want people to be afraid of me.

205
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony

206
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you use radical acceptance about the fact that you cut a man's neck right now.

207
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:55.230
Anthony Garcia: I

208
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.570
Anthony Garcia: I guess I can accept that that's who I was then

209
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It happened.

210
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.160
Anthony Garcia: And it's

211
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not

212
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.380
Anthony Garcia: Change it.

213
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Go away from who I am business because the risk of that is what I do is who I am. Can you just radical acceptance isn't what you just did radical acceptances so let's do it again. How can you use radical acceptance. Listen to the words.

214
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I use radical acceptance to accept.

215
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did.

216
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's probably more of those.

217
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:46.380
Anthony Garcia: Know radical, radical acceptance is hard for me, like, I don't know.

218
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.830
Anthony Garcia: I know one thing that I am accepting now is that

219
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.770
Anthony Garcia: My dad's never gonna say that he's proud of me.

220
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

221
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:07.260
Anthony Garcia: Uh huh. And now I'm gonna I'm gonna move, except that you know that

222
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.110
Anthony Garcia: You know, maybe he does just doesn't he won't say he won't

223
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.330
Anthony Garcia: Show it you know

224
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.980
Anthony Garcia: I guess I can't just spend the rest of my life. Wait.

225
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.470
Anthony Garcia: So I'm going to accept that.

226
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good. I like it. That's gonna really serve you well especially living with them.

227
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.960
Anthony Garcia: If it's true. You know, I

228
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.020
Anthony Garcia: But I don't know. I want to feel it. I want to feel it. That's true.

229
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So notice how you're using this discussion to

230
00:24:52.650 --> 00:25:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Derail the discomfort probably of how hard it would be to accept that you hurt people. And this, I got one story. Notice how much easier it is to go to

231
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Us philosophizing about this relationship between you and your dad. This is what's keeping you from seeing a future where you get to have just as much enjoyment and satisfaction as someone

232
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Who doesn't have this history.

233
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.500
Anthony Garcia: I don't know, I just, I

234
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.300
Anthony Garcia: I can. I'm, what I'm thinking. Now, was that

235
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:34.200
Anthony Garcia: Maybe it does have a lot to do with my dad because a lot of the people I heard are males.

236
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.560
Anthony Garcia: Okay, older males, you know,

237
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:45.720
Anthony Garcia: Like I don't hurt women and children and stuff but older males.

238
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.240
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. It just seems like

239
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.120
Anthony Garcia: I'm always something's always

240
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.680
Anthony Garcia: Ross fighting or getting into it so

241
00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting.

242
00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:09.090
Anthony Garcia: Today, even to this day. Now, a lot of the people I argue with or get into fights with are like a little bit older than they're all right, an older

243
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good information. It really is. It's insightful. I think it's going to serve us for for some work down the line.

244
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know how strongly I support this idea of being able to let go of expectation with your father. Yeah, it is. But right now it's about you sitting with the discomfort of facts.

245
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:40.710
Like

246
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.520
Anthony Garcia: My daughter's. A lot of times, my daughter will

247
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.070
Anthony Garcia: Go to him for things

248
00:26:48.240 --> 00:27:04.470
Anthony Garcia: And, you know, I'll ask her. Hey, did you need something to whatever. And she said, No. And then lastly, I know I can hear TALKING ABOUT MY DAD ASKED ME THAT SAME THING THAT I just offer and that hurts me also sometimes, you know, it's like

249
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:17.850
Anthony Garcia: I want to be there for her and I want to be that person that she can come to for like things that she wants to order and stuff, but she just personally never does it

250
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.570
Anthony Garcia: Goes to him, you know,

251
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:29.580
Anthony Garcia: Understand that he raised for practically her whole life pretty much for all life. So that's just the way it is, but

252
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not but

253
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the comma. But just now. It's that first part. That's the part that you don't want to sit with he raised her more years than you.

254
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: He has been there more year. That's the part you don't. So what right in there, comma, but but but now I'm here now I'm here now I'm here now, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Good.

255
00:27:53.310 --> 00:28:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this stuff is the part you don't want to sit with this is the one that turns your stomach. This is the one that keeps you from going to an interview. This is the, what is keeping you from going to school, my opinion.

256
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It is sitting with this shadow side of ourselves.

257
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That when you see it reflected. If someone ever calls you one of these things, or your daughter's treating me like you don't have money reliability or trustworthiness and that's what that looks like when she's not coming to you, you hate it.

258
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.480
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I mean I bad

259
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you do

260
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not about

261
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You she gets to trust you. She wants to you manage yourself. You can't even sit with this history. You can barely it's probably only because I've known you for years at this point.

262
00:28:48.210 --> 00:29:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That you let me push you to say that you had done this, this assault worse choice you I got angry. I mean you danced around that as long as you possibly could. Until you couldn't do it anymore. He had to say.

263
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The Act was this

264
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. These happened.

265
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what radical acceptances we look at the ugly at the dark and we say I did these things. And if you can't say to me.

266
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What you've learned from them about yourself is going to be really hard to do it some stranger in an interview and not that you would ever get to the point that you would describe these details, by the way.

267
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not the point on your line, you'd be afraid I don't ever have to just say what I just kind of did with you. But that's not so it's this, it's being able to sit with the discomfort of the worst parts of yourself.

268
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And still knowing you have every right

269
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To celebrate who you are.

270
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.250
Anthony Garcia: To celebrate

271
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But he won't be able to, I don't think, again, this is my psychological perspective is until you can sit with what facts you write it out and you say,

272
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I did this.

273
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is what I've learned from it.

274
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do it for myself, I could do it because I have looked at the dark side of looked at the things that I'm not proud of, and I know how it has taught me lessons that someone telling me right from wrong couldn't teach me I had to feel it.

275
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a judgment about it and I certainly don't have a judgment about you.

276
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad we have

277
00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The judicial system for a lot of people, it gets some of you to snap. Finally, oh, there's a limit of how much

278
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get away with. I was getting away with a lot. I didn't know there was a woman. I thought I can keep going. For some people it's that

279
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And they finally get the lesson, but I haven't, I haven't heard it yet from you, but I think it's because you haven't sat with these pieces.

280
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think the 12 step talks about making amends about a Tony and telling another the shit.

281
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That y'all have done. Why do you think it's a step.

282
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.550
Anthony Garcia: Because it's necessary.

283
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Necessary and hardest fuck

284
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

285
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.520
Anthony Garcia: I think that's probably why I didn't do too well in the 12 STEP program.

286
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this is stupid. Oh.

287
00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.940
Anthony Garcia: I don't want to be telling nobody what I did.

288
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:17.130
Anthony Garcia: I just, that's, that's, I think that's one of the main reasons why I did because I did like the 12 step meetings, you know, I like to go to the meetings, I can hear people's stories. You know, it's like, that's part of it. But then when the sharing part I just

289
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm watching, I'm watching group.

290
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Here in group you like

291
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.980
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I've always been like to

292
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen in depth.

293
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were not ashamed of what you did.

294
00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead you took healthy responsibility for it.

295
00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be able to talk, it wouldn't own you.

296
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.130
Anthony Garcia: But I was thinking like

297
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.430
Anthony Garcia: It almost feels like

298
00:32:54.810 --> 00:33:02.010
Anthony Garcia: bragging about it. If I'm telling people, I don't. I just don't want people to know that part of me. I don't know.

299
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.910
Anthony Garcia: Now gone you know us. That's not me anymore.

300
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.210
Anthony Garcia: Unless it is still is just

301
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:17.460
Anthony Garcia: Maybe I'm just changing, but I don't want to one day blow up and hurt somebody, again, you know,

302
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So notice that right there.

303
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The anger still there.

304
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.070
Anthony Garcia: And you're still there. Yeah.

305
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't your anger sometimes scare you.

306
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.200
Anthony Garcia: Yo, yeah.

307
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.560
Anthony Garcia: Yeah. Very much so. Because sometimes I don't.

308
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.100
Anthony Garcia: even remember what I'm thinking, you know, just

309
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.260
Anthony Garcia: That's how mad I get

310
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What if, what if the ugly awful truth. The thing that none of us, neither one of us want to look at what if it's that you haven't learned the lesson yet.

311
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that's radical acceptance.

312
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that's what we're doing in therapy. What if it's getting you to that point where you really get

313
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:17.430
Anthony Garcia: I mean, I thought I did. But I guess when you think of when you say it like that, maybe, maybe I have it look like this.

314
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And look, look.

315
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.710
Anthony Garcia: It's kind of hard to deal with.

316
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That well i don't know i i just say I could be wrong. I could be wrong but look what you did earlier. Look what you did. You had an insight you said

317
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this anger that I have towards my dad.dot.dot.we don't know what the dots are dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, I noticed that I kind of am most aggressive to older males.

318
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And where is the deep psychotherapy happening when I do, em, Dr. When I do inner child and I do empty chair, who's in that chair.

319
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.900
Anthony Garcia: Then

320
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We're dealing with now it's your dad. It's, it's Dad.

321
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't about mom. This isn't about sister that isn't about some dude on the street. Some thug dynamic. So you are on to something. So I'm optimistic.

322
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we can't get real at this point. Look at you, your candy all this low dose this stuff that you and I do now, I think is going to stick. There's no impairment

323
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. It's like this is your brain. I think it's going to stick. And I think if we can get to the real letting go of anger and really grieving the loss of not having, you know, the father that you needed. I think if we can do that work.

324
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing. Maybe you're doing it on some level with your dad.

325
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can't fool your brain. You can follow me. You can lie to me. You can you can play any as much as you want to talk to the group.

326
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: intellectualize and say exactly the right thing. It's a beautiful note. Look, my client has inside he draws the connection between but you're going to know if you're a phony inside you're going to know if you still want to fucking kill the man.

327
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel me

328
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and don't do you now. Good.

329
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in here is a waste of your time. We got to keep it real. Every time you can come in every time and say, I basically I have to hold back the impulse to want to punch him every single time I see this man. That's what I want to hear if it's the truth, not what you think. I want to hear.

330
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we need to get at that dynamic and we got to move through it, but we can't move through it unless we're keeping it real.

331
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I want to hear from you. This was

332
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of looking at stuff that maybe wasn't all that pleasant.

333
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you're thinking about

334
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.940
Anthony Garcia: I'm kind of thinking about

335
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.630
Anthony Garcia: I guess you're right. Because I come home, I take a shower.

336
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.190
Anthony Garcia: And

337
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:28.170
Anthony Garcia: I want to go, like, say hi to or something. Say what's up there. But then I don't want to hear him say we're going to have for dinner. What do you want to do guys do for dinner, and it was like almost that question is, like, what are you going to cook for dinner and

338
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.780
Anthony Garcia: I don't, I don't know, I just

339
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.560
It's

340
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.440
Anthony Garcia: Sometimes that trying to avoid it.

341
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.300
Anthony Garcia: Just makes me feel better when I just don't see him that day.

342
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This is heartbreaking. For me, Anthony. Because right there.

343
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If you take, and I think

344
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Please turn scribe for next session we talked about Anthony comes home from a hard day at work and I kind of want to say sup dead. I want to connect with my father.

345
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to have a cash conversation. I want to connect with him as Father, Son, and when he says things like, well, what are we having for dinner I interpreted as, what are you going to cook for me and what emotion. Do you have as soon as you hear that

346
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:15.870
Anthony Garcia: Anger.

347
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it like How fucking dare you ask something of me is it that big.

348
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:32.580
Anthony Garcia: It's pretty big. Yes, I get pretty mad. And then I thought, you know, it's not. And then my dad I go downstairs and my daughter, she has to say something to me, I'm already irritated.

349
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:41.220
Anthony Garcia: So I get kind of like, you know, I like shrugged her up sometimes I'll say something like, leave me alone or something and

350
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.000
Anthony Garcia: I could tell she gets her, you know, because she's smiling.

351
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.000
Anthony Garcia: As much as she can wait to say something nice to me or

352
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:52.710
Anthony Garcia: Talk to me or see me or something and then I act like that and then

353
00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.700
Anthony Garcia: I just heard her feelings and now I'm back in my room.

354
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.080
Anthony Garcia: Like, I don't know, just mixed up because I'm mad.

355
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.250
Anthony Garcia: I'm mad at myself just hurting my daughter and

356
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:06.870
Anthony Garcia: I'm just

357
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.070
Anthony Garcia: Go back out. There you go. Yeah, I'm stuck in this room.

358
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And you avoid and you don't know what to do.

359
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: For exist and push away as feminine information in here that people are using in the workplace. They're changing and transforming relationships.

360
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going out into the world and they're reconnecting with people, but you have decided

361
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have access to it because you think that these things are feminine and you don't want to do it, but you're repeating the pattern. What's your father just did to do you just did to your daughter, your opinion as much as you don't want to do it. There it is.

362
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.600
Anthony Garcia: I know. And the thing about it is, I've been doing it for a while now.

363
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.290
Anthony Garcia: I catch myself sometimes. And

364
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.480
Anthony Garcia: I don't know bugs me. But then I say, am I gonna do it again and the very next day happens again so

365
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: everything other than the way you're doing it. Tell me. Be honest with yourself. If you were to do it any other ways in the way you're doing it.

366
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's too girly and weak.

367
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I give you lots of different ways to speak and to interpret

368
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're downs question.

369
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of different ways. Every week, week after week group individual give you lots of different ways but you end up doing it, you're familiar way right nine out of 10 times really 10 out of 10 times most of the time.

370
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to do that for the rest of your life.

371
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.800
Anthony Garcia: I want to

372
00:40:59.160 --> 00:40:59.400
Anthony Garcia: Do

373
00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So the worst thing that your dad could say to you, if you, if he noticed you started speaking to him differently would be what so worst thing he could say

374
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.440
Anthony Garcia: Me. It's like you're a PC shit.

375
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You believe he thinks you're a piece of shit.

376
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes. So you're already there. Then why don't you just do something different. Try one of the things out and I'm trying to encourage you to experiment with you already thinks you're a piece of shit accept it.

377
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what he does. Anyway, it already goes through that piece of shit filter.

378
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:40.890
Anthony Garcia: Accept it but

379
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to

380
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.720
Anthony Garcia: Know bothers me, it still bothers

381
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not acceptance as

382
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.680
Anthony Garcia: I know, that's why it's hard for me to see the say that I accepted because

383
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: you tolerate it.

384
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.630
Anthony Garcia: So what's a different word if it, if you

385
00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

386
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.320
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I guess I'm tolerating it

387
00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Anthony you grew up with this you grew up with this.

388
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Disconnect with your father.

389
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But august psychoanalysis, I can go on and on. It isn't going to get you a better relationship with your dad. The only way to do it differently is to do it differently.

390
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why the word radical is there it is foreign bizarre uncomfortable. You already are at the worst he already thinks you're a piece of shit.

391
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell

392
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:41.220
Anthony Garcia: Me every week. It feels like I'm making progress. Like, I'm like, things are different.

393
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.150
Anthony Garcia: And then I

394
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:47.850
Anthony Garcia: And then I realize now that I guess I was wrong, you know,

395
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:50.400
Anthony Garcia: You know, I keep

396
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.680
Anthony Garcia: I don't know, like

397
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.220
Anthony Garcia: Making myself believe you know and

398
00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.600
Anthony Garcia: I want it to be real. I don't want it to be just something that I

399
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.900
Anthony Garcia: tell myself that is real.

400
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You believe your mother and father and no one has taught you how to be emotionally available.

401
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.840
Anthony Garcia: I guess I guess I'm not. I don't know how to be that

402
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to be that parent to your daughter and to yourself.

403
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:38.700
Anthony Garcia: That, yes, and then to other people also people that I meet in the future and stuff like that. I want to be able to just be able to at least speak, you know, or say sup stop thinking

404
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:57.810
Anthony Garcia: Like, I don't know, I just think about what I don't want to think about what to say. I want to just know what to say. I want to know how to feel know how to think, I don't have to like try to work my brain to focus on something.

405
00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

406
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.060
For me,

407
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you're busy analyzing anyway. If instead you had different thoughts in your head, you had different tools, your mind can work in a different way. It's going to busy itself. So just busy it in a different place wants you to do something just see how you feel. Okay.

408
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be your dad and I want you to use radical acceptance, which means you have the following thought

409
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I think my dad.

410
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably doesn't respect me probably has some issues. You know, we've got this kind of crummy dynamic

411
00:44:47.130 --> 00:45:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't want to feel crappy right now I want to connect with my dad. That's the only thing you need to do. You can take a deep breath, you cannot respond, all of those skills which you have learned. You may not remember them. But you breathe.

412
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Quiet.

413
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you remember

414
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where I use radical acceptance. It's not about whether I don't like what my dad is doing or I don't like dynamics with my dad and I, that's not it. I except my dad and I are kind of fucked up right now. It just is. You stop battling just put your hands up, metaphorically and resign.

415
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You breathe.

416
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: you resign and feel your body like yeah there's a little bit of freedom in there. I have to keep trying to battle this it is what it is.

417
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not going to change, I can change right now I want to enjoy casual conversation with my dad.

418
00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to review, you're going to breathe, you may want to write it down. I guess I'm pretty sure you're going to forget all these things is, we're gonna do a quick little role play

419
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Brief radically accept the limitations of your father and relationship.

420
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get angry just it's just acceptance, you won't be able to just be like, there it is no surprise to me now is what I grew up with. There it is again, no surprise. Okay.

421
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But I came in this room, wanting to chit chat, hold on to that truth, Anthony. You want to chit chat. You want to talk about today. So it was that

422
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a way to do it. But none of as possible. If you can't hold on.

423
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To yourself in that moment.

424
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That you came in the room, wanting to just have a casual conversation. You don't hold on to that intention.

425
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to get their brief radical acceptance. What is it that I came in the room to do just kind of say, how was your day, hold on to those

426
00:46:50.460 --> 00:47:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Do not interpret me dad's behavior when I say, well, what are we having for dinner. Do not let me repeat it again. Do not interpret

427
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What I mean by that.

428
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: All you gotta do is remember why you came in the room.

429
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You came in the room to have contact with your father to chitchat kind of decompress from the day your dad does. That's his business. It is not your job to interpret what your dad really means, which is, of course, you're a piece of shit, not your job.

430
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Breeze radical acceptance. I came in here for a chit chat, you're going to redirect back to that.

431
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do not do what

432
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.690
Anthony Garcia: You're not

433
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.230
Anthony Garcia: Brave radically accept

434
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.910
Anthony Garcia: Be radically accept and then

435
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then remember you came in there just to make contact. You just came in.

436
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.930
Anthony Garcia: And connect squared as say what's up.

437
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's something very specific. You've got to be on purpose about not doing what is it because you do it automatically. What do you not do when I say, Oh yeah, why don't we have it for dinner.

438
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.560
Anthony Garcia: don't interpret

439
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. It is going to be easier said than done. Ready.

440
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You walk in and asked me a question.

445
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's happening right now.

446
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.430
Anthony Garcia: To me, doesn't matter because I asked you.

447
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, what did you do, I know you're mad. I already got my answer. Did you do

448
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What you love me writing them down. No, but do you have it. Did you do all the steps that I encourage you to do literally seconds ago, or did you go to just mad.

449
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:15.330
Anthony Garcia: Or just went to man, because

450
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.350
Anthony Garcia: Why did he asked me.

451
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:20.340
I just

452
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, what's the thing I said not to do.

453
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpret and did you

454
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:28.260
Yes.

455
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're going to keep doing this relationship, the same exact way later today and tomorrow.

456
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not kidding.

457
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Not your job.

458
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:44.880
Anthony Garcia: I know what I just hate somebody asked me a question asked. I asked them a question.

459

Gwenevere Abriel: So what

460
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:53.700

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.420
Anthony Garcia: Except it

462
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.020

463
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to be angry. You could try what a professional has been doing this for over 20 years

464
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Is inviting which is going to bring peace.

465
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: To your heart to your mind and give you freedom to be okay in the presence of someone

466
00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Like your father.

467
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.780
Anthony Garcia: Okay, somebody asked me for dinner. Am I supposed to tell them. That's not what I asked you.

Gwenevere Abriel: It is good enough doesn't need to change.

474
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it isn't what he wants to focus on brief radically accept hold on to yourself, hold on to what

475
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll show you how to do it in a second. I just I can't even give you the first two things for you pop off. Okay.

Anthony Garcia: He was doing

531
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:45.630
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, you did talk about dinner. Also in there. I guess you mix both of it together.

532
00:56:48.810 --> 00:57:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I talked about my day. Now I don't know your dad well enough to say what we can talk about, Oh my gosh, like, Hey, Dad, what did you do with it that that the time machine and look up, up, up, up. I don't know content that's where you would

533
00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:04.350

Okay.

538
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm probably going to have to go soon. But listen to this Anthony, you want to give your dad a hard time when neither one of you have the social skills.

539
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Around casual conversation, but you get mad at him for it, I get it. The chicken came before the egg. I get it.

540
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:51.480
Anthony Garcia: But it's just because I make an effort to at least try. And I don't think that he even mix the, I mean, this

541
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is radical acceptance right this second.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not going to change just accept that, your life will change once you get that one.

545
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Out because I did, I basically I remembered I just, I want to talk about my day and I can hear what he's saying about dinner, and I heard about Katie and

546
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I am not threatened by dad's dismissive.

547
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: inept inaccessibility

548
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I expect it. I'll be shocked. What a cool day when he's like

549
00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, how's your cousin. How are you, how are you guys doing like you guys ever like butt heads over there. I'll be like, oh,

550
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Question. Oh.

551
00:58:52.380 --> 00:59:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, won't that be nice. I feel like I could handle that surprise, but you're breaking your you're getting yourself offended every day all day every day. There's a way out. And it's accepting that you are good and lovable and an interesting man, despite the fact that he cannot

552
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: See it certainly can't show it.

553
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's a lot to overcome and you and I'll do the psychotherapy to get you there. But on the front end. I want you to kind of have a decent life worth living.

554
00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So just accepted. He doesn't know how to talk to you. You don't know that I talked to him either. So you say anybody interesting job by today.

555
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. I catch you later, I'm thinking about spaghetti, because I'm tired.

556
00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:49.230
Anthony Garcia: See, I wish I could do that, you know, but

557
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm not a genius. I just said spaghetti. I just said anybody dropped by

558
00:59:56.730 --> 01:00:01.140
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, but when it, when the time comes. At the very moment, what is happening.

559
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:11.130
Anthony Garcia: I can't really predict what's going to happen. I just know that a lot of anger comes out, you know, even if I was just happy five minutes.

560
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:22.350
Anthony Garcia: It's just, I don't know, but I keep doing it. I don't know. There's days where I want to just say hell with it. I'm going to go to my room. Close the door. And I want to hear ship nobody

561
01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:31.800
Anthony Garcia: But that's not me. I gotta go. See how people are doing. I want to see you. I want to ask you, how you doing, I want to

562
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.810
Anthony Garcia: See

563
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance just accept it and you just enjoy me and you and pop around just

564
01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to be a happy guy.

565
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.970
Anthony Garcia: I know I just get

566
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.110
Anthony Garcia: scared because

567
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:53.640
Anthony Garcia: I want to, I just want to be able to say that last few years, me and my dad talked

568
01:00:55.290 --> 01:01:03.900
Anthony Garcia: We were able to do a few things together. I mean, I don't remember one damn activity. We've done together, ever. You know, I can remember the

569
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Way your way and we got to go, which was going to get you to going on a hike or some kind of outing your way.

570
01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Or mine.

571
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So what one where you can just continue enjoy being who you are and love him unconditionally anyway.

572
01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.810
Anthony Garcia: I guess your which I guess is your way. But that's the hard way.

573
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it isn't hard. It's on familiar

574
01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:32.700
Anthony Garcia: It's familiar uncomfortable to

575
01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself a break. But it like any habit. It takes more glucose effort to learn something new. It takes effort. And yes, it takes effort.

576
01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But the flip side of this is a Happy. Happy. Anthony when it isn't walking around with a chip on your shoulder waiting for the next time he's insulted and he might hurt someone.

577
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.390
Yes.

578
01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You might really be able to let go of that.

579
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I want that for you. I think you long to be that man that you know you are inside without all this resentment. This is so old. This is sense like five this is old, old, old, old, old stuff.

580
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Go prove me wrong, if I'm so wrong. Do these behavioral experiments, come back and tell me I'm wrong.

581
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't be superficial. It can't be a phony one. It's got to be

582
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

583
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, what's this radical acceptance a look, I got myself offended again because I'm expecting him to love me the way I needed to guy ain't gonna do it. All right. Yeah.

584
01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, I came into just to kind of say, Hey, I'm I haven't really been kind of talking with you the last few days, just say as anybody stopped by

585
01:02:52.950 --> 01:03:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be clunky at first, but it'll get it will get easier radical acceptance. It is doing the opposite of what you've been doing. You've been

586
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hating what is you have been hating it put your hands down and accepted accepted, I have

587
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How come I know that's what your dad's gonna be tomorrow. Give me when you walk outside that rule where it's going to be that

588
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Was gonna be the same thing. You can be pissed off. You let me finish this last piece I believe if you can have a badge that you were every day.

589
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It would say, Dad. You fucked me over and I feel like you were that every day and you let him know. And I want to know, Anthony. If you took that off. Would it be okay if he wasn't reminded every day if he failed you.

590
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.430
Anthony Garcia: Yeah.

591
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take it off for one day and see what happens. I already know he failed you.

592
01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: He knows on an unconscious level. He can't own it because he's not mature enough, but he knows. So just, just so that you can have some joy.

593
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it off.

594
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:18.120
Anthony Garcia: I'm gonna I'm gonna try because I don't want to. I don't want to be doing this same thing to my dog, and that's what I think I've been doing

595
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.160
Yeah.

596
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to have more access to connections with daughter later on when you really get the habit. A healthy romantic relationship, all of that. Once you really get this piece.

597
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing to prove that badge. Just take it off.

598
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on happiness lets him know every day. You screwed me over. Dad, your fault. Look what you did. If you take it off and go ahead and shine and be happy.

599
01:04:54.870 --> 01:05:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're happy and now he's, he might think, oh, I assumed I was a good, good.

600
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, whatever guys delusional. Anyway, so

601
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to be happy.

602
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a thought.

603
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we meet again.

604
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.600
Anthony Garcia: A 22nd.

605
01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll see you at seven.

606
01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Be good to you.

Anthony Garcia: Bye bye.
