Got it.

7
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.130

8
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.580
Isaak: So far I don't feel like sick or anything. I mean, in the morning like before I take my medicine like

9
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.720
Isaak: I'll start to feel kind of like, you know, kind of weird, but then I'm fine, usually

10
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.870
Isaak: But yeah, so other than that things have been pretty good. I've had like I had some friends visit from

11
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.510
Isaak: Like out of state like last weekend stuff. So it's been pretty good.

12
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.010
Shawn Phalen: How long it's gonna take you to taper.

13
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.210
Um,

14
00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:03.450
Isaak: I'm taking it pretty cool because I mean I've only dropped like two milligrams, so I'm probably going to be on this for like a few like I don't know, maybe two. I'm just going down i two milligrams every time.

15
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.240
Shawn Phalen: So,

16
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.790
Isaak: What's going on with the work front anything. Um, well, nothing right now because like I kind of want to

17
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:28.050
Isaak: I kind of want to see how everything goes as I keep going like lower, but you know what I mean, like the tapering or whatever. So, like, as I just, I don't know, I'd be afraid to like

18
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.570
Isaak: Get a job that like I really like and stuff and then like if I tape or an iPad stick and stuff and then just affect like my work ethic and stuff.

19
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.650
Isaak: So, yeah, yeah, I remember we talked about that last yeah

20
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.080
Isaak: Okay, keep tapering yeah you know keep doing that and

21
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.800
Isaak: Yeah, I got a bunch of money saved and

22
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:07.320
Isaak: I'm planning on getting some guitar stuff this weekend because like I've lost a lot of like guitar stuff over the, over the years, like one I sold one for drugs in the past and

23
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:18.990
Isaak: Then I had like an acoustic and stuff. And I got in a car accident and snapped in half. So, yeah, it sucks, but thankfully I have money to kind of

24
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:34.440
Isaak: Get like the things I lost back. Plus, like, I don't know, maybe get a new AMP. And I think that that's gonna be good for me right now because like I really like playing guitars stuff. And whenever I tape or I just need more options, you know, get my mind off things

25
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.630
Shawn Phalen: Still on unemployment.
