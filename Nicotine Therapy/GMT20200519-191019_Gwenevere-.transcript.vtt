Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're alone right now. Right.

32
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you and I already talked about the benefits of you going to residential because it would mean you wouldn't have to be with your father was already in the background.

33
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: When you the moment that you, you had the slip you turn right around and it didn't. I don't remember did it last more than 24 hours. And did you really

34
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.100
Laura Lujan: Want to three hours total

35
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.540
Laura Lujan: Three hours. Yeah.

36
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you thought you talk maybe with your boyfriend. You thought, well, should I tell. Should I not tell. I want to be honest and you made a decision because you were hearing. Let's just run away, right. Like, let's just dip.

37
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But you decided to do it.

38
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Honest, and you reached out to your P. O. And you told him.

39
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't lock you up.

40
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you were trying to get information through text for me. You couldn't write because

41
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't budge.

42
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.520
Laura Lujan: Time and more or less. I wanted to talk my money. I

43
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm glad you did it. I did.

44
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get into that in a second. But I've just I've just sort of laying out a little bit so you can see in front of you right all these

45
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.270
Laura Lujan: My point here.

46
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah right in front of you, just like okay and then you work through the part around. Am I kicked out of the program. What's going to happen, you made your way back into group. And you told people in group that you had slipped. I didn't do it. You did that.

47
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're here again today.

48
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't sound like

49
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.090
Laura Lujan: I haven't seen you since

50
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.780
Laura Lujan: I know that because you canceled that appointment.

51
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't seen you. So a lot is going on. But I wanted, I wanted to finish this thought in the thought is this

52
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Year invalid invested

53
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: In your healing and I can see that. Okay.

54
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it's possible that you're having used got you closer to getting out of that house.

55
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I get it, and sometimes we do things that are always conscious, sometimes we can do them unconsciously, like maybe I'll use the benefit of this. Maybe I'll get closer to moving out.

56
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: From your father's house, so I don't look at it from just you slipped you're kicked out of the program treatment doesn't doesn't look at substance use. That way, if you're any good if you're a clinician, that has any if you've been doing it for a while.

57
00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't look at it like that. It's far more complicated than just you used in your bad you know we don't do that.

58
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

59
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.060

Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on.

67
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That that was the solution because for you to go do that that be the solution there must have been something going on before that.

Laura Lujan: And then I saw her when she they go around.

138
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.330
Laura Lujan: And I saw what

139
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:30.420
Laura Lujan: You just saw you out and seeing that made me realize hey that's not my my speaking right now because I know he's awesome okay that's not my parents because my hands are, you know, even though they're drug addicts or whatever, they're not speaker, they're not they're not in that whole

140
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:39.900
Laura Lujan: Plant. You know what I mean, like, and I realized that even though my dad, you know, my mom's wherever they're so they're not

141
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.340
Laura Lujan: They're doable. Like I can, I can get all i care, you know,

142
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I can handle that. Okay. All right.

143
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.260
Laura Lujan: All right, I can deal with that. I think I believe me, you know,

144
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But wait.

145
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You were that day you were coping and you were adapting

146
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I can see that over strike after strike after strike after strike.

147
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So something that sort of perfect storm of somehow something your dad said that struck that I am intelligent but he's not seeing you as intelligent you felt insulted and then some drama and then to have your step mom basically hand do the needle. I mean,

148
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Back, back

149
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.630
Laura Lujan: My part

150
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.560
Laura Lujan: Yeah, we're

151
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.350
Laura Lujan: not stupid. She knew she doing

152
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.130
Laura Lujan: She knew what you do. I should not. I know I

153
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

154
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:45.180
Laura Lujan: That's the part where it's like she did not my messenger. And out of that like Apple for me.

155
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah proof, maybe, maybe that's useful for you to say, I don't have to question my intuition anymore. She wants me to fail.

156
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You have any doubts left

157
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

158
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.940
Laura Lujan: Hello.

159
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.590
Laura Lujan: Like I said, it was, it was over before we even started.

160
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:24.480
Laura Lujan: Asking my head like, you know, going to be on the run longer. Yeah. And then it was all like, what am I doing stop stop stop stop stop back the train back to find out, like, you know, within like 20 minutes I really like one

161
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.680
Laura Lujan: Young on the run my ass. Awesome. I'll remember to eat the bottom but I can't. I can't sleep in a bed.

162
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.920
Laura Lujan: Back Katrina back and you're and

163
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.570
Laura Lujan: You're not hearing any of that.

164
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.570
Laura Lujan: I, for one, I'm producing you can't when you know you can have you tried to will not be able to. What are you doing right

165
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.160
Laura Lujan: Here.

166
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's

167
00:17:47.310 --> 00:18:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's deconstruct a little bit more. There was some period of time. So you're hanging in there, you're dealing with it. There's all these strikes and then Teresa says you want if you need a fix. And then there's a you summarized it, you kind of went drama.

168
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I exhausted my boy. So let's just say what was the last strike. What really was the last one that you got the efforts.

169
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.570
Laura Lujan: Remember I said no you can't push him.

170
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:25.230
Laura Lujan: So I'm sitting on the right. Okay, well, I can't sit here and then he goes to withdraw withdraw from anything on anything.

171
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:42.150
Laura Lujan: Right, I'm like, you know, there's no NO WHAT YOU'RE YOU HAVE TO BE ON AN INCH OFF. Come on. I mean, I'm not, I'm not much about this. I still like, I mean, I just take a little most of Boston, our team that then, you know, I mean, sure. Yeah, I'll do that. And so long to do that and

172
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:57.660
Laura Lujan: I brought him to take them and I didn't want to hear. That's fine. You know, just whatever. And she just she you so pressuring it's like why why do you care like obviously characters long. We're about is

173
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no, no, no. Laura.

174
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Here back what you just said. You just said she cares for the wrong reasons. Are you sure you want to say that sentence.

175
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.550
Laura Lujan: She doesn't care how to get at a

176
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Map.

177
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.220
Laura Lujan: She doesn't care at all like let's don't like cheese so fake. It's ridiculous like

178
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds honest.

179
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: She's so fake. It's ridiculous. Now that I'm like yeah

180
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.120
Laura Lujan: It's crazy thing I just

181
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.280
Laura Lujan: in disbelief. Honestly, I just didn't understand it. Okay.

182
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Kitty.

183
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.090
Laura Lujan: SO STUPID CAT

184
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

185
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're in it. When we're right in it like this with that craziness with what's going on with Teresa and your dad when you're like this.

186
00:19:46.200 --> 00:20:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't see, as well as when we're like this. Okay, you're like that in your life you're this it's right where we can't focus is so close is happening in the moment and all we can do is just just navigate this thing right in front of us.

187
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When you step back

188
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Like we're doing now, notice how we're laying it out for stepping back from it. We're putting it all out and we're looking at it from hindsight, from a distance.

189
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the privilege of being able to do that because I'm not in it like you are

190
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.800
You did the best year

191
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't make any sense that someone

192
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Could do that to you. It doesn't. And so

193
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The alternative of right now, if you don't go slip, which is what she's pushing because she wants you to fail.

194
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:52.920
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

195
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is go crazy. Now you can either go crazy with your mom or punch her

196
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or hurt yourself.

197
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So look at the choices I either go violent outward or I go violent inward or escape into a substance or I go crazy.

198
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's often. Those are the choices you guys are left with

199
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.930
Laura Lujan: Me. I never thought anyone would be like that.

200
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

201
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome. I watch you guys struggle with these and I wish I could go in there and remind you that there's another way that there's kind of like hands on the hips, there's this defiance. That's a quiet confidence within

202
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that got you to say.

203
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: stop the train. Right. The one that said, Wait, wait, wait, wait.

204
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That one.

205
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: She

206
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: may look like she cares and your dad may look

207
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: On some level, like he cares but these two individuals are unhealthy. From what I can tell, I haven't heard much that's healthy

208
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:16.920
Laura Lujan: Huh.

209
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and it's no it's no compliment to to to a crazy environment that you stay like that you get along fine with a bunch of crazy people. It's not a compliment.

210
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you might be the only sane person in the house.

211
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.100
Laura Lujan: I know I hate me, boy.

212
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:56.280
Laura Lujan: Right. So, for example, as a kid. A lot of my friends would always say, you know, I grew up in a bad environment back in. I'm like, Okay, well, no.

213
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:12.810
Laura Lujan: It doesn't that rule never applied to me like ever like, I mean, my parents. My parents for being, you know, ridiculous mom. My mom like as a kid I used that and my team like I'm learning to do good in school and my reading to read through education, like, and it just

214
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.970
Laura Lujan: As a sudden like I just wish I had that mindset.

215
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

216
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And the unfortunate truth is that even over like overachieving like in psychology that would be sublimation. There's this great word for it, where it gets us motivated that that anger and resentment to not be like this not be like mom means I'm going to overachieve over here.

217
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.820
Laura Lujan: There may be no no longer

218
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.570
Right.

219
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What ends up happening is even this overachieving

220
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It has a downside to

221
00:23:52.170 --> 00:24:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaustion perfectionism rigidity irritability and an inability to connect with people. So as much as we think this is good and that is bad. It's just more complicated than that, that the

222
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:07.800
Laura Lujan: Way the room.

223
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the way down is kind of in the middle.

224
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And when we veer off a little bit. All we do is we come back to center as best we can. And when we veer off.

225
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We come back to center. That's all, that's all we got out of this life there won't be just one

226
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Answer. It's just going to be like

227
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm really off track.

228
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I'm gonna come back here.

229
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And then come back to center.

230
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But what is guiding you what is helping you forward that is at the center of what's going to keep bringing you back.

231
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So why

232
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:50.940
Laura Lujan: On Earth,

233
00:24:51.090 --> 00:25:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Or maybe it's something that you know in yourself. Maybe it's what got you back after 20 minutes right this thing.

234
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, right, what do you know, regardless of what people say about you or around you or try to push you to do. What do you know about yourself that can help keep you focused moving forward.

235
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.530
Laura Lujan: And then

236
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:32.550
Laura Lujan: I know that normally understand my disability. Yes, and I use right and I just kind of turn it into it's not my decision. It is my ability like no one can ever see thing. The way I see me because I'm not, you know,

237
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:40.830
Laura Lujan: So if I, if you're in a crowd or whatever I normally focus on, you know what, I can hear, which

238
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:49.800
Laura Lujan: Isn't a lot. I can tell you that much. But it's what's around me. So, like, I don't know, like my perception or things are different than yours. Yes.

239
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.000
Okay.

240
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: My perception. We like it.

241
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we go underneath that and and and say what might be steering you like you went off for a minute. Right. You you buckled under the pressure of a Teresa's pressure you you came into it.

242
00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To shut her up to stop the craziness right you got her to stop you caved because to confront her. This Teresa person right is to say, You're crazy. That who talks to a to a daughter, like that who I'm in recovery. Why the fuck are you telling me to do this.

243
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's, that's this that's hands on the hips. That's defiance. That's no sane person would tell someone in recovery to get a fix.

244
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.390
Laura Lujan: You go, yeah.

245
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.940
No one would do that wouldn't

246
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That just that's an altered reality. And that's the reality. She's living in

247
00:26:53.070 --> 00:27:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's your perception and that if you perceive something if you get a sense that she's a phony, I believe you, but you need to believe you and hold on tight to it.

248
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and finishing your perception, the subtleties that because of your heart of hearing. Right.

249
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna pick up on things that other people aren't going to pick up on and subtle cues like face or or people's bullshit. You're going to pick up on it before the rest of us are. And it is a gift.

250
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to honor that that's going to get your

251
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's going to get you. You know what I picked up on it quick. I looked around, look at this mess. Look at this guy has passed out. I have a man that loves me and cares about me and he's home sleeping. He cares about me. I just forgot

252
00:27:50.400 --> 00:28:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's all it is is under the pressure of someone that toxic a Teresa, you may have just forgotten your true north, you know, you forgot the direction you're going. You forgot your own perception.

253
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all you forgot. And guess what you remembered right away right away.

254
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.790
Laura Lujan: Yeah, true. I remember was around

255
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.400
Laura Lujan: Our grammar.

256
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

257
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess I feel guilty because I haven't spent enough time asking more questions about what it's like to not be able to barely hear things in a crowd.

258
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Of people. What is it like, oh, I want to know that was that was

259
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:52.980
Laura Lujan: As far as I am, or I mean like with my boyfriend, he does it. He does respect me on the level of, like, you know, he

260
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.980
Laura Lujan: takes the time to care nothing about the whole situation. However, there's one thing he does is where

261
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:06.900
Laura Lujan: You will ever looked at me and he's talking when I brought 50% OF THE TIME HE DOESN'T LOOK AT ME. And it's not like he doesn't have a purpose. He just

262
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.720
Laura Lujan: Is there anything else you know what I mean. And I don't expect him to look at me 24 hours or days or a week or whatever.

263
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:27.780
Laura Lujan: There's, like, you know, certain time. We're having a conversation and he won't face me and we'll be talking to, like, the law or whatever he's doing, you know, whatever, you know, and it doesn't bother me, but like I like internally does you I mean

264
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.370
Laura Lujan: I do

265
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.660
Laura Lujan: It doesn't bother me like

266
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.040
Laura Lujan: Out right like it doesn't. I don't have to say that's like the least of my work, but

267
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Laura. I know you do that with everybody else. I know you compromise for everybody else. But you don't have to do that in here you get to be

268
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Insulted you get to be offended you, you get to say I deserve.

269
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I deserve. It's Kyle right

270
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I want Kyle I want to be able to watch your mouth and your eyes and I want to be able to to look at you when we're talking. It means a lot to me. You don't have to make excuses. You don't have to say.

271
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't I don't deserve this. I put up with so much shit. This is nothing compared to the should I put up with no

272
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Heat. You still have the same rights as everybody else does. You have the right to a preference. You want someone to look at you when they're talking you have that right

273
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:44.910
Laura Lujan: Now,

274
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You have been putting up with a lot and so you know how you were saying earlier in there. This is all connected. You were saying

275
00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

276
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Other people, you know, they make excuses about why they use drugs, but you you used it as a motivator and you got to work and you graduated from school early you knew you didn't want to be like your mother's right

277
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

278
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had such a great thought and it just left the building, it'll come back, though there was a connection between those two things.

279
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.220
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

280
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The connection between oh normal found it.

281
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

282
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've been exposed to so much sort of that toxic environment.

283
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's normalized

284
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

285
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost got it. Wait for it. Normal, normal

286
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Normal. Okay. It means you're going to put up with Kyle's behavior. I don't. I just figured out

287
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.240
Laura Lujan: Everything and everything.

288
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

289
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.960
Laura Lujan: We want to remember, maybe I wouldn't if that was the

290
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.230
Laura Lujan: Case I would have already told him my enough

291
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:08.820
Laura Lujan: Not

292
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Enough, I think.

293
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what you might have said was

294
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm part of hearing. I connect with you.

295
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: More and I can understand more. When I can read lips to it means something to me that you would

296
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that, and Turner and turn toward me when you talk to me it would mean you love me, it would mean you care that I have, I have to work harder. I have to. I'm already working hard, like, show me you care and turn toward me.

297
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are used to putting up with you are used to it, meaning it's normalized for you.

298
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I'm the first person to tell you. You have a right to your preferences. You have a right to your environment.

299
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To accommodate you.

300
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You just did right

301
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:13.800
Yeah.

302
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I figured out. And it's interesting in real time. You notice how I forgot twice in here.

303
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to know why I did that.

304
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I figured it out. You want to know.

305
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.470
Laura Lujan: Hi, man.

306
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't normally do that i can i can

307
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty, pretty complex thoughts. And what I did was I switched the video.

308
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So that your, your face was up here so that I can do my best to try to give you, eye contact. And what ends up happening is my face was huge. And I can see my yappy mouth and like almost like totally

309
00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I got distracted with myself.

310
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.060
I do

311
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But I, but it was interesting to watch that in real time I'd like, look at that. Twice I lost my train of thought.

312
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And all it was was this. It's a pretty basic thought that you're you're toxic environment got normalized. And so you're going to tolerate more, you're not going to be as like upset by it but someone who I'm going to tell you right now, someone that did not grow up.

313
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: With your family of origin.

314
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Are gonna like

315
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't

316
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.460
Laura Lujan: put up with it right

317
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

318
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.520
Laura Lujan: I wouldn't even bother with them. I hear me.

319
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.420
Laura Lujan: Just based on that whole criteria, you know,

320
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe, so just keep that in mind when you think about

321
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I have a right to ask from Kyle What, where do I register where my rights begin where they end

322
00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So check it out with people, maybe not just me other people that you kind of see kind of have put together some some health

323
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your reference standard is a

324
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

325
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa.

326
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:13.860
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

327
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.630
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

328
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: When

329
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get upset.

330
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That means that you've probably put up with 100

331
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Things already so

332
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You really probably need to speak. By then, don't you think because you've given how much you already sort of compensate cope with deal with by the time you actually get angry.

333
00:35:48.690 --> 00:36:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Get sad get nervous get afraid it's probably because it had it has reached such a high point, my goodness, long overdue for you to speak your truth.

334
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.320
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

335
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how I see it.

336
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.630
Laura Lujan: I just don't like to. I'm going to complication of all costs.

337
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.660
Laura Lujan: I know that about myself is not good.

338
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what over time.

339
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're out of here. And you and I have some distance from it and we reflect back and we say, oh boy, that was so hard.

340
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be able to hear what I'm about to say right now, which is

341
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's even intimacy.

342
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: In a confrontation. There's even a connection with someone. There's trust.

343
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That is probably like, like I'm from Planet Mars.

344
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But someday when this is in the past. This is in the past when you feel safe.

345
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To be able to express yourself.

346
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Regularly without fearing confrontation.

347
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You might pick this up again or here this remember this or you won't even know where it came from.

348
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But part of the reasons why people get close to each other is not because they went on a roller coaster.

349
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: had fun at a restaurant that's not where the real intimacy comes from. It's actually, it comes from navigating difficult times together.

350
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about how tight you are with certain people that it's almost like we got through this obstacle together. It isn't that we only had fun together we navigated this challenge. We spoke our truth and we got through it. We were honest, we were genuine

351
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We went through this difficult time together. It isn't just happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy. So although you know you're talking about your boyfriend being exhausted.

352
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you just trust him even more because he was able to do that with you.

353
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.580
Mm hmm.

354
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the same right

355
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To be exhausted to be angry to be scared to be sad. You have the same rights as Kyle has me as everybody else. You have the right to say

356
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Teresa, I can see you're trying to be helpful. This is what help with looks like right now. Right. This defiance.

357
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see you're trying to help me.

358
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what help would look like.

359
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And she comes to five because what that does is that offs out of crazy land.

360
00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Opting out will not. I won't go crazy. I won't hurt myself. I won't cut. I won't kill myself. I won't act out and get violent. I won't go escape into a drug, but I'll tell you what, I'll do see my hands on my hips.

361
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You do this, psychologically, or you can literally stand there with your hands on your hips.

362
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

363
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that Wonder Woman pose and

364
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks like you're trying to help Teresa. Thank you for that. What would be most helpful right now is I think I just need some quiet reflection time

365
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You

366
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.190
Are

367
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter.

368
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What you say you do it again. Why do you have to come up with something new. Yes. Teresa that's that's a, that was a good idea, but I think right now what I'd like is just some some quiet reflection time. I think I might go for a walk. But thank you for your help and off you go.

369
00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to go crazy. You don't have to be violent. You don't have to act out. You don't have to escape. You don't have to hurt yourself. You can have this inner right i know is, and it's in this

370
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I know. I know my perception. I know what I'm feeling. I know this woman doesn't care about me. What kind of crazy person would offer someone who's in recovery a fixed

371
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:22.890
Right.

372
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.540
Laura Lujan: I say after me football, I like

373
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: She matter bagger my

374
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.690
Laura Lujan: In college. Now, of course, you know,

375
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.640
Laura Lujan: I don't like yeah

376
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, not work, but because you're around it day after day minute after minute over you're having to numb yourself to the perception that this is an unhealthy relationship. Your radars down

377
00:40:51.690 --> 00:41:02.970
Laura Lujan: I see what you're saying. Okay, so you're saying like if I was so used to seeing that play out. I was growing up, or whatever it was they wouldn't be that wouldn't be normal, it wouldn't. I wouldn't.

378
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't just

379
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Freaked out and you would have said.

380
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To a counselor at school, a teacher anyone you could get your hands up this place that I'm coming from is sick. It's crazy.

381
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unacceptable.

382
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I know my truth. I know, I know what I know and I need help.

383
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Time after time after time you've had failures of people to help you when you needed it.

384
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.480
Laura Lujan: You're pretty good.

385
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really

386
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty good.

387
00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I wish I could get you out of there. I wish I could get you out. I'm

388
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:52.860
Laura Lujan: Not

389
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.240
Laura Lujan: One of those way it can be worse.

390
00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.060
Laura Lujan: Oh,

391
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Never see it could be worse. I know it could always be worse.

392
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But you slipped and you talked about cutting

393
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How close to worse in. Are you are you really that far away from worse.

394
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.850
Laura Lujan: I was kind of wondering if I find myself.

395
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.590
Laura Lujan: Wanting to do that and that when you meant like

396
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

397
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.690
Laura Lujan: Like my level like that's been doing a really, really.

398
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.000
Laura Lujan: Good, thanks.

399
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's level zero

400
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.140
Yeah.

401
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How often does level zero kind of percolate where it comes up.

402
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:48.960
Laura Lujan: Once

403
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You once a week, how, how far away.

404
00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:58.620
Laura Lujan: Yeah, once we get a little more currently. Now just because of the death of my boyfriend.

405
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:08.490
Laura Lujan: You so I'm just touching on my arm and then 637 or whatever. And that's what we're human, so

406
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, I think we're going to need to focus on how to manage that anniversary, I think, respectfully, being able to be with that anniversary without hurting yourself might be a good idea. What do you think

407
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:26.400
Laura Lujan: I agree.

408
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:27.360

435
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So the parts that you liked you like Tom and it sounds like a little bit of a little bit of is that sentimentality.

Laura Lujan: Yeah.

437
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:39.570

438
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.870
Laura Lujan: Touch of innocent. Yeah. Okay. What, uh,

439
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. So we've got calm sentimental innocence.

440
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And also with people sharing stories, right.

441
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:54.150
Yeah.

442
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:56.880
Laura Lujan: Of like a good

443
00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.040
Laura Lujan: Reflection

444
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.820
Laura Lujan: But I think, you know, just remember every time I mean he actually okay what

445
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.910
Laura Lujan: Can I do with it. You actually probably okay.

446
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to be worried about his thing. Okay, where you didn't have to do that with TJ.

447
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:27.840
Laura Lujan: Yeah, because he did

448
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.250
Laura Lujan: Like

449
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.690
Laura Lujan: Yeah, right. And you

450
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:35.700
Laura Lujan: Know my wife and

451
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it's never been romantic with you and TJ.

452
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.600
You're

453
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:51.210
Laura Lujan: Okay. No, I won't, I won't point, the first time ever anything ever happened or whatever. I told him to hear it at all. Don't ever hit

454
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:53.970
Laura Lujan: Or miss Beth, write it

455
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.140
Laura Lujan: On

456
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.680
Laura Lujan: A Monday morning, come on you. I do not need an extent of it like

457
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:00.810
Laura Lujan: No money.

458
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe homework if you want to is spending time thinking about exactly what you want, not the compromised version because notice you're going to default to the compromised version well Kyle's okay with it. That's a compromised version.

459
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:27.480
Laura Lujan: Okay, that's not the common good. Is that right, I want to go, no matter what.

460
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.200
Laura Lujan: Okay, it was more or less. I just didn't want. I didn't think anything

461
00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.340
Laura Lujan: I think you misunderstood that so that's

462
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I got it.

463
00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I got it. So if you're not going to be distracted.

464
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: By whether he's okay or not okay at any given time because

465
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.760
Laura Lujan: I don't want him to come. Yeah. Alright.

466
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got, what do you want to do there. What time who all, do you want there. And do you want some piece of really intentionally

467
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying this person, this person, this person, I'd like you to bring this or I'd like you to read this or share this or draw this or paint this or do this. Let's do this.

468
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To really structure.

469
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A ceremony and ritual that maybe builds on itself, each year.

470
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.190
Laura Lujan: Okay.

471
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll make I'll make something up just to

472
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.600
Laura Lujan: Remind me I'm, I'm a good way to like

473
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:25.680
Laura Lujan: Handle actually

474
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to, I'll just to brainstorm.

475
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you learned on YouTube or something. How to Make a candle and everyone brought

476
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.980
Laura Lujan: everything it can to make it today.

477
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you really. Oh, that's weird. So everybody brings you know

478
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, everybody brings an object, no larger than you know the size of your palm or no larger than the size of your thumb. Everyone bring an object that represents their relationship with him or some special memory and we all make this candle together.

479
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.210
Laura Lujan: Hmm.

480
00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an idea. So you

481
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Come up with something where

482
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: A you're planning, which takes your mind right it channels the mine. It gives you something to focus on and it's right where it needs to be, which is the love.

483
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: For him right it's it's channel. It's not pretending like it's not happening. It's happening. June 3 is gonna happen. It's gonna happen.

484
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So instead, radical acceptance, we say this is going to happen this anniversary is I can either get in to it or I can pretend like it's not happening.

485
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So this time, you can do it intentionally call people text people let them know what you want and maybe they'll join in, or maybe they'll have a great idea that you yeah I thought of.

486
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:52.770
Laura Lujan: Yeah.

487
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Something to think about to focus your mind. Okay.

488
00:49:59.550 --> 00:49:59.790
Laura Lujan: I

489
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Have

490
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.720
Laura Lujan: A candle making it so

491
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes that makes the back of my hair is kind of stand up just

492
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit.

493
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, that's cool. So let's schedule another time to meet. Oh, the thing I never I didn't quite finish a thought I had started earlier and that is

494
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're waiting to maybe for a residential level of care. I would like to see you more frequently. Can you tell your PO that you're going to do that.

495
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.750
Okay.

496
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

497
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:43.920
Laura Lujan: Yeah, he might actually let that a lot. And probably you know it might help me a little bit too.

498
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.750
Laura Lujan: Because then I know he didn't

499
00:50:48.810 --> 00:51:01.050
