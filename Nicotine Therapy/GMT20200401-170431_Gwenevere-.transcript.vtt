Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was on the 24th. You said

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're kind of a right

58
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're asked a question, you'll answer it. But other than that, you're kind of

59
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.560
Bianca Garcia: Sorry, I don't try to be like, I just, I don't know. I mean, I'm you so, so can I get used to it.

60
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's okay. So, but that might just be part of how the context of our relationship or group or therapy or treatment. I don't know. Are you

68
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I don't know what's coming over me. This is the part I was curious about it. Don't know what's coming over me, but I believe my chronic anxiety and panic.

69
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: chronic anxiety.

70
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.240
And panic.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Panic, panic.

72
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.700
Bianca Garcia: Opinion. I said this to or or you're reading a text or

73
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a text. Oh.

74
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't remember texting that

75
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:16.710
Bianca Garcia: Not what I was trying to remember because I was even going to look up the one you said from the other one. When I told you that the inspection, because I was like, wait.

76
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.310
Bianca Garcia: But yeah, no. Yeah. Now I remember now that i but i was gonna look it up myself to

77
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: God, if you're in front of me I can always pull that up. So I want to talk about that a little bit. Because it, it

78
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It surprised me.

79
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So it says, um, I don't know what's coming over me. I believe my chronic anxiety and panic disorder is taking over.

80
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And I need to do something about it.

81
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Call virtual clinic to reschedule now grammar aside, I don't know what that last part means, but I wanted. Can we talk a little bit about chronic anxiety.

82
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's a new piece about you that I don't know anything about. Tell me about chronic anxiety and let me just listen for a while. Let me understand that is

83
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.110
Bianca Garcia: Well, I have been diagnosed with it. I'm

84
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:22.710
Bianca Garcia: And sometimes it's really hard to manage like I worry too much and I'm I feel

85
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:33.720
Bianca Garcia: I feel good that I have a therapy. Now, or I don't know if I have it. But I mean, at least I have some kind of therapy. I guess if it's not really for that. It's fine. But, I mean, I

86
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:49.080
Bianca Garcia: I feel like I at least I have that, but um yeah I know sometimes it's, it's, it's, um, it's pretty bad and I i cannot control it in and I like start to panic.

87
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're glad that you have some therapy in your life. Although you wonder whether it's treating the anxiety and you notice that there are times you try to control it, but you can't

88
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:24.150
Bianca Garcia: Right, I mean I been really good about it. But that one time, I couldn't. And like I usually do like briefings or I'll walk or you know whatever there's other stuff. You're supposed to do for it.

89
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.460
Bianca Garcia: And I have and I have been really good. And I also have like

90
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:37.290
Bianca Garcia: Take as needed. When that happens, so I have to do that if if I can't control it, but

91
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:37.920
Bianca Garcia: Take

92
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I speak as needed. I take as needed. What

93
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, is

94
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.530
Bianca Garcia: There are their pencils.

95
00:11:47.640 --> 00:12:00.300
Bianca Garcia: First she was giving me liras pans and then since it got so bad and I got a problem and and then I just take one of the 0.2 point five.

96
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So, on this day somewhere around the 24th that day. Did you take the point five that day.

97
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, did you experience some relief from racing heart and racing thoughts do you get some relief.

98
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:30.150
Bianca Garcia: Absolutely, yes. Yes, and I believe that was the day that I missed appointment with you the 24th. Correct.

99
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure I can look too far away, we can cross check that. But let's just stay clinically discussing what's going on. Okay.

100
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

101
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you take point five, or did you end up taking more than that.

102
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.880
Bianca Garcia: No, that's good.

103
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: On that day, what time of day did you end up taking lorazepam

104
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

105
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:12.630
Bianca Garcia: I'm not sure. I remember you don't remember. No, it was like it was an evening that's sure

106
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.020
Oh,

107
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:26.970
Bianca Garcia: No, I don't think it was evening. It goes like afternoon. I'm not too sure. I really don't like to take it if I don't have to because it does like give you like a little memory loss.

108
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:44.040
Bianca Garcia: And that's why I can't take more than the one I just do the one and even after that. I'm like the gum, like, oh, you know, I don't like it like that, it's only for that and and it does, it gives you like some kind of memory loss that I don't like that at all. OK.

109
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So the side effect of memory loss is a deterrent for you.

110
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.490
Bianca Garcia: Is it. I'm sorry, what

111
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm deterrent. So I'll rephrase

112
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Sup negative side effect.

113
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.550
Yeah.

114
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.020
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

115
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see what was going on that day. Let's see if we can deconstruct it a little bit.

116
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'll take a peek at the calendar. So the 24th is Tuesday.

117
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So it looks like a Monday evening I reach out to you. It looks like. And I say, Good evening, trying to confirm tomorrow's individual therapy, we must add something up at one o'clock. Yeah. So we had something on a Tuesday.

118
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The 24th. Yeah.

119
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you hit said yes it's confirmed little thumbs up. Thank you. And then, um, I don't hear from you all. Tuesday.

120
00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it's a no show. See, I don't know what's going on. Something's going on and I hear from you. I have to translate the time because it's two hours later here for four o'clock, your time.

121
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see what you. Hello. Right. I'm so I'm so sorry I didn't even notice the time

122
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Usually my alarm goes off, even though I did confirm yesterday.

123
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you didn't notice the time. So let's just see what might have been going on on a Tuesday. What do you think was going on on that Tuesday. Do you think

124
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.890
Bianca Garcia: I was super busy. I'm always busy. I have two kids and

125
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, right.

126
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:49.470
Bianca Garcia: But there is like my phone sometimes is so weird. Like, I will have it for a certain time, it won't go up and it's I've had that happen before

127
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:58.110
Bianca Garcia: And I don't know, and I'm making sure it's like, you know, because you have to put like the day or like every Monday or Friday or, you know, starting AM, PM and

128
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:13.140
Bianca Garcia: And I'm just like, I don't understand why that happened that day. But I also like panicked off of it. And I think that's when I was like oh my gosh I missed it. And I felt it from it. So I think that's part of it.

129
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So as we continue to talk. It might have been

130
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I missed the appointment and maybe that is what you think you said you panicked off of it off of the missed appointment. So I'm guessing.

131
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That you had made some meaning out of the missed appointment. So I want to spend a little bit of time with that right there.

132
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the same meaning for everyone but you did something with it. I'm curious to know what what the thoughts were

133
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back in time and try and picture that moment when you realize I miss my appointment, even though I confirm with her last night. Let me into some of the thoughts that you had when you realized you missed the appointment.

134
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.370
Bianca Garcia: Was definitely like oh man and

135
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:16.290
Bianca Garcia: Then that's when I started like worrying so much and I was like, no, because I I'm usually really good with you guys like I've only missed, like the one deployment Friday. And then I went to Monday group.

136
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.040
Bianca Garcia: That was inspection and not once with you.

137
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's let me interrupt you for just a second. So what you're doing is you're talking about you.

138
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:26.640
Bianca Garcia: Think

139
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This is okay. You're doing great. This is really this is different. You're talking about

140
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Who you are with bright heart that's not quite what I'm asking.

141
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want you to go back in time and the moment you realized, oh my gosh, doing more of those. That's a thought, Oh, my gosh.

142
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to know what your next thought was, and then the next one and kind of want to get into what it was like to be you for those early minutes before

143
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You how did you say you panicked off of it. So I want to know what kind of deconstructing the events of thinking, feeling

144
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Expectation beliefs, all of that. I want to kind of slow time down and hear about it. So let's see if it can go back, you realize it. Right. Do you remember where you were like,

145
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You realize it was four o'clock or something like, do you remember what what brought you snapped you to what time it was

146
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.370
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

147
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.470
Bianca Garcia: I think it was in my room. And when I grabbed my phone for my charger.

148
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:43.170
Bianca Garcia: I saw the time and I just started thinking, like, oh, shoot in not in that word either

149
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:55.650
Bianca Garcia: And I was like, I was like, what is she gonna think I was like, Oh man, I don't like to miss. And I just, I don't know. That's what I felt like I just

150
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay right there so you know you. I have a you can cuss all you want. I that is not a problem.

151
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You can use the F bombs. You can use any words you want. I know I look like I'm not ready to hear those words, it is not a problem. You never have to edit.

152
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

153
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is probably Oh shit, right.

154
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.630
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

155
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And then so let's slow time down. Let's look at this one. What will she think, am I the sheet or is like, am I the sheet.

156
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so I'm going to see. So what will what will when think now.

157
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain came up with a couple of scenarios.

158
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel that in you asked. I wonder what she'll think and you answered yourself, why did you answer yourself. When will probably think what

159
00:19:52.170 --> 00:20:10.800
Bianca Garcia: I don't know, but I thought that I just knew that I had to tell you, you know what, I was like, what, why, I guess, and then how I felt. And I told you the whole kind of thing or the anxiety and and I just hope you would understand when I when I said that

160
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.210
And hope for understanding

161
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had to tell me this panic stuff.

162
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.900
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

163
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but there was a period of time before the panic off of it. There was moments before it happened. You weren't in a panic space as you were going about your day you're taking care of the kids, you were doing a thing, right.

164
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the cause. Let's just play with this a little bit. Do you think the cause is what I think specifically going or

165
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it what will my treatment program thing or will I not get my Medicaid for some people, there's a connection between the therapy and their medication and it's a big scary thing like well what if they

166
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't give it to me or something. What if I'm kicked out of the program like it's more than just what is this

167
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When think it's more like what is my treatment program going to do some for some people it's that

168
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's less about art my personality, per se, or my genus or something and more about what privilege or what may be taken away the fear response of what might happen because I forgot my appointment. So let's rewind a little bit and see and fine tune what this was. What will she think

169
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only what will she think. But what was the thought of what might happen, but it. What was your fear around what might happen that you missed the appointment.

170
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.860
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I think, yeah, definitely the whole program.

171
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:08.970
Bianca Garcia: But obviously, you do have a lot of authority over a song that I i would think, because you do, you know, say, hey, can you send the prescription or will we see you

172
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:23.670
Bianca Garcia: And stuff. So maybe I thought that. But definitely, I thought about you more than the program was like, oh, like I hope she's not bad, or, you know, I was like, shoot. Like, I don't know. Okay.

173
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay there. You're doing great.

174
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's mad. Now let me ask you something. Have you

175
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's accurate or not that that less is matters less than when you have been watching in group or in individual therapy.

176
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you seen me be mad.

177
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.800
Bianca Garcia: No matter mad, I'm what I seen

178
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.870
Bianca Garcia: Just more like where you would be like, Oh, no, you can't miss you. You have to stay here. You, you can't go to work. You need to stay here.

179
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. You can't go to work.

180
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

181
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:23.790
Bianca Garcia: Not like a mad tone. But of course, more like, you know, more like I don't know how to say it, but like where you're like, more sturdy on them or like or you're like No, like cap or whatever. I don't know how to express that, but not like Matt. The more you know you know what I mean.

182
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.520
Bianca Garcia: It's more of a look

183
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to use your wording now because I think we're getting somewhere with this.

184
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh.

185
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The actual words. I know, as far as words go. I've never uttered. You can't go to work I dance around it a little bit more right i'm i'm kind of tricky.

186
00:23:48.300 --> 00:24:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'll, I'll talk about the value of employment are all say, so it was important for you to go to work and I'll say things like that, but I never said you have to stay and you can't go to work quite phrase things quite like that because it's

187
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.420
Bianca Garcia: My motive. Yeah.

188
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.400
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, definitely. But

189
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:13.710
Bianca Garcia: In a way, like that. The guy said, and group. He's like, I have to go to work and you're like, well, you have to stay here and he just left, but I was like you know it.

190
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:28.830
Bianca Garcia: It was from the work and all that. But you weren't mean or anything like that. But that's, that's, I was like, Oh, man. Like obviously she wants us to keep be consistent and stuff like this happens. I didn't think it would be okay. I mean, you know,

191
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we stay right in there. We will, we won't go into too much dispute around what I said.

192
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this you ran into some very you ran in your in a very unique setting because that is that's a pretty unique one that I won't even come close to

193
00:24:46.740 --> 00:25:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: As the typical way for me to actually say something more like this is a difficult choice, the expectation is that you stay here for the duration. That's a typical way I talk. I can't really say stay. I can say the expectation is that you remain here for the duration.

194
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Are you said a lot. Yeah.

195
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.060
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

196
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I dance around it a bit because I really don't have. I'm not God. I'm not right. I all I'm doing is saying this was the commitment and

197
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There will be a consequence. Now, the consequence part I don't talk much about that's very delicate. That's a really a really special kind of conversation and it isn't always appropriate to happen in a group setting.

198
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.530
Bianca Garcia: It's just, it doesn't

199
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't fly very well. But what's really important that I'm hearing today is what Bianca heard was stay

200
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.720
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, that's how I think. Yeah.

201
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And that's what I care about that, even though I dance around. I've got all these fancy talk

202
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what I do. BIANCA heard in an authoritative tone in a firm tone. You need to stay here.

203
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though I didn't say it. That's how it felt. And that's what I'm interested in. So I've got to kind of be aware of that and be sensitive to it.

204
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: About how I come across, because I need to check in with you and say, how are you hearing

205
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What I think I'm inviting or I'm setting up a contingency or doing something else. It might not land. The way I intended it, I might wanted it to have been more like easy breezy, but you might be hearing it like she's for real.

206
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This is like the she means business and this is black and white and I better do it. So I've got to be really careful.

207
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You

208
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:46.500
Bianca Garcia: Know, yeah, I'm not trying to be disrespectful or any offend you in any way, but

209
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I guess the summary. So do you think right now I'm offended.

210
00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:13.080
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I don't know. I just don't want you to think that I just I that's, that was my perspective and you know your perspective is your reality. So I didn't feel like you're like that but i knew that i mean i know that it obviously it program would have to be someone you know

211
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:26.610
Bianca Garcia: You were you have to be like that, in a way, but I don't think it's offensive to other people. I don't, I don't think you have to like, you know, I think it's good that we know that we have to be on it, you know.

212
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with you beyond

213
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.900
Just us

214
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, watch what happened.

215
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This big feeling happen for you. What will she think I don't want her mad at me and then you know what happened.

216
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: A PANIC. So my question to you is going to rewind even further back, go back in time. Go back to five years ago, go back to 10 years go back 20

217
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Trains try to think back to the earliest time where you were afraid of what an authority figure with think of you see if you can go back and picture an important story, maybe the most intense time. That was the case or the earliest age. What do you think

218
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.630
Bianca Garcia: Well, I've had

219
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:50.760
Bianca Garcia: Always obviously had some scares with like authorities figured like I i don't like to be around already because like, like, you know, I try to be as good as possible to avoid that. But I mean obviously I've had run ins and I guess maybe I just, I don't know why.

220
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: you're realizing

221
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.310
Bianca Garcia: So, yeah.

222
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Monica. Let your therapist do that part.

223
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So I tried to be as good as that's that's sort of let's sort of philosophizing for a second. I'm really, I'm asking you to pull up a memory.

224
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In your working just pull one out. The first thing that came to mind when I asked you that what was one of the memories that came up, hmm, I'm listening to what Glenn is saying.

225
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I just thought of this. What was the first first image, you got when I brought that up.

226
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:35.340
Bianca Garcia: When you said already, I, I ran. We thought about it. This is a long time ago, but I thought about my ankle monitor person.

227
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:45.840
Bianca Garcia: And and this was it like how like eight years ago or something. But yeah, that's what I thought about because

228
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:59.850
Bianca Garcia: I had missed one of my things that I didn't know if it was like, because you had to do like you had to go do like your job and then you're counseling or blah, blah, blah. And I missed something. And she threw me in jail.

229
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, ouch. Yes, so you, you probably had some sort of supervision, you probably had some sort of

230
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: pre trial release supervision or something and you were asked to do community service and you're asked to be on this ankle monitor and you got to report it this time and drug screens and all that kind of stuff. Right.

231
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:39.780
Bianca Garcia: And I don't know about all the junk foods. I just know I was, I lived in Santa Fe. And I do have to do time of there and then I had to do time in MTC when I was in NBC they wanted to release me, but I have no family or friends and

232
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:50.940
Bianca Garcia: I met this girl in jail and her son lived in this house and I moved there in a week later I found my own place here in Albuquerque. But I had to reside in Albuquerque on the ankle bracelet.

233
00:30:51.540 --> 00:31:00.690
Bianca Garcia: Because I was, I was actually finalizing my probation. So I had to do a few months up here in Albuquerque. So I had to like live up here and

234
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:18.780
Bianca Garcia: Work up here and I've always lived in Santa Fe. So yeah, that's what happened. But no, it was nothing about john screens and stuff like that. But maybe I had to after because I don't know. I don't remember the race. It was exactly but remember that memory of authority.

235
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like you were on

236
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Ankle monitoring during a probation period and you had requirements is about a year ago was about eight years ago and you violated was a VoIP or picked up on a VoIP brought in custody. How many hours or days. Did you have to stay in jail.

237
00:31:45.960 --> 00:32:02.820
Bianca Garcia: No, I went in, actually, to see the medical monitor person. And she's like, Oh, this lady said you missed. And I'm like, oh, we rescheduled I didn't know it was like big deal, but they were such as is there oh my god like especially appear there like so mean.

238
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:18.240
Bianca Garcia: And yeah, and she took me from the probate from the ankle monitors offers acting. They're calling tracker. I remember something like that. And yeah, they me and some other girl had got in, but I don't remember how long it was

239
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:29.100
Bianca Garcia: Really. Yeah, no, I think it was like a few days, I think, I don't know, I think it was, though.

240
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:43.830
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I don't even have good memory as it is and and yeah I don't remember exact time how long it was, but I would have to ask

241
00:32:46.170 --> 00:33:02.730
Bianca Garcia: My, my, my boyfriend to see if you remember, because he was there with me at that time. And he has he's sometimes we has like some things that I forget, or he forgets. And then we put together. Oh, yeah. But right now I do not know exactly how long it was

242
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.220
Bianca Garcia: I know for sure. I think it was a few few days. Oh, but

243
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How old is your oldest child.

244
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.490
Bianca Garcia: She is 12 oh yeah

245
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to take care of any kids. You're more than welcome to because sometimes we gotta keep them entertained.

246
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:47.610
Bianca Garcia: But yeah, she she they'd like to like sleeping now that there's no school, so she's, she's the smallest one. She was my second smallest but she likes to come in here and watch TV or, you know, let's make some food. But I said, Hold on one second.

247
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm

248
00:33:52.980 --> 00:34:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: At the time, and he didn't have any family or friends like, I'm sure. Do you see so confusing.

249
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:06.930
Bianca Garcia: For no i did i have my oldest my 12 year old, she was there she was. She was little she was like one or two but

250
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:12.510
Bianca Garcia: She was not with me. She was with my mom. And then she went with her dad after because he had to move up here with

251
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:26.100
Bianca Garcia: Us together while I was there, so she was like gramma DAD, AND THEN SHE HAD TO COME WITH HIM. SO DON'T KNOW, I HAD HER. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE nobody up here like no friends, no family. Oh buddy up. Everybody was insanity.

252
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.950
Bianca Garcia: And they wouldn't let me go to sign up on equal basically said here.

253
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.570
Bianca Garcia: So I yeah

254
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the crime. Do the time right like that like you didn't hear you got to pay or like not very nice. Okay, so here we are, you're

255
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on probation. You're on the ankle monitor you're on some sort of supervision status, you're making you stand on her feet, you have to work and live there. Your boyfriend moves. Does your little one come with you eventually and live there. All three of you together and

256
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:11.160
Bianca Garcia: Yes. Yes. Yeah. Once I got out one week later I I just did one week with the with my friends sudden, I found a place at we all came here. Yeah, okay.

257
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's interesting the

258
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The memory of how many days you were in there. Yeah.

259
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:21.510
Bianca Garcia: Do you

260
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember anything about how you felt while you were in there.

261
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Are your stays in custody all kind of lumped together like there none of them really are distinguished from each other.

262
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they do you know that we're distinguished because if I'm not saying something that makes any sense. I gotta, I gotta come up with a better way to say it.

263
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:51.420
Bianca Garcia: But I didn't do me like if I could tell like they just all the same to me or

264
00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let me let me come at it from a different way. How long all put together. Have you been in custody into office.

265
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.590
Bianca Garcia: All together.

266
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:09.570
Bianca Garcia: All together. Oh, shoot. I don't know. I mean, I've done like

267
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just try just try

268
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It all together, as if there was no time out in between all together. I've spent in jail.

269
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.880
Bianca Garcia: Under opera, but I don't know, maybe like a year.

270
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:38.880
Bianca Garcia: I don't know. That's just what I think I don't know because I've done like one day or then or a week here and there. I mean, before I used it was like that. Like, like, and now I don't try to be like that.

271
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:50.370
Bianca Garcia: But yeah, I didn't like it was like that for a while. Like, and it was always for for like fees, like, oh, you owe a fee. And I'm like, oh, like, yeah, stuff like that.

272
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: The edge.

273
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Charges themselves, where they possession related where they

274
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:11.250
Bianca Garcia: Know they were always like like war, it feels like, oh, you have to pay this or traffic stuff like you have to pay this. It's always something that had to pay and I wasn't able to because they started charging you all kinds, like they pay they want you to pay a lot

275
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.050
Bianca Garcia: For dumb stuff and it was always like warnings are

276
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:29.040
Bianca Garcia: Because of the fees that I owe from like traffic violations or suspended license or just stuff like that but that one was for probation. So that was like a major one

277
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that one for what was the offense there.

278
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.520
Bianca Garcia: Um, I think it was a dW by

279
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.170
Bianca Garcia: And I was like 24 you think

280
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:45.990
Bianca Garcia: Or no, yeah, it was from up here in Albuquerque. That's what it was a DWI.

281
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had other GWS

282
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.880
Know, okay.

283
00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:00.600
Bianca Garcia: No, I'm not. I don't even like to drink. I was just young and dumb.

284
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there any memories of being in jail that you relive or they intrude into your dream life.

285
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:26.820
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I think sometimes di like I like have like fear over like I'm like I don't want it. Like, I don't want to be like that. And I think I spent enough time.

286
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:33.780
Bianca Garcia: That I'm like no, I can't go back so i think i do i i think i theory in my dreams.

287
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:49.110
Bianca Garcia: I don't have like a specific dream, but I know I've had like sometimes you don't even remember your dreams, but I know that I have had like fears over a

288
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And when was your diagnosis about panic disorder.

289
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.520
Bianca Garcia: Um, I think it was like last year.

290
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:26.640
Bianca Garcia: I just, I was, I was in treating I didn't really know until I was like, maybe I need to go see a psychiatrist or something over the worthiness and

291
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:48.540
Bianca Garcia: You know, like the constant, I guess just worrying and overthinking so I did in that. And it's actually helped a lot more. Sometimes I do like that time. Like, I'm like, oh man, and and i don't like to be liked out because I don't want to worry about it. Like, I don't want to feel like I have

292
00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:55.710
Bianca Garcia: Well, I guess everybody has a consequence, but I don't want it to be like where I'm all like I jacked up that much, you know,

293
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So worry for everyone is different constant thinking is different.

294
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you constantly thinking about what are you worrying about I'd like to hear the thought, this is what I'm thinking. I kept thinking this, what did you keep thinking

295
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.910
Bianca Garcia: I'm usually

296
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:39.630
Bianca Garcia: Is it's just like life in general, things are. I don't know, just like, Oh, we have to hurt the guy here, or, oh, they need to. I need to do this for the kids and are getting ready. I don't know. It's just little things. It could be little things that could be everything. It's just

297
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.450
Bianca Garcia: It gets everything

298
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check in on how you're doing. Now pay attention to a little scanner, your body now sort of turn in even taking in information with your eyes and your ears right you can see this video you can hear this video.

299
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been maybe trying to answer my questions, but we haven't been paying much attention to how your body's feeling and you do a little scan and see, see if there's anything tight.

300
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Any sort of energy shift anything tapping rattling twitching anything going on just remove it from the feet.

301
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Ankle calves knees thighs to your seat bones, where it meets the seat up your back and your gut, your stomach, your chest pain tension to the hands to the arms, pay attention to the shoulders and the neck.

302
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune into the breath.

303
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Scanning scanning upwards further into the neck into the jaw.

304
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the eyes and the forehead.

305
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice when we do that, scan. What do you notice about you.

306
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.290
Bianca Garcia: I was moving my hands a lot

307
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, is that right, okay.

308
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.570
Bianca Garcia: Well, like I was like I was like, sure. I think

309
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So my guess is

310
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Since there's a bit of an association to an authority figure and the negative consequence was that you could be put in jail. That's not what this is.

311
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's, well we can know it logically and our irrational mind the limbic system.

312
00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Has a different imprint of having not followed a rule we think is a rule.

313
00:42:52.920 --> 00:43:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's different in here and that's that's the thing, your body, your, your mind and body might remember it as if I might go back to jail.

314
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, logically, you're like, No, this is this. I'm not on probation. That's not what's going on, but the memory itself is imprinted with that kind of intensity that kind of threat response.

315
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That your freedom might be taken away by miss this meeting. It could be that what's being activated is a reliving of that what you just described. And I don't know if it's this one.

316
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This one, eight years ago, or if it's other ones, or if it's sort of this blending of a bunch of them are there's other stuff that we have yet to learn

317
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.090
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I agree.

318
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a reliving of it as if I could.

319
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It does it feel like the dial on worry over I miss an appointment with Glenn doesn't match.

320
00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The mistake.

321
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, does the amount of worry that you give it match. I just forgot. Does it match.

322
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is the worry too high or the worry, not enough to the missed appointment. Like where would you, how would you sort of write that.

323
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.800
Bianca Garcia: Probably a bit higher.

324
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What's a bit higher.

325
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The worry the worries higher than

326
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:24.390
Bianca Garcia: Then the, I don't know, like, whatever you said if it matches. I think it would be

327
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I want to know what you what you heard, though, so the worry is higher than what

328
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:40.560
Bianca Garcia: I think you said of, I don't know. I don't know. I thought maybe you thought you said of like the bit like the missing appointment. Yes. Yeah.

329
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:41.790
That's it.

330
00:44:43.260 --> 00:45:00.540
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, so I would think that uh yeah I'm always worried. I'm like, I gotta make sure I gotta get there. You know, I don't want to miss. And I know it's not the gel part. I just know that. I mean, I don't want to be like terminated or, you know, yeah, I worry about that. Yeah.

331
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.370
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

332
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.100
Bianca Garcia: Got one not have my meds, you know,

333
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go that's typically what it is that this even though I'm not prescribing it's dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, it's not too far removed from

334
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I need to comply with this so that this medication gets ordered that. And so then I end up looking like a probation officer.

335
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, the problem with that. Bianca, and I get it. Believe me, I do. Um, I hope we can get past that part. And I'll tell you why you're not going to want to trust me.

336
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.330
Bianca Garcia: If

337
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You're afraid of me, you will most, most people once they really get that you know how you said earlier you said something like this. You said

338
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this isn't really therapy is for my substance users. This is absolutely psychotherapy. I'm a licensed therapist.

339
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't spend all my time talking about the medicine or the buprenorphine. I want to know about childhood trauma. I spend most with most clients. I'm spending. I'm doing em, Dr. We're doing inner child work.

340
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're absolutely addressing depression, anxiety, we're addressing grief, we're addressing interpersonal communication, we're doing that in here. But if you're afraid.

341
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't open up if we can't be right. I mean, it will work. If you're so afraid. So you and I got a fun. We're going to have to find our way.

342
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Where

343
00:46:39.480 --> 00:47:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can relax into trusting that I care about you. This is not about me waiting for a gotcha. It's not that I'm not waiting for you to make a mistake, and then I gotcha. I'm not those those ankle monitor people I'm someone who I asked questions so that I can be of service to you.

344
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say I have a panic disorder. I have an anxiety disorder. I want to rewind and understand. Hmm, wonder where it came from. She must have come up with this way of approaching the world for a reason. I wonder what it was. And I kind of want to go there and figure it out with you.

345
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not to get the gotcha now.

346
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: My authority is in it somewhere else in group, you'll see it.

347
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: In protecting the doctors time you'll see it in protecting boundaries with clients, you'll hear me say we can't tell people how to live their life. Let's make sure we're only sharing stories, some kind of keeping safety for everyone also doing it.

348
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if one person shows up and says, hey, listen, I'm going to bounce after 15 minutes. How would you guys feel

349
00:47:52.950 --> 00:48:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had to get a babysitter, and you had to spend your last $25 on data and make sure you stay for this meeting. How are you going to feel when this guy has to balance out in and out. What he wants to

350
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.080
Yeah.

351
00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be pissed off.

352
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.150
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I didn't see that point. But I'm actually that's a really good point.

353
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:20.430
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, definitely. But also, I kind of felt like, I'm like, oh, they have, I mean I it's kind of hard to balance work and

354
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:27.300
Bianca Garcia: And these this is this is tense. I think this is like an intense group, you know, the individual groups and

355
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:35.550
Bianca Garcia: But I think it's really awesome because it also helps a lot in if obviously we're here because we need it. So we have to

356
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:49.590
Bianca Garcia: Give our time and not like you said, leave whenever just because he has other stuff. Yeah, you're right. I totally agree. I wouldn't agree with it neither, but I didn't agree with it at first because I didn't see it that way but

357
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.400
Bianca Garcia: I do

358
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.260
Bianca Garcia: See a different way now. Yeah.

359
00:48:53.040 --> 00:49:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So these appointments are at a particular time, like there are set, here's a group. Here's a group. Here's a group. Everybody knows when they are. I don't change group times very often. This is very rare once in

360
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Three years I'm changing this Friday thing. Hmm. So basically, it's always the same 99.9% of the time very predictable.

361
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So one way to think about it is right heart health didn't go into who I don't even know the person who you're thinking of I've since forgotten it. If you reminded me I could probably remember but I don't remember.

362
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But I didn't go into this person's life and knock on his door and say, hey, listen, I know you're working, but can you not go to work today and show up to my services.

363
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What he did or she did don't know who it was. They came to us and said, I will put aside for an hour, what I'm doing, whether it's work childcare cooking sleeping and I will attend your services at these set times. And what happened, I think, is he or she didn't do that.

364
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.780
Bianca Garcia: Mm hmm.

365
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We were set we didn't interrupt there. Otherwise, you know, their work life or whatever.

366
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.480
Bianca Garcia: Right, yeah.

367
00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's the difference. We have it already scheduled

368
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Attend those things. You made a commitment to it you meaning people in the

369
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:11.760
Bianca Garcia: Commitment.

370
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To the best of your ability. Here's the thing. We're human. We make mistakes I make them every day, make them all the time. I have a right to apologize. I have a right to explain myself. I have a right to forgive myself when I make a mistake and I make them every day.

371
00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:29.700
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

372
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a right to make mistakes to to forget things to oversleep to be overworked, you know, tired, hungry you do to just like everybody else.

373
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:45.660
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

374
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's bring today to a close and Bianca, I want you to see if you can

375
00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice about how you were with me today that might have been just a little bit different than how you've been with me in the past. Do you notice any difference about yourself and what. What is that difference

376
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.630
Bianca Garcia: If it goes explaining myself more

377
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

378
00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:22.440
Bianca Garcia: I think I have. But no, I don't know, what do you see

379
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

380
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you were sharing more like he will you described him explaining myself more

381
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, yeah, I think you were, I would ask you a question and

382
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You would give a general response. And then I would ask, I'm looking for specifics and I noticed, I don't think you wanted, or were comfortable or could remember. I can't tell what it is, but I don't

383
00:51:52.890 --> 00:52:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how am I, but I think it was really useful for us to address this authority piece to to get at trust like

384
00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:03.750
Bianca Garcia: Well, how many

385
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Press this lady if she's, she's going to bounce me out of here.

386
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.010
Bianca Garcia: No. Yeah.

387
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way you're going to trust me, if you're always in the back of your mind thinking I'm one or two mistakes away from being kicked out.

388
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:20.100
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

389
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that isn't how this program works, it isn't.

390
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you here. I want you working on the goals that you want to achieve.

391
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's working through the panic piece if I get more hours of the day where I'm in a relaxed body and I have more confidence than that's progress.

392
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to be worried the whole time. I don't want to tell this lady something so she uses it against me kicks me out of here, you're just wasting your time. If you're doing that, right. So our relationship was at the forefront.

393
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Of today. And I think we need to keep it there until you can really say.

394
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to do A, B, and C in order to trust you and we make that happen. I think we're going to have to keep working on report and developing trust. I already trust you.

395
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But I still look like a threat because I might be the one holding your medication from you. So there's still this this distance that we've got to overcome, and I think we'll get there because you're not the first person to go through this

396
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.100
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

397
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I think. Yeah.

398
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you name it, the better the more you can say, well, you know what, Glenn, I want to tell you some stuff, but I don't want you to judge me or I want to tell you some stuff about it but

399
00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: First let's let's send a message to Dr. Solomon about my medicine. Let's do that first. You might say that to me, I'll say, Oh, yeah. Great. Let me do that.

400
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it's out of the way. Or you might say, Okay, I've been here working with you and I've consistently attended individual therapy and groups for a month.

401
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like to know, let's move that prescription to every two weeks, so that you can relax more and it's not this constant question of will. I have it will I have it will I have it.

402
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That is very reasonable. In fact, that's what we normally do. But there's been a little, a little bump. That's all. Just a little bump, and we're going to get right back on track. But all of that.

403
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear. I can hear pretty much anything except that you want to kill me or something.

404
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're planning on killing someone else, including you, then I've got to take action. I've got to protect you. I've got it. You know, check myself and whoever this is but otherwise Bianca, you can you can just do you in here.

405
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:41.370
Bianca Garcia: Okay, and

406
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You can let it fly, and I'm not going to get offended. I won't make it about me. This is going to be about what is going on, either in here that's getting in the way of you doing the deep, meaningful work and we did a little bit of that today so

407
00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me make sure I turn to my program here and I turned to my little slack message and I messaged your doctor and you have Dr element right

408
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:05.550
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

409
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to just say,

410
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:15.240
Bianca Garcia: He is. That's a good relief I feel really

411
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. I'm so glad I'm sorry you had to sit with that fear for so long. No, no, no, no.

412
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:26.310
Bianca Garcia: Thank you.

413
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to feel comfortable. Alright, so we got beyond us here today. And when's your next service. When's the next thing. Are you coming in on Thursday.

So they're touching base so your next service, let's set up another time for us. Let's go over to April. See what we got.
