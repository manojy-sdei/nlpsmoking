00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.330
Bethany Shadid: Hey,

3
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what was it like in virtual clinic. Was it busy in there.

4
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, come on.

5
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.240
Bethany Shadid: I don't

6
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.790
Bethany Shadid: Know what happens the first guy.

7
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.010
Bethany Shadid: Didn't know how to check me in or something. He couldn't figure it out.

8
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.190
Bethany Shadid: Sent me to somebody else.

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.220
Bethany Shadid: And then I was talking to that person. And then all sudden the audio cut out

10
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:04.380
Bethany Shadid: And I saw him trying to unmute me and stuff and and for the longest time, he just kept looking at me and I couldn't hear him, you know, like

11
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.590
Bethany Shadid: Like, I can't hear you. You know,

12
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.680
Bethany Shadid: So finally, he switched over to texting. He's like, Are you sure you can't hear like. Yes. Can you just tell me

13
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.360
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

14
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe he's new I noticed

15
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: When they were just saying his name that I didn't recognize the name

16
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.010
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

17
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway.

18
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're starting to get a little, you know, little roller coaster.

19
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this week. What's it been like for you.

20
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.620
Bethany Shadid: It's been a bit rough. Okay, I'm definitely having a hard time

21
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.470
Bethany Shadid: With everything coming up. Um, I

22
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:13.110
Bethany Shadid: Kind of had a bit of distress moments, thinking about having to go back to work and the immediate feeling of panic and I'm not ready.

23
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.900
Bethany Shadid: This isn't a good time, you know, and

24
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.240
Bethany Shadid: Had to

25
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.250
Bethany Shadid: Calm down after that so

26
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.650
Bethany Shadid: And and a lot of issues with the sleepiness, the

27
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.630
Bethany Shadid: Zoning

28
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.410
Bethany Shadid: Movie. You know, I'm more aware of it.

29
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just check on some of these pieces.

30
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking about having to go to work. And where's that pressure coming from. Is that from you. You have a set deadline for yourself.

31
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.440
Bethany Shadid: No, um, I got a call from the human resources, lady. Okay. I didn't answer.

32
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.350
Bethany Shadid: Me a message.

33
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:24.300
Bethany Shadid: And said, Hey, how you doing just wanting to know, you know how everything's coming with your license. Now I know they have access. It's a public record. They can go look up and see if my license is active.

34
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And right

35
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.310
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I don't know what's going on there. But a friend of mine that's still working there said, I wonder, I was wondering what was going on.

36
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.820
Bethany Shadid: She said they were talking about you this week. And so the apprehension of quitting.

37
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I was

38
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.010
Bethany Shadid: Was the trigger. I think

39
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's about quitting the pulmonary job.

40
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay. So, but you've already told them.

41
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's left to quit. Tell me what the pieces that's distressing for you.

42
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.350
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I haven't told

43
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I had it in my head. You were here.

44
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh hey, I got you. All right.

45
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.670
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, just stay out of work.

46
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

47
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.790
Bethany Shadid: Pirlo

48
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

49
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.860
Bethany Shadid: I just said, Okay, I'll, I'll be on furlough circle.

50
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.060
Bethany Shadid: Now that

51
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.960
Bethany Shadid: They're going to call and say, Okay, it's time to come back. I have to say.

52
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.860
No.

53
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you want to focus there. You want to focus on reading for that.

54
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.000
Bethany Shadid: No, actually.

55
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

56
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.230
Bethany Shadid: Through it, it's not so much telling them, I'm very comfortable with that.

57
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.650
Bethany Shadid: Okay. It was thinking about

58
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:57.030
Bethany Shadid: Having to start the new job. Okay. Um, and that I've kind of been able

59
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.180
Bethany Shadid: To give myself a lot of

60
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.790
Bethany Shadid: What do you call it.

61
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.150
Bethany Shadid: Sorry. People text, I'm

62
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.260
Bethany Shadid: A lot of room to work through some of the things that we're working through right now.

63
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:32.760
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. And that seems very difficult to do and starting a new job too. So I think that's where the panic Canaan. I've got to talk to people, but, you know, like, getting back to my responsibilities and work in that whole thing.

64
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.370
Bethany Shadid: Um, was more of the distress, so

65
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So well if that's the case.

66
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You

67
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We can certainly put the particular technique on hold. Now the fact that it's busy.

68
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing its hold on.

69
00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.970
Bethany Shadid: Your bio

70
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Harm that was

71
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that it might be busy in the unconscious messing with the very, like, what if it's the reason why

72
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The other workplace, aside from you are with some toxic people. But why the experience was so deeply personal and emotionally activating. So on one hand, I hear you. And we can do full stop. If anything, you know about me. I'm going to go with your lead.

73
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We can we'll shift gears. We can do light and fluffy. We can get. We can do whatever you want. But I also want to throw out the opposite, which is what if it means we're doing it and you might actually go to work.

74
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Still be around toxic people because they're all around.

75
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were not as activated.

76
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So it might also be the opposite effect. So I get the apprehension.

77
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But

78
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now those that's that that part of your own work. And that's because we're starting to

79
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You brought up you know this this trauma history and we've been doing some direct work with the am Dr.

80
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony

81
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You could. What is it that's coming up. Like, what are we talking about right now.

82
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.470
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

83
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.590
Bethany Shadid: So,

84
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.470
Bethany Shadid: Um,

85
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.300
Bethany Shadid: I was listening to a sermon.

86
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.290
Uh huh.

87
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:49.740
Bethany Shadid: And there was one part of it that really stuck out to me, which was the guy was talking about lions.

88
00:07:51.210 --> 00:08:02.910
Bethany Shadid: Lions in captivity versus lions in the wild. And they they noticed that lions in the wild have inflamed adrenal glands.

89
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:14.220
Bethany Shadid: And their life expectancy is 10 to 15 years, whereas a lion in captivity lives much longer.

90
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:30.780
Bethany Shadid: And the stress, you know, on somebody's life expectancy realizing that for the majority of my life, I've kind of been running it a high stress level was pretty

91
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.500
Bethany Shadid: Hit. Hit home and then

92
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.280
Bethany Shadid: I had a video doctor's appointment with the GI doctor

93
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:57.900
Bethany Shadid: And I told her all about this genetic disorder that I, you know, probably have and want to get tested for. And the reason that God's you know

94
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:10.050
Bethany Shadid: Was a priority being the kidney stones, but you know my liver WAS INFLAMED at the ER visit, which is why I got this consult

95
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:26.400
Bethany Shadid: And so she pretty much goes, Well, I actually, I don't know anything about that. I've never heard of that, but we should get an MRI of your liver and it's probably just this and the visit was tops five minutes.

96
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not the doctor, you're going to work with. I hope

97
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And not it.

98
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.010
Bethany Shadid: Was like, all right.

99
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.820
Bethany Shadid: You know, and just got off and I think I was really dealing with

100
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.720
Bethany Shadid: I'm not being heard. I'm not being understood

101
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, I see it.

102
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.130
Bethany Shadid: And then, um,

103
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.890
Bethany Shadid: I was reading some more so because I am a medical professional

104
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:07.020
Bethany Shadid: I'm able to read more about this genetic disorder that I need to get tested for and there's a whole part of it.

105
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:16.800
Bethany Shadid: You know, and understanding the genetic components and how high levels of stress and cortisol.

106
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.380
Bethany Shadid: Yep, and activate these, you know, negative gene.

107
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.410
Bethany Shadid: So anyway, it was kind of a rough thinking about how

108
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.570
Bethany Shadid: All that stress played in has played into my health.

109
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.670
Bethany Shadid: Um,

110
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.030
Bethany Shadid: And really like

111
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.970
Bethany Shadid: Feeling like I don't have somebody that's taking that

112
00:10:52.110 --> 00:11:01.680
Bethany Shadid: Interest in saying yes to get you tested. Yes, we need to do this, I hear you, you know,

113
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.160
Bethany Shadid: Frustrating so

114
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.990
Bethany Shadid: Just got really exhausted. This week I'm

115
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.070
Bethany Shadid: Trying to be kind to myself.

116
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.320
Bethany Shadid: Um,

117
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.570
Bethany Shadid: And

118
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.970
Bethany Shadid: The other wonderful part of all of this.

119
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:37.710
Bethany Shadid: Is that Saturday night I got together with some friends like two friends and my friend's husband and found out

120
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:45.990
Bethany Shadid: I'm random. I don't even know how we got started on the subject, but I found out that

121
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.020
Bethany Shadid: My friend and her husband.

122
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.670
Bethany Shadid: Their daughter her stepdaughter

123
00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:04.500
Bethany Shadid: They recently found out that she had been abused by her grandfather, his father.

124
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.160
Bethany Shadid: From age 12 to like 17

125
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.230
Bethany Shadid: Know,

126
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:31.650
Bethany Shadid: He's kind of this macho guy and you can tell he's had some counseling, but he doesn't really like get all of the psychological, emotional impact of that kind of abuse. So it was it was a little bit

127
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:49.140
Bethany Shadid: jarring listening to their whole situation and how they're dealing with it and everything he I know because I opened up and shared. I said, Whoa, you know, I'm I was abused as well.

128
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:56.070
Bethany Shadid: And he asked about if I told my, my parents.

129
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.080
Bethany Shadid: Because his daughter never said anything. And she told him later when it all came out.

130
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:11.760
Bethany Shadid: The reason she didn't say anything is because he threatened to kill everybody if she told

131
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:20.700
Bethany Shadid: And he goes, I just don't get it, you know. He's like, I just don't get it, you know, and, and we all were trying to

132
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:49.800
Bethany Shadid: You know, explain how she's a child. She's surviving in her head, you know, she was manipulated and so it was like bringing up so much stuff and then him and his earnest need to want to understand was like GRILLING ME ABOUT, LIKE, WHY I DIDN'T TELL more and you know it was like really jarring.

133
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.270
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so kind of all this wonderful stuff.

134
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Bethany.

135
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, when you saw how his psychological mindedness was

136
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.690
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

137
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the top and he's not there. He's somewhere in here.

138
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When you decided

139
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To put this very precious thing you have, which is your truth, your history in his hands. Tell me the logic about that.

140
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:35.160
Bethany Shadid: I wanted to help him understand his daughter and honestly I didn't

141
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:47.580
Bethany Shadid: The telling him that I been i'd also been an abuse victim. That wasn't the vulnerable part for me it was when

142
00:14:48.780 --> 00:15:06.660
Bethany Shadid: He was asking me all the other questions that I could have and probably should have opted out, you know, okay, I gave him this little piece so that he would listen to me and it was the from there.

143
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you

144
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Back, right, what would have been ideal. Here's the piece. What did you want to hear from him that that would have been ideal.

145
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.760
Bethany Shadid: I'm like, oh wow and and

146
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:32.190
Bethany Shadid: I guess I don't know because when I say that, then I'm like, Well, that really does open everything up for him to ask more questions.

147
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.720
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so

148
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.030
Bethany Shadid: That doesn't really make sense.

149
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Which brings us back to

150
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: protecting yourself, which has to do with your reading people you didn't know you could see it. He has he can

151
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the jargon. He knows some words.

152
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted him to understand

153
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.220
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

154
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe that's it.

155
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:04.890
Yeah.

156
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you're not in the role of nurse right there.

157
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.220
Right.

158
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's Play that out the other way. What if you had honored that initial gut feeling.

159
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not in the role of helper. I have no one to protect right now there is nothing to sacrifice. I don't need to. I'm just going to sit

160
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What would that scenario happened like

161
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.970
Bethany Shadid: Would have been fine.

162
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.640
Bethany Shadid: Because my friend did it, she just sat there and listen.

163
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.440
Bethany Shadid: To the other

164
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:53.760
Yeah.

165
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.130
Bethany Shadid: But

166
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.110
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

167
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted to help

168
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.340
Yeah.

169
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.010
Bethany Shadid: You know, to, I think I with my two friends that were there.

170
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.770
Bethany Shadid: I trust them.

171
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:18.150
Bethany Shadid: And I think that trust transferred over to her husband when

172
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.050
Bethany Shadid: I don't know him like that, you know,

173
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.510
Bethany Shadid: So I think that may have been part of it is low.

174
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and you still have every right to say, well,

175
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm done talking about it. Like, you still have a right to pull the reins.

176
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: At any point. And so this since that is what happened.

177
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Meeting that moment, which is a common one is, that's my limit. I just reached it

178
00:17:52.140 --> 00:18:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember thinking I've reached it and now I just right he's he's inundating you with with, right, like you said, he has the intentions were great. He was trying to have compassion and understanding for his. I think it's a stepdaughter maybe

179
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.490
Bethany Shadid: Is

180
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: There. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.610
Bethany Shadid: But

182
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You you found

183
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember, was it that hot core. What was it that registered first

184
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.850
Bethany Shadid: I stopped breathing.

185
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.680
Bethany Shadid: I started holding my breath.

186
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:35.820
Bethany Shadid: Okay, and it was when he started asking me a bunch of questions about my parents, my dad what you know.

187
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.750
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I was like,

188
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.990
Bethany Shadid: Okay go there.

189
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

190
00:18:49.200 --> 00:19:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say that this is going to happen again that your good intentions will be the lead in the chill the want to help, but maybe you'll already sort of helping and then you'll register. I think I offered more than what I have to give that might happen, right.

191
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's

192
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of that. So if you already assume. Well, let me check in and see if it's true. Do you have a right to change your mind.

193
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:18.840
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

194
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean it genuinely like the real question.

195
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.040
Bethany Shadid: As yeah I

196
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.370
Bethany Shadid: Have never thought about it that way because

197
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:35.310
Bethany Shadid: So much I want to help. And part of that I know is people

198
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.890
Bethany Shadid: Open up when they

199
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:55.770
Bethany Shadid: When I share my side of it. So it's like giving a piece so they feel comfortable to you know, open up and I don't think I've ever realized that in doing that. I'm not just giving them a little to feel comfortable. I'm

200
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:02.190
Bethany Shadid: giving them some vulnerability will open the door to that. Yeah.

201
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just take that one piece. And I wrote this down the language you use just now. It's really important so

202
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I opened up. Let's keep it really simple. I opened up and disclosed so that he couldn't you just said it so he could open up

203
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the thing.

204
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What he did was he asked questions.

205
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that right in that moment.

206
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll track it back to more original signals but right in there.

207
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your intention was to create a safe space so that he could open up

208
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But he's not so you could redirect it if you wanted to. Yeah.

209
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I share my story with people at times.

210
00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To create this sort of openness for other people to open up. What is this been like for you as a father to have a daughter that went through this

211
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see

212
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:06.930
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

213
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I shared nothing. Now I want you to go back to the therapist role.

214
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: For a moment.

215
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Does anyone know my stories. No. No one does.

216
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes therapists do in order to develop rapport and trust. But then what do you think's going to happen.

217
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens, I'll tell you is this. They yes they yes but

218
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but yours wasn't like this, right, so then it's well yours wasn't as bad or or there's all lot of questions that come in and maybe I haven't limited maybe my boundaries here and I don't want. That's not clinically relevant. So what I needed to do in order to establish rapport.

219
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't explained to the person to the client.

220
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys get to do with it whatever you want to. You have that right and you want you're curious, let's say the person is curious, and they want to know more about it.

221
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I am trustworthy.

222
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Without disclosure

223
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:19.650
Yeah.

224
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

225
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope and maybe I'm not, but I'm I think

226
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:46.110
Bethany Shadid: Am I, yeah, ya know, and it's making me think too that I was assuming I needed to open up to you know make him feel comfortable, but that's just what I've always done that doesn't mean that that's required. Every time you know

227
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So take a look in here. So there's a little bit of distance. So I'm carrying sort of your role of the helper for a moment what I did to earn your trust.

228
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.590
Bethany Shadid: Listen, genuinely

229
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.140
Bethany Shadid: Really listen. Yeah.

230
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

231
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: In that in that moment when you're hearing this man share right

232
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What could you have done to really show him that you could could really hold space for his confusion.

233
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is limited insight and having this happen right under his nose.

234
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.260
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, being active listener and

235
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.030
Bethany Shadid: You know,

236
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.260
Bethany Shadid: all that that entails, I will

237
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.710
Bethany Shadid: You know that

238
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.660
Bethany Shadid: Actively showing him. I'm interested and

239
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.800
Bethany Shadid: Concerned and empathetic and without having to share my piece.

240
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But for a moment. I want you to think about what you could have actually said

241
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

242
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's actually easier to describe the phenomenon than it is to actually do it. So how would that sound.

243
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.530
Bethany Shadid: So he was like

244
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.910
Bethany Shadid: I knew he was in a big lawsuit issue with his parents.

245
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:26.970
Bethany Shadid: But I didn't know what it was about. So when he said I was like oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. I had no idea that that was the reason

246
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:40.560
Bethany Shadid: That's awful. Um, you know, how are you guys doing and then shared a little bit and I said you know well myself but instead I could have

247
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.840
Bethany Shadid: It could have gone more like

248
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.860
Bethany Shadid: I can't, I'm in shock as

249
00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:02.670
Bethany Shadid: I can't even imagine what I would feel like if I was in your shoes and

250
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.880
Bethany Shadid: How this must have just

251
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.820
Bethany Shadid: Totally disrupted.

252
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.700
Bethany Shadid: You know your worlds. How are you doing,

253
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing you asking a question right, if we're going to listen. So you did some some validation. You did the I imagine I imagine this.

254
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Something happened though right around the tone of. I can't imagine being in your shoes, something happened and I'm not quite sure what what that was. Do you know

255
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:49.650
Bethany Shadid: I think it was, I can imagine, right, but not wanting to

256
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.540
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, sugar,

257
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I picked up on it sounded a little phony just a tiny smidgeon I'm glad you

258
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: said something about it. So here's the trick.

259
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The trick is destiny.

260
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to lie. I never lie. I don't lie. I don't lie to you guys.

261
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't lie. There's no miss. No, there's nothing you have to lie about you give what you have to give

262
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it is the school one one more truth. One more. Below that, even the truth as in I can't

263
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine from the perspective of the person who has it kind of happening in their own home. Tell me now what you like. Is there some signs that you didn't see now that's quite a view. But notice how I put it in a direction that's on like that is on

264
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it happen under your nose.

265
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

266
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That now you can see the signs, maybe you didn't then um

267
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, part of it, do you not get john Fred that her life that right cuz

268
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:25.350
Bethany Shadid: No. That makes sense unless I was putting on a I was using a phrase a common phrase, instead of being

269
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.310
Bethany Shadid: honest with myself about what I was saying.

270
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

271
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you can turn, man. Yeah.

272
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you you can imagine even worse.

273
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

274
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, we don't want to ask, why would any therapist really be asking for you to not just do you but just giving what you have to give. So let's try it again. Let's do it again. See if you can make. And I noticed you were looking away because remember it's harder when we're making contacts.

275
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just but you can break contact here and there.

276
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because it's harder.

277
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: First, start with, if I am. What's this guy's name again.

278
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Ronnie. If I'm running.

279
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we do you actually care about me.

280
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you care.

281
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

282
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you start there. Then you serve. Right. You start care.

283
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.040
Bethany Shadid: Gosh, Ronnie.

284
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.250
Bethany Shadid: I just feel so bad for you.

285
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:54.360
Bethany Shadid: I, I can't imagine the emotional load you're dealing with

286
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.810
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I can't

287
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.130
Bethany Shadid: My heart just aches for you. How are you doing, yeah.

288
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That feel like it's getting closer to really yeah yeah

289
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.430
Bethany Shadid: Much more real and honest and

290
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.600
Bethany Shadid: Not disclosing I was so used to that so used to having

291
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.100
Bethany Shadid: Interesting.

292
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.030
But

293
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So your history is back to back, but actually both your mother and your father require you to defend your position you you do quite

294
00:29:44.970 --> 00:30:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: More than your fair share of diligence in getting ahead of it and being ready for a good defense and and the exhaustion that's involved in that. But you don't have to. You owe us nothing for a woman, you are an adult, you all mean nothing.

295
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You get that

296
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:16.530
Bethany Shadid: I do. But I it's so foreign to me I that I can say it and I don't even realize when I'm getting into it, you know.

297
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:28.110
Bethany Shadid: Until, like we said like, oh, I'm holding my breath. Okay, maybe I didn't wanna. Okay, this isn't the way I wanted the conversation. Oh yeah, no.

298
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

299
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.060
And

300
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:32.310
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

301
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this maybe it's a bit thinking of it like in phases or in stages or steps and think, while I'm in therapy working on my boundaries.

302
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm learning where they are and my if it is this comfort level of being able to say, you know what, I just got myself a little uncomfortable. I want to change the topic.

303
00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I have humor. Right, so I throw that I get away with a lot because I give myself that so it may not look like I'm

304
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: A session earlier today. I'm actually a little out of sorts and not actually feeling that great.

305
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And I lost my train of thought. It doesn't happen too often, but I did so I really know my cognition is really kind of sideways and I did. And then I was like, Oh, I just lost my train of thought it's person picked right up and kept going and then I remembered

306
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I came back, he said, I just caught it.

307
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to do that to you get to say

308
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I over shared. I don't really want to answer questions about it. But I'll tell you what I can do. Ronnie.

309
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell you this concept about feeling threatened, it's a pretty common one. In fact, I know city could pull it further, further away. I know therapists often ask

310
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Survivors, they'll say, was anyone in your family threatened or did you have this belief or perception that harm might come to you.

311
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Or someone you love. If you told I said it makes it even worse that trauma is worsened by that thread. Did you know that Ronnie. It's so you see how it went out here went to philosophical it went to sort of a psycho educational thing right now that happened to be a nugget. I had

312
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have some to where could you have helped. Is it him or is it his daughter, like how if he has understanding why then he'll treat his daughter with more respect. Like, where might that healthy delivered

313
00:32:50.580 --> 00:33:08.790
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. Well, it was obvious that his wife, my friend. She's also an abuse victim herself and and so she understands. He's grappling with it. He. None of this makes sense.

314
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:22.080
Bethany Shadid: His worldview. You can tell his worldview is really set and then this happened and now he likes so confused about what

315
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.380
Bethany Shadid: And so

316
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:38.700
Bethany Shadid: His and this is horrifying. But his mother told him that his own daughter was trying to seduce her

317
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.830
Bethany Shadid: Husband, or the grandfather and that it's her fault.

318
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.650
Bethany Shadid: And

319
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: He

320
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:55.140
Bethany Shadid: Has pretty horrifies yeah and that and the father

321
00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:01.650
Bethany Shadid: He's talked to him and asked him, like why and

322
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:09.810
Bethany Shadid: It, it's very obvious that he was very close with his Father before all this happened.

323
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:20.730
Bethany Shadid: And that's the hardest part. You know, we, they were in the business together. They were best friends.

324
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't show

325
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But wish I was at the table. I would have kicked your leg.

326
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have kicked you like don't you say a word.

327
00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:37.800
Bethany Shadid: I'm wondering, we were all like

328
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.420
Bethany Shadid: Just there listening to this and

329
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.120
Bethany Shadid: You know,

330
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:46.770
What yeah

331
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you think at best would happen with your help. What did you think would happen

332
00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.370
Bethany Shadid: I know for me, it's nice to

333
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.040
Bethany Shadid: Talk to people that

334
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:10.200
Bethany Shadid: Relate and so I felt like

335
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.900
Bethany Shadid: Disclosing

336
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:19.050
Bethany Shadid: Would be a comfort. That's all.

337
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But she did talk and my daughter wasn't in the room.

338
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So no trial and see that he

339
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it who and now you go one step up and you you knew about the mother and like you see it. Does this look more like a victim or a perpetrator.

340
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.560
Right.

341
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting the perpetrator to understand you, what harm.

342
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:52.680
Bethany Shadid: No, no, no, no, no. I think I confused you so Ronnie.

343
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:58.200
Bethany Shadid: His father abused his daughter.

344
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's move on. Yeah, yeah.

345
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but I'm not sure I'm off so

346
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: roadie Ronnie's dad for whom they had a very close relationship is knowing confusion because Ronnie step daughter was

347
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.390
Bethany Shadid: His biological daughter.

348
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Ronnie's daughter was

349
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a survivor of molestation between 12 and 17 by Ronnie's father

350
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.810
Bethany Shadid: Yes. Okay.

351
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And

352
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.680
Bethany Shadid: I'm not, I'm not bother.

353
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.420
Bethany Shadid: Ronnie's father

354
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.460
Bethany Shadid: His wife was the one

355
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.800
Bethany Shadid: Who said was said it was

356
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just yeah

357
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I'm not off.

358
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, watch.

359
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter who so. Watch it. Watch it again.

360
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If. What's the little girl's name. What's the 17 year old son or

361
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter Danielle.

362
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Danielle Danielle was in the room.

363
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This version of help what you just did have, wouldn't it be nice if someone felt comfortable and could relate

364
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's relate both survivor.

365
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But who was in the room was Ronnie, whose father was the perpetrator, for whom Ronnie is very close and whose wife is accusing Danielle of basically bringing it on herself. So what you ended up doing was trying to convince and I know this sounds really weird but work with me here.

366
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're trying to tell the perpetrator you're trying to get again see it from the victim's point of view, don't be confused. This is, believe me, this is awful and and and so what I just saw was like

367
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to

368
00:37:54.120 --> 00:38:00.150
Bethany Shadid: I actually didn't click until now, but I think I

369
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.890
Bethany Shadid: Saw my father in him.

370
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.100
Bethany Shadid: And the not understanding

371
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:16.020
Bethany Shadid: That's it. The confusion like

372
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:32.670
Bethany Shadid: Wanting like it's like he doesn't listen to me. He wants experts to tell him this than the other but wanting him to understand

373
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.460
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

374
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, don't be confused. Other. Don't be confused. This is wrong. It was horrible. I'm completely transformed because of it. My life trajectory went left when it could have gone some other direction. What's there to be confused about here.

375
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:53.520
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

376
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And so, so you saw me kind of pushing a little hard there, and I apologize if I was to push it.

377
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess the reason I will say why questions very often in therapy, but it speaks to number that original question.

378
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to kind of put your little self out here like this to that.

379
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not safe.

380
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The last thing we want is to put our underbelly our vulnerable self around someone who is either a ignorant.

381
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Ignorant confused. No, no, no, no. Again, members of phase. It's a stage. And so instead it's, I'm going to put it out with someone who can relate to me a Danielle.

382
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Them.

383
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: A best friend someone who's been with it, but otherwise we're putting our selves out for someone to

384
00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be like the. Can you imagine what if he had said something. And frankly, he did by curiously because you had to hear this re abuse assault come down from this twisted thinking from this grandmother right thing and then I should have about that.

385
00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:13.590
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

386
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You, it would have been one extra layer of distance, had you read the signs which you you felt them somewhere because you told me straight away. He had sort of this superficial insight.

387
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not trustworthy.

388
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I trust you.

389
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to trust you.

390
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:49.830
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, well, and then that was the. That was the other part that was a little bit difficult is that my friend Stacy, who was also witnessing this you know like happen.

391
00:40:50.940 --> 00:41:04.470
Bethany Shadid: She texted me later and was like, wow. She was like, how did you feel about that conversation and some of the things that she pointed out, I was like,

392
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.110
Bethany Shadid: Oh my gosh, like

393
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.630
Bethany Shadid: I totally missed

394
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.730
Bethany Shadid: I totally didn't like that red flag. I didn't see

395
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:21.840
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, that thing I didn't notice or that yeah so

396
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there with that stay there. That's the work right there, that's the piece.

397
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I keep saying this is in phases someday you want, months, years down the line to tell your story and you don't want to be owned by having to weigh whether someone's trustworthy or not fine.

398
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's get the resilience up before you start throwing it out there so it doesn't wipe you out. That's fine. You want to do that, but I can't help but want to protect you and that is if you can't catch those early signs, then just tell yourself. I tell them, nobody

399
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Until I'm better at reading the ones from just a boss who slams their hands down on a desk or does things that until I know how to do those

400
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: My read on it. I might be. I might over disclose and make vulnerable. What is tender and and I need to register, I need to catch those signs need to get better and more skilled at it, it's going to take some time. And for now, none of y'all.

401
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Do you see it.

402
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:35.490
Yeah.

403
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: baby step.

404
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your register of having to just share everything to just give it all over to mom to dad just Glenn and then when you have an important one wasn't believed, just the insanity that created

405
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: unraveled unravel that

406
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You when you catch it. I

407
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to help because that's going to happen. You're a helper. I know.

408
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But this

409
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to share or you can, but I'm saying as a new philosophy. If you wanted to do it differently. Just say

410
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:22.920
No.

411
00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:29.430
Bethany Shadid: I definitely, yeah. Was I think that's a good and

412
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.350
Bethany Shadid: Honestly,

413
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: With with a with a girl with a seven. Isn't that a totally different audience.

414
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now look, that word relate

415
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.330
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

416
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: He needs to know she's still lovable. Okay. She doesn't have to go crazy that her dad doesn't get it or their grandparents are going

417
00:43:50.250 --> 00:44:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to you could really help her with that right kind of send her in this crazy direction as if somehow blaming the victim girl. Hold on tight because not everybody's going to understand it. But I'll tell you what I do.

418
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, that's the relate

419
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.050
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, for real.

420
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: There's signs so catching them and it's no

421
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:16.140
Bethany Shadid: Different

422
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no different than when you're going to go to the new workplace and you're going to need to see signs. Is this person trustworthy.

423
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Or am I going to keep this conversation.

424
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and short. I'm going to use my. I'm just going to be sweet, but I am not going to give until they have earned your trust.

425
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Through and you can be a little ways they didn't gossip. They sit. They made a sweet. So they asked me questions they show they cared and time after time after time, they weren't overly

426
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: By trying to get it just too nice like they want something. Okay, now that when I ain't gonna

427
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do nice to nice even right what's up.

428
00:44:59.610 --> 00:44:59.970
Yeah.

429
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to just keep watching. I'm going to go nice and slow. I'm going to see if my register is getting better and better if I can see the signs and still people will betray us, they still mess with us. I know that. But I'm talking about

430
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Chicago

431
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

432
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.530
Bethany Shadid: I can't even

433
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.900
Bethany Shadid: practiced it and

434
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:31.140
Bethany Shadid: I guess this is a good opportunity for me to go in and practice.

435
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:32.790
Bethany Shadid: It's

436
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It really is. So I'm excited. You're going to go to a new I don't. I didn't hear you over and you're starting this new job. But if you are. That's exciting.

437
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we get to do it again. Now I got to witness because now I've been working with you long enough, I know what you're like right before and you're so excited so excited. Oh my gosh, what did you do so smart quickly and we let them know, hey,

438
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I have these these challenges with these learning programs and blah, blah, blah. Okay. And then we run into toxic people demanding people and and then right all of these dynamics.

439
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And I gotta tell you, I know that it looks optimistic but it's a real possibility, same type of environment will be there.

440
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.340
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

441
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.980
Bethany Shadid: It's although I definitely know the

442
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.150
Bethany Shadid: Consequences of the over share

443
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:40.740
Bethany Shadid: Okay, and then living with that in a work dynamic now and how that is a big part of not

444
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.880
Bethany Shadid: Like wanting that clean slate. Right.

445
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.560
Bethany Shadid: Because I did that.

446
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:52.380
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I became the over share very emotional to your, you know, like

447
00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:00.960
Bethany Shadid: I get an opportunity to apply these things, this time. So that's what I'm excited about.

448
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.460
Bethany Shadid: But to hear

449
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What you hear in your voice. You might be saying that to me.

450
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your body's telling a different story. Right now, you know,

451
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:20.790
Bethany Shadid: I think it's just the feeling of not being ready to go back to work. Because of all this going on.

452
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.280
Bethany Shadid: I had a rough time

453
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:25.710
Bethany Shadid: This week,

454
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.640
Bethany Shadid: I need a plan.

455
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:38.040
Bethany Shadid: Because of not not realizing how

456
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.490
Bethany Shadid: This avoidance.

457
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:53.700
Bethany Shadid: My whole life is avoidance right now. I really, you know, I

458
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:59.910
Bethany Shadid: I guess I asked myself, honestly, it was like man, the quarantine right now.

459
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.690
Bethany Shadid: You know everybody's dying to get out and get back into everything. And I've just perfectly content.

460
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:07.530
Yeah.

461
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I like the timing. It's given you a chance to kind of like, you know, oh

462
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get myself ready again. Yeah.

463
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:27.630
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I've had the opportunity to start trying to instill some new habits like exercising every day and

464
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.850
Bethany Shadid: Getting them to

465
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:35.400
Bethany Shadid: My

466
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:44.700
Bethany Shadid: Tasks and Bible time and I have my list here, drinking enough water.

467
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.920
Bethany Shadid: Creative be doing something creative every day and

468
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:58.740
Bethany Shadid: Because in the beginning when you're trying to instill that it can be very hard to keep it going. When you

469
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:08.460
Bethany Shadid: Are starting a new job. So it's like, yeah, wanting to have more time to

470
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.130
Bethany Shadid: Work on myself.

471
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're, you're going to what I'm imagining you're feeling

472
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're feeling. Yeah. If you've got it. It's just

473
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It just exudes from you.

474
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But the truth is that when you meet this new environment.

475
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to know.

476
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Just another classroom for you to practice these skills. They are so fortunate to have you even walk through their door.

477
00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: They're just so lucky. And you get to show up and give as much or as little as you want.

478
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready,

479
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just

480
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Another sandbox.

481
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to you get to play. Okay, you're bringing this pale, she's got this shovel. Let's play

482
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. It doesn't have to be what I think your body is remembering is that emotional intensity of this other workplace of all of these other intense environments. It does not have to be that

483
00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.130
Bethany Shadid: It can be very good. Yeah.

484
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It can you this, but give it a chance to be the fresh start.

485
00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I told you the way I look at it, right. It's this I'm new. Lots of room remember that one. Lots of room.

486
00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:47.940
Bethany Shadid: Itself that too. I was like, I get to be lazy and not know what I do.

487
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I I'm new lady.

488
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the new lady explain it to me again, just get into the notion of play.

489
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the new lady. Okay, I know. Say it again. Say it again. I get away with this new right there's that humor.

490
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, yeah, let me get my notepad and write it down by region. Imma, imma imma because right we were better when we hand write we write out the instructions. Give me a second.

491
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds really important. I'm new.

492
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me go get my notepad.

493
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We were forced it let me write it down, let me watch you let me do it stand over my shoulder.

494
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but this is how I work best, right, this could be fun.

495
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun.

496
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:37.830
Bethany Shadid: I know if I let myself.

497
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:39.750
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

498
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But your body, saying, oh, it's going to be the same thing where you give and give and give and give and give and give and no one sees you.

499
00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what it looks like.

500
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:51.180
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

501
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this these tears.

502
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:58.380
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, well, I'm definitely feeling the impact of realizing

503
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:20.880
Bethany Shadid: The emotional dress load I've added me for a long time and how I need to release it and change my life. And so maybe that's part of it, not wanting to be in that place again but

504
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.550
Bethany Shadid: Being honest with myself about the fact that it's not just

505
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:34.230
Bethany Shadid: Like I'm not anticipating that everything's going to go perfect right like I'm trying to be real about it.

506
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:36.600
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

507
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This desensitization stuff it's it's intended to make it so like what you're feeling right now it gets some distance, it's whole purpose is to give you relief and yes it's a bitter. It does taste better, but then the medicine works.

508
00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I just

509
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to keep working with you. I want to keep doing these things. But I also want it want to really back off when you say I've got to keep processing it

510
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

511
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If these ones are interpersonal when you're interacting with these people. You could have a healing experience. Oh, I just look at me, keeping I didn't say a word. I was like, Huh, that's really interesting.

512
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Not my business.

513
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have a healing experience.

514
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just as likely as the other.

515
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so this time you'll go and now we have more I have more information. This time I'm I really ready for

516
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Your style, you know,

517
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're enough, not without you don't have to give

518
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: All your enough with just this little bit you give

519
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let us

520
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Earn

521
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Your trust.

522
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that this isn't. This is because we're not trustworthy. There's something flawed in you. It's it we suck.

523
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Were careless, you see.

524
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to earn your trust.

525
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep that

526
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

527
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the way they got that posture up because that's right

528
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep your eye out for whether we are not

529
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

530
00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Big one where, where are we, as we are at the top of the hour. I know I gotta go run a group, but life doesn't always happen right on time so

531
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:07.380
Bethany Shadid: We do anytime. Anytime next week, Monday at noon spine.

532
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:09.780
Bethany Shadid: Or whatever.

533
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, how about there's a possibility. There's this thing happening, possibly tonight. I've got this backup at noon on Monday. So I'm not really sure. I'll be able to pull it off, you know, to worry about that. But that's a maybe.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's rather
