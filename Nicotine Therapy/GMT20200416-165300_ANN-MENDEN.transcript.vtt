00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:25.500
ANN MENDENHALL: So I'm just going to leave this recording, it's 953 my time. I think our fellow has already checked in, but he's not actually in zoom yet so

2
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:38.940
ANN MENDENHALL: Rather than stop the recording and started again, I'll just keep it running just to let you know that it'll probably be folks. He just entered the waiting room so it'll be probably another six minutes before this actually really starts. Thank you.

3
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.940
ANN MENDENHALL: Hey Kyle.

4
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.460

ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, yeah. So my name. Let me close this little. There we go. My name is Anne Mendenhall

7
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:52.710
ANN MENDENHALL: And and so they have assigned you to me is your new provider and. And to do that, the readmission so

8
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.700
Kyle Camargo: I see that

9
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.230
ANN MENDENHALL: Excuse me.

10
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.510
ANN MENDENHALL: We can hear.

11
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.110
ANN MENDENHALL: You used to be with Dr. Waters. And so I just wanted to get a little history.

12
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:16.860
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, I'm kind of looked at your chart and of course we've got your past medical history and a bunch of other things that you did with her. So, you know, that's good. We won't have to, you know, waste time I'll just kind of verify that. That's all accurate but

13
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.840
ANN MENDENHALL: Often so

14
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.260
ANN MENDENHALL: So why don't you just kind of tell me what's what's going on. I wouldn't. When did you first start with

15
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.020
ANN MENDENHALL: Right heart health.

16
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.260
Kyle Camargo: I started maybe about

17
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:40.620
Kyle Camargo: Roughly three months ago, but I was very, very shy. I was very maybe for like three weeks is

18
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.090
Kyle Camargo: I wanted to get sober and then

19
00:08:46.920 --> 00:09:03.450
Kyle Camargo: I actually have a traveling drop. So my boss come back up and I thought I'll usually, usually when I need home I'm pretty strong about not using drugs, no not going on, looking for it. But when I come back home. I have my downfalls, and I always use and

20
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:15.900
Kyle Camargo: That's my current situation right now. I left the program because I thought I could maintain sobriety even myself. I did for a little bit, but

21
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.180
Kyle Camargo: It didn't last very long.

22
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it's hard to do it on your own. It really is. I mean, you're not alone in that

23
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.330
I mean,

24
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:26.760
ANN MENDENHALL: I

25
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.250
Kyle Camargo: Don't want to be sober, because I've been through methadone before, you know, but I didn't like the way let the dog.

26
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:45.090
Kyle Camargo: The stereo for so long. You know, I like going to the office every day and then it kept my goes cuz I create even more. And it's like, oh my god.

27
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.450
Kyle Camargo: It's a little too much for me.

28
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.300
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. And where do you live,

29
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.460
Kyle Camargo: Salinas, California.

30
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.450
Okay.

31
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.600
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it's hard to have to go in every morning. That's one of the, I think main problems with methadone.

32
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.460
ANN MENDENHALL: notes down

33
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.390
ANN MENDENHALL: And so were you ever on methadone.

34
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.010
Kyle Camargo: Yes.

35
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.600

36
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.950
Kyle Camargo: Um, the last time I recall being on methadone.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.050
Kyle Camargo: Which is like

46
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.500
ANN MENDENHALL: What in October, maybe know

47
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.010
Joseph

48
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.170
Kyle Camargo: Yeah, it was January.

49
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:48.720
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. Okay, so what, what did you do between March of 2019 or were you just using the entire time.

50
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.310
Kyle Camargo: I was using the whole time.

51
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.060
Okay.

52
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.050
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

53
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.660
ANN MENDENHALL: And so when, when was your, your last opioid use

54
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Other than yesterday.

55
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.600
Yesterday,

56
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.600
ANN MENDENHALL: And what did you use

57
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.130
Kyle Camargo: Heroin

58
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.230
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and how much

59
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.330
Kyle Camargo: Maybe

60
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.170
Kyle Camargo: About maybe up to a gram. I think

61
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.340
Okay.

62
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.450
ANN MENDENHALL: And is that been your normal use every day, the gram or so.

63
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.870
Kyle Camargo: On most days. Usually, yes.

64
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.740
Okay.

65
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.520
ANN MENDENHALL: What time of day. Wish Your, your last here to be here when

66
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.660
Kyle Camargo: I say about two o'clock.

67
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:09.510
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And you know why that's important is because if you take the Suboxone too soon it will trigger that precipitated withdrawal, which you know it from

68
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:26.940
ANN MENDENHALL: Everybody that's told me I was gone through it. It's like hell. It's like going to hell it's you know you worse than you have ever felt in your life. And so I'm always just really careful that I, you know, let people wait a full 24 hours before they start just so they don't

69
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:38.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Experience that because even though you might have you know a little bit more withdrawal symptoms. You seem like you're fairly calm right now. I'm sure you're probably having some symptoms. But yeah, it should be about good

70
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:44.400
Kyle Camargo: 3040 minutes just to wake up. I woke up at night and I turned on the lights in my room. I just laid around like

71
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:57.750
Kyle Camargo: Nine 935 and then I called the bright health and then I sat there again, laying down and then I got up early. When I was Dally. The help to host you saw. I'm not feeling too good right now.

72
00:13:58.890 --> 00:13:59.580
ANN MENDENHALL: I bet.

73
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:00.960
ANN MENDENHALL: I mean,

74
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.710
Kyle Camargo: Just cold right now and just normal symptoms.

75
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.330
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, well, we'll get into all those symptoms.

76
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.420
ANN MENDENHALL: So what

77
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Let's see.

78
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.560
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

79
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.750
ANN MENDENHALL: So what did you ever have any overdose where you had to go to the ER.

81
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And when when how many and and when were those more or less.

82
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.650
Kyle Camargo: I only had one overdose and now maybe roughly two years ago.

83
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

84
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.050
ANN MENDENHALL: And did you go to the ER them.

85

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.660
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so they had didn't have to use nor can to bring it back.

87

ANN MENDENHALL: Yes. Okay.

88
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.780
ANN MENDENHALL: Luckily they did. And you're here.

89
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:19.260
ANN MENDENHALL: And it's your the height of your use what what is the most use per day like two grams or so always been about a gram or

90
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:26.730
Kyle Camargo: Roughly. I mean, depending how much money I have been enough if I really want to get high.

91
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:45.570
Kyle Camargo: Lately, in the last two weeks. I have been trying to cut down my minimum us, but I don't usually the last in the last two weeks, I only just get high. Just to get well you know try to spend more money. Spencer $10 again. Hi. I just want to get up and get going, or good. What do I have to do.

92
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:56.670
Kyle Camargo: Okay so lately I've been actually cutting back because I i was i wanted to call brain health but you know I wasn't ready yet, but

93
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.770
Kyle Camargo: You know, I knew I had to get high to the

94
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:14.940
Kyle Camargo: Day I get in contact with them and I called him, maybe two days ago and they said they have to check with a supervisor to readmit me and see go from there. And it gave me a call yesterday. I believe in started the process again. Yeah.

95
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:23.850
ANN MENDENHALL: So you've been using a gram a day is that IV or snort smoke.

96
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.160
Kyle Camargo: I'm usually I ID and smoke.

97
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.850
Okay.

98
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.530
ANN MENDENHALL: And you've been using that gram a day. So would you say since March of know since

99
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.830
ANN MENDENHALL: Since when when you quit.

100
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.730
Kyle Camargo: This time

101
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.870
Kyle Camargo: Since I be using about a gram a day for the last month, but

102
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.380
Okay.

103
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.420
Kyle Camargo: My heroin user has been off and on throughout the years but

104
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.640
Kyle Camargo: Since I was with Bright House, I was sober for a little bit, taking the Suboxone

105
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:12.450
Kyle Camargo: And then I had to leave. I had to go work. So I thought I could be strong and be sober and then I came back to Salinas and started using the game with the last month, you know, you just get tired of using, you know, you want something else better for yourself.

106
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.860
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, for sure.

107
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.920
Kyle Camargo: That a waking up in Philly sick every day or

108
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:18.030
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah.

109
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.140
Kyle Camargo: That's the other stuff.

110
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:32.730
ANN MENDENHALL: So the one concern. I guess I have is, you know, how, how it works with bright heart in order to get refills. You need to come to the groups and

111
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:48.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Even if you are on the job someplace else, you know, as long as you can get, you know, hook into an Internet connection there. You can do it on your phone. Were you able to to attend the groups when you were working on the road.

112
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:57.300
Kyle Camargo: Actually when I was in the road, I just give up, like I just I just took the rest of my soapbox and I had

113
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:12.060
Kyle Camargo: And just stop. I stopped getting high because there's no there's no jugs around so so i i was sober for a bit like for a weekend and I just like, I don't have to call them, like myself, you know,

114
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.230
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so were you how, how often are you on the road.

115
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:35.280
Kyle Camargo: I'm usually on the road, eight months out of the year, but I'm I'm done actually with that I'm actually, I'm staying home now. I'm and I'm good. I mean, I'm done traveling on the road with work with that company now.

116
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:44.700
Kyle Camargo: I'm just personal reasons why but i'm i'm done traveling. I'm going to stay at home with my family and

117
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.540
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

118
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:52.560
Kyle Camargo: And do better right here because you know there's work everywhere, but I always choose to work to go on the road.

119
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.050
Kyle Camargo: Yeah, and yeah.

120
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:02.910
ANN MENDENHALL: But if you. I mean, that's one of the things that I think that's, that's a great decision.

121
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:09.180
ANN MENDENHALL: Because in order for this to work. It's not just

122
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.640
ANN MENDENHALL: It's of course you know also having the

123
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:23.010
ANN MENDENHALL: The therapy part of it, you know, to help you sort of get underneath why you're using and to help you.

124
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:37.890
ANN MENDENHALL: Make you know help you with your decisions and also to be able to continue to prescribe that Suboxone because it really it really bothers me when I have somebody you know who I felt like, okay, we're getting going here.

125
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.540
ANN MENDENHALL: And then they disappear. I very

126
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:52.170
ANN MENDENHALL: I worry about my patients when that happens because it's almost inevitable that they've relapsed. And so one of the things that we need you to do is to come to the groups.

127
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:05.070
ANN MENDENHALL: At first century, you know, you'll be starting back. I'll just be prescribing a week at a time until you've been with us, you know, for a few months, and then we can you know give you two weeks at a time.

128
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:14.490
ANN MENDENHALL: But you know that entails you actually coming to the group. And can you attend a Friday morning group at 10 o'clock.

129
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.730
Kyle Camargo: Um,

130
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.020
Kyle Camargo: Yes, I can. I'm one question.

131
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:37.110
Kyle Camargo: About LIKE LATE AT ONCE I START WORKING WITH THEIR be adjustment as groups, I could have 10 cuz like saying I work in am and then will I be able to attend a different group say yes.

132
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.150
ANN MENDENHALL: I gotcha. I mean,

133
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.580
Kyle Camargo: The clock and then cuz I'm looking for a job right now to

134
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.180
Kyle Camargo: Yeah, and I don't know if a little work graveyard, or am but

135
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.580
Kyle Camargo: It's all you know the balls going but as the right now. I could meet at 10 o'clock in the morning.

136
00:20:54.270 --> 00:21:03.510
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, why don't we start you out at that 10 O'clock Friday morning group. I do it with Levada who's the therapist and

137
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:11.010
ANN MENDENHALL: We also have a Wednesday evening at six o'clock. That one's pretty full. But so let's start your on the Friday morning.

138
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:23.910
ANN MENDENHALL: And see how that goes. And if you need to switch, you know, we'll see about switching you to the Wednesday night, and if for some reason that doesn't work, or we've got too many people, then we'll just find another group for you that works with your schedule.

139
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. How's that sound.

140
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.010
Kyle Camargo: Thursday. Actually, I go to the Wednesday group because I'm

141
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:51.540
Kyle Camargo: Already in the mornings and I be caught getting caught up like doing chores for my family and you know I think last time I was doing Mondays, or something like that at nighttime though like around six clock, I believe it was

142
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Uh huh.

143
00:21:53.550 --> 00:22:00.510
Kyle Camargo: And I feel maybe just Friday at Fridays at 10 in the morning is like, you know, it's the end of the weekend and then

144
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.740
Kyle Camargo: I'll get caught up doing something and not be able to dial in.

145
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:17.250
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, well we can try that, although our group is pretty full and so

146
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:26.430
ANN MENDENHALL: We'll have to see it wasn't very full last night so that that was alright but we can try you at Wednesday. And if that doesn't work.

147
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:40.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Because you know it doesn't work for us, if we have more than, you know, nine people show up because we just don't have time for that. And we already have 15 people in that group, but they don't all show up at the same time. So,

148
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.980
Kyle Camargo: We may

149
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.700
ANN MENDENHALL: Be will be, we can start you next Wednesday at 6pm

150
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:59.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Have you call the bright heart health to make that appointment. But, and also for the initial therapy appointment, but just so you know that there may be a chance we'll have to switch you to a different group, but we can try it.

151
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.110
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, okay.

152
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.490
Okay.

153
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.890
ANN MENDENHALL: All right, and so

154
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:06.690
ANN MENDENHALL: Let's see.

155
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.590
ANN MENDENHALL: How about. Have you had any

156
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:27.180
ANN MENDENHALL: I mean who hasn't had consequences from substance use, but, you know, specifically, have you had either any legal consequences like arrest or D wise or work related consequences or relationship.

157
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:38.220
Kyle Camargo: Only consequences as with myself and like losing a job in

158
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.540
Kyle Camargo: Know residential, you know, having somewhere to stay

159
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.500
Kyle Camargo: Connected drugs, you know, get high instead of paying bills.

160
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.790
Kyle Camargo: Okay, stuff like that. I just say personal consequences myself.

161
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.980
ANN MENDENHALL: But button. The little ones at this point.

162
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.080
Kyle Camargo: No legal legal

163
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:11.370
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. Well, that's good. I'm good for you it, you know, for me it's like I asked these questions and I really don't have any judgment about your answers. It just helps me to know exactly, you know, where you've been at so I can help you the most.

164
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:19.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Possible. So I just mentioned that because i i know some I also work at residential rehab facilities and sometimes

165
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:33.420
ANN MENDENHALL: You're really trying to minimize you know kind of what their history is their uses, you know, probably because maybe they they're a little ashamed or they they just sort of don't want admit to what they're taking. And I really

166
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:44.010
ANN MENDENHALL: It doesn't really matter to me how much you've taken or you've taken or what your consequences are. I just like to know, you know what it is. So I can

167
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.670
ANN MENDENHALL: Be most helpful to you. That's, that's where I'm coming from, because it's

168
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:48.930
Thing.

169
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.340
ANN MENDENHALL: And then, okay. The other question is, how about any other substances alcohol.

170
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.070
Kyle Camargo: Things like marijuana

171
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:00.840
Kyle Camargo: Marijuana

172
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:01.980
Kyle Camargo: Marijuana out of the

173
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.880
ANN MENDENHALL: How much, how often

174
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:13.350
Kyle Camargo: He really can dive in smoking heroin. I've not having spoken that much marijuana but

175
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:21.690
Kyle Camargo: Um, you know I smoke every day, though, but maybe like I'd say about a gram or two grams a day.

176
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.980
Kyle Camargo: Okay, there was

177
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.090
Kyle Camargo: Nothing, nothing big.

178
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.860
ANN MENDENHALL: Um, and how about alcohol.

179
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.260
Kyle Camargo: No, I did not drink alcohol.

180
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.340
Okay.

181
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.820
ANN MENDENHALL: And any Xanax or Valium or any other kind of benzodiazepines Klonopin

182
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:55.950
Kyle Camargo: I mean I have took a narc goes in the last like 30 days because I couldn't. It couldn't find any drugs when I was sick and just Narcos else did. But it's not an everyday thing. It was just a one time deal

183
00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:56.940
Okay.

184
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:05.910
ANN MENDENHALL: But you're not taking any benzodiazepines like Valium. Sorry. Okay. All right.

185
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:09.990
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

186
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:28.650
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, and past medical history, it looks like yes she put marijuana use smoking daily since the age of 10 except for one year, while under house arrest as a juvenile likes it, not interested in stopping

187
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Started smoking heroin age.

188
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.330
ANN MENDENHALL: On the weekend by 21 to 22

189
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.290
ANN MENDENHALL: Became daily

190
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:42.510
ANN MENDENHALL: It does have two, three to six months periods of sobriety intermittently.

191
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:49.320
ANN MENDENHALL: 22 smoking a gram daily Suboxone started on January 15

192
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.010
ANN MENDENHALL: And let's see. Oh, and you smoke cigarettes.

193
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.060
ANN MENDENHALL: Two packs a day. Is that still correct

194
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.400
ANN MENDENHALL: Yes. Okay.

195
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:11.820
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, and that's, you know, I, I would be remiss to not mention something about that. I mean, you know, it's like I'm sure you know

196
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:29.850
ANN MENDENHALL: Smoking is is really bad for your health. But I don't know if you realize how bad it is. I mean, it's probably the number one worst thing you can be doing particularly right now with all the coven 19 things going on because you're really, you're really damaging your lungs.

197
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.020
ANN MENDENHALL: And that is, you know,

198
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:41.460
ANN MENDENHALL: When people who are most at risk for getting it, are people who have some kind of line issue and smoking. That's a lot of cigarettes smoking that much definitely put you at this so

199
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:52.770
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, if it's not my decision for you to quit. That's only yours and it never works, unless people really want to quit. But I would start thinking about that and it can be something that you talk to your

200
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.010
ANN MENDENHALL: They are, first you know about

201
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.940
ANN MENDENHALL: Possibly get some, you know, I have you ever tried nicotine gum or Los Angeles or any of that.

202
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:20.700
ANN MENDENHALL: No. Okay. Well, when you're ready, I'm not. Let's not go down that road right now. But when you're ready, we can always have a discussion about that, like, you know, in the group. And if you decide that you want to try quitting. You know, we can see if we can get you some help doing that. Okay.

203
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:33.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, looks like you had elbow surgery at age eight you fell off the monkey bars. Oh, and Shattered your elbow. Any other surgeries.

204
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.240
ANN MENDENHALL: No. Okay.

205
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:53.160
ANN MENDENHALL: And your father's alive. Your mother was deceased at age 48 she's got diabetes, heart disease, largely due to cocaine cocaine use disorder and. She smokes.

206
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:54.750
Kyle Camargo: Yes.

207
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.530
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay see your, is your dad still living in Mexico.

208
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.170
Kyle Camargo: Yes, I have no contact with him.

209
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.020
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so you don't know his medical history.

210
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:11.820
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and then your brother, do you also diabetes heroin addict.

211
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.170
ANN MENDENHALL: And. Is that still true.

212
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.300
Kyle Camargo: Yes, it's still true.

213
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.380
Okay.

214
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.300
ANN MENDENHALL: Siblings

215
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.030
Kyle Camargo: No, just my brother.

216
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.170
Okay.

217
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and you don't drink.

218
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.190
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, let's see, you're born raised and so Salinas.

219
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.870
ANN MENDENHALL: Talk about cannabis you steely

220
00:29:44.580 --> 00:30:00.450
ANN MENDENHALL: You have your GED. You were expelled from school in ninth grade for drug use employment history new job now in the steel industry and construction has worked traveling carnival. The last three

221
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.810
ANN MENDENHALL: That was interesting was supervisor.

222
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.320
ANN MENDENHALL: So you set up rides in in that sort of thing.

223
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.670
ANN MENDENHALL: Yes. So I imagine that was a lot of the traveling work huh

224
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.070
Kyle Camargo: Yeah, that was my traveling work.

225
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, that's probably not happening now.

226
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.040
Kyle Camargo: Know my family don't want me to go no more and

227
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:28.680
Kyle Camargo: Financial wise, it has. It's always like they treat me good and the bad and this year was bad year and

228
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:35.400
Kyle Camargo: I don't feel like going back, the more you know I got, I always had a job here where I'm at, but

229
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.970
Kyle Camargo: For some reason this year, my boss asked me to come back.

230
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:46.380
Kyle Camargo: Again, I'm sure I'll go back to help you and then Cobra 19 happen and I said on what I have to go back home, you know,

231
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:57.810
Kyle Camargo: And I came back home and I started using it, I was like, man, I gotta stop doing this because, like, no, there's times I've been silver like each year. I go to the carnival. I'VE BEEN SOBER because I don't look for drugs.

232
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.280
Kyle Camargo: And you know, that's fine. No sobriety. I can maintain it.

233
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.210
Kyle Camargo: But yeah

234
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:10.320
Kyle Camargo: I just need a little help. Probably because I've done it myself. But, you know, away from home away from everybody away from

235
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.330
Kyle Camargo: From all existing like no, just my normal routine.

236
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.550
Kyle Camargo: That I want, I want to change. I always wanted to change.

237
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:32.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it sounds to me like you, you really are committed to making a change here and i think that's that's so important because only you can really make that decision, you know, to buy that heroin.

238
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:44.010
ANN MENDENHALL: And, you know, so now you're back at home. You've relapse there before, but I feel like if you can, you know, keep coming to our groups every week.

239
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:50.370
ANN MENDENHALL: And also have a therapy appointment, you know, we can really help you maintain a sobriety. Were you there.

240
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.250
ANN MENDENHALL: And then you'll be able to get a job and stay around your, your family and be able to sort of

241
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:06.240
ANN MENDENHALL: I think I would guess it's going to feel really good. If you can stay sober in Salinas, because that's kind of been you know where you've used most your life and

242
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:20.550
ANN MENDENHALL: You might be a good really set an example for some of your other friends who are still using how it's possible to get out of this loop because like you said, after a while, it was fun. At first, and you got a high

243
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.280
ANN MENDENHALL: But now it's not a high. It's just like you're just trying to feel normal and

244
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:37.950
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, so hopefully you know with the Suboxone you'll be able to sort of turn things around a little bit. But you know, I just want to make sure that you're willing to commit to coming to the group's

245
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.590
ANN MENDENHALL: Yes. Okay, that's great.

246
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.520
ANN MENDENHALL: So you were taking when you

247
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.870
ANN MENDENHALL: Quit we're taking the Suboxone films.

248
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.820
ANN MENDENHALL: And you were taking three a day.

249
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.730
Kyle Camargo: I believe so, yes.

250
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.050
Okay.

251
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.160
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, I think it probably would be. When was the last time you took Suboxone

252
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.180
Kyle Camargo: I took off to the carnival. Maybe this year like

253
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.480
Kyle Camargo: February.

254
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:28.440
Kyle Camargo: Like February 10 I believe or February is the middle second week of February. I took off to the carnival. And then maybe a week after that.

255
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.060
Kyle Camargo: So like maybe the third week of February, probably

256
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.020
Kyle Camargo: That was the last night.

257
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.750
ANN MENDENHALL: That was last time you took this box on

258
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.780
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so

259
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:58.830
ANN MENDENHALL: Today is the 15th. So you use pretty much, maybe a week of February, all of March, and then a couple weeks in April, so it's it's been

260
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.270
ANN MENDENHALL: About seven weeks, almost a month. Right.

261
00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay.

262
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.200
ANN MENDENHALL: Say seven weeks.

263
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.120
Okay.

264
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.630
ANN MENDENHALL: So because you've been off it for a while.

265
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:27.150
ANN MENDENHALL: I some of the past notes and I know that you were started up at a lower dose. So I am going to start you at two films a day but I

266
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:38.430
ANN MENDENHALL: Just want you to know that that's, you know, for the first week just to get used to it and not to overdo it. But then we'll have a discussion when you come to group next Wednesday. See how you're

267
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.420
Kyle Camargo: If you're

268
00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:45.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Still having cravings. If you're still having some withdrawal symptoms. We'll look at increasing that amount.

269
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.580
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, okay.

270
00:34:48.150 --> 00:35:04.800
ANN MENDENHALL: It's just safer safer to do. It's not like I'm trying to hold back from you but you know when you've not been using it for a while I we never put people back up on on three times a day. And that's the most I ever prescribed for anybody is three films a day, just so you know. Okay.

271
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:05.160
Okay.

272
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.870
ANN MENDENHALL: And so are you still taking

273
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.060
ANN MENDENHALL: I so cool. I mean,

274
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.120
Kyle Camargo: What does that again for me.

275
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.640
ANN MENDENHALL: It will. I'm just looking at your medication list here. Let's see me.

276
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:34.650
Kyle Camargo: Are those the prescription. She prescribed prescribed to me at first she prescribed me a bunch of medication because when I get sick. I get really nauseous. I get I started vomiting know

277
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:43.080
Kyle Camargo: Haha, like crazy chills. Like right now I woken up you know I'm just like, stretching know pretty soon. I'd want to get high and then

278
00:35:44.100 --> 00:36:01.560
Kyle Camargo: Know it took me like an hour to roll out of bed. Still, this morning, but I'm but no, she gave me like my sickness. When I start getting real sick. And I think actually fill them more sicker than any other day because I don't inject every day. I really started

279
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.540
Kyle Camargo: Injecting like in the last four days. And it's been heavily like

280
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:19.590
Kyle Camargo: Like I do a shot and then do another shot like 10 minutes later, because I know I just, I don't know what's wrong with me. I just sudden, the last three days I've been using pretty heavily injecting, sir.

281
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.110
Kyle Camargo: Okay, oh my

282
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.500
Kyle Camargo: I get nauseous and a bunch of other stuff too.

283
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Did the XO Fran that she gave you help with the nausea.

284
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.370
Kyle Camargo: Yes, they do.

285
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:40.200
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and the quantity is something that's only a temporary thing, but that often can help with opiate withdrawals, too.

286
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:41.490
ANN MENDENHALL: So I can be

287
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.480
ANN MENDENHALL: Refill back

288
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:49.440
ANN MENDENHALL: In the day so clean. Did you take all three of these. That's not what I normally prescribe

289
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you remember taking that one.

290
00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.710
Kyle Camargo: I don't know what that's for. Oh, I think so. I think that's for body aches.

291
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it's, it's more for sort of

292
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.810
Oops.

293
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:14.640
Kyle Camargo: I think that was one that said body pain. I don't have my prescription like doom away or at the bottles at home for a while.

294
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.030
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. Yeah, this one is more for

295
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.730
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, diarrhea and GI problems.

296
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:25.740
Kyle Camargo: What part of me again.

297
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.920
ANN MENDENHALL: If this is more for belly problems.

298
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.520
Kyle Camargo: I'm sorry, stomach cramps.

299
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.510
ANN MENDENHALL: stomach cramps and in diarrhea.

300
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:39.900
ANN MENDENHALL: That I saw coming

301
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.150
ANN MENDENHALL: So I'm just asking you, because I'm wondering if you're going to need that, too. I could

302
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:57.900
Kyle Camargo: No, I think I'll be okay. From the dice. Whenever how you I think I just I just know I get real, real nauseous. When if I really let myself get sick like that I get nauseous. I started vomiting just

303
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.750
Kyle Camargo: Know, and it's hard to control because it

304
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. Well, that is

305
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.980
ANN MENDENHALL: The zone, Fran is better for that anyway. So what did I give you. I'll give you the Suboxone

306
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.530
ANN MENDENHALL: And you'll have

307
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:23.880
ANN MENDENHALL: Enough to take two films a day for this first week and then we'll reevaluate how you're doing it next time you come to when you come to group.

308
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:28.260
ANN MENDENHALL: And I'll give you a prescription Clonidine, and also for the XO Fran.

309
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:40.650
ANN MENDENHALL: Clonidine is the one that kind of helps with other symptoms. So it technically is a medication that we usually just give for high blood pressure, but

310
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.200
ANN MENDENHALL: Actually, it's also given for people who are going through opiate withdrawal so

311
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.590
ANN MENDENHALL: Let's close that

312
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.600
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

313
00:38:52.710 --> 00:39:01.680
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so here are some questions, kind of, you know, more or less, head to toe things that you might be feeling right now. Let me just

314
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:04.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Go.

315
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.120
ANN MENDENHALL: Are you having any fever.

316
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.060
ANN MENDENHALL: Night sweats chills fatigue.

317
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.020
Kyle Camargo: I'm healthy only children. I feel fatigue.

318
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.450
Kyle Camargo: With those symptoms.

319
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:19.530
Kyle Camargo: Always do

320
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

321
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:32.160
Kyle Camargo: Or maybe it's probably because where I live. That is, I live in like the back of like a big property and the outhouse like old garage, but it was made into a house.

322
00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:39.900
Kyle Camargo: So I don't know if it's me from being sick or just cold because maybe there's no insulation in the walls. I don't know.

323
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it could be

324
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:51.810
Kyle Camargo: Or you know cuz it's not a real house. It's like, it looks like a real house, you know, but I don't know if it's the property or if it's me being sick, but I feel it's both. I think I feel it both

325
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:59.160
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, how about any runny nose right now or nasal congestion, sneezing, let

326
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.990
Kyle Camargo: Know that right now because you know

327
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.320
Kyle Camargo: I don't feel that like that right now.

328
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.040
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, how about a cough wheezing.

Kyle Camargo: too sick right now. I use like in the last 24 hours.

332
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:26.250
Kyle Camargo: Right. Or like since yesterday around maybe two or three years for us. I don't know, a time but I used to wake up sick and I

333
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.600
Kyle Camargo: Like, I feel cold and then I it took me a while to get out of bed and then

334
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:46.230
Kyle Camargo: I decided, Okay, I'm gonna go get high. And I'm like, I better get high before I even gets sick or anything. Usually that's, that's my usually daily routine is I try to use before I feel any type of sickness even come towards me.

335
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:50.760
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, how about any chest pain, palpitations.

336
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.300
Kyle Camargo: As the right and left you know chest pains and nothing

337
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:55.950

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.730
Kyle Camargo: Know, I think I'm good. Right now it's just

341
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.870

342
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:19.800

Kyle Camargo: And then usually i get i usually to my I get sore, I get like restless body.

345
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.650

Kyle Camargo: Bed I sleep on. I'm not too sure.

347
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:48.150

ANN MENDENHALL: That'll do it.

Kyle Camargo: It's a big pickup truck and I have to go and get them. And every time I pick them up, I get a bunch of hairs on the stuff like, Oh, man. Come on. Also, what

429
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:38.910
ANN MENDENHALL: What kind of magazine.

430
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:41.520
Kyle Camargo: I think it's like an Australian something

431
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.140
ANN MENDENHALL: Australian Shepherd.

432
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:48.660
Kyle Camargo: I think so. It looks. Yeah, he's a small dog. Yeah. Nice.

433
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.180
ANN MENDENHALL: Cool, yeah.

434
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.640
ANN MENDENHALL: I already sent us a box on

435
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:45.810
ANN MENDENHALL: The quantity, you're going to have a total of 10. So, you know, just take it when you really need it, like, you know, I wouldn't take any more than three a day and that what that will stretch out for three days and you should be totally fine. I

436
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:53.850
ANN MENDENHALL: shouldn't need it. And then for the show, Fran, you can have. Let's see. I think she gave you 10 tablets last time.

437
00:52:55.230 --> 00:53:00.030
ANN MENDENHALL: So I might not take that more than three times a day, either. So

438
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:01.350
Oh yeah, okay.

439
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:50.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Got the zero friend since I've sent the Clonidine, and I sent the Suboxone for you.

440
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, I think that kind of covers it. So I just want to

441
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:13.380
ANN MENDENHALL: Make sure that you know you know I think you mentioned that you your last use of the heroin was at 2pm but then I think you also mentioned, maybe it was three maybe was four and so

442
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:23.760
ANN MENDENHALL: If I were you, I would you know go pick this stuff up. See, you got it. Ready to go. But I would not really start that Suboxone until around four o'clock, just because

443
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:30.000
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, you might end up feeling a little bit worse. You can always start the So Fran, a little earlier, if you're starting to feel

444
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:48.000
ANN MENDENHALL: And you can start the quantity. And so that kind of help tide you over. But if you wait until then a freely a full 24 hours and only you know for sure when the last use was. But if you wait a full 24 hours, then I think you're going to be totally safe from the precipitated withdrawal.

445
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.600
ANN MENDENHALL: We don't want that to happen because you're

446
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:54.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Really awful so

447
00:54:55.320 --> 00:55:15.150
ANN MENDENHALL: So that I think I kind of got everything that I need there. We sent those three prescriptions. And so if you can call the bright heart again and tell them that you need an appointment to be in our group on Wednesday night, and that you need your initial therapy appointment we should

448
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:15.510
Be

449
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:20.130
Kyle Camargo: I think I scheduled a therapy appointment already

450
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:25.650
Kyle Camargo: Oh, good for, like, when is that I think sometime next week got

451
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:29.040
Kyle Camargo: 10 in the morning.

452
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.750
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, well I just verify that. Make sure you have that written down because I don't really know.

453
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:40.410
Kyle Camargo: Yeah. Cuz there's the guy he was he was supposed to send me an email. I haven't checked my phone right now. Okay.

454
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.320
Kyle Camargo: See, one second.

455
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.400
Kyle Camargo: My email.

456
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:55.050
Kyle Camargo: Got a bunch of eBay.

457
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.400
Kyle Camargo: Know it's you, I think. No, I haven't got nothing yet.

458
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.730
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, um,

459
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:17.040
Kyle Camargo: Now, these are all old

460
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:18.840
Well, I'll call

461
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:34.590
ANN MENDENHALL: It looks like they're yeah call them and make sure you get that appointment set up and then tell them I said you could be at least for now. You can be in our Wednesday night group so

462
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:45.990
ANN MENDENHALL: I think that's it. And so I will plan on seeing you next Wednesday at six o'clock, but make sure you know zoom. There's so many people using zoom right now that

463
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:53.610
ANN MENDENHALL: It's taking a lot longer to check people in. So thank you for checking in early today. I really appreciate it.

464
00:56:54.150 --> 00:57:06.330
ANN MENDENHALL: That's when we'd like you to check in. So if you could do the same for Wednesday night, and that way you make sure you'll actually be in the group because sometimes when people wait until like five or 10 minutes I have a time they can't get in the group because

465
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:07.560
Kyle Camargo: Yeah I know how it works.

466
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:10.440
Kyle Camargo: When I first when I first joined

467
00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:20.790
Kyle Camargo: Dr. Waters didn't explain to me like exactly how this works and how the medication fills up and you have to go to group to get your prescription. No, I didn't.

468
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:34.650
Kyle Camargo: So I for like the first. I was in the program payment for like almost up to like three weeks to a month, but I know I missed the first two group meetings like we like the first two weeks of group meetings because I didn't know what to do.

469
00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:43.020
Kyle Camargo: She never explained it to me and I kind of didn't like comprehend it. And I didn't fully understand how to do this.

470
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:43.680
Yeah.

471
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:48.810
Kyle Camargo: I'm very, I know how on the program those. I mean, how the process goes

472
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.650
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, cool.

473
00:57:52.140 --> 00:58:03.480
ANN MENDENHALL: I will tell you that I i work, you know, full time for a couple of residential we have facilities and so if you come to the group, you know, it's

474
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.640
ANN MENDENHALL: I fill the prescription that night.

475
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:09.540
ANN MENDENHALL: When they have to try and get in touch with me.

476
00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:15.000
ANN MENDENHALL: That can be really difficult because I'm working so much that you know you definitely

477
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:23.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Will have a delay in getting your prescription of sometimes several days so so that's the thing. Make sure you come to group and everything should be cool.

478
00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:25.020
Kyle Camargo: Okay. Sounds good.

479
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:25.650
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

480
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:26.550
ANN MENDENHALL: All right, just

489
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.700
ANN MENDENHALL: I oh here we go.

ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, this was just done yesterday. Good. So Kyle's

491
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:25.050
ANN MENDENHALL: Band score. I guess it's pre BAM his risk score was 17 and his protective store score is six. So good thing he's come back.

492
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.830
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, so anyway.

493
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:36.660
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so this whoops. Hang on one second.

494
00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:39.870
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, I'm

495
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:57.390
ANN MENDENHALL: A guy. I'm not sure if it's pronouncing geen or a guy, my apologies if I'm mispronouncing your name. I'm assuming you're doing the transcription and on this one. So what I often do is

496
00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:05.700
ANN MENDENHALL: fill in some of the stuff, but I didn't necessarily get everything. So I totally love how

497
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:16.740
ANN MENDENHALL: People. The transcriptionist in the past will will listen to, or, you know, read the whole transcription and fill in any gaps, you know, throughout the whole

498
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:22.860
ANN MENDENHALL: HMP that I'm may not have put in, even though I have put in some information.

499
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:40.920
ANN MENDENHALL: I guess I'm so used to doing charts that it's hard for me to not put anything in there. But if it's a problem for you and in confusing, please send me an email and let me know. But otherwise I'll try and get some info in there. But if I try and enter at all, then you know that the

500
01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:54.660
ANN MENDENHALL: Zoom meeting goes on way too long. So I really, really appreciate your transcription and makes the world of difference for me. And in terms of time, time wise, so

501
01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:06.690
ANN MENDENHALL: I think that's it and be sure and send me any emails for any questions, I'll give you any feedback if I see anything that you know

502
01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:15.840
