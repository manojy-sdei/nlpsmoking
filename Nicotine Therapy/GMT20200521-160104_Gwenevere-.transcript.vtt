00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy.

2
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: hit the mute button.

3
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Though all right we got it so i woke you up. Haha.

4
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.970
Cynthia We: Yeah, yeah, totally. I was crushed out like I had nothing going on today.

5
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.260
Cynthia We: Sorry, I feel like a loser.

6
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy. Now it was there anything unique about last night.

7
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

8
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.770
Cynthia We: Just adjust well is

9
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.490
Cynthia We: This pandemic, I'm typically

10
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.880
Cynthia We: Living every day, till 1130

11
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.260
Cynthia We: And I guess, yesterday I got up it I got up at 930 but that was like an occasion to get up a little earlier.

12
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.890
Cynthia We: I my schedule is really whacked it's like switch and it's and I don't like it.

13
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.590
Cynthia We: I need it to go back to normal like

14
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

15
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.140
Cynthia We: Because I don't feel good when I get up late and I go to bed late

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I started. Uh, nope. Nope. I didn't

18
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to take a second while we're here together and you want to take this time while it's fresh and put an alarm in the net for our next appointment, do you want to do that or would you mind if

19
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.980
Cynthia We: I have an alarm.

20
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

21
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.570
Cynthia We: I did have one that goes off every day, every day for you and

22
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.790
Cynthia We: It seems that I

23
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.080
Cynthia We: Didn't have my phone charging and

24
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.660
Cynthia We: Turn it off.

25
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll do it.

26
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Alarms yeah

27
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.230
Cynthia We: Yeah.

28
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you speaking of alarms. Were you able to experiment with that tomato timer. I

29
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.960
Cynthia We: Know, I was not

30
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.080
Cynthia We: I promptly forgot right about it.

31
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.990
Cynthia We: I'm going to download right now so I can remember.

32
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.610
Cynthia We: I'll never remember

33
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I was kind of seeing if doing things in the moment might might be useful.

34
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.550
To me.

35
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.160
Cynthia We: We got a swimming pool.

36
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.850
Cynthia We: You did, yeah. Blow up one

37
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh fun

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.630
Cynthia We: It has a. It has a filter, though, and it needs chlorine. So it's kind of a big blow up one

39
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.380
Yeah.

40
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.460
Cynthia We: Yeah.

41
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.920
Cynthia We: Oh, focus keeper. Yeah.

42
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I've noticed the people that use this. I'll let you focus on that. I'm going to

43
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.060
Cynthia We: Read um

44
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.650
Cynthia We: Is it the tomato, tomato timer.

45
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.960
Cynthia We: Timer.

46
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not this icon is this guy.

47
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.740
Cynthia We: Okay. Yes, I saw that, yes, here it is. Okay.

48
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.080
Cynthia We: Make it that one.

49
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, pick something else. I mean, no I

50
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.490
Cynthia We: Want to try it.

51
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.240
I want to try it.

52
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what I noticed is the the commitment to stick with the timeframe. So if it's 20 minutes where I'm focused working hard, then it's 10 minutes of play time where I walk around and I carry my phone obviously won't work. If not, next year, hip.

53
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, sticking in your jeans or you got those yoga pants at the pockets or something. Are you sticking them in there and then

54
00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The commitment, though, is been kind of cute to watch people using this because it's like, no, no, I can't. I can't talk right now I'm on. I'm on my 20 minutes I'll be free and I'll be free and like

55
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See right there will be done in a little bit just to it. The fact like there's a real sort of loyalty

56
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I already. I know if I'll be able to chat, but in in four minutes.

57
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.520
Cynthia We: Right, right.

58
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's kind of cute.

59
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.090
Cynthia We: GUY JUST SAID YOU'RE pinging around out here like you do inside

60
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.330
Cynthia We: Because I'm in the yard. He was, he was

61
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.170
Cynthia We: He took one of my gardening areas with the pool.

62
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.870
Cynthia We: And that'll make it easier for me, I guess, but but i was pinging from one thing to another, just like I always do.

63
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.610
Cynthia We: And I'm

64
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.820
Cynthia We: So this will help. I think

65
00:04:48.840 --> 00:05:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you but but the key is give yourself a break on the research part to see how long is a productive amount of time and when your attention drifts. So in other words, it's like

66
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's 20 maybe it's 24 minutes you're gonna have to try to figure out what your focus time is

67
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.000
Cynthia We: I think it probably depends on what I'm doing. Doesn't or does it

68
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: See that's the thing I'm

69
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously you can morph this into whatever you want to. But if you can compare yourself so much with making each task ones for gardening ones are ones for running

70
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.680
Cynthia We: Or doing it.

71
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There you found it.

72
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with the I keep it simple, stupid, I go with licious dumb it down to its fundamental elements. And then I might actually do a thing.

73
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, that's how that's how I kind of see it. Um, but what I'm getting at is figuring out the duration. So if it turns out

74
00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: you're noticing. Let's say you said it for 20 MINUTES OF THE FOCUS time and then it's 10 minutes of walk around and play time then day, it goes off again. Oh, I gotta go back to my project, what was my project, but then you go back to that project. You remember you go back to it.

75
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be that it's too short might be, it's too long. And that's where the discovery is it's like pick one and let that be the starting point and then you say, Oh my gosh, this is frustrating. I literally need 10 more minutes then yours needs to be 30 minutes

76
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.370
Cynthia We: Yeah, and

77
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you have different one you have options. There's different

78
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sessions. So you have the number of sessions. So you have for so watch you have gardening, you have a house. I'm making stuff up cleaning. We have shopping and we have writing this one might be longer than cleaning or you know what I mean.

79
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.500
Cynthia We: Yeah, yeah, totally.

80
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And then their color. Color coded so that you can you already have them set she gets too complicated. Nobody's gonna do it.

81
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.950
Cynthia We: Right.

82
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.500
Cynthia We: Give us an awesome I am thinking that this, um, this will help to get into

83
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, yeah, I think, help us all so handy.

84
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.400
Yeah.

85
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:19.920
Cynthia We: He is graduating today. However, we had a very, very difficult week of trying to get him to do his work.

86
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.230
Cynthia We: Oh, and, um,

87
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.010
Cynthia We: And then the therapist called me on Monday.

88
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.360
Cynthia We: Yeah, and said, I've never seen him like this.

89
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.080
Cynthia We: He's, he's so disconnected. He's so detached. I'm so depressed.

90
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, baby.

91
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:54.240
Cynthia We: And he's like, how do you. He's like, I really feel like nice to see some friends. First of all, one friend. He's like, pick one friend. That's one family that's quarantine that you feel safe of him playing with

92
00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:09.630
Cynthia We: And I'm so we're doing that he's gonna go bike riding with his friend Sam tomorrow. Okay. Um, but he also said you guys need. He's like, I'll just tell you, you know, he's like you know I'm divorced and I'm like, yeah.

93
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:31.080
Cynthia We: I'm. He said, My I found out that my second grader hadn't done 18 assignments and I flip the lid and and I was like, so, um, you know, oh my god, what's going on how we can get this done. And I called my axe and she said, Just could just relax. It doesn't matter.

94
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.270
Cynthia We: And, um,

95
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:46.140
Cynthia We: I had said that to Scott earlier this week. I'm like, perhaps, that this is such a strange time, maybe, maybe it's so different and so weird and so on.

96
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:58.920
Cynthia We: Maybe what we do as parents right now doesn't count for the future, like maybe we're not if we if we say nothing to him. We're not raising someone that will never do that work like

97
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:06.600
Cynthia We: I don't really know, but I'm like, I can't stand the stress and the yelling and and the fights between the two of them.

98
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:20.070
Cynthia We: And I'm taken like this week. I got to be the good guy because he was so mad with with Scott, but then I wasn't successful. He didn't do, he did half of his cyber city.

99
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're the administrators at the school aren't saying they're not making an exceptional way of addressing grades.

100
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: With the exceptional environment. It's not matching them, you're not hearing. Hey, don't worry about it there. There's no end date for this this this assignment you guys can turn them in whenever you're not hearing an exception going on from the school.

101
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.160
I'm

102
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.890
Cynthia We: Not really.

103
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That surprises me so that's that's a school that's not doing the exception, which I know our schools are math.

104
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.450
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think they told the kids the exception.

105
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you just don't have to know what they are.

106
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.150
Cynthia We: I just think and and i think that they told the kids. There's no way you're going to fail. During this time,

107
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I

108
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.200
Cynthia We: Have the parents like we

109
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:17.250
Cynthia We: Were like but you should do your work, but you're supposed to do your work. You didn't have very much work to do. This is all they asked you to do.

110
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:35.370
Cynthia We: So because the more you push and that's what Greg said he's like the more you push the more he's not going to do it like he's just like I was when I was his age like don't forced me. Don't try and control me

111
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:55.200
Cynthia We: I don't handle it. But Scott thinks that we've failed now because we didn't he didn't get the personal assessment done the thing is he lied to me about doing it. He said he was doing it. Um, instead he watched YouTube all day.

112
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.000
Cynthia We: He did get a stop motion done. It was amazing.

113
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.800
Cynthia We: You know, the things he did do, he did an amazing job. Yeah.

114
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.190
Cynthia We: Like way over the top, way beyond what they wanted.

115
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.220
Cynthia We: It's just some

116
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.910
Cynthia We: seems to think that this means

117
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.890
Cynthia We: That we're raising somebody who's gonna be lazy, who's not going to be able to get a job because they don't know how to work. And, uh,

118
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.060
Cynthia We: I just think that we can we can let it go. This time, like, I don't think that it means anything

119
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, wait a minute.

120
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So I heard what you said that he's interpreting that have five items five assignments. He did one bit.

121
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.300
Cynthia We: Too. Yeah.

122
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.990
Cynthia We: He did to

123
00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: To get them well and they were ones. He was interested in. And that means he's lazy and he will mount to nothing.

124
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.650
Cynthia We: That's pretty extreme, isn't it.

125
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's extreme

126
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at your own behavior and how you're sleeping.

127
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, are you is productive.

128
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.330
Cynthia We: Hello.

129
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And imagine the helplessness of a child.

130
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.360
Right.

131
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And hearing permission that it's okay that it really doesn't matter about around the thing didn't want to do to begin with.

132
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, that's just that's too tempting.

133
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.260
Yeah.

134
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. He's gonna win this argument because he's going to be like I told you didn't matter.

135
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:46.260
Yeah.

136
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, and then the damage that's happening in your guys's relationship. Oh.

137
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, Cindy. I'm sorry you're going through this

138
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.910
Cynthia We: I finally just told Scott, he had to talk to Greg about it because I didn't want to argue with him anymore.

139
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.030
Cynthia We: I think he, I think you I'm the one that spoke with Greg. I was the one that was like

140
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:21.720
Cynthia We: Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. You're right. You're totally right my instincts were right, I'm gonna, we're gonna just lay off.

141
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.610
Cynthia We: It's not

142
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.930
Cynthia We: It's not, it doesn't mean anything. It's a pandemic, it's never happened before.

143
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I

144
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.320
Cynthia We: Mean, we're bad mom, dad,

145
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.360
Cynthia We: Does it mean he's a bad kid.

146
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.670
Cynthia We: Oh,

147
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But not only that, I mean, I thought I heard you say that Scott acknowledge that or was that the therapist that said, Hey, I was like that too. If you push really hard when I was in our lesson. I would just say, Screw you. That was you. Okay.

148
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right.

149
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:09.870
Cynthia We: Not necessarily about school work because that was kind of the law was laid down and I was expected. I, I didn't really mess around. I was I'm mighty I needed my teachers to like me so

150
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.340
Cynthia We: I did all my work.

151
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.650
Cynthia We: By about other things. If my dad would push. I would push back twice as hard

152
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:18.690
Right.

153
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.220
Cynthia We: And I resented trying to be I resented being controlled

154
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like that feeling.

155
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.210
Cynthia We: I'm so, so like

156
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:46.320
Cynthia We: It's just the dynamics of the relationships are what's really weird because

157
00:14:47.490 --> 00:15:01.020
Cynthia We: He's always Scott has always been able to talk to you again about his schoolwork, and get it done. But this times, um, you know, it's so volatile that chickens. Like, I'll let my my check up on me.

158
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:11.130
Cynthia We: Like he's totally playing two of us against each other. And, um, and we buy right into it. And so then I check in and him and he

159
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:28.530
Cynthia We: He seemed to be doing his work, but now that I find out he wasn't Scott, that's all men, and he's he's he's, he doesn't know where to send his anger, you know, he's mad. He's mad that I failed to get together to do this one personal assignment.

160
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.690
Cynthia We: I don't

161
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:38.640
Cynthia We: This is interesting. So I know that it's so dysfunctional, but I don't really know to do

162
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So basic recipes, whether you're finessed with the unit unique values and beliefs of a family are that at the mother and father are unified front, so you're aware of the splitting. And so that's where taking us his power is splitting. You can you to argue and

163
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't you know

164
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.290
Hey,

165
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your shoe.

166
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:04.950
Cynthia We: On me

167
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.220
Cynthia We: Is

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.260
Cynthia We: Do you see you can you see I

169
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: cute though. I think it's cute so

170
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.280
Cynthia We: This is Sylvester

171
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.980
Cynthia We: So lover such a clever name.

172
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.620
Cynthia We: We let our we let to name him.

173
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.860
Cynthia We: When he was a baby when he was like four

174
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:26.820
Cynthia We: So, yeah.

175
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.590
Cynthia We: My mom and dad. I remember me trying to split them and they would not

176
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there.

177
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.510
Cynthia We: They were like,

178
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so the the the party line is you know what

179
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me talk with mom. First, I'll get back to you. Let me talk with dad for a second. Back to you, that's, that's

180
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. Yeah.

181
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.270
Cynthia We: Dad was kicked out of the conversation, though, because of his, his temper and his

182
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.910
Cynthia We: scariness when he's mad.

183
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:03.870
Cynthia We: So,

184
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: has kicked out.

185
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:12.360
Cynthia We: What we can what refused to even to refuse to even deal with him because he kept kept getting so explosive

186
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.340
Cynthia We: And I'm

187
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Not up for a child to decide that. Remember the thing

188
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I just said.

189
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:20.910
Cynthia We: Yeah.

190
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.370
Cynthia We: You're right, you're right, except that

191
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:29.430
Cynthia We: Lola was crying. I was I was furious. So

192
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.050
Cynthia We: I'm

193
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:38.580
Cynthia We: Scott was I maybe I should just step back. Maybe I shouldn't deal with this since I can't control myself.

194
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.270
Cynthia We: Maybe you should be and look

195
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

196
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.280
Cynthia We: A piece of the family.

197
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:58.620
Cynthia We: Yeah, he's totally manipulated it and and pushed Scott button Scott's buttons until

198
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.150
Cynthia We: It's so obvious when you look back at it.

199
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right so Scott's here. It's like you to talk to each other.

200
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the plan. Where's the compromise. What is it, then, that is the one thing

201
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.190
Cynthia We: That you say yeah

202
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You show them. One thing you both say the same thing. That's it.

203
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I rendered I'm rendered useless because i can't i can't manage my own time.

204
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.310
Cynthia We: You know, Andy's being dramatic.

205
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.450
Cynthia We: Because he doesn't

206
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.750
Cynthia We: Think dramatic because he's immature sometimes about things like this.

207
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.450
Cynthia We: As we all are.

208
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.110
Cynthia We: One more word. Yeah.

209
00:18:44.730 --> 00:19:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It means. It means, but that's what what were the, the husband, wife come together and you talk about. So what does it mean to you. Scott that Tegan underperforms not what you project will happen to Teague and Scott. What does it mean to you.

210
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah.

211
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. And then what does it mean to you, you do it in here with me because you have a me. And so you say, oh, it means if I fail. I'm not a good mom you go there right but when he doesn't have a me. That's what we are to each other is where each other so helpers, you know,

212
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Each other get deeper

213
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean to you, Scott, that he underperforms how because I see the intensity it you're motivated by something right um

214
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that affect the image of you or you know the same things that you and I do

215
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do the same thing.

216
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.600
Cynthia We: Yeah, it must be the

217
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, he would answer.

218
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:01.800
Yeah.

219
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.050
Cynthia We: Yeah, he

220
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:07.980
Cynthia We: Might know

221
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. Am I being naive that the the marriage right now is so rocky that these kind of conversations are really just unreasonable, or am I

222
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:24.330
Cynthia We: Oh, no, no, no. I feel like I'm in fact we have been able to talk

223
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.680
Cynthia We: Like normal human beings, a lot this week.

224
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.650
Cynthia We: Please like we've had many conversations where I actually felt like he was my friend again.

225
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.900
Cynthia We: Oh my god.

226
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:50.250
Cynthia We: That's a great because these are tired. These are circumstances where I would feel like the opposite would be true, but

227
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.180
Cynthia We: We do come back together. Yeah.

228
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's amazing. That's really beautiful. Can you told him how that feels. And maybe this another time to do that.

229
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.480
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think this is the time to do that. Yeah.

230
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you can leave with a compliment.

231
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.570
Cynthia We: Yeah.

232
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.350
Yeah.

233
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And a tenderness, Cindy, if you want to, which is

234
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I do this with one

235
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to sit and she brings this stuff up, like, oh, I don't want to look at it. No, no, no, I don't want to feel like a bad mom awful but then I see it's not the whole truth that's just

236
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm telling myself. But that's not true. There's so much evidence to the contrary, so much other evidence and sometimes it's helpful to have someone sort of shed a light on that.

237
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could do that same right. Would you share the AI stuff to give say

238
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

239
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this making you think about

240
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.470
Cynthia We: Well I, I will. I wish Scott had somebody to talk to. Because I think

241
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.940
Cynthia We: Being inside your own head, and in my case to like when you don't have somebody to talk to being inside your own head is like

242
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.210
Cynthia We: The same old echo chamber similar ship going around. There's no new information coming in.

243
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:35.280
Cynthia We: And and then you feel a shit about yourself all the time. It's a vicious cycle vicious circle. This is

244
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:37.350
Cynthia We: Something I

245
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.610
Cynthia We: Can remember

246
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.890
Cynthia We: All circle. Yeah, right.

247
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: around around around same track so

248
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more.

249
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.660
Cynthia We: I had a terrible phone with my sister. This week, too.

250
00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh boy.

251
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.180
Um,

252
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.130
Cynthia We: She

253
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.250
Cynthia We: She believes that the virus is a conspiracy by the left

254
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.290
Cynthia We: Okay to

255
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:22.560
Cynthia We: To get the people in the red states comfortable accepting money from the government so that the blue states could take over with their socialist agenda.

256
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:36.540
Cynthia We: And I said, Well, what about the rest of the world because that sells it makes sense that they would be in on it with the blue states and she just railroads just went over that she's been reading that far right.

257
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.510
Cynthia We: Conspiracy shit.

258
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:47.010
Cynthia We: Like she totally has bought into it and I'm you know i'm i'm super duper liberal and

259
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.680
Cynthia We: I'm the eyeball and my family.

260
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

261
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:59.460
Cynthia We: But my parents are very respectful of that. Like they just kind of like, that's fine. Cindy sending us the article, you know, and we're going to read it and we're just going to

262
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:07.830
Cynthia We: That same thing about my sister start sending all this stuff that's fake total, complete faintness and um

263
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:15.870
Cynthia We: And discredited new sources and and like this video that kept getting taken down off of YouTube because it was, um,

264
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.730
Cynthia We: It was a misinformation. Yeah.

265
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:36.720
Cynthia We: Um, so, so she said her last thing that she said was that she and her husband went out to Kroger's, mind you. She lives in Plymouth Michigan, which is really a fancy suburb of Detroit, you have to go actually in a minute.

266
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.510
Cynthia We: They took their gun.

267
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.760
Cynthia We: And they without a mask.

268
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, gee.

269
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.940
Cynthia We: Because two weeks ago, she was talking about wearing masks and wearing gloves and

270
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:54.780
Cynthia We: And without taking your gun out to the grocery store for so

271
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.180
Cynthia We: I said, what

272
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: In the world is knowing effing crazy

273
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.580
Cynthia We: It is

274
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.150
Cynthia We: And those people on the far right.

275
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:24.360
Cynthia We: I've read a lot about it because I'm like who are these people. Why, why are they trying to why what's going on. And I understand there's the liberal and the, the liberal pansies and the conservative me. I'm so tough and our president is leading

276
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.000
Cynthia We: The wrong side and

277
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: you rephrase that leading what

278
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.050
Cynthia We: What is

279
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Leading I think that word is

280
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.780
Cynthia We: Leading yes he's pretending to leave.

281
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:44.220
Cynthia We: I think he is in charge of the wrong side he's he's misinformation throwing this information around and, and, um,

282
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:57.030
Cynthia We: So yeah, she's a huge Trump supporter and her husband's a Republican, but he's not a Trump supporter. But there he then he's carrying his guns like they're all losing their mind and um

283
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:04.140
Cynthia We: I just can't take the stupidity makes me so mad and the believing news sources that

284
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:19.980
Cynthia We: Aren't really new sources, their newsletters put out by some random guy who lives who doesn't have any credibility because he's never he's not a news person. I went to journalism school like I have great respect for new sources and

285
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.560
Cynthia We: So,

286
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We are we are at the top. And I've got to jump out this group I'm

287
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:38.340
