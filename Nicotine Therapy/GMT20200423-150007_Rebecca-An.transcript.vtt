00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:50.250
Jessica Freeman: And after that, Dominique has a stew like mindfulness or we breathe and like, think of our spine as a tree trunk.

152
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:58.620
Jessica Freeman: You know, some bullshit. I go along with it. I do, I do. I try to keep an open mind, but just between you and me.

153
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:00.750
Jessica Freeman: It's not my thing.

154
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:01.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, you're the

155
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.110
Jessica Freeman: Hokey Pokey

156
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.200
Jessica Freeman: And then she'll ask questions. Question and like last night. It was like

157
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.130
Jessica Freeman: The personal check in that everybody had to do was

158
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:24.150
Jessica Freeman: Sorry think Brock was like, mentally, physically, emotionally, where are you

159
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.030
Jessica Freeman: So, you know, and nobody ever wants to talk. So I'll talk. Obviously, I like to talk

160
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.730
Jessica Freeman: And so I'm like, mentally, I feel soft

161
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.020
Jessica Freeman: I feel

162
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.880
Jessica Freeman: Like, I need a challenge.

163
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:50.790
Jessica Freeman: And then physically like I'm good. I'm healthy. But, you know, the group is pretty late at night. So by the time it comes along. I'm like, I'm ready to like it's literally bed time

164
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.480
Yeah.

165
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.390
Jessica Freeman: And then emotionally

166
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.640
Jessica Freeman: I, what did I say

167
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:11.850
Jessica Freeman: I don't remember what I said, but I think it's like I'm conflicted this what I said I'm conflicted between like I'm hopeful because we're all talking about reopening

168
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:24.480
Jessica Freeman: But I also I'm watching the news, I'm hearing what our governor has to say I'm reading about these phases and I just feel like it's going to take a really long time.

169
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.350
Jessica Freeman: Long time

170
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:25.920
Yeah.

171
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.190
Jessica Freeman: Honestly, I kind of like being at home, you know, not having to worry about working it's

172
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.270
Jessica Freeman: Really nice.

173
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:49.830
Jessica Freeman: It frees me up to pay more attention to my kid and you know do some things with him that I normally wouldn't get a chance to do, which is really cool. I like this it's quality time. I just wish that we could break it up with like, Oh, we're going to go to the aquarium today or

174
00:15:49.860 --> 00:16:01.980
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, we're gonna go to the park today and we can't do anything that's What's hard about it. I love being home with him. I'm fine with not working, and I've got money right now, which I'm trying

175
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.780
Jessica Freeman: To blow through but I'm doing good at that. I'm really smart with my money so

176
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

177
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.870
Jessica Freeman: Going off camera for a moment.

178
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.190
Jessica Freeman: But I'm still hearing

179
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any word from your bosses.

180
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: anywhere, any word from your bosses from your work. We can't

181
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.970
Jessica Freeman: Know they said they were going to

182
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.610
Jessica Freeman: Check in with me every week, but they're not which honestly is fine with me because I don't have anything to say.

183
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:41.040
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, me and my point really clear unless until I have somewhere for him to go so that I can work again.

184
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:42.330
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

185
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Someplace for him to go that he's happy at

186
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That it doesn't disrupt him. Right, right.

187
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.090
Jessica Freeman: Like school I am to go back to school. That's what I need.

188
00:16:54.930 --> 00:17:00.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any idea when they are planning on letting know next year. No school this year.

189
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:19.530
Jessica Freeman: Well, um, he's like enrolled and APS and he's getting the online classes and we're going to continue to do that through the end of the school year. And if we get to phase two by June 1 then he'll be able to go for the month of June, you know, part time like

190
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:33.750
Jessica Freeman: I have three hours a day to this social communication class slash developmental preschool and they're talking about putting him in kindergarten next year. And I don't think he's ready for that we're about to have the third IEP meeting.

191
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.070
Jessica Freeman: Since I moved here in January three,

192
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.300
Three is a lot.

193
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:51.240
Jessica Freeman: But it's to talk about the kindergarten transition. I don't think he's ready, especially with a break or he's had no services and no school like I don't think he's he's ready to go to kindergarten.

194
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:51.960
He said,

195
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you keep them from going

196
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:06.660
Jessica Freeman: I don't know what my options are. But will I really hope that he can go in person to this class in June. I think I'll be a big, big help.

197
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:16.200
Jessica Freeman: And then, yeah, he'll go back to school at the first of the year. And I think that he should stay in the social communication class.

198
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.010
Mm hmm.

199
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.050
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, how to communicate in a classroom setting.

200
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

201
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:31.800
Jessica Freeman: They use a lot of pecs and pictures and they have like the kids, whether or not they speak, they have to communicate what they want.

202
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.170
Jessica Freeman: So like if they want to play with, blah, blah, blah. They get the picture. They take it to the teacher.

203
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:49.770
Jessica Freeman: And then they can play with it, like they can't just go grab anything like they have to communicate what they want and they talk about feelings and they talk about weather and the date and things that we don't really talk about here.

204
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so it's good for him.

205
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.400
Jessica Freeman: I think a good solid year of that would be would prepare him for kindergarten.

206
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.330
Right.

207
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:08.700
Jessica Freeman: I'm sure I mean they'll do what i i'm sure that if I say I don't want him to go to kindergarten yet. Then, though.

208
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.760
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, cooperate, they have to. He's not ready.

209
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:21.600
Jessica Freeman: Right, especially if you look at the report from all the evaluations that they did on him. They're saying he's cognitively below two years old and first of all that bullshit.

210
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.560
Jessica Freeman: But surely that's enough to

211
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.430
Jessica Freeman: Keep him back.

212
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:27.360
Right.

213
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.070
Jessica Freeman: Not right.

214
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when is it

215
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.100
Jessica Freeman: When what

216
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're meeting.

217
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.740
Jessica Freeman: My a meaning.

218
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your i mean

219
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.530
Jessica Freeman: This may something on my calendar.

220
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.960
Jessica Freeman: Me 12 maybe

221
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How is he getting a lot doing in a zoom in his school. I mean, is he doing okay.

222
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.880
Jessica Freeman: He's getting better at it, the more we do it.

223
00:19:52.590 --> 00:20:01.050
Jessica Freeman: We did it all last week, except for Monday. So Tuesday through Friday. And then we did it. We had speech.

224
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:13.500
Jessica Freeman: Yesterday morning and then we did school yesterday at noon. We're off today because the teacher has an IEP meeting and can't do the special class for him.

225
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:24.240
Jessica Freeman: So he'll have speech tomorrow morning. And then he'll have speech class at noon and then we're going to try to hook them up with

226
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.570
Jessica Freeman: The rest of the classroom on

227
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:29.790
Jessica Freeman: On

228
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:31.590
Jessica Freeman: Monday.

229
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cool, cool.

230
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good stuff.

231
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.460
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and also the

232
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.050
Jessica Freeman: APS

233
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:52.350
Jessica Freeman: Like the his, his teacher and some of the other developmental preschool teachers have like videos and online activities.

234
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.940
Jessica Freeman: I haven't done that yet.

235
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.570
Jessica Freeman: Because we just been kind of getting used to what we're doing. And he's been

236
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.250
Jessica Freeman: Just, you know, yeah. Great.

237
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:13.980
Jessica Freeman: But I'm going to dig into that you know i'm i'm not sure about today. But between now and Monday. I'm going to get on the site. And, you know, find videos of his teachers so that he can get more used to her.

238
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:23.730
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, the activities and try to do that. And I went to the store and I got all the crafty stuff that was on the teachers list. So we can do stuff at home. So I'm going to do.

239
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

240
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good.

241
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:32.100
Jessica Freeman: And the fact that I don't have to worry about working makes it so much less stressful.

242
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, we're on the same page there. I was thinking the same thing. You know, I was about ready to say it.

243
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just the fact that you're able to be present and be there, you know, and work with him.

244
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is, you know, is huge for him, you know,

245
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:56.250
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, he's starting to get really, really attached like he wants to sleep with me. He doesn't want to be away from me ever which

246
00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:05.010
Jessica Freeman: I'm, I'm going to hold my ground on this. You're not going to sleep with you can sleep in your own bed. I know about that problem. We are not going to start that problem.

247
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.040
Jessica Freeman: But he's he's really really attached

248
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:08.940
Yeah.

249
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're is number one. Of course he is.

250
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.600
You know,

251
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

252
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:23.400
Jessica Freeman: I just have to stand firm like, you know, mommy needs time. I mean needs her own bed mommy needs time away like it just is what it is.

253
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yep.

254
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is

255
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because once you start it. Oh my gosh, it's so hard to break that habit when you get a going

256
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.000
Jessica Freeman: You know, I know.

257
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.790
Jessica Freeman: With my older son Brendan. Speaking of Brendan

258
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:58.920
Jessica Freeman: The have their house sold and they bought a new house in Texas and they are closing both properties on May 22 So Brendan will be living in Plano, Texas, which is near Dallas beginning at the end of May.

259
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. Yeah.

260
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That happened fast.

261
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.320
Jessica Freeman: Well, when Scott puts his mind to something

262
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Happens fast.

263
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.890
Jessica Freeman: He will force it. He's not like a, you know, let's let the universe, you know,

264
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:25.890
Jessica Freeman: Give us a sign or, you know, listen for any sort of leading or, you know, no higher power Scott is

265
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.650
Jessica Freeman: The God of all eternity in his own mind.

266
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know a few of them.

267
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.930
Jessica Freeman: And I fucking hate him.

268
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.760
Jessica Freeman: I hate him.

269
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gotta kill them with kindness.

270
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.730
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, we're cool. Last thing. I mean, that's what I do. Took me a long time to learn that I used to let him push my buttons.

271
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.510
Jessica Freeman: But I don't have any buttons left when it comes to him.

272
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.370
Jessica Freeman: A long time and worse for 15 years

273
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, a long time.

274
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.550
It is

275
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:18.540
Jessica Freeman: But yeah everything's good on that front. Brendan, spend some time with us here in Albuquerque. And once he gets settled in Texas, and he wants to finish school

276
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:25.560
Jessica Freeman: At his current high school online, which is an option, which I think is a great idea.

277
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.980
Jessica Freeman: Because yeah, I think you could do really well with online school

278
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.420
Jessica Freeman: Send your computer games.

279
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:45.810
Jessica Freeman: And it'll take away the, the social bullshit that you know that I fear for him switching schools all his credits. You know, there's not gonna be any issues with his credits and then maybe even he can fly back and like do commencement with his friends, you know,

280
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.670
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

281
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

282
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.880
Jessica Freeman: But I'm actually Scott's the box. And if I like it. He'll probably do the opposite.

283
00:24:55.410 --> 00:25:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I hope you let him do it. You know, but I mean, that gives him closure with his friends that he can. You know what I mean.

284
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't be let them do it.

285
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.220
Jessica Freeman: I do too.

286
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially since this virtual there's no reason why he shouldn't

287
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:09.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

288
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To cross fingers.

289
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:32.820
Jessica Freeman: Well, he's just such a petty fucker. Like, you know, he knows that I'm in support of it and he would probably say no. Just despite me, you know, damn, the consequences for Brendan, you know, it's all about Scott getting his little digs in that's how he is. That's the kind of human being he is

290
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.040
That's crazy.

291
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's not fair, you know, to your son.

292
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.800
Jessica Freeman: At all. Never been fair to our son.

293
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.700
Never

294
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.500

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No way to leave a voicemail. I kind of feel like that's like really cutting, especially with small businesses or businesses, that's kind of like cutting business form, you know,

438
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I've been able to have that contact to be able to call back

439
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.320
Jessica Freeman: My little boy.

440
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:17.640
Jessica Freeman: And you take my dog to the vet my little boy needs to be seen by a doctor and these are the things that would normally be no big deal. But right now, that's like super stressful.

441
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.450
Yeah.

442
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.030

Jessica Freeman: Are you getting crazy virtual clinic through Presbyterian health care services. So there's hospital and they have urgent care and they have, you know, women's medicine and this whole big network and we were insured through that so

447
00:39:49.170 --> 00:40:01.830
Jessica Freeman: I went through the whole process of getting everything online so that I can get a virtual visit so we can have, you know, like this. Yeah, with a doctor and I'm told that they can prescribe you know without seeing in person.

448
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

449
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.790
Jessica Freeman: But they don't have any of his charts, you know,

450
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.810
Jessica Freeman: Ketosis charts, Indiana.

451
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, they got a request his records.

452
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.640
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

453
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

454
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:18.930
Well,

455
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.200
Jessica Freeman: Is he needs antibiotics.

456
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:25.710
Jessica Freeman: We

457
00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Had a lot of

458
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of stuff coming out of his ear.

459
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:31.830
Jessica Freeman: gross stuff.

460
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:42.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what those drains are for is to help to where they, you know, there's no build up behind that your drum so that it's able to come out right.

461
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.530
Jessica Freeman: Well, I think that the other one might have come out and that's what the problem is.

462
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long ago did he give it give them in

463
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.490
Jessica Freeman: December of 2017

464
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Time, maybe. Yeah. Maybe they work their way out. It's worked its way out.

465
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:09.390
Jessica Freeman: I know one has last time you had is yours. Check. He only had one left. So I'm thinking that the other one came out and that's

466
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.740
Jessica Freeman: Maybe I need to take him to an EMT again.

467
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: haven't checked out and looked at

468
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.610
Jessica Freeman: Maybe he needs more tubes bigger tubes. I don't know.

469
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.270
Jessica Freeman: It's just not a great time for this.

470
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, absolutely not. Right now, when there's no hands on nothing.

471
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:30.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At all.

472
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.690
Jessica Freeman: And I don't want to expose him to anything.

473
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:34.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

474
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.360
Jessica Freeman: Because he gets sick really easily and I read a story about a five year old girl that died from the CO good

475
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.310
Jessica Freeman: Years old.

476
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:48.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's it you know little kids are vulnerable. You know what I mean their immune system isn't

477
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 100% bill, it's building, but it's not 100% so

478
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.700
Jessica Freeman: He's just really prone to respiratory problems.

479
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:06.750
Jessica Freeman: He always has been said croup. Twice he said so many ear infections like I lost count. And he's had sinus infections and respiratory issues.

480
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:12.360
Jessica Freeman: He's being so good right now I know he wants my attention.

481
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.090
Jessica Freeman: You would come sit with mommy can come sit with mommy.

482
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:19.890
Jessica Freeman: Mommy.

483
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now,

484
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.040
Jessica Freeman: He's wandering around.

485
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.380
Jessica Freeman: On the love sheet.

486
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.820
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, so that was my list.

487
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you did good on your list.

488
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Actually, you know,

489
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.120
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, why not

490
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

491
00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:42.000
Because, I mean,

492
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You should because it's important. You know what I mean. You didn't procrastinate on anything you might on top of

493
00:42:49.530 --> 00:43:06.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: handling it getting your schedule bill is huge right we get a routine, we get a schedule, we get a routine. We start, you know, living by that routine, which makes it better. There's a structure, you know, and you know that when you go back to work. All of that is going to have to be altered.

494
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And changed a little bit.

495
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's going to take an adjustment. You know, when you go back to when you go back to work. And when he goes to school. You know what I mean going to be different. Being in the house for a few months, and then having, you know, having to go back to work is going to suck.

496
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:28.980
Jessica Freeman: Oh man, I know, because you know I lived in that RECOVERY HOUSE AND like I didn't have any support.

497
00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:48.180
Jessica Freeman: I had good jobs. I had to ride the bus. I had to get like find a place to live. You know, all that stuff without help. AFTER THE RECOVERY HOUSE AND I bootstrapped my way out of the gutter and made shit happen you know on my own. I did it all on my own all of it.

498
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.750
Jessica Freeman: So I know what's up man. I know it's not easy being not working.

499
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.830
Jessica Freeman: Anytime you're, you're not working. It's an adjustment to go back to work.

500
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. It is

501
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially getting up and leaving the house and you know what I mean. You don't want to leave the house but you know you gotta leave the house and it's just you know it's tough.

502
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.150
Jessica Freeman: Cold

503
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At least it's not cold. That's right, at least, you don't have to go outside the rain.

504
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.260
You know,

505
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: makes a big difference.

506
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.710
Jessica Freeman: Really knows

507
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes a difference on what shoes you wear makes a difference on white clothes, which

508
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.060
Jessica Freeman: Makes you have to shave your legs.

509
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. Which is, okay, when you've got beautiful weather outside. You know what I mean.

510
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, you. The, the motivation and the drive to be okay with you know having to do those those things pretty amazing. Yeah.

511
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.160
Jessica Freeman: And you get to that, you know, where cute dresses and

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I can't wait to get a pedicure, I am so ready.

516
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This having to do it myself, is just utter bullshit.

517
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:13.170
Jessica Freeman: Oh, I agree. And the last pedicure I got was a gel pedicure yeah so

518
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:17.100
Jessica Freeman: He gets that shut off my toes is just gonna have to grow out

519
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:17.670
Yeah.

520
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, unless you have a little Dremel, then you can Dremel it off but

521
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:23.940
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I don't have

522
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.340
Jessica Freeman: To sell those are good.

523
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know if they do, they I'm sure they do.

524
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.900
Jessica Freeman: Is it target you can order stuff and then they'll at least our target and

525
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:46.020
Jessica Freeman: You can order stuff online and then they'll bring you drive up and they'll bring it out to you and it's ready in like, you know, they say four hours, but usually it's like two or three

526
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:54.180
Jessica Freeman: I place to target order last night that's ready and we're going to go pick it up at some point today when we feel like leaving the house, but that's really convenient like

527
00:45:54.210 --> 00:46:02.250
Jessica Freeman: I can do one thing, like I had to order dry erase markers for the class just one thing and go and pick it up.

528
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:12.600
Jessica Freeman: And, you know, grocery stores, it's more complicated that you have to order like a week out, you know, and then they might not have it like I did it. I did a pickup order at Smiths.

529
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:27.780
Jessica Freeman: And it was I put it on, on a Thursday, and then it wasn't going to be ready until Tuesday, which is fine. I plan for that, but then when I went even have half the shit that I ordered it was like I waited all this time and I didn't even get what I needed.

530
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:37.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy. You know, I, I do the same thing. It's Instacart. I do it for my daughter, my 16 year old daughter lives in Oregon.

531
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, she keeps complaining about not having the food she likes at her dad's house. And so I'll go to Safeway.

532
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:57.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because safeways right down the road from their house and all do the same thing. I will go in. I'll order her food and I can have it as long as I do it in the daytime. I can have it delivered to her within two hours.

533
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice. Yeah.

534
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.270
Jessica Freeman: Hmm. Cool.

535
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:16.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes it you know makes a big big big difference for sure, but I've noticed that you know what they'll do is they'll say, Okay, this is what you ordered and if they don't have that, you know, this is the equivalent. Are you willing to trade, you know,

536
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.740
Jessica Freeman: The thing is with kin. You cannot substitute. He's only going to eat exactly what it

537
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.250
Jessica Freeman: Is

538
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.320
Jessica Freeman: And that's all. So no substitutions. So problem.
