00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.750
Yeah.

152
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.010
Richelle Direny: Okay.

153
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.590
Richelle Direny: Okay, I take it back.

154
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.190
Richelle Direny: You said your father died three years ago.

155
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.210
Yeah.

156
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:29.490
Richelle Direny: And then your siblings. They had no history. So you did. You did say you didn't have your sister, your siblings have no history because she said she only wanted

157
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:38.250
Richelle Direny: So, um, but you said that. Very good. So all of your family lives in Ohio.

158
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.050
Letita Williams: Yes majority.

159
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.870
Richelle Direny: Now, so what are the things that I wanted to

160
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.580
Richelle Direny: For you, I know you

161
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.220
Richelle Direny: I know you said that you don't necessarily have

162
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.680
Richelle Direny: Issues with, you know, you're not addicted to alcohol or don't consider

163
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.740
Richelle Direny: myself falling apart. I know that you had some DUIs

164
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.110
Richelle Direny: Well, why do you think

165
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:11.730
Richelle Direny: That your, your appeal think you will benefit from this program at this capacity, where you're meeting for individual

166
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:20.970
Richelle Direny: And even. I mean, the group part. It's a little different, but because they're not prepared, even though you met with the providers. SHE'S NOT GIVING YOU, DR Jameson is not prescribing you anything. Right.

167
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:30.750
Richelle Direny: No. Okay. So why do you think it meeting with your probation officer. Why are, why do you think that they're strongly recommending that you

168
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:45.960
Letita Williams: He said, because it was core order. He said he don't really know much about this program. This is this first, you know, time having someone on probation that you know that he had that had to do this program. So he said he really don't know much about it, but it was court order.

169
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.120
Richelle Direny: But, you know, to

170
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:48.600
Letita Williams: Me, I

171
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.050
Richelle Direny: Know, you said that but outside of it being court ordered

172
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.250
Richelle Direny: Why do you think

173
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.580
Richelle Direny: Courts, you're the lawyer, the State attorney.

174
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:57.540
The judge

175
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.450
Letita Williams: To keep me out of jail, ma'am, because otherwise I wouldn't have to do 30 days in jail.

176
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:19.860
Letita Williams: He said he knew you wanted to. I said, Mr. I can't go to jail. Okay. I work, I can't go to nobody's jail so my options were to get the 30 days in jail or do probation. You know what this program. And so there was a better route to keep me out of jail so I did.

177
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.590
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then, so then let me put it to you like this.

178
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:30.870
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. If you're saying that all you had to do was go to to get incarcerated for 30 days right there's 30 days or you needed

179
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.770
Right.

180
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.230
Richelle Direny: It's either jail time going on probation.

181
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.490
Letita Williams: paying a fee for

182
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.300
Letita Williams: Probation

183
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.120
Richelle Direny: Having to be a part of this program.

184
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.990
Richelle Direny: Will be part of this program for i'm sure more than the 30 days.

185
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.740
I'm

186
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.880
Richelle Direny: Having to meet with me.

187
00:13:51.330 --> 00:14:01.860
Richelle Direny: Having to go through having to just do all of that. Now granted, each of our interaction here on this platform on from this sector, it's only one hour. I mean,

188
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.430
Richelle Direny: It's not anything when you compare it to everything else.

189
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:13.980
Richelle Direny: Why choose this route in comparison to doing 30 days of

190
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.120
Letita Williams: jail time.

191
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.310
Richelle Direny: And I'm just, I'm just asking because in my mind.

192
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:34.080
Richelle Direny: If I know and I'm just asking. I'm just logically because you're looking at it like jail time is jail time. How much if you had not done the 30 days. So that's all your days.

193
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.860
Letita Williams: I'm only ma'am. That's a long time, will you in jail.

194
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:44.160
Richelle Direny: I know, I know. I hear what I'm saying to you, 30 days 30 days. It's just a month 30 days.

195
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.840
Letita Williams: Right.

196
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.950
Richelle Direny: How much you paying for to be. Are you paying daily for revelation

197
00:14:50.490 --> 00:15:01.200
Letita Williams: No, I haven't even start paying yet my my probation officer told me next time we, you know, speak. I don't even have to go to Mansfield, you know, we're, you know, the charge happen.

198
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:08.670
Letita Williams: I don't have to go to Mansfield to go see him. He told me, we'll just do talk over the phone every. I think it's a month and a half.

199
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.070
Letita Williams: He said, once I get done with this He'll basically I basically be done here. Let me off.

200
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.300
Letita Williams: He said, I need to stay on the full year he said I'm let me off the Roku

201
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.190
Letita Williams: So, okay.

202
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.560
Richelle Direny: So you have to be on probation for a whole year.

203
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.440
Letita Williams: It's supposed to be a year, but he said he'll let me off before

204
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.780
Richelle Direny: But a whole year. Okay, even if he's saying that he's let you off because

205
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.450
Richelle Direny: I was just talking to somebody about this this morning about the whole concept of probation.

206
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:43.200
Richelle Direny: And comparison to serving out whatever time because I having limited knowledge now.

207
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.860
Richelle Direny: Little I do know is that they offer you.

208
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:54.270
Richelle Direny: Either 30 I mean either being incarcerated or going on probation.

209
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.320
Richelle Direny: But if you

210
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.400
Richelle Direny: Ever mess up whatever the terms of your probation is

211
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.810
Richelle Direny: Where I forgot your time right whatever that time is

212
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.250
Letita Williams: So,

213
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:11.610
Letita Williams: I just know maybe they can put a probation by nation out on us up to your PTO if he wants to send you to jail or not.

214
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:12.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, business.

215
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.650
Letita Williams: Person I don't get in trouble. So I'm like, I'll take the probation, you know,

216
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.720
Richelle Direny: The violation. I was told is that you have to comply with Bernhard health

217
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.480
Letita Williams: That's right. Correct. Yeah. Well, no, that's what the court. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's

218
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.270
Richelle Direny: Shorter your pro. Yes. So if you don't comply

219
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:30.960
Richelle Direny: With this

220
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.880
Richelle Direny: Brian part of the consequences is a violation of probation.

221
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.800
Richelle Direny: With when it comes on to adults, even though they threaten you with violation. I

222
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:48.840
Richelle Direny: Right, I'm going to assume that they don't necessarily violate you as quickly as how they make it they stayed because it's a whole process.

223
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.600
Richelle Direny: You have to go through to get you violated.

224
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:52.440
Letita Williams: Correct.

225
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.870
Richelle Direny: The whole process. I have to do to get you violated.

226
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.370
Richelle Direny: But I'm saying

227
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.940
Richelle Direny: The stress of having to check in with appeal for over a year, whether he keeps you on it for six months or for one year.

228
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.630
Richelle Direny: Having to pay the fee having to

229
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:13.200
Richelle Direny: Comply with this program and everything else that you have to do. My question is,

230
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.200
Richelle Direny: Not looking at it from, well that's 30 days. I don't want to be nobody juvenile 30 days.

231
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.070
Richelle Direny: Right if after 30 days I could put this behind me.

232
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:31.650
Richelle Direny: Why not take this route then for you to be dealing with chew for a whole year, possibly a whole year.

233
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.100
Richelle Direny: Right, that's my, that's what I'm asking.

234
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:46.950
Letita Williams: Because I don't want to go to jail is dirty and I don't want to be in there what on females is dirty. Ma'am, you guys share one shower when autumn females. And what this coronavirus going on. I'm not

235
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.540
Richelle Direny: In the current him in jail ain't got a word about know coronavirus right now.

236
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.140
Richelle Direny: What they what

237
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.900
Richelle Direny: They were coronavirus

238
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.160
Letita Williams: Hell well

239
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.060
Richelle Direny: Go to jail to go see somebody you know in jail because they better than you.

240
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:15.870
Letita Williams: Right. Well, I'm just saying I go on and nobody jail because it's dirty in there and I don't want to share a shower with autumn females. That's jails, just not for me. I can't do jail, I gotta go to work I got living things I have to do, man.

241
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.060
Letita Williams: I'm just curious.

242
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.130
Richelle Direny: Have you been in there before.

243
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.970
Letita Williams: For one day when I was younger. Like when I was like 21

244
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.000
Richelle Direny: Well,

245
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.300
Richelle Direny: That's still one trippin.

246
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.700
Letita Williams: That's Mark, I don't know. How about Martha Stewart probably had it may when she was in there. She got all that money.

247
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:49.260
Letita Williams: She had her own sale her, all she was in prison. So most like she had her own sale. You know, it was clean. She's pregnant fast stakes. You know when you'll be getting that treatment when you got that brand like Martha Stewart.

248
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:50.880
Letita Williams: Now,

249
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.820
Letita Williams: I do this, I'd be, this is just fine video chat is just five will be baby.

250
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:07.650
Letita Williams: And I can say about warm home and this is cool for an hour. It's still laugh. You still got your freedom. I'm cool. This way.

251
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.080
Letita Williams: This is me personally, how I feel about it. I prefer to do this.

252
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:20.790
Richelle Direny: I mean hey, that's fine. That's fine. I'm just saying I was just curious because, in my mind, I'm thinking for everything that

253
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.870
Letita Williams: I mean we do tomorrow.

254
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.050
Letita Williams: You will do the month in the workhouse

255
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.520
Richelle Direny: bothering me for a whole year. It doesn't just say a whole a whole year.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.040
Letita Williams: A whole month no drug test may

259
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.030
Letita Williams: Be drug tested. I don't have to go in to see my PO I'm

260
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.570
Letita Williams: Not reporting probation. Only thing I do is talk to him on the phone.

261
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.340
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Oh, so maybe if it was a little bit more intense or no.

262
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.020
Letita Williams: Right.

263
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.460
Letita Williams: No, I wouldn't know I would. Did this route.

264
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.510
Letita Williams: I wouldn't miss, Rochelle.

265
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.720
Letita Williams: Why I just leave it on them hard bunk beds.

266
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:18.240
Letita Williams: You'll notice that one day. One day, a long time ago, you may not even get a bomb, you may have to get one in and pull out things because they have a box available when I went in for that one day.

267
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:32.550
Letita Williams: He had this hard hard plastic Matt had to sleep on the left, the lights on at night. I'm like, no, this ain't no place for nobody. I gotta get out of here and my bail me out the next day.

268
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:39.750
Richelle Direny: For real, okay. I mean, I'm just, I'm just conceptualizing

269
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:52.590
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. You know why, when you think about like the 30 days. And again, I've spoken to people who have chosen probation over incarceration.

270
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:58.020
Richelle Direny: You say it's just better to just serve out your time because to deal with.

271
00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.460
Letita Williams: A power cord and

272
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.850
Richelle Direny: Everything else and I met I was speaking to someone who has to do with a probation officer now.

273
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:06.900
Richelle Direny: And

274
00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:16.710
Richelle Direny: He said, You know, that's even a trigger for for him. Anyway, that's a trigger for him when it comes on to his sobriety because they they speak to you like you're less than

275
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.830
Letita Williams: And just kind of a nice

276
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.200
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you got a nice one.

Letita Williams: I told he told me I had to do this no more than Kathleen Capri whatever her name is she gonna call him to say

280
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:40.980

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.080
Letita Williams: I'm done. I'm done.

Richelle Direny: That's a lot.

359
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.270
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so the question is,

360
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:48.210
Richelle Direny: Are you going to look at your experience now and your situation now insane.

361
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.370
Richelle Direny: Yes, I've learned from it, but it could have been avoided.

362
00:27:54.750 --> 00:28:02.730
Letita Williams: Correct. I've been thought that I've been thought that yet. I will share that to David. I thought that I said. Darn you know I

Letita Williams: Yeah, I had no business driving and drinking. You know, I know better already. But something's we know better, we still take a risk and doing it.

366
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.650
Richelle Direny: But this is that ok so the two times because what you said is two times

367
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.060
Richelle Direny: really lucky for the two times you decide to drink in a in a year.

368
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.500
Letita Williams: You've

369
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.460

Letita Williams: You know, or the 30 days in jails within 10 years you know if it's 10 years apart being you. Good. But if it's within the same 10 years, you get a DUI, then you know you got more stuff. You got to do.

374
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:23.070
Letita Williams: So I was blessed just to get hit with the probation and this now. That's what I'm telling you, because it could have been worse, it could have said you got to do them 30 days or 30 to 60 days, you know, the judges real nice with me.

375
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:30.480

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:35.340
Letita Williams: Oh, I can definitely let them know, Hey, you know, go with God, you know, don't get behind the wheel drinking and driving. If you won't drink stay at home. Stay safe, you know, and just don't drink and drive.

390
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.270

400
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:21.750
Richelle Direny: Talking about young people today tell us young people today make better choices is cliche. So how can you tell them based on

Richelle Direny: her son's wrong decision of drinking and driving

438
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.600
Richelle Direny: It just cost him his life, it cost them everybody

439
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.390

440
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:13.470

441
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.090
Letita Williams: She ended up making it, but it's a lot. She had to go through and she killed three other people in the car with her.

Richelle Direny: For you. I'm gonna say from a Biblical

458
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.950

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:33.150
Letita Williams: You do that right you handle that on your end, right, the weekly report. Okay, so I'm good. Alright, cool, cool.

582
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.140
Richelle Direny: But I had to

583
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.130
Richelle Direny: Go to your groups, I have to find out do each week that you you went to group.

584
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.430
Letita Williams: Yeah, on a group, baby. I enjoy it. I enjoy it.

585
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:43.770
Richelle Direny: Did you go this week.

586
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:53.130
Letita Williams: Yeah, I went this week. Yeah, did this. We know my group is what's today I thought this was my group, but didn't turn out to be individual

587
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.140
Richelle Direny: They only gave me

588
00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:09.330
Letita Williams: They only gave me a couple days. Let me hold on let me look at it real Shahada you probably could be to see me for a second. When she emailed me. This is what, let me see where this email Kathy. Let me see what Kathy does she say

589
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:10.620
Richelle Direny: Here.

590
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.530
Letita Williams: It says appointments in group schedule.

591
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:28.680
Letita Williams: Miss Williams for our discussion yesterday, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so she said you're expected to follow the treatment recommendations as a therapist, you have been assigned to weekly group therapy Tuesday at 915 Eastern star in

592
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:35.190
Letita Williams: THE 31st. See, it did. I didn't take it as I had to do it every Tuesday at 915 but I

593
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:35.550
Richelle Direny: Got it.

594
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.130
Letita Williams: Okay, I get it. Now, did I do with this Tuesday. No.

595
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:51.900
Letita Williams: I don't think I did because I thought it was just, you just scheduling it like each week I'll have to call in for an appointment. But now I noticed every Tuesday I log in every Tuesday.

596
00:44:53.010 --> 00:45:00.600
Letita Williams: It didn't says your next individual therapy appointment. Now, now, now it's making sense because then I'll explain stuff good when you talk to them.

597
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:06.540
Letita Williams: Now didn't send your next individual therapy appointment is on the ninth, which is today at eight.

598
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:14.250
Letita Williams: So cool. So now start logging in every Tuesday, you know, at nine o'clock I didn't, I didn't know it was supposed to be for every Tuesday.

599
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:27.300
Letita Williams: Now, that makes sense because I'm like they want me to call every week and get the appointment day and time. I'm like, that's a little bit too much for me. But, OK, now I noticed every Tuesday. I'll just log in this Tuesday and do it as well.

600
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:34.920
Richelle Direny: Every Tuesday at 9pm and with me. It wouldn't be every week.

601
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.370
Richelle Direny: I don't have time on my calendar for every me

602
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:39.570
Correct.

603
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:46.290
Richelle Direny: To what days are better for what what days are best for you.

604
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.150
Letita Williams: We can keep them on Thursdays, if you want, we can keep them on Thursdays, by which

605
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.220
Richelle Direny: You said your next appointment with your probation officers on the 27th.

606
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:10.680
Letita Williams: Let me make sure we're all on the shape I write everything down. So I know appointment notice on April 20th at 330 with my probation officer.

607
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:14.490

652
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.770
Richelle Direny: That's in two weeks. Right.

653
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:12.510
Letita Williams: Yeah.

654
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.060
Letita Williams: Okay, perfect. I got it.

655
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:22.860
Richelle Direny: But I'll send you. I'll send you. I'll send you a reminder

656
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:23.910
Okay.

657
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:33.390
Letita Williams: All right, now is it will be the same ID, the same I'm group ID to eight or 9515

658
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:34.530
Letita Williams: Every country.

659
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:37.170
Richelle Direny: It is, but you still have to check in through

660
00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.380
Letita Williams: The main ID, it's

661
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.510
Richelle Direny: Okay, but you still have to do that.

662
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.910
Letita Williams: Okay, so let me join us together.

663
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:58.140
Letita Williams: Now I'm getting the hang of it now because at first. I'm like this is an organized. That's what I kept on calling bright heart telling them like they want to explain it good, but you explained it better.

664
00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:07.080
Letita Williams: I got to do the group things every week. That makes sense or every Tuesday night I make sense. So now I know no or they didn't say that.

665
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.570
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because then then because then what's going to happen is that they're going to hold you accountable.

666
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:19.230
Letita Williams: For not shine. Correct. And I think that's what they have been doing, but they didn't tell me to do it every

667
00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:29.160
Richelle Direny: So this is the thing, in turn, okay. So in the with the report stuff that was the thing is you had, I think you had one appointment with me.

668
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:33.660
Richelle Direny: Right, like one or two appointments with me that you didn't come to

669
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:34.470
Letita Williams: And

670
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:49.770
Richelle Direny: They were holding you to because the reality was. You were never assigned to a group because you don't see that, sir. So I raised the question of, you know, are you supposed to attend group. Do you see the doctor. Like, and so

671
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:50.400
Letita Williams: Right.

672
00:50:50.730 --> 00:51:04.140
Richelle Direny: Um, so if you have attended if you had maybe a two appointments that you had with me. I don't think it would have went as far as it did. But now they're going to, they had to assign you to a group kind of

673
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:19.890
Richelle Direny: Integrate you to the full system. And so now you're you have something that you're following so right me you don't i don't it to me. It's not necessary for us to me all the time.

674
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:21.570
Letita Williams: Right.

675
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:22.470
You

676
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.670
Richelle Direny: See the reason you. I mean, you're saying that

677
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:27.240
Richelle Direny: Right.

678
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.680
Richelle Direny: Pretty good for you.

679
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:30.720
Letita Williams: Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

680
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:41.010
Richelle Direny: So for me, um, you know, if I would say that if it's continuous where you're on probation officer requires that you continue to attend.

681
00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:46.470
Richelle Direny: Right. And I would say, let's meet once a month and you do the group's weekly

682
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:54.720
Richelle Direny: Cool okay if that's something that he wants. So we will make that full determination, when we meet on the 23rd.

683
00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:56.040
Letita Williams: Sound good

684
00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.780
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

685
00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:09.390
Richelle Direny: So we'll check back in one more time for the month and then if it is that he's going to have you continue if you go to the group every week. Yes, you. We will just meet once a month.

686
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:11.100
Letita Williams: Okay. Sounds good. Michelle.

687
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:12.870
