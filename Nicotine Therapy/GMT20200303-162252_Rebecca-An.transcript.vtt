Donna Jochimsen: Sleep. I finally got at about quarter to four. I just gave that

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.070

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How have things been going are you still by yourself or

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.280
Donna Jochimsen: Excuse me, can you say that again.

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I said, how are things going are you still by yourself or is your dad back there.

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.970
Donna Jochimsen: No, my dad is right, he's still at my brothers.

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.860
Donna Jochimsen: Was liking it.

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.450
Yeah.

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.730
Donna Jochimsen: I went inside yesterday. He's like, Hi, how you doing this in a really good mood and man when he was over there by himself, he, he was depressed.

17
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.140
Donna Jochimsen: He would be crying you know just you missed my mom. So he would sit there and look at a picture of my mom. She died like 17 years ago but

18
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:30.540
Donna Jochimsen: He would look at our picture and get all sad and cry and then you'd want to be dead. And then that him, he'd start thinking about that he'd be scared to be there so

19
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.370
Donna Jochimsen: It was it was. Yeah. It happened a lot. So he's doing really, really well.

20
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

21
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What makes you feel better. It's just

22
00:01:42.630 --> 00:02:00.060
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it makes me feel really a lot better. That was a lot. It felt like a lot of responsibility. You know, I just, I hated it. When he would be depressed. I feel like I needed to do something to stop that. Or, you know, it was just hard.

23
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.490
Donna Jochimsen: It's hard and dimensions. And really, really awful disease. I hope I don't get it, because I don't want to do that to my kids.

24
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't blame me me there.

25
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.990
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

26
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At all.

27
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what your plans are why you have all this free time.

28
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:35.310
Donna Jochimsen: Oh my goodness, that is something I've been thinking about, I don't know. I need to think about that. I need to make a decision about what I want to do to i want to i i'm thinking about going back to work part time. I don't want to work full time, but I could do part time

29
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.850
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know where you are.

30
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.240
Donna Jochimsen: I'm just not sure i i think i can get a job as a teacher's aide, probably, but probably not at the schools.

31
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.730
Donna Jochimsen: But probably not tell school starts again next year. It's so late in the year.

32
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.170
Donna Jochimsen: But I might try to, you know, try to find something in the meantime.

33
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.630
Donna Jochimsen: I definitely need to do something.

34
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.300
Donna Jochimsen: fill my time I have way too much of it now.

35
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:15.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really, it's really cool because you get to, you know what I mean, it's like you get to make these choices you have these choices laid out in front of you now and

36
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.650
Yeah.

37
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.200
Donna Jochimsen: It's amazing.

38
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:35.640
Donna Jochimsen: I just don't quite know what to do. I've been taking care of somebody that was sick for about five or six years now, and it's just kind of odd. I don't I'm sitting here, I sit here and think, well, I'm almost done with all my housecleaning

39
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.330
Donna Jochimsen: And so what are you going to do next. I need to figure that out. I've been thinking about it. I just haven't

40
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.990
Donna Jochimsen: Really made a decision yet I'm leaning to like I said towards trying to find a part time job.

41
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's really good. Good stuff.

42
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.110
Donna Jochimsen: I just hope nobody else gets sick, I can tell you

43
00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

44
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. Um, so, how did you go to any meetings. The last couple days. I feel like I just saw you.

45
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.520
Donna Jochimsen: Yesterday, his army.

46
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.320
Donna Jochimsen: Group meeting.

47
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.780
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. So yeah i i went to the new meeting yesterday. And then I go to a meeting and

48
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.440
Donna Jochimsen: I've been going. I've been going on for quite a while.

49
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:41.040
Donna Jochimsen: It's most while they're the core group are some old timers are a little bit older people. There are people that you know come come in and rotate through all the time. So there's different people, but

50
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.440
Donna Jochimsen: I just, I like it. I like the way that it's run and I like the people that are my my sponsors there so

51
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.450
Donna Jochimsen: It worked.

52
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Out for me and then I

53
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.150
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. And then last night I did another women for sobriety online.

54
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.660
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, good. I have. I haven't done my first smart recovery meeting yet. I'm still

55
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:16.530
Donna Jochimsen: Going through everything that it is there's, it's a lot so I'm kind of trying to look at the curriculum and figure figure it out a little bit before I actually do a meeting.

56
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The great part about smart recovery is that you can go in there. You can go to their website, you can go to their toolbox and

57
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In one of those assignments or worksheets, or whatever.

58
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really, you can go through it. Like, there's the costs and benefits analysis thing where

59
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you, you.

60
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the evening.

61
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.250
Donna Jochimsen: I started in the sheet for that.

62
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.410
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, see there is a lot

63
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.970
Donna Jochimsen: And

64
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.550
Donna Jochimsen: I just wanted to get a little bit familiar with it before I actually log in and do a meeting.

65
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's a really good program. Definitely. Um,

66
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.460
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, as I said, and

67
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:13.110
Donna Jochimsen: It's it women for sobriety is great support it. It really is. But the smart recovery was a little more like worked. And I feel like I need to do that I

68
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:23.490
Donna Jochimsen: I haven't put myself first for a really long time haven't thought about things. And there are issues that I need to know that I need to work on.

69
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:41.610
Donna Jochimsen: So I just I want, I want to grow a little bit more and well now a lot are actually. So I thought that that would be really good. That's why I ordered the book that book that are the the work that I did. It's the same the same thing.

70
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.260
Donna Jochimsen: As I got the guy, the guy, he's with Dr. Stephen, I can't remember his last name.

71
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.360
Donna Jochimsen: It's the first part of it is self management and recovery training, but

72
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They use

73
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.930
Donna Jochimsen: They use the app.

74
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

75
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.670
Donna Jochimsen: And now I can't remember what it what it's an acronym for

76
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.820
Donna Jochimsen: Are you testing my

77
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.190
Donna Jochimsen: Okay. Anyway, I

78
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.980
Donna Jochimsen: I've ordered that I should get it.

79
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:26.130
Donna Jochimsen: I get it today, but if not today, tomorrow, for sure. And it you know it's a work, but to work through those kind of things. I've never actually really done that.

80
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.830
Donna Jochimsen: I've done a lot of

81
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:37.350
Donna Jochimsen: Sobriety things and recovery, you know, and recovery things I've done done the Steps Know numerous times, but

82
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:52.740
Donna Jochimsen: To me that, to me that's on to me it feels the steps and what I've done is looking back, you know, a lot. And I'm wanting to do some work that looks forward or

83
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.100
Yeah.

84
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.610
Donna Jochimsen: So I'm kind of looking looking for that. And I'm hoping that this book is a step towards

85
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Actors acceptance and commitment therapy.

86
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.390
Donna Jochimsen: Yes. There you go. Thank you.

87
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.350
Donna Jochimsen: Thank you. I forgot anyway.

88
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:27.420
Donna Jochimsen: When I read when I read about what it's about. But that's the basis for it. So, you know, and that sounds really good, you know, accountability, accountability, commitment and what was it, T. Darn it.

89
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.850
Donna Jochimsen: There. It just sounds good therapy. It sounds like

90
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:43.800
Donna Jochimsen: You know, working to move forward. Mark, to me, then I can get sober, I can do the sobriety.

91
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:50.700
Donna Jochimsen: And but I've never actually moved past that I've stayed in that for a really

92
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.570
Donna Jochimsen: Long time

93
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.340
Donna Jochimsen: With the groups and the help that I was getting and

94
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.250
Donna Jochimsen: That's always been a problem. That's why I relapse, because I'm not moving forward.

95
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.590
Donna Jochimsen: So I'm trying to really be aware of that and find ways to do that.

96
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:20.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. I think that that now that you have this free time, being able to look for a job while you're attending meetings and you know are you're working the steps with your sponsor.

97
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is as you say.

98
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.650
Donna Jochimsen: We are. We are. Yes. I think it's my fourth time, but yes.

99
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do you get all the way through them.

100
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.060
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, we

101
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:33.660
Donna Jochimsen: Do

102
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:41.070
Donna Jochimsen: God, I'm not. I'm yeah I've actually was her on I think I'm on. Step four. So,

103
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.270
Donna Jochimsen: Good.

104
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In working through those and then adding in this other piece that you're

105
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that you've ordered the workbook.

106
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think is going to make a huge difference.

107
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And helping others get to a point where you can help others.

108
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stepping outside

109
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.410
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, so that that is important, right when he said that. I'm like, oh, I don't want to help anybody else.

110
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

111
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.710
Donna Jochimsen: But that's, that's different. I know it is. You're right.

112
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.310
Donna Jochimsen: You're right.

113
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:15.720
Donna Jochimsen: It is

114
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.390
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it is. And I did. I already do that.

115
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:34.890
Donna Jochimsen: And then the last two years. Well, I won't even go past that before that. But in the last two years I only used for two months I had had a relapse and

116
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:50.550
Donna Jochimsen: One of the things that made that made me that, well, I'm not gonna say made me relapse. But that was a part of my relapse was of the group. I was in the people were so needy and

117
00:10:51.990 --> 00:11:04.500
Donna Jochimsen: You know, they saw me as somebody that was fairly steady with the car and I just got here all the time and it sort of dragged me drag me back into that into that world.

118
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:14.490
Donna Jochimsen: So that's why I like my a meeting at that that doesn't happen that people there are not quite as as needy.

119
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:28.530
Donna Jochimsen: And I wasn't they did. They didn't need me. They didn't really want me to help them stay sober, although we did talk to some people. I did do that with but most of them wanted you know material things for me.

120
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So think about

121
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can help people and other ways that don't put you in that predicament. And it can be something as simple as as volunteering.

122
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, at a thrift store.

123
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or yeah

124
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.700
Donna Jochimsen: I get. I get what you're getting at. Yes. Okay.

125
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was thinking of

126
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:58.230
Donna Jochimsen: Thinking about sitting with people who are trying to get clean and stuff.

127
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.380
Donna Jochimsen: That that got to be kind of bad for me.

128
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nope, to you to go a whole different Avenue on

129
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.810
Donna Jochimsen: On it. Yes.

130
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.860
Donna Jochimsen: I know what about volunteer with kids or yeah um

131
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.950
Donna Jochimsen: You know, I might. I might do this I had

132
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:25.560
Donna Jochimsen: I had thought about doing it before, but then I my dad got sick or sicker and I had to help him that the our domestic violence.

133
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Shelter needed usually

134
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.310
Donna Jochimsen: Means volunteers, I might try that I might do that. Try that again.

135
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good idea. I that's like almost a little bit where my passion is is in domestic violence.

136
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.370
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

137
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Therapy, but

138
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just someplace that doesn't require anything from you but time

139
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see what I'm saying. When you help others.

140
00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:05.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you help others in early recovery, you know, that's where you learn to put these hard boundaries down with people and say, No, you know what you have to offer is time.

141
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.610
Donna Jochimsen: Experience. Very good.

142
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.120
Dinner.

143
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:19.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So getting it. Think about it getting in the practice of it is really volunteering your time in in other areas that don't require anything but your time.

144
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.780
Donna Jochimsen: Right. Yes. Yes.

145
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if it's just

146
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One day a week or a couple hours.

147
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A week but something that helps you work with others in a manner that

148
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes you feel good inside without draining you. You know what I mean, right. Angela with material things.

149
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. That makes it

150
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.970
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, that isn't really good idea.

151
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.520
Donna Jochimsen: That is a good idea.

152
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.340
Donna Jochimsen: So i i don't know i i think i'm on a good path right now.

153
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

154
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.070
Donna Jochimsen: I stopped gorging on sugary foods.

155
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.270
Donna Jochimsen: Oh,

156
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.900
Donna Jochimsen: Good. The best but yeah the vegetables helped a lot.

157
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:14.550
Donna Jochimsen: I spend a fortune on on fresh vegetables last week or so, but that's all right.

158
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why is it so much, why is it so much more expensive to eat healthy than what it is to eat junk.

159
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.980
Donna Jochimsen: Food just, I don't know, but it really is it totally is. It's

160
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.330
Donna Jochimsen: It's not good.

161
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.800
No, no.

162
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.020
Donna Jochimsen: No.

163
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what do you think about if I put you at every other week for our meeting.

164
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:50.310
Donna Jochimsen: That would be fine. Rebecca i i'm not i don't i'm not really in a need for a therapist every week, probably every other week would be good. I, I still want to do this but

165
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:59.820
Donna Jochimsen: I value your advice and wisdom. So every other week would be good for me.

166
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.380
I think that and

167
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then we'll come back.

168
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.460
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah yeah

169
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When it. When are you going to get your workbook.

170
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.370
Donna Jochimsen: It should come. Maybe today, or if not today, tomorrow, for sure.

171
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Because what I want to do is, is kind of walk you through it a little bit work with you with it as you're going through it. I think that no okay so

172
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:40.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what we'll start planning on doing is working through the act workbook that you get, and really kind of building up your toolbox in that area, but because you're doing such a great job and you're studying. You're stable and you're moving forward.

173
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your emotions are stable your thinking is where it needs to be.

174
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep.

175
00:15:48.420 --> 00:16:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And if it's if it for some reason, something happens, we can come right back to Weekly, but I just think you're in a place where you know you and I can, I can let go. Just enough for you to

176
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

177
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:11.910
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, you know, I like your guidance. But you're right, you're right. I probably, I don't need every week.

178
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we can plan.

179
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:14.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On

180
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.710
Donna Jochimsen: You on Monday. Every Monday, so

181
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And if you need something you can always call the virtual clinic and tell them you know that you need to to

182
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:43.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Schedule an appointment with me and they'll do it and we'll keep the same time, but we'll, you know, we'll just switch it to every other week. And, okay, okay. And when you get your workbook and start doing like the first part of it. And then the next time we meet, we'll go through it.

183
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.800
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, yeah, that's that sounds like a good plan.

184
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, all right, and

185
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:56.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've just got to keep doing what you're doing and focus on you, you're doing an awesome job.

186
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, keep going to your meeting.

187
00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.910
Donna Jochimsen: I'm sick.

188
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.380
Donna Jochimsen: I'm 62 I don't get a lot more chances the house.

189
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.130
The time

190
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:13.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the great part about it is that now's the time when your mind is open as well. You know what I mean. Yeah.

191
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.360
Donna Jochimsen: It is, it is. I'm really, I'm ready to do this, I am

192
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:24.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, awesome. So you're going to try. You're going to check out smart recovery, a little bit more in depth.

193
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then venture

194
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.150
Donna Jochimsen: I'm pretty close to checking it out well enough to

195
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.610
Donna Jochimsen: Feel comfortable during the meeting.

196
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe you're you. Have you thought about asking your sponsor to go with you.

197
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.040
Donna Jochimsen: Know, I haven't, but I should

198
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see if maybe it's something that you guys can plan to do together.

199
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.890
Donna Jochimsen: She probably would be happy to do that.

200
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:59.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would be kind of cool, then you would have somebody else's feedback, you know, to on their perception of what they experienced, you know,

201
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.000
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it would probably be different for her to, I don't know that she's ever done anything like that so

202
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.470
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

203
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I think that would be

204
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:27.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Idea. Okay perfect, so you're going to check it smart recovery going to start working on out of the Act workbook and then the next time that we meet is going to be the week after next same time so nice. And we'll start going through, you know, going through that workbook.

205
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.610
Donna Jochimsen: Great. That sounds great.

206
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.260
