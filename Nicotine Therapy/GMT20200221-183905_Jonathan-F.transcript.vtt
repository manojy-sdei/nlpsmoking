Jonathan Figg: Okay.

125
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:18.960
Jonathan Figg: All right.

126
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.780
Jonathan Figg: Are you allergic to anything.

127
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.580
Austin Ackerman: No. Okay.

128
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.650
Jonathan Figg: Other than it sounds like depression and ADHD are you diagnosed with those anxiety.

129
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.670
Austin Ackerman: Yell manic depression, anxiety,

130
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.160
Austin Ackerman: In yeah

131
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.420
Jonathan Figg: Okay. So when you say manic depression. Do you mean bipolar.

132
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.820
Austin Ackerman: Yeah, I have that. Awesome.

133
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.300
Jonathan Figg: Okay. And are you seeing a psychiatrist to manage that.

134
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.810
Jonathan Figg: Yeah. Okay. Are you still on the laptop.

135
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.310
Austin Ackerman: Yeah.

136
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:03.330
Jonathan Figg: Okay, but I just want to make sure I understand all the, all the things going on. All right. Um, have you ever had any surgeries.

137
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.470
Jonathan Figg: No. Okay. All right, so

138
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.400
Jonathan Figg: I'm going to talk a little bit about how bright heart works. So you were referred to us. We are

139
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:27.690
Jonathan Figg: Tele health organization. Right. So all of our doctors visits and interactions occur we use zoom this the software that we're using for the video call here.

140
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:37.890
Jonathan Figg: And we're primarily structured around weekly support groups. So we pair people up into a support group. You have a history of opioid use

141
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:50.010
Jonathan Figg: So we would pair you into a support group of other people who have been or are in a similar situation, who would understand the stressful things that you're going through and can support you and your recovery.

142
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:57.870
Jonathan Figg: Groups are led by a therapist who has a background in opioid use and addiction medicine.

143
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:18.060
Jonathan Figg: And has been doing this for a while and on each week. The meeting is about an hour long and starts with a check in with the doctor. So you have a weekly interaction with the doctor who's managing your Suboxone so that we can make sure you're on the right dose or not having side effects.

144
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.040
Austin Ackerman: Or cravings.

145
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:30.510
Jonathan Figg: If you're having relapse we address it and manage it and help you continue in your recovery and that we don't run out of medication, all of those things. Does that make sense.

146
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.190
Austin Ackerman: Yeah, okay.

147
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:42.810
Jonathan Figg: Let's talk about Suboxone so Suboxone as a medication. It's an opiate so fentanyl is an opiate heroin and opiate Suboxone as an opiate

148
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:50.520
Jonathan Figg: It works differently than the other things that you've used in the past with that knowing heroin. If you think about

149
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:59.490
Jonathan Figg: What they do in your brain. Think about it like a light switch. They take the light switch that controls your sensitivity to pain and they turn it off.

150
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:08.940
Jonathan Figg: Okay, they take the light switch that controls whether you're feeling good and enjoying things they turn it all the way on right that's the high euphoria.

151
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.860
Jonathan Figg: They take the part of your brain that controls your ability to breathe.

152
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.610
Austin Ackerman: And they

153
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.470
Austin Ackerman: And now, yeah.

154
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.850
Jonathan Figg: That's when you overdose.

155
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:24.000
Jonathan Figg: Right yeah Suboxone worse a little bit differently. And that doesn't flip the switch is all the way. Listen, about halfway

156
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:36.570
Jonathan Figg: So it will keep you out of withdrawal because it moves the switch. It'll pass your cravings to use other things because it moves the switch, but it won't turn your breathing center off.

157
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.930
Jonathan Figg: It won't turn the, the high that the other things cause on the same way.

158
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.020
Jonathan Figg: It tends to be safer because

159
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.200
Austin Ackerman: It's

160
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:55.620
Jonathan Figg: Difficult to overdose on as long as we're not mixing it with other things that suppress your wakefulness. So benzodiazepines. That's why I asked about

161
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.280
Jonathan Figg: The Klonopin

162
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.020
Austin Ackerman: Or alcohol.

163
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.190
Jonathan Figg: Or the two major things

164
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.020
Do you drink.

165
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.270
Austin Ackerman: Hello.

166
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.640
Jonathan Figg: Okay, there we go. I lost you for a minute.

167
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.890
Okay.

168
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:34.410
Jonathan Figg: Ties we're talking about the things the other things that interact with Suboxone that we're concerned about our benzodiazepines like Klonopin

169
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.130
Jonathan Figg: Or alcohol. Those are the two major ones so

170
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.870
Jonathan Figg: I wanted to know do you drink alcohol.

171
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:40.770
No.

172
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.210
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

173
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.930
Jonathan Figg: And that's and you're not using any kind of benzo medications anymore like fun event.

174
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.570
Jonathan Figg: Or an event or anything like that. Okay.

175
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.250
Jonathan Figg: All right. When's the last time you used anything like that.

176
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.740
Austin Ackerman: Right members.

177
00:12:59.160 --> 00:12:59.580
Mm hmm.

178
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.280
Austin Ackerman: None in month

179
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.460
Jonathan Figg: Okay, alright. So those are the two, like I said, those are the two things we don't want you to next thing.

180
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:14.340
Jonathan Figg: Because Suboxone on its own is almost impossible to overdose on it's really safe. That's why we like it.

181
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:21.990
Jonathan Figg: But if you make things with it, it can it can put you in that situation like you experienced before with overdose.

182
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.540
Jonathan Figg: So we don't want you to. We want you to be safe and

183
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:48.150
Jonathan Figg: Our goal is to find a dose for you that keeps you out of withdrawal suppresses your cravings to use other stuff. And at the same time is not so high that is causing side effects. We want you on the lowest effective dose and can may have been started on

184
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.560
Jonathan Figg: To eight milligram tablets or strips. Right.

185
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.920
Jonathan Figg: So we think 16 milligrams

186
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.330
Austin Ackerman: Yeah.

187
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.490
Jonathan Figg: Does that sound right. Okay.

188
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.550
Austin Ackerman: It might have been to eighth and it might have been eight and four and

189
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.580
Jonathan Figg: You will. You're saying they started you at four before and then a and then the next day they gave each

190
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.480
Austin Ackerman: Other yeah yeah

191
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:17.940
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so they gave you 12 one day and then I say even 16 so when you took the Suboxone

192
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.720
Austin Ackerman: Before

193
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.150
Jonathan Figg: It's a strip that dissolves under your tongue.

194
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.970
Jonathan Figg: may explain how to take that

195
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.290
Austin Ackerman: And yeah.

196
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.160
Jonathan Figg: Okay, great.

197
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.660
Jonathan Figg: I'm going to go over it again because it's really important. You don't swallow it.

198
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.980
Jonathan Figg: If you swallow it, you won't get the

199
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.610
Medication

200
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.860
Jonathan Figg: It dissolves under your tongue entirely usually takes five to 10 minutes

201
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.640
Austin Ackerman: For you.

202
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:46.050
Jonathan Figg: All entirely and then afterward, you should not eat, drink or smoke for at least 10 to 15 minutes to make sure nothing washes it down.

203
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.040
Yeah.

204
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.410
Jonathan Figg: When you took it before, did it make you sleepy groggy drowsy.

205
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.250
Austin Ackerman: A little bit early.

206
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.450
Okay.

207
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.040
Jonathan Figg: The first time when they gave you four and

208
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.940
Austin Ackerman: Then they gave you the day

209
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.960
Jonathan Figg: After that, after those two doses, did it make you sleep your body

210
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.750
Austin Ackerman: Wasn't groggy

211
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.310
Jonathan Figg: Oh, just like fuzzy

212
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.640
Jonathan Figg: Where you can't think straight or feel drowsy.

213
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.320
No.

214
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:23.640
Jonathan Figg: No. Okay. Alright, so the first time and then when they gave you the two eights. The next day yesterday and

215
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.570
Austin Ackerman: Found the same

216
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.830
They felt the same

217
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.700
Jonathan Figg: Yesterday morning. Did you have any withdrawal symptoms.

218
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.370
Austin Ackerman: A little bit.

219
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.550
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so that's why they gave you a little bit higher. Just this morning.

220
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.240
Austin Ackerman: Did you have

221
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.180
Austin Ackerman: Been through a

222
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.260
Jonathan Figg: You threw up. Okay. But then, then after that. Were you okay

223
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.920
Austin Ackerman: A little bit.

224
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:56.340
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so it's it's 10 o'clock this morning, when what time did you take the Suboxone

225
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.230
Austin Ackerman: Or take

226
00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.910
Austin Ackerman: Take it this morning.

227
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.350
Jonathan Figg: No, I mean yesterday. I'm sorry.

228
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.470
Austin Ackerman: You're on seven or eight

229
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.730
Jonathan Figg: In the evening.

230
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.320
Austin Ackerman: Okay.

231
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.630
Jonathan Figg: All right. And are you feel like you have any withdrawal symptoms, other than the one time you thought through up this morning.

232
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.370
Austin Ackerman: Yeah, a little bit.

233
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.140
Jonathan Figg: Little bit. Okay. All right.

234
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.320
Jonathan Figg: So,

235
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.130
Jonathan Figg: What we would do if by heart. Seems like an okay program for you.

236
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.900
Jonathan Figg: If you can commit to a weekly support groups.

237
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:31.620
Austin Ackerman: Right.

238
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.650
Jonathan Figg: And that's the most. That's the biggest part of this is

239
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.750
Jonathan Figg: The single most important part of your recovery is

240
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.780
Jonathan Figg: That you have accountability and support.

241
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.910
Austin Ackerman: From social aspect.

242
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.490
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

243
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.360
Jonathan Figg: I told her I don't want to violate your privacy data.

244
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.380
Austin Ackerman: Now, you're good.

245
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.970
Jonathan Figg: There's other people are out. Okay.

246
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:01.050
Austin Ackerman: Well, what do you mean like groups like I just check in with a doctor once a week now.

247
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:10.800
Jonathan Figg: So it's a supporter. So it's about an hour long, it's done over zoom like this with a group of other people who have a history of opioid dependence or addiction.

248
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:27.480
Jonathan Figg: It start. It's about an hour long, it's led by a therapist. It starts with a brief check in with the doctor to make sure your medication to say and then the therapist goes over some kind of material about preventing relapse or managing stress, things

249
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.880
Austin Ackerman: And this is all confidential.

250
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.050
Correct.

251
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.690
Austin Ackerman: Way. Why is this a recording

252
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:41.190
Jonathan Figg: So much so bright heart records. These so that we can make our notes from the

253
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.630
Austin Ackerman: Dogs. Okay.

254
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.980
Jonathan Figg: And also because

255
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:55.260
Jonathan Figg: We're what we call a mandatory reporting organization which means if there's any talk about child abuse or elder abuse or something like that, we have to report those things to the police.

256
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.610
Austin Ackerman: That does that make sense.

257
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:05.070
Jonathan Figg: But it's not shared with anyone else other than for, you know, legal a legal situation like that. Does that make sense.

258
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.230
Austin Ackerman: Okay.

259
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.610
Austin Ackerman: Okay.

260
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.430
Jonathan Figg: So,

261
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.720
Jonathan Figg: What do you let's see I have

262
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.540
Jonathan Figg: We have space in our Tuesday 3pm group, is that a time that would work for you.

263
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:31.590
Austin Ackerman: I can do that because I'm at work or school from at 8:30am to 4:30pm Tuesday.

264
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.980
Jonathan Figg: Tuesday through Saturday. Okay, so with more for so we need to find a better spot.

265
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.520
Austin Ackerman: For you. Okay.

266
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.240
So,

267
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.450
Jonathan Figg: What we'll do

268
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:43.980
Jonathan Figg: Is

269
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:51.900
Austin Ackerman: I can do the industry that don't get a recession, be an alcoholic. He never, never

270
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.610
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so what we'll do is Alice you a prescription for you for your Suboxone

271
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.490
Jonathan Figg: It'll be for a dose of two and a half. It's Australia.

272
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:28.410
Jonathan Figg: You took two before it's okay, there we go. You took to the eight milligrams trips before and you still threw up this morning.

273
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:40.950
Jonathan Figg: And you feel like you're in some withdrawal this morning. So my suggestion would be to go up on the dose, a little bit. We don't want to make you sleepy and we don't want you to feel just fuzzy in the head all day. Okay.

274
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:55.050
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, but we don't want you what's wrong. So I think we should go up in the dose, a little bit. All this your prescription for that. And then we're going to have the care coordinators give you another call to set up and find a time for a group that works for you.

275
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.220
Austin Ackerman: I understand.

276
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.920
Jonathan Figg: The schedule constraints with work and school. OK.

277
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.540
Austin Ackerman: OK.

278
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:09.930
Jonathan Figg: For the groups, they're done through zoom. So you you start by calling the virtual clinic, just like you did before you got into my room here.

279
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.070
Okay, yeah.

280
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.660
Austin Ackerman: Okay.

281
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.050
Jonathan Figg: And then

282
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.760
Jonathan Figg: Let's see, did they talk to you about doing blood work.

283
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.310
Austin Ackerman: Yeah, do I have to do that.

284
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.600
Jonathan Figg: We do need it. So we need to make sure your liver is working well.

285
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:36.960
Jonathan Figg: Because Suboxone is metabolized by our liver. We don't want it to build up tons a fumble so we just want to check that your livers working well and we checked for

286
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:51.090
Jonathan Figg: Hepatitis and HIV because in people with a history of opioid opioid dependence, we see a higher rate of that. And if that's positive. We want to help you and treat it because there are treatable. Okay.

287
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:51.810
Austin Ackerman: Okay.

288
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.700
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so we'll get

289
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:54.510
Austin Ackerman: Like I have

290
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.070
Jonathan Figg: What's that

291
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.240
Austin Ackerman: I don't have that.

292
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.300
Jonathan Figg: But we still we still want to check and make sure

293
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.010
Austin Ackerman: Oh yeah that's that's very good, actually.

294
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.060
Jonathan Figg: Right. Um, okay, and then

295
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:14.460
Jonathan Figg: I think that is all I reviewed your questionnaires here. Okay, I think that's all I have.

296
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:22.770
Jonathan Figg: So the next steps is the care coordinators, you're going to give you another call to set up a time for your groups. Okay.

297
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.880
Austin Ackerman: Great, so

298
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.900
Jonathan Figg: What's your schedule.

299
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:30.360
Jonathan Figg: And then you need to go to the pharmacy. I'm going to send your prescription. Let's make sure your pharmacy is correct.

300
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.820
Jonathan Figg: I have Walgreens on El Camino Real

301
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.590
Austin Ackerman: in Burlingame is

302
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:44.100
Jonathan Figg: OK, so I'm going to send your prescription, they are right now. I usually recommend give it about an hour.

303
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.140
Austin Ackerman: Yeah, it

304
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.040
Austin Ackerman: should pick it.

305
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.480
Jonathan Figg: Up and taking them at night and that works for you then typically I recommend starting with just once a day dosing

306
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.400
Jonathan Figg: And then take it roughly 24 hours apart.

307
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.130
Jonathan Figg: Does that make sense.

308
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.210
Austin Ackerman: Yeah.

309
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:14.430
Austin Ackerman: All right, and then the, um, the lady before this was talking about. I have to pay $200 or something. But she said, Maybe I don't even have to bake because I got recommended from the hospital.

310
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.510
Jonathan Figg: I'm not sure on the finance stuff. I don't do I don't handle that.

312
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:27.990

323
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.620
Okay.

324
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.650

326
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:15.240

327
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.850
Jonathan Figg: So there are legitimate times people have medical emergencies or suddenly have to travel or something like that.

328
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.200
Jonathan Figg: That you can't attend a group

329
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.190
Jonathan Figg: But in general, if you start missing or no showing two groups or not.

330
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:26.550
Austin Ackerman: You know,

331
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:37.200
Jonathan Figg: In general, not showing up. We're going to start decreasing the length of your prescription to make you go to the pharmacy more frequently because we would rather you show up.

Jonathan Figg: To group to get your prescriptions so that you can interact with your support group receive

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:34.170
Jonathan Figg: Just based on the emergency room, having tight radius and little bit up to 16 milligrams, but he still had withdrawal currently and throughout this morning. So we're going to start with an address at 20 milligrams and we're going to send it to a prescription for right now.

345
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.800
And

346
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.510

348
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.950
Jonathan Figg: And then we're going to do labs.
