16
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.890
Galaxy S10+: A sudden loss of employment. Yeah.

17
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:13.530
Galaxy S10+: Where are you living right now I'm staying with a friend up in Redding, California, because where I'm at, is pretty rural and there's not a lot of stores and stuff to be around. So I figured we better be where there was more stores to get food and stuff.

18
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.160
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so tell me

19
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.310
Shawn Phalen: Tell me what brought you to break hurt.

20
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.340
Galaxy S10+: Oh, a friend of mine recommended it. Because like I had a

21
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.660
Galaxy S10+: I gotten frustrated with my life because

22
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:45.120
Galaxy S10+: I never get my treatment from ADHD. I know I i've had treatment for it. Like, I've taken other people's treatment for it, and I know it works, but I haven't been able to get it myself, because of the area of living and I kind of fell into using drugs.

23
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.160
Shawn Phalen: What we use and

24
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.160
Galaxy S10+: I'm heroines okay

25
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.010
Galaxy S10+: And I kind of got stuck using that it started, it was like, at first it was punishing good and then it got really, really, really bad.

26
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.050
Galaxy S10+: And then I didn't want to be on that any months ago a friend of mine recommended

27
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.250
Galaxy S10+: And Suboxone and that's what I've been taking for that. But there's still the underlying

28
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:25.200
Galaxy S10+: Issue that I'm not having any there's not a solid like I still struggle with ADHD every day and I pulled back into a depression because I'm still affected by that. Even though I'm not like doing heroin now.

29
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.960
Galaxy S10+: I'm still everyday struggling to like be able to function like

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.040

Galaxy S10+: Basically I had like pain pills and stuff every once in a while like just get like

43
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:34.260
Galaxy S10+: I don't know if you consider marijuana but I smoked better and whatnot. But I'm kind of allergic to it. I'm not a big drinker. I've never, I can't really drink makes me sick. Okay.

44
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:48.900
Galaxy S10+: Is this the first time they have sought treatment know I've sought treatment, the entire time I've been an adult, but the county. I live in is so small. There's nobody there that can make me a referral to get anybody to get my treatment like

45
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:59.460
Galaxy S10+: The I've literally got into the clinics there and to the doctors and the mental health and they just don't have anybody that can do this on me. That's why I sought help like through you guys

46
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.990
Shawn Phalen: So have you ever been on ADHD medication.

47
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:11.970
Galaxy S10+: I have tried Strattera I have tried. I've tried all of the kinds that they try you on first and

48
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.060
Galaxy S10+: None of those worked but

49
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.310
Galaxy S10+: I don't work for me.

50
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:28.140
Galaxy S10+: I use that for very short time and then my doctor moved away from this area. I don't know if you knew this virus was come in or what was going on, but about

51
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:48.390
Galaxy S10+: Three and a half years ago and decided to leave. And there's been nobody to replace him since this was when I i got a short amount of treatment to mental health and never been anybody refer me ever since. Like, that's the documentation that have through having treatment of this

52
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.570
Galaxy S10+: I was diagnosed with it when I was in

53
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.890
Galaxy S10+: Preschool kindergarten.

54
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.180
Galaxy S10+: And my mom decided not to give me the treatment for it. She decided against it.

55
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.130
Galaxy S10+: Out as an adult.

56
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.000
Galaxy S10+: I don't, I don't see how it plays being without it is possible because like it's a struggle.

57
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:29.640
Galaxy S10+: I'm not, I'm not successful in my, in my job. During my everyday life because I've never completing anything I struggled to keep a hold of what I'm doing. And I'll, I'll start something else and all sorts of snow and never finished anything. So I can't focus

58
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.070
Shawn Phalen: Have you heard about getting on some ADHD medication.

59
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.920
Galaxy S10+: I have. That's why I'm speaking to you.

60
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:46.320
Galaxy S10+: I'm I've literally asked them every time that I've spoke with any individual from this company.

61
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.350
Shawn Phalen: Who's your doctor.

62
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.010

63
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.050
Galaxy S10+: Yes, I have. And he says you can't. It's not his

64
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.370
Galaxy S10+: Son his specialty or something. And that's, that's why the reschedule. I believe with you.

65
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.250
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, see, I'm not a doctor.

66
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.550
Yeah.

67
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:19.200
Galaxy S10+: therapists and I don't understand why I've had this have this appointment. Okay.

68
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:26.460
Shawn Phalen: So I'm wondering the therapist right heard. And what I do is I see people individually.

69
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.530
Galaxy S10+: Okay. Oh yeah, I get you, because I wasn't able to make my meetings because I worked

70
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.340
Galaxy S10+: I know I wasn't doing the groups because like my job was totally

71
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:46.890
Galaxy S10+: When they had their meetings. But now, now I don't have a job at all. And I'm stuck. I'm stuck indoors at this place all day long.

72
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.700
Galaxy S10+: Going crazy so

73
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.910
Shawn Phalen: What were you doing what kind of work in the restaurant. Were you doing

74
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.760
Galaxy S10+: I was a I was a cleanup and prep cook.

75
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:03.570
Galaxy S10+: Right. And I also had gotten a second job doing a maintenance.

76
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.070
Galaxy S10+: Like construction and everything.

77
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.960
Shawn Phalen: So is there any way you can start doing the groups now that you're not working.

78
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.120
Galaxy S10+: Um, I don't, I don't know. I'd rather have some of this more one on one.

79
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.870
Galaxy S10+: An actual group is I didn't get much of a chance to actually talk

80
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.990
Galaxy S10+: I said it was hard enough to address the fact that I guess the treatment for the

81
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:42.360
Galaxy S10+: heroin addiction is working, but know that this whole thing is not going to fix my main issue like I still struggle every day. And it's like, that's what's going to push back and

82
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.960
Galaxy S10+: Having something or do something good for me it

83
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.800
Shawn Phalen: Was the heroin really addressing the ADHD.

84
00:11:52.830 --> 00:12:00.450
Galaxy S10+: Know it just, it just took me away from all of my problems. It just, it made it so none of it makes us to because I just wasn't in the squirrel.

85
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.930
I'm it's freezing when you were using

86
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.120
Galaxy S10+: A lot as much as I could, with a lot

87
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.400
Galaxy S10+: Like a, like a gram per shot by

88
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.600
Galaxy S10+: $300 a day.

89
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:32.490
Galaxy S10+: So you're using what three grams a day three grams a day. Okay. How are you using it. We're smoking injecting a I wasn't injecting I've had an injector I'm smoke it.

90
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.020
Okay, how are you supporting your habit.

91
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.270
Galaxy S10+: However, I could

92
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.690
Galaxy S10+: Be honest, like, however, I could something you point like in China and how that

93
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:55.980
Galaxy S10+: I would try and work. I would try and I would try and do everything I could to make money. But you know, I would do it. However, I have to get it.

94
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.390
Okay.

95
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.970
Shawn Phalen: Is there a history of fan of addiction in your family.

96
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.980
Galaxy S10+: Because she could say so. My father was a juicer, but I'm sure lots of substances, I normally

97
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.140
Galaxy S10+: Okay, what about your mom. My mom's not

98
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.000
Any siblings. No.

99
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.040
No.

100
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.100
Galaxy S10+: Okay, no, their family.

101
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.800
Galaxy S10+: Are you experiencing depression right now of course

102
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:48.030
Galaxy S10+: experience depression every day as I can't get treatment for this ADHD and I know it's out there. I literally have a friend that used to live near me that has ADHD.

103
00:13:48.690 --> 00:14:04.680
Galaxy S10+: And he got medication for the Adderall and he even let me try as medication and it worked. And I, I couldn't believe it. So I went and talked to my doctor and he prescribed it to you. Like, I only got it for like maybe two weeks and then it was gone.

104
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.590
Galaxy S10+: Yeah, he left the state he no longer worked out of that office.

105
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.470
Galaxy S10+: And there's nobody else I could see

106
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:22.890
Galaxy S10+: Where I live in a very small town up in Northern California like yeah like to get to the nearest like like

107
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.760
Galaxy S10+: superstore I have to drive at 200 miles.

108
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:28.410
Galaxy S10+: Yeah, no.

109
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:35.880
Galaxy S10+: That's why I'm in writing right now because I'm so far out there. It's like there's nothing out there. And what's this virus thing happening.

110
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.970
Galaxy S10+: Want to be so far disconnected.

111
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.710
So,

112
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.910
Shawn Phalen: So how was school difficult for you.

113
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.780
Galaxy S10+: Yeah okay when I in my younger years

114
00:14:53.970 --> 00:15:01.710
Galaxy S10+: If I wasn't like to hyper I'm standing on my desk and getting in trouble. I was at the back of the classroom, not being able to keep up because I was so sidetracked all the time.

115
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:26.160
Galaxy S10+: Though I'm, I'm in. I'm an intelligent person. So I actually got by my classes I was able to just do the book work and shipped by but yeah. Did you finish high school. Yeah. I graduated high school as a 3.8 type for valedictorian. Are you serious, I'm actually curious. I did it on homeschool

116
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.330
Galaxy S10+: Incredible.

117
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.720
How did you do that.

118
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.470
Galaxy S10+: took a lot of time.

119
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:45.240
Galaxy S10+: I spent all week learning the information and studying it. Then I go take my test on Friday and passed my test.

120
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.050
Galaxy S10+: I already knew the information. So I get like Greg.

121
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.170
So,

122
00:15:53.490 --> 00:16:01.800
Galaxy S10+: Have you ever been prior suicide attempts. No, I don't want to kill myself. I just want to treat my my problem is I know that it's

123
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.400
Galaxy S10+: An answer to my my problem.

124
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.300
Galaxy S10+: And that's the biggest that's my biggest struggle is, I know it's there. It's there, and I

125
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.320
Depression.

126
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.970
Galaxy S10+: I usually try and talk to it with like my friend and

127
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.910
Galaxy S10+: I

128
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:42.660
Galaxy S10+: Don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes I don't know how I feel like this has been most frustrating thing I've heard in my life is to know the to the treatment for what I have and I just, you know, okay, so I understand that, but

129
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.190
Shawn Phalen: We have to understand, too, is that doctors are not really prescribing that stuff.

130
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:56.670
Galaxy S10+: Directing like this is not a disease, but it isn't. It is an diseases is something that people have

131
00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:10.320
Galaxy S10+: I've had in my whole life. And I know for a fact that it exists. I know what you're talking about. I know how some doctors don't believe it even exist. That's not true. If he if those doctors had it, they would know that people that do have know it. That's okay.

132
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:16.800
Shawn Phalen: So, have you had any like a rest because of your heroin addiction any legal problems.

133
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.460
Galaxy S10+: Okay. And, um,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.750
Galaxy S10+: Any traumatic events, growing up, um,

Galaxy S10+: So, so is D. Are you interested in doing individual therapy. Is that something you'd like to do. Yeah, I'd rather do it in the group therapy because the group therapy was just

170

Galaxy S10+: Okay i mean i'm i'm really familiar with this.

196
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.410
Galaxy S10+: I'm not a stupid person I know what I did was like stupid.

197
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:09.990
Galaxy S10+: So frustrated in my life because I felt like I had no homework, like there was nothing. Nothing. Nobody, nobody would write me pro nobody would get me to a doctor that actually helped me

198
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:19.050
Galaxy S10+: And I if I'm doing the same job like extra someone else's not normal, and no problem doing that job. He turned to the job.

199
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:25.140
Galaxy S10+: When I do the job that they're doing. I struggle three times as hard

200
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.080
Galaxy S10+: And that and that every day that wears you down to the point where

201
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:36.930
Galaxy S10+: It's like

202
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:44.850
Galaxy S10+: To know to sit there and know that that it doesn't have to be that hard that that life doesn't have to be as hard as it is on your

203
00:24:45.660 --> 00:25:02.670
Galaxy S10+: Everyday like no I don't want to say I love life. I love the things that I find in my, I know that there's something that can make it so that it's not so hard to do the things in life and to be successful and you pursue happiness. It's like

204
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:27.720
Galaxy S10+: I don't understand why someone or anyone would want to keep someone that like I know that I know and I'm, again, I want to reiterate to you that I am not a doctor and so somehow like this, I can get a referral to service or a doctor out by heart healthy. I know there is one

205
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.020
Shawn Phalen: Person, you should ask Dr. Thing that's a

206
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:48.150
Galaxy S10+: Good idea, did and he he sighed skirted it kinda on and i i i know this because my friend that that that recommended I go here, those two groups and in in their groups. There are people that have been taking the medication from the doctor there.

207
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.940
Galaxy S10+: Dr. I don't know.

208
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.930

209
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:04.320
Shawn Phalen: So that's what I would do is try and find that doctor that prescribed and then say, I need to meet with that doctor and see what they'll do

210
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:20.160
Galaxy S10+: Yeah, I had been but with this whole quarantine thing. It's like I've been trying to just haven't been able to get ahold of them. And it's like, you can try to search through this like on my own, like, yeah, I'm still doing the treatment like like this for me but like
