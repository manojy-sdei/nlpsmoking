00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.140
Saraniah Aston: Never PCP LSD.

47
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:29.010
Saraniah Aston: Absolutely. When I was six years old, I took I had taken plenty of us before but on occasion I took it and I it was bad. It was very bad day triggered my anxiety disorder and my OCD and PTSD. So, yeah.

48
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.850
Saraniah Aston: So,

49
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you first start

50
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: LSD. What age was it 16 years before that.

51
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.770
Saraniah Aston: Were 14 okay

52
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And how often have you done it after trying to 14

53
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.330
Saraniah Aston: Probably all together. I see by like

54
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.480
Saraniah Aston: 15 pounds.

55
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.980
And if there are separate.

56
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And the bad episode was at a 16

57
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.780
Saraniah Aston: Age 16 which was the last time that I that I did that. Okay. And that's it.

58
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That was okay 15 times lifetime.

59
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

60
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I miss anything.

61
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.720
Saraniah Aston: Um, did you get my like antidepressant and I don't know if that's important.

62
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're going to go into that I'm

63
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of on that wreck level like recreational level stuff.

64
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's move on to treatment history when it's just not getting into mental health, depression, any of that. But just zeroing in on

65
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Just substance use treatment. What was the age that you first had treatment.

66
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And what level of care was that

67
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.800
Saraniah Aston: Hospitalization

68
00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.680
Saraniah Aston: And for depression actually and anxiety, but I was also

69
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.580
Saraniah Aston: Just active with all kinds of drugs.

70
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: How long did you stay

71
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:27.450
Saraniah Aston: And that one. Sometimes I get them confused because there's quite a few, but this was a it was 30 days as well. Okay, and then another one at 17 which was also 30 days.

72
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am going to be going into another section which is differentiated into sort of the psychiatric let's let's see if we can pull them apart. Let me, let me go to come about it this way.

73
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's move away from hospitalization for a moment. Let's go to. Have you ever been in residential substance abuse treatment.

74
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.080
Saraniah Aston: Oh, no.

75
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.820
Saraniah Aston: I've been in rehab.

76
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.020
Saraniah Aston: But no, no.

77
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, how you differentiate rehab from residential treatment.

78
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.240
Saraniah Aston: Um, I don't really know much about it actually. I just know that people go from

79
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.990
Saraniah Aston: Often to go from rehab.

80
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.020
Saraniah Aston: And then they continue their recovery in residential treatment with

81
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.100
Saraniah Aston: With care from doctors and groups and yeah

82
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, I

83
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I let's, let's see.

84
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: How about were you sleeping overnight in a facility and what you're labeling rehab.

85
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.120
Saraniah Aston: If you say okay

86
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're probably let's use this word residential as rehab. Let's use a as if we're speaking the same thing because my guess is, we are in there where they then kind of having groups and then there'd be times when you meet individually with a therapist and you get medication and

87
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

88
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.030
Saraniah Aston: It was it was UCLA. Again, it was, it was there a there was a rehab program. And yes, I got my my psychiatric meds.

89
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.040
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it was a psychiatric and a detox.

90
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You are detoxing from what they're

91
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.120
Saraniah Aston: At that I'm detoxing from painkillers.

92
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That what year was that

93
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.630
Saraniah Aston: I'm not sure I don't remember. Okay.

94
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Yeah. It's starting. It's getting into the, I don't remember I'm getting a little lost in here. So now I'm not sure this UCLA piece. I know we've got one at age 15 we've got 30 days and then there's something happened at 17

95
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.500
Saraniah Aston: Mom.

96
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.150
Saraniah Aston: When was I hospitalized. You tell me please.

97
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.110
Saraniah Aston: For when was it. When did I go to rehab.

98
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.950
Saraniah Aston: The second time.

99
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.040
Saraniah Aston: 17

100
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.550
Saraniah Aston: That was shepherd fret. That wasn't UCLA.

101
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.330
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

102
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:20.730
Saraniah Aston: The it was shepherd Pratt in Baltimore not UCLA. I'm sorry. I was 17. How long were you there 30 days, got it. Okay.

103
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and then

104
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.670
Saraniah Aston: I'm sorry if you if I have to say this. I apologize if you get lost, but

105
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:49.500
Saraniah Aston: I didn't come here with any, you know, I didn't know that I was going to need to give every detail of my history. So I don't have it on backup in my head I have it written down somewhere, but I just don't have all the information readily available in my memory bank.

106
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Very few people do.

107
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. So then we have

108
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: can't quite tell you CLA if we're thinking maybe that was age seven teen you have it. Can you guess where was that 15

109
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.280
Saraniah Aston: I'm

110
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.830
Saraniah Aston: The UCLA was born low one when I was younger.

111
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.260
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

112
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, okay.

113
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

114
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Since they kind of overlap the mental health and substance use, it sounds like, why don't we go with, and I'll pull them apart. How many times you think you've been hospitalized. Is it. You said a few times. You think it's more than 345 like what are we thinking

115
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.930
Saraniah Aston: It's about four times four times. Got it, my lifetime, four times. Okay.

116
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And now kind of moving into you know that after care notion of intensive outpatient intensive outpatient often looks like three hours a day, sometimes three days a week. It's intense get to stay in your own bed and go home.

117
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.440
But

118
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.650
Saraniah Aston: Once

119
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:12.150
Saraniah Aston: You feel a little still at the UCLA. They did their outpatient program for adolescence.

120
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. How long do you, how many months or years without loss. If you had to guess.

121
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.930
Saraniah Aston: I went for two weeks and then I stopped going

122
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.670
Saraniah Aston: Because you

123
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: felt better or it wasn't a good fit or kind of went back to us and

124
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.930
Saraniah Aston: That was very rebellious and I just didn't care to go

125
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright. Cool. Any other outpatient treatment.

126
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.550
Saraniah Aston: Just that one.

127
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So back, way back then at 15

128
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.500
Saraniah Aston: Years. I've never had another outpatient

129
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.150
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

130
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So, not until right now.

131
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.990
Saraniah Aston: Right, okay.

132
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And let's see what else

133
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Covered I got them all thrown off here with the substance before I think we've covered it. We've covered some treatment. We've got a little bit of history with other substances.

134
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that covers it. Let's go to the next section next section. This one straight, straight psychiatric stuff.

135
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like they've got a diagnosis that that you've been assigned. So for example, I thought I heard a little something PTSD. I heard obsessive compulsive disorder. Think what else have have people died.

136
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.860
Saraniah Aston: What what I've been diagnosed with

137
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.760
Saraniah Aston: Yeah okay, I've been diagnosed with an MD major depressive disorder.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:52.500
Saraniah Aston: And

533
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at setting a schedule for these first 30 days.

534
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What I do is I meet with clients once a week for individual therapy and then you're also coming in for group. After that you and I talked and we kind of go, okay.

536
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I was asking about your schedule kind of trying to get a sense of what might be good timing. Do you notice that there is a particular date that's better for you.

537
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.290
Saraniah Aston: Um,

562
00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:25.950

565
00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:37.680
Saraniah Aston: It's okay.

566
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but I want to get it right. I'm a mess it up a few times, eventually Sarah Nia Saara like Saren Yes sir, yes sir.

567
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:52.920
Saraniah Aston: Oh no, I'm really impressed when people actually put the effort in trying to say it's so it's nice. It will take your time.

568
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I really do. I mean, because people mess up going to bear all the time and

569
00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I get comes a personal kind of piece of identity, it's nice to hear your name said correctly so sorry me so I will work on that. I want to get it right.

570
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is it. Am I, am I hearing correctly that you haven't had psychotherapy to address the OCD and and the PTSD symptoms. Right, I'm

571
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:25.890
Saraniah Aston: Not at all.

572
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying you

573
00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:42.810
Saraniah Aston: Will Yeah, I just when I divorced my husband, I, I know not Jewish. So the I didn't get the social, health care and more and I didn't have the doctors like to go to the refugee clinic there.

574
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:49.470
Saraniah Aston: Get medication and I basically was my own doctor for the path for the last like four years now.

575
00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:51.030
Saraniah Aston: So,

576
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.160
Saraniah Aston: And he came here basically to heal. Yeah.

577
00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what we'll do. Okay, now I know you came here because you want to address right this chemical dependence that has developed and all learn more about that from you.

578
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But when I

579
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: End up doing is I end up treating the trauma.

580
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right most people end up sort of reaching out for those self medicating behavior because they're trying to self medicate the trauma and the anxiety and the depression and

581
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So treat that

582
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll get your permission and consent meaning. I'll tell you what I'm going to do and I'll offer you sort of education around. And if you want to know about it, if you like, I don't need to hear it. Let's just do it. Then we'll go for it.

583
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But my style tends to be like to prepare and make sure people feel safe.

584
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Using resourcing techniques and we and we really first start with making sure you can emotionally regulate, you know, using the breath and things like that so

585
00:53:55.020 --> 00:54:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably the direction will start and you'll just keep talking to me, you know, so far, you've been really Frank you'll tell me you know this and you'll know you're shooting it straight so

586
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue that and just if anything changes, like if a big feeling happens like a big scary anxiety, depression, starting to kick in. You're welcome to text me I don't do therapy through texting. So it might feel cold because texts can feel cold.

587
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.820
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

588
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:24.930
You know what I mean.

589
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you all to know you can reach out so that there's never that I feel alone moment.

590
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:31.920
Saraniah Aston: And

591
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What will come back is, do you have time to meet in zoom. That's what you'll hear through text. And what that means is we got to meet in here so I can be helpful inside of the tele health. Okay.

592
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wonderful looking forward to working with you. I'm glad this assessment is a hard one. It's so serious. It's so intense, and now we get to just relax and get to know each other. Okay.

593
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.190
Saraniah Aston: Okay, great.

594
00:54:56.430 --> 00:55:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking forward to it. So I will see on Monday and in your group, and do I need to message your physician and and tell him.

595
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That you need medicine. That's typically people are bridge to this. Oh no, you probably bridge to the first one, so you're probably okay all the way to to group right

596
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:20.370
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, a doctor amen filled my prescription things. I got a text so

597
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. And I'll see on Monday.

598
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.210
Saraniah Aston: Okay, thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
