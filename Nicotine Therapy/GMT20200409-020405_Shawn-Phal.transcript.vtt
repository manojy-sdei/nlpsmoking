Shawn Phalen: Mary about maybe getting on Chantix or

130
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:36.930
ljewell: Chantix I'm afraid of because of that it can cause suicidal ideation and I did attempt to take my life very seriously.

131
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:44.790
ljewell: And ended up being like blighted to San Francisco. When was this. This was back in September.

132
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.410
Okay.

133
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.850
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so here's my suggestion is that you talk to marry.

134
00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:00.240
ljewell: Her what's going on. Oh, Mom. She knows about my mom situation. Okay.

135
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:08.850
Shawn Phalen: To tell her tell you, having nightmares and that you want to stop smoking. What does she suggests what can she or something.

136
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.560
ljewell: Okay. All right. And so what do you think you could see I you know I think when you

137
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:21.660
ljewell: Send to me that you felt I was in pretty good spirits and yes I am. You know, stuttering. And, you know, and that's my normal outlook anyway.

138
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:32.520
ljewell: Um, but, uh, I think it is to go about my mom with this upcoming whole thing and you know the bad dreams. I think maybe I could use a little more one on one.

139
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.510
Shawn Phalen: So how often were you seeing the center therapist.

140
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:44.520
ljewell: At the open door clinic. His name is George I don't know his last name. He's on a psychologist, you know,

141
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.680
Shawn Phalen: So here's the thing is that

142
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.230
Shawn Phalen: You don't have to stay with him or you hate it come with right her into

143
00:22:52.260 --> 00:23:02.610
ljewell: Individual care. Oh, I see. Okay. Well, I am. All right, how about this. Alright. So one of the other, then you won't have a chance to be able to

144
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:16.920
ljewell: Call him say tomorrow and have one more. I'm only seen him once, but I really liked and we hit it off very well and. But I also want you very much, you know, and so I'm

145
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:28.080
ljewell: You know I'm because I'm kind of a first impressionist and usually I kind of go with my gut feeling on these things. So, um, when should I give a decision.

146
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.000
Shawn Phalen: Why don't you do this, why don't you talk to him.

147
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.590
Shawn Phalen: Uh huh. And guys, have a session around it and

148
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.880
Shawn Phalen: You know, just, just say

149
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.090
Shawn Phalen: That you met with me and you know

150
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.270
Shawn Phalen: I said that we can't duplicate services, you know,

151
00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:05.010
Shawn Phalen: Right, I would just be very truthful with him and and then make a decision after you speak with him and what you can do is always call her and schedule with me.

152
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.280
ljewell: All right, I understand that. Sounds good. Well, thank you.

153
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.780
ljewell: Alright, sounds good.

154
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:26.400
ljewell: Okay. Well, listen, I really appreciate your taking the time to speak with the I hadn't really intended to take up this much time and thank you create it and thank you so very much and have a good evening and stay healthy and, you know, thank you, Sean. Okay.
