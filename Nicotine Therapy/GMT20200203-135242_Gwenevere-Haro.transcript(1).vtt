16
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And put it about a foot and a half apart.

17
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, like a water bottle or a vase or yeah a little statue or something.

26
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you been noticing as far as where your mind has been going kind of your distress level this week. Any nightmares kind of bring into your world a little bit

27
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.420
Christina Haro: Um, no, no nightmares good genes. I've been drugged me, my parents, which is that

28
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.840
Christina Haro: Which is good because I've been

29
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.740
Christina Haro: I've been I dad, my mom. I'm in the sense of not the early years, but the later years, like when I was taking care of her and stuff, which were good years

30
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.400
Wow.

31
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.870
Christina Haro: So, um, yeah. I haven't had any nightmares.

32
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.980
Christina Haro: I've been. I've been busy looking for a job and not just been keeping busy really

33
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you keep busy. What do you do

34
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.260
Christina Haro: A read and then I've been out in about looking for a job. I'm

Christina Haro: Oh yeah, yeah, she she lives in Dallas.

41

I don't

43
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the last time you talked to her.

44
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.960
Christina Haro: Um, the day she walked out of here and stormed out mad. That was the last day. It was probably a little before Halloween maybe

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Claire's in this program.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Oh my goodness. All right. Did she just start

Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay.

56
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.290
Christina Haro: We try not to talk about it, we pick the best. Yeah.

57
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So the only. So, so far it's not an issue because there hasn't been an overlap. She hasn't been referred to me if she ever were. I continue working with you. And then I would make sure she was with someone else. Okay.

58
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.050
Christina Haro: Yes. Alright, so

59
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.090

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And the one that lives with you.

69
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.950
Christina Haro: Um, he is

70
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.500
Christina Haro: He'll be 21 in a few months, couple months.

71
00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's his name.

72
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun, fun. Okay. And is this all your children.

73
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.220
Christina Haro: That's it, yeah.

74
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so one in one lecture with you. And how's he doing he got hurt recently. Is he okay

75
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.800
Christina Haro: Yeah, good. Yeah, he's fine, he's recovering he's doing that. Okay. All right.

76
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Let's see. Where did we leave off. I think I was. Let me see if I was working on anchor room with you.

77
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: continue developing anchor room and let's see monster.

78
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. Do you remember spending any more time after we ended that session kind of thinking about that some people do some people don't think about it again. They leave everything sort of in here in therapy. Do you remember kind of continuing to process it.

79
00:06:49.650 --> 00:07:00.720
Christina Haro: I thought I thought about it for a bit, you know, maybe for a few minutes of stuff I thought about. I sat there and I thought about effects of coffee kind of went over it. And then I said, Okay, you know, then I let it go.

80
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.400
Okay.

81
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

82
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, let's go back up here as we start to move towards the MTR. Oh, right. So, um, let's spend. I've got my protective nurturing and wise figure developed here with you.

83
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a pretty good. We see feels happy this time. Yes. Come back early. Yeah. See you were able to go out with your friends and go out, have fun with them.

84
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think that room that you develop the anchor room if you ever hear me say, let's go to this sort of anchor room. This would be the room.

85
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so now let's do something else, another metaphor. We're going to do a container and you may have done it in group with me and it just didn't get transcribed in here, you remember doing that, where I said it has to be big enough and strong enough to hold all your stuff.

86
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:53.700
Christina Haro: Yes.

87
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your container.

88
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.470
Christina Haro: Uh,

89
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.770
Christina Haro: I think my container was a lunch box.

90
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Lunch Box. Oh my gosh, okay, and

91
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So it is a lunch box and

92
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: All your stuff is all of the emotional stuff. So just think for a moment. It's okay. But for you that lunch box is big enough.

93
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.530
Christina Haro: Yes. Okay.

94
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how it's strong enough.

95
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.740
Christina Haro: I think it's strong enough because up

96
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.150
Christina Haro: It's it's metal. Okay. And I, and I can close it. I can classic closed.

97
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:46.560
Christina Haro: I also carry it around with me. So to me, that was like the thing for me. Okay.

98
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And could if you wanted to, you could leave that behind right

99
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.900
Christina Haro: I could put it down in the behind

100
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because maybe we don't want to carry it around. You know what I mean.

101
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:05.850
Christina Haro: But to me, at that time, you know, that's what I was carrying around with me. So that was like most obvious thing. Yeah, I got you.

102
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can change it to. So right now, when you think that this you know for a moment when you dip into

103
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the sort of painful recollection of you the treatment of your mother and that distinction between why me and why and

104
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Mom. I wish, I wish you have had the resources you know had friends and didn't take things out on the all of that. Now, when you think of that is that lunchbox STILL A GOOD PLACE. A good container that's big enough and strong enough.

105
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.020
Christina Haro: Just checking in on it. Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything

107
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: On the lunch box. Is it a specific color or anything.

108
00:09:49.890 --> 00:10:00.360
Christina Haro: Well to me when I first when I first thought of the lunch box. To me it was like, I'm one of those cartoon lunch boxes like

109
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.970
Christina Haro: Like the Snoopy ones.

110
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Okay. What I

111
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to know if it had any like anything on it, you know, very cool. Okay, so it's a cartoon Snoopy metal lunch box with a class and

112
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get a sense if there's a lock on it.

113
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.430
Christina Haro: No.

114
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that stuff is going to want to stay in there. If there's no lock what's in there. What's making it so that stuff that emotional stuff is going to want to stay

115
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:48.600
Christina Haro: I think to me. It's up to me if I open it or not. So I just leave it shut up. Yep.

116
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll stay shot if it's class, it'll stay shut

117
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.250
Yes.

118
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, next one. Let's do another another metaphor, so

119
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about a distancing metaphor. And I'm going to give you an example. If you like the one I kind of share, then we could use that one if something else comes up if another image comes up for you. I want to go with yours. Okay.

120
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this idea of of imagery and we're calling it a distancing metaphor is

121
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say something comes up for you and maybe even in session, we have something that's like heavy you know as hard it was distressing up there in that 70 range, you know,

122
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're nearing the end of the session or maybe you just want to use this this metaphor to put a little bit of distance between the intensity of an emotion. You could do this. You could picture yourself on the shore.

123
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right of a lake.

124
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a river or stream.

125
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you look out on a log or a leaf, right, which you see is that image floating away it's floating further away from you and what a year with on the shore.

126
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is all of the qualities

127
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Of

128
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The wise figure of you know yourself and your dad. Right. And this unconditional loving guardian angel.

129
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can be on the shore and sort of be present with this and do some imagery and picture of moving away or thoughts are very powerful right

130
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.670
Yeah.

131
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what's going on right now you're using your brain right now, we can summon up even feelings by thinking and we can pull them up from the hippocampus, we can drive them out from there.

132
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can be thinking about our thoughts are very powerful. So if we can drag out stuff from memory. Why then, we can also turn our attention to something positive.

133
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we monitor right where we attend is what we modify. So if you think about I want to spend my minutes I want to spend my time.

134
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Being in a positive confident was nurturing protected safe place. You will be rewiring your brain when you do it and it's neat. It's cool to think that just by spending time and imagery, you could be changing your brain that's pretty cool.

135
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's cool about it is what you'll be doing is you'll be having that imagery, while you were in distress.

136
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So what gets remembered. Oh, I can manage my stress, I can manage my upset feelings and not go to rage or anger or anything. You know, I need or

137
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: collapse into depression or sadness and I don't have to have us a drug, right, or an alcohol. So it's pretty amazing. You think it's over simplified, but our brain will baby. It's powerful.

138
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so that's one. Or what about a train right you can picture.

139
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's just those cars are moving further and further down the track.

140
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.860
Christina Haro: I like to see

141
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one do you like

142
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The train. Oh, tell me about what you see now let's get into what you picture get into the size, shape, color speed all that

143
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:39.030
Christina Haro: This is just a regular black train, you know, with a lot of cars. And the reason that that just popped into my mind is this when I was little. We live close to railroad tracks and that's one thing I would like to see when I was little.

144
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.110
Oh,

145
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. Yeah, so that's great. Okay, so it's a lack

146
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Train with a lot of cars.

147
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.150
Love.

148
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's moving down the tracks. You can see it.

149
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's moving

150
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it was a fast, kind of, how would you describe the speed

151
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:12.720
Christina Haro: I'm not too fast, so you know it's it's moving that that at a slow speed, but it's moving. Okay. Slow speed. Okay.

152
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.610
There we go. Beautiful.

153
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

154
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing great. Now I'd like to spend a little bit of time working on

155
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Adding more elements to your the suds remember how I did. What's your 50% I don't have it in here. I gotta track that down, but

156
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get a little. I wanted to be a little bit more robust

157
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When I had asked you if you if you ever hear me say, oh, I didn't do that in group. I wasn't there that day, tell me again what that is never be shy. You can say, I don't remember doing that. Okay.

158
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I forget who was in a group, a month ago. And when I did an activity. I just can't keep track of it.

159
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And especially with my Friday group I oftentimes don't end up doing the behavioral health piece I end up kind of processing what's going on in group in the moment that group tends to miss out on some of some of the more structured interventions.

160
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So, does that sound familiar. I'll show you what it is it's subjective unit of distress and I had you. Do you remember it.

161
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.240
Christina Haro: Yes, yes.

162
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Do you remember what your 50% WAS WHEN YOU COULD STILL THINK IT WAS distressing certainly wasn't 100 and there was no dissociation. Do you remember what 15

163
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:38.460
Christina Haro: Minutes. I think my, my, I think my 50 was my son, my youngest son.

164
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:51.840
Christina Haro: When I told you, because you had asked what was, what, what my says level was and I said it was like 50 to 60 and then you asked me why. And I told you it was when my son.

165
00:16:52.500 --> 00:17:06.210
Christina Haro: I would tell my son for you going and you tell me that he was going out and I would get upset and tell him you know will tell me where you're at, or call me let me know where you're at, because I get upset. I'd be worried about him leaving walking out the door, not coming back.

166
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So afraid he won't come back.

167
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: OR IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF

168
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.960
Christina Haro: Just I'm not afraid of him not coming back. What is going to happen to him, you know, and he's not coming back. Yeah.

169
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to check something and see why that didn't get transferred from the previous note, okay, because I do remember that I remember that really well. Let me just check the one on 130

170
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It should have moved me followed. It's bizarre know why.

171
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's my check the group note.

172
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.610
You 124

173
00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, it was on 124 see it when youngest son walks out the door does not tell me where he's going. I get mad but not to the point of where I will blow up.

174
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.520
Yes.

175
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, alright, cool, cool, cool. I'm gonna grab that one copy. Yeah, just didn't, it didn't follow the note, I don't know why.

176
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Okay, so let's see let's do, let's give it an exact number. You said it's between 50 and 60 you can move it some other time. But what is it we have all the way from zero to 100, you might as well. Pick a number that really feels right.

177
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:39.450
Christina Haro: So by the 60 because it's much higher level than the lower level. Exactly. Let me move it.

178
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Move it to 60 and the emotion is fear, I'm afraid.

179
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.380
Christina Haro: Yes Beer.

180
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And during that experience when he does that has done that, um,

181
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what's the belief that you have about yourself. Or we could start with what do you yet. Let's do that one. The below. This is a hard thing to get to. So

182
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Be patient with it if it takes a while. So this is going on picture.

183
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: He's going out.

184
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you don't want them to. Or there was something right, you get into that imagery and just sort of get into the worst part of that. The Worst Picture THE WORST piece of that image and see if you can get in touch with what your thoughts are about you.

185
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with it.

186
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then see if you can answer finish this sentence for you know what it says about me. I am

187
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe I am

188
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

189
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your thoughts, dude. Let me see if I can get in there with yet.

190
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.720
Christina Haro: I laughing to myself because he's

191
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.840
Christina Haro: Because when I get upset and I tell him stuff. He tells me Oh mom just so menopausal

192
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Funny. He's funny. He's got a good sense of humor.

193
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.860
Christina Haro: I believe I am menopausal. That's what I kept thinking

194
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That right okay well it's cute. Um, but let's see if that's the core thought about you, but it might be a start.

195
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a funny one.

196
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.980
Christina Haro: I believe my mom.

197
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.010
Christina Haro: I don't know, I, I kept my word for it script.

198
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. So that's this. This is hard to get to these are hard. So let's just keep wandering through this network of thought, okay, so

199
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Flip it around. Let's play with its toggle back and forth. Now picture that he doesn't walk out the door and he ends up staying

200
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

201
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Now what do you believe about yourself. When he does that.

202
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.010
Christina Haro: Um,

203
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.170
Christina Haro: Well, I just believe I'm going to have a good night. And I'm not going to people as stress.

204
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:43.500
Christina Haro: I'm

205
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have a good night.

206
00:21:49.110 --> 00:22:02.220
Christina Haro: Yeah, I just believe I'm gonna, you know. Have a good night. I'm not going to be worried, you know, because I can really happen, there's there's times you know when. He'll. He'll tell me onto the stage at home. I was watching will be it, you know, that's great.

207
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's great. So go with that. I want you to think about. He's home or you asked him. Oh, you know, you know, you want them home. He stays home.

208
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can finish the sentence, I believe I am

209
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard.

210
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: These are hard to find.

211
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: simply sit with a little bit and then I'll help a little bit more

212
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.880
Christina Haro: Just believe. I'm not worried. I believe

213
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.300
Christina Haro: I don't know.

214
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So notice how it's easier to identify the absence of fear. Fear is right. That's anxious

215
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Nervous worry. Those are, it's easy to identify the relief from that distress. It's easy to identify it. But look what's there.

216
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In the absence of fear. So go a little deeper. Just sit with it a little bit. Now you you touched on it a little, a little bit ago actually so picture. He's there with you. You watching the movie.

217
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me how you're feeling in that imagery, when you're with him, watching a movie.

218
00:23:51.600 --> 00:24:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just try a feeling word will go, but I'll go back to the thought the belief about the self in a minute we'll come back to it. See if you can identify how does it feel when he stays home with you.

219
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:20.820
Christina Haro: It feels, it feels great. It feels right. Okay. We're home safe, you know, we're we're together, we, you know, it feels, it feels great. You know, it feels feels good one. We're all here together. You know, I'm

220
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:25.950
Okay.

221
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.210
Christina Haro: Yeah, we're

222
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.610
Christina Haro: I don't know, I, the word can't come to Jane. Does the word tonight.

223
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll get there and some of it's just not a familiarity with using emotion words. You know what I mean, some people just don't don't do it very often. So it's this kind of awkward thing.

224
00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but you give me really good clues and you've right you're, you're kind of creating these little breadcrumbs for yourself because you've got, I feel great. I feel safe. I noticed, we're together and I feel safe. I feel great.

225
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Great is a

226
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A word. I never really know what it means. So I want to know. Maybe a core emotion. Let's see if I can throw out some of the core emotions. We have joy, which is happy. We have surprised we have discussed it we have fear we have anger, we have discussed

227
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame.

228
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.320
Christina Haro: You don't have to stay home.

229
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. Yeah, okay. No, get in touch with that just sort of sit with that imagery of keys. There may be sort of sitting there with you. Together, watching a movie.

230
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When you picture this

231
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it say about who you are.

232
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.350
Christina Haro: It makes me feel like a good mother.

233
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:30.960
Christina Haro: Ma. Yeah, it makes it feel like, oh, you know, I'm he's home you know he he wants to stay home and be around me. You know, he wants to spend time so it makes me feel like a good mother.

234
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. So try this time when he's Tom I feel safe, we're together.

235
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I believe I am a good mother does that feel kind of the closest we've come to the truth when he's home.

236
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.810
Yes.

237
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: She wants to be near me.

238
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And in order, right, if someone wants to be near me. Well, then I must be a good mother like that.

239
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so now let's go to the the flip of that ready. Here we go. Now that uncomfortable one level 61 he just wants to go out you're upset and afraid.

240
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Something bad will happen.

241
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body as it responds to that guided imagery. See what shifts and changes.

242
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Where does that land in your body. Just now when we switched it

243
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.740
Christina Haro: I made it makes me feel like he doesn't want to be around me like I'm an unwanted

244
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see it.

245
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:41.370
Christina Haro: And

246
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And pay attention to your body. Now, just as you say that, where does it land. What gets activated which shifts in the body.

247
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.130
Christina Haro: I get like up litter in my stomach.

248
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the one.

249
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.270
Christina Haro: My heart starts pounding.

250
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach flutters and heart pounds. Then I bet you're on to some truth there.

251
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean.

252
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, this isn't the first time I've heard this.

253
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little bit about with your, with your, your daughters to there's a little bit in there. I have heard that.

254
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.130
Christina Haro: Yes. Wow.

255
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

256
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a piece of me right now. I'm doing. And we're going to preparation phase. It's also really useful. I get to kind of understand more and more about you, but I want to know a little bit more about

257
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can see if you can bridge to the earliest age.

258
00:28:50.220 --> 00:29:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the most distressing it. We won't stay there. I won't make you tell me if you don't want to just dip into it, even if you just touch it lightly on the age and the imagery of how old this is of I am unwanted

259
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.500
Christina Haro: Probably my early teens.

260
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:24.750
Okay.

261
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Like we're talking 1314

262
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.180
Christina Haro: Probably more like 1213

263
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's 12 or 13

264
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you comfortable telling me kind of what that picture was in your mind.

265
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.020
Christina Haro: Um,

266
00:29:52.080 --> 00:30:04.110
Christina Haro: I think that's when I started noticing how much my mom favorite. My sister more than I might one of my sisters, which is my sister. That's two years older than me. My mom always favorite for more

267
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:14.340
Christina Haro: Than the rest are developing days are developing years where I started noticing you know that there was a big difference.

268
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what's her name.

269
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.780
Christina Haro: Her name mean that, am I na

270
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you noticed

271
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Nina was favored by your mother.

272
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.060
Christina Haro: Oh, yeah, yeah.

273
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the emotion when you were aware of that.

274
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.290
Christina Haro: I felt them wanted. I felt like

275
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.590
Christina Haro: Why not me. And I just felt like

276
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.870
Christina Haro: I DIDN'T KNOW, HURT maybe

277
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.040
Yeah.

278
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And why not me.

279
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What level of distress. Would you say that's out for you right now.

280
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.300
Christina Haro: When I think about that. Yes, very, very high. I said, but

281
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.410
Christina Haro: At 9089 about at

282
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: About 80 okay

283
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.670
Christina Haro: Yeah, it starts it starts going up there.

284
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.990
Christina Haro: There's a lot of times I don't even like to think about it.

285
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.880
Christina Haro: No, I just

286
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:26.730
Christina Haro: Don't

287
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:29.730
Okay.

288
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember I was telling you earlier that

289
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of what

290
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When we pull it up. Notice I don't like to think about that, right, this might be something that you rather leave in a container or maybe you want to put it, you know, I'm one of those train cars and just haven't been moving away just kind of at a distance.

291
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But also know that

292
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I haven't really assessed whether this is where we might start. But if we think about it. Notice when you brought it up.

293
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: If we do some MTR around it. You could experience some desensitization to it. So it might not be as distressing so that it could be just, just a story. It's just part of your history, it might not be as intense, which means you would have fluid access to it and it wouldn't stay

294
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Activated and possibly

295
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: turning the dial upon events in your current life in your future imagination. In other words, it won't be intruding, the intensity won't be intruding unconsciously. That's what's neat about this work.

296
00:32:46.440 --> 00:33:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. I was saying, well, what we monitor right now notice we're monitoring it. We're right here in inactive memory here and working memory. We're sitting with this this imagery you you literally changing it by pulling it up.

297
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And talking about it with me here. It's changing every time we pull something up we change the memory.

298
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really wild, you know, it's like well what do I want my relationship with this memory. Do we do I want to stay resentful and angry or do I want to

299
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of Change My Relationship with that imagery and that memory. You know, do I want to hold on to this resentment and anger and fear and

300
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to change it.

301
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.680
It's nice.

302
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but

303
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's up there at an ad right now so

304
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to something really low.

305
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just put almost a zero. I mean, we're talking could be a

306
00:33:51.240 --> 00:34:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and low something that's not 100 which is so much anger so distressing that you can't even think straight right you're, you're almost like

307
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotionally dissociating it's so intense. Um, but picture something really, really, really low. It's just for just a few just a little irritant, let's say, what would be very, very low.

308
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.210
Christina Haro: Um,

309
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.090
Christina Haro: Okay, thinking

310
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.330
Christina Haro: I don't know, um, something really low to me is like, I'm

311
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:18.540
Christina Haro: Like when asked me when I tell my son when I get home, you know, or I'll call him and tell him, hey you're home and he tells me guess. And then I tell him, can you wash the dishes and throw the trash. And then I come home and they're still there that's low

312
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:25.350
Christina Haro: That upset, it's the usual but I get upset, but I don't get, you know, yeah.

313
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what number. Should we give that one.

314
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.040
Christina Haro: And that was like a like a 10%

315
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Bought it. Yeah, that's where I had it anyway. So that's great. So I tell my son fine when you get home, or when you get home. You want to see that the dishes or washing the trash us out.

316
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.180
Uh huh.

317
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get upset.

318
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.490
Christina Haro: I can say, Yeah, but you know, I'm

319
00:35:52.290 --> 00:36:02.190
Christina Haro: I see years ago, I used to get more upset, but now that I'm getting older, things have kind of mellowed out. And to me, it's like, whatever you do it myself. You know, it's like

320
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.460
Christina Haro: In a bother me much. Yeah.

321
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm just see if, again, just sort of working on sort of this language of labeling upset upset for different people might be a different combination of emotions what emotion, are we talking about here.

322
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.110
Christina Haro: Um, give me the like washing dishes and stuff.

323
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:30.300
Christina Haro: Yeah, no, I don't. I may be, um,

324
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.200
Christina Haro: To me being upset is like a

325
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:49.740
Christina Haro: being upset to to me is like being like, like a scolding kind of upset I'm in the spotlight. I get upset and you know go off the deep end, no to me up Susan's down here.

326
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can find an emotion language word scolding is what you do to him.

327
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.930
Christina Haro: Yeah, but yeah.

328
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not an emotion that's a, that's a parenting technique right

329
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.510
Christina Haro: I get a little map.

330
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: A little go with a little bad

331
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's it.

332
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: For you notice I used to get really, is it really mad.

333
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. Okay, now I get it. Okay. And then now it's about 10

334
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.750
Christina Haro: It's not but

335
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You can still think and basically you sounds like you don't even scold or redirect or lecture you just go do it yourself.

336
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

337
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.850
Christina Haro: I'll just do it myself.

338
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

339
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, take some time and think about your, your, your current life. Okay.

340
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:56.400
Okay.

341
00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And thinking about what has been bringing the distress level up to maybe into that, but somewhere between maybe 6080 that's been

342
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: On your mind. You know, it might be a you mentioned your daughter. I'm not sure if that's what's going on. I might still be about your son, I don't know, might be about, I don't know what. So just take some time and just reflect back kind of

343
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Where your worries and your fears.

344
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:38.850
Christina Haro: Yeah, I think I get really did. I think I get really, really distressed and it really goes up when I think about my older dog.

345
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.580
Christina Haro: Because I'm

346
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.050
Christina Haro: Oh, do you want me to tell you why.

347
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:54.570
Christina Haro: I get. I get. I get really upset because I stopped to think I wasn't, you know, I was, I know when I look back at

348
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.520
Christina Haro: Me as a parent.

349
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:04.500
Christina Haro: Um, I, I tried to do. I tried to do things different and active front and totally

350
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.840
Christina Haro: The opposite of how my mom was okay so I

351
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:20.010
Christina Haro: I never ever singled one out. I never, you know, favorite one more. Um, but yeah, she

352
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.300
Christina Haro: For some reason has in her mind that

353
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:38.940
Christina Haro: That I was like a horrible Mom You know those things that she told me that I stayed thinking, Wait a minute, you know. So I asked my other kids. I tell them I got a multi I asked them.

354
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:51.150
Christina Haro: Because I really like that I mean seriously you guys tell me the truth. And they're like, No, Mom, why are you even listening to her, you know, she's just totally flipped. That's what the time she slipped out, don't, don't miss it.

355
00:39:51.570 --> 00:40:05.880
Christina Haro: You know, and she doesn't do drugs, she's you know she's not a drug addict or anything. I mean, she's just totally started in her mind that I was just this horrible parents. Parents that just, I don't know. She just

356
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she say you did or didn't do. What are the patients.

357
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:20.640
Christina Haro: Accusations is that I was a bad mom is that all that, um, I used to Peter. That's what she said. And I'm like, I never even spank them.

358
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:34.020
Christina Haro: I said, you know, and I looked at my kids are sick today. Repeat, you guys. And they're like, No, they haven't even listened to her, don't listen to her. She's just ties to you know make you mad, you know,

359
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.560
Christina Haro: I've always every time she ended up

360
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:48.270
Christina Haro: If things didn't go. Good for her, you know, cuz she left home, which was about 19 so she will get with her boyfriend. So after that, I didn't see her for a while but

361
00:40:48.900 --> 00:41:04.980
Christina Haro: When things would go down here as you come home. I always gave her publicist, he always stayed with me. But things always ended up and she just does not like she doesn't like authority. She doesn't like for you to actually

362
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:19.410
Christina Haro: Like give her any advice she can she she could be talking to you, and you're fine. Laughing But if you say one little thing that he doesn't like she will flip out as she likes to I think she's bipolar.

363
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.010
Christina Haro: And she just will totally flip out and at accuse you have the weirdest things. Yeah.

364
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.720
Christina Haro: So,

365
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, um, let's talk a little bit about

366
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: He said something about, then it would get bad, like what do you, what do you

367
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.740
Christina Haro: Oh yeah, I had her arrested twice for hitting me

368
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.480
Christina Haro: Twice.

369
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:55.770
Christina Haro: She just totally would flip out and you know I backed away and try to walk out and she'd been after me. And then she started telling me, look at me, look at me and

370
00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:04.980
Christina Haro: If I would turn around, look at her. Then all sudden, you know, the first time she hit me right across the face and then the second time she

371
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:14.490
Christina Haro: Showed me against the wall slamming against the wall and I, you know, you know. And actually, when the policeman came, you know, when he told me

372
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:23.640
Christina Haro: He told me that I should get I should get her and spank her like the little girl. He says, Get the inspector. Maybe that's what she really needs. That's what the policeman told me

373
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, they're not you know that's not their area of

374
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:27.660
Expertise

375
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:38.160
Christina Haro: But you know, I stopped to think I never, you know, even at that moment when she was so aggressive with me. I still didn't do it, you know. And I told her you know Kareena I

376
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.900
Christina Haro: You know, I really don't know. I really don't know.

Christina Haro: Um,

393
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.390
Christina Haro: I guess.

394
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:27.480
Christina Haro: If you were to ask me this a few years ago. When it first happened, I would have told you, maybe I am a bad mom.

395
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:43.650
Christina Haro: But, you know, after all this does happen, and I've taken a look at it. And my kids are older and I could talk to them about it. I know I'm with her. I know I did nothing wrong and I don't feel like I'm a bad mother. I don't feel that with

396
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone

397
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:59.220
Christina Haro: Asked me a few years ago with a total. Gosh, I'm a bad mom. Look how she turned out, but now i don't i don't feel that anymore. I've gotten past that to where I can actually say it's it's not me, you know,

398
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I

399
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:07.740
Christina Haro: Said I get upset because I get upset, thinking about it because there's nothing I could do about it.

400
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There go without one. Tell me more about that one belief about you. There's nothing I can do about it. Tell me more about that one.

401
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:24.930
Christina Haro: Yeah, I feel like me being her mom, I should be able to get her, as you know, I'll say, you know, slapper and make you wake up, but I mean,

402
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:38.610
Christina Haro: I don't mean literally slapper. You know what I mean. I mean, I wish to get her Hugger and make her understand that what she's feeling is inside of her and it's not everybody else, you know,

403
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:50.970
Christina Haro: But I can't do it. There's nothing I could do, you know, I've tried all kinds of stuff. You know, I take telling her, you know, I told her one day. Why don't we go to counseling. Well, why don't you go to counseling, you know, I'll go with you.

404
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.750
Christina Haro: Oh, to the never said that she flipped out and told me

405
00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:02.850
Christina Haro: She says, I did telling me I'm crazy. She says, Why don't you look at yourself in the mirror. She says, you're the problem you're the crazy one

406
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:10.020
Christina Haro: But, you know, after all this time. Now I look at it and I say, you know, really, in reality, it's not me.

407
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:16.920
Christina Haro: You know, I know it's not me with her with what goes on between me and her. I know it's not me.

408
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, as you say that pay attention to your whole body.

409
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. Anything shifting, as you say, I know it's not me what she's going through is in her

410
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it feel any different or the same right now.

411
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.510
Christina Haro: No, it, it starts

412
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:48.960
Christina Haro: The Hundred percent goes to kind of go down, go down and then I started to feel like

413
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.940
Christina Haro: Like a sigh of relief. You know, I feel

414
00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:09.090
Christina Haro: I feel like I'm just really. I know it's not me. I can actually go from 100% down to like, you know, really low, because I know it's not me.

415
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so one more piece on this one.

416
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, what would you like to be thinking about what's going on with Katrina, would you like to be thinking about yourself.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.110
Christina Haro: Thinking

418
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.200

Christina Haro: Um,

Christina Haro: Because I also have a 10 year old granddaughter with her.

434
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:50.730

518
01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you kind of brained, it brought in this team right

519
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you shifted some of the thinking you allowed some of that other thinking to come in right hope she's okay and

520
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The calm started to come in and the thoughts weren't sort of maybe what is negative.

522
01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:04.680
Christina Haro: I mean, I can feel it leading but not like it was before I could feel it in my head, I could feel it just pounding when I thought about stuff.

523
01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So basically went from 100 to five and even lower. I don't know what is it right now. What's your stress level now.
