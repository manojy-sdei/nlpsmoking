10
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm going to review your treatment plan.

11
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Been a while since we've met individually. So I wanted to touch base with some of the treatment plan goals that we had in place when you initially joined the program.

12
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I would expect that over time, you may have new short term and long term goals that you might want to add to your plan. Okay. Okay, so

13
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:29.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It says that you're going to attend route every week, but I know you're on your schedule has been changed. So how often do you come to group is it every other week because I feel like I have to do as often as a group.

14
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.410
Tito: Yeah, it's every other week. I just been

15
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:52.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Out of state. Okay. Um, so make sure that you attend group bi weekly I'm in the event that it's your week to come to group and you can't make it in an email, um, because I didn't inquire email with more state with having to go report because you're in the

16
00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:08.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not Peace Corps. What are you in army. Sorry, I'm not good with military stuff at all. So you have to correct and listen because you're in the army. Still, if there's more than 30 days of no activity we would still discharging

17
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, because I know that you travel back and forth the communication is important if you have to miss group on the week that you come let us know. Okay, okay.

18
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:33.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and then another goal was to develop your relapse prevention plan, including strategies for managing relax. Um, how has that been for you because I know you're doing really good with the taker process your cravings are triggers.

19
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.340

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:59.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, you also added a goal of wanting to include exercising into your weekly routine because you said that you lack motivation. Don't tell me what's been going on with that.

42
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.000
Tito: That's not really the motivation.

43
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.130

Tito: Drink as much as I should, but

46
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.100
perks of being skinny again.

47
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:36.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it sounds like you don't exercise on a regular basis. But when it's time to do the, I guess the physical exercise every six months. That's when you engage in it.

48
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, what do you do to just keep yourself physically and emotionally emotionally fit throughout the week.

87
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything that you'd notice

88
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.240
Tito: No, I don't really think that at all, actually.

89
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:53.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's good to hear. So there are no triggers it must be something that you doing well to eliminate those triggers. So what has worked for you so that you don't have those triggers.

97
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how long have you been to go for a

98
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.330
Tito: Two and a half years.

99
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where did you meet

100
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With your parents.

101
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:48.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't think I delve in much, but what's your cultural background. Wait, where's your family from my mom's from New Mexico. My dad from Mexico. Okay.

102
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So were there any cultural

103
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Perceptions when we found out about your addiction.

104
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, not really. It was just like

105
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.850
Tito: Cuz, no. My parents didn't really do drugs or anything.

106
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.410
Tito: And then that was just because it was in small town and

107
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.250
Tito: That's pretty much where there's nothing else to do. So we did

108
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That that's how it started for you because it's been so long since you've been in the program. I don't remember how it all started for you.

109
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.110
Tito: Yeah, I was just like my best friend him or just primitive experiments. And I guess.

110
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you're liking it. So then we kind of like move charts. What can we eat and moved up

111
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was it pain pills. Yes.

112
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what would you hope to gain out of this whole experience and being in the program.

113
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.730
Tito: Pretty much like

114
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.510
Tito: Anything I put my mind to do and my mind. I can do it.

115
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The same way you lack motivation. What do you think that comes from

116
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.820
Tito: I don't really lack motivation.

117
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what shifted for you. What makes you motivated now.

118
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.790
Tito: Think those cuz I

119
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.290
Tito: I just

120
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.190
Tito: I'd always think about doing something else.

121
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For that. But now it's like I don't even have to worry about that anymore.

122
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.770
And go do something

123
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:39.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any conflict that you experience in your relationship with your girlfriend. As a result of the job of us.

124
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.420
Tito: Kind of like she obviously she don't like doing that stuff.

125
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:53.370
Tito: And then once we had our son was like even harder. That's I think that's why I stopped, mostly because pretty much

126
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.300
Time for

127
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:13.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what's your thoughts on the Suboxone program because some people have the belief that the boxing is just another drug or she, along the lines of, you know, we're right heart health position is is that this is different. This is a new form of sobriety.

128
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.370
Tito: But

129
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's pretty much how she started like that.

130
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.060
Tito: And then now she's a meeting.

131
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.750
Tito: I kind of don't but that's like just finished my program. So like

132
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:31.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: actually accomplished, I guess. Yeah, well what what lets her saying that you don't need it.

133
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Cuz I guess you've seen how

134
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.840
Tito: Much better. I am and

135
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.310
Pretty much.

136
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:51.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any areas in your life or situations where you feel misunderstood.

137
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Areas of life.

138
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:18.030
Tito: I kind of used. I used to feel guilty when I was doing it for like because, you know, it's kind of hard to family, friends and stuff. And I was always all my stuff.

139
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.530
But the now like

140
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.520
Tito: I like to go walking around and seeing people and saying hi Ben and stuff. Not feeling embarrassed. I guess.

141
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because we use the only one that ever experienced with drugs.

142
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.010
In my family.

143
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.270

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you were the only one.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.450
Tito: That they didn't even like smoke cigarettes or anything.

149
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anyone in your family that you could think of ever had a history of addiction.

Tito: But not really like something big like to attend meetings and stuff.

154
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm curious to know where this interest with addiction from

155
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.770
Tito: Know what

156
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I cover.

157
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:43.380
Tito: Claimed over always throughout high school, I never did never did. And then I'd my juniors came when I started going out to friends and stuff.

158
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You guys can probably

159
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.620
Try said to me.

160
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.840
And I liked it.

161
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was the first thing you tried engineer.

162
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was there anything going on the family that led to the experimentation in junior high.

163
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:19.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The reason why X is because even though you've been sober for a long period of time. It's important to understand the root of what meant to be addiction.

164
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:28.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To identify emotional triggers. Any other thing that may put you are ready to want to explore or be interested in the drugs again.

165
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I've had patients that have been sober for years and they relapse and the root of the relapse is always an underlying emotional trigger that they never caught Rathbone

166
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:53.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it was too late and they slip and then they deal with all this guilt because they bought one I was strong enough, because I've been sober for so long. So why did I slip

167
00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:07.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what I always try to work with them on is identifying what were those things that led you to us and first place. What emotions were you trying to suppress

168
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:18.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I can tell you to. There's a lot of people that are bored, but they don't think let me use drugs. I think there's more to it than just boredom.

169
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:25.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was something some emotion, something that you would not want to feel

170
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.660
Tito: I was kinda like a shy kid.

171
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.460
Tito: So then I becoming more outgoing that's that's that's why I understand.

172
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:45.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. All right. I make sense and maybe connection, you have a friend the shy kid usually doesn't have a lot of friends, but you have a friend. This is connection does that friend. You see, yes.

173
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:59.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it makes sense. It was more kind of like a peer influence. So with that, you will want to make sure what she said you're already doing is that you're watching who you associate with yes

174
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:14.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So pure influence is going to be big for you and you said this made you a little more outgoing. So you want to find other ways to be more outgoing to be social, that doesn't include drugs.

175
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:23.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if you don't identify you know other methods, what may happen is a relapse justification five

176
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:31.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Years down the road. Another situation may present itself, will you find connection with appear, and if they happen to be a user

177
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:44.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You might be that red flag that might come up again like we're just having fun. It's not a big deal. Other rat. Other thoughts that we use to rationalize our behavior.

178
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:54.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And this is practical and not just for addiction and other things. There's some people that struggle with anger, depression, anxiety,

179
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:08.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they will rationalize their anger through different things like I can control the situation, why can I control the situation which will lead to them to have that distress are outraged outrage and anger.

180
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:15.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So long time because I get the sense you want to taper off and you're done with the program.

181
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:24.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's good. Everybody has their goals when they come in in here and I'm glad that you had a goal coming in and you've been working hard towards that goal since you've been in

182
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:37.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To keep in the back of your mind is to always have that awareness of what's going on inside. What am I, needing, what am I lacking. And where is it coming from

183
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:49.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't know if you've been a last groups, but the past few weeks, we've been talking about how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors all have to align, they all work together.

184
00:17:51.060 --> 00:18:01.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So some people that have a management, they'll say, Oh, I go from zero to 100 real quick. And that's not true. It's there was a fight that came up

185
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:15.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sometimes I thought is, I'm being disrespected or not. Say whatever the fact maybe the feeling is anger rage, whatever it is, and the behavior is them lashing out

186
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:29.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And some people think they're lashing out is always because they're angry, but when you really play some people have identified, really. I was disappointed and felt rejected, I felt hurt. And so they lash out

187
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:41.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For those are different things. I want you to find the connection and the thoughts. The feelings and the behaviors, because I don't get much reflection from you.

188
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Lucky can be just enough without access certain question. I'm not going to get answers.

189
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.850
Tito: Well, I never been really tough.

190
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For them. Yeah.

191
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.090
Tito: That's how I talked to some master question.

192
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:54.930
Yeah.

193
00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:04.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's awesome. Yeah. And so with that, you know, you want to do the work of reflecting because people that are more talkative.

194
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:12.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They start learning about themselves in the conversations, but because you're more introverted, you're more shy.

195
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your word may have to come more internally that internal dialogue that you have within yourself.

196
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Either way is fine. I'm not telling you you have to be an extrovert and social to find yourself.

197
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:31.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what I'm saying is, because you're introverted and because you're also busy with a good career with a loving family.

198
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:46.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You may forget the significance of doing that check in with yourself to find out what exactly you may be thinking maybe feeling and how those thoughts and feelings might be interacting with your behaviors.

199
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make sense

200
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:50.700
Yeah.

201
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

202
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where do you see yourself in about six months from now.

203
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.170
Tito: Hopefully I moved up to my job.

204
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.540
Tito: And then my son who probably

205
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.710
Tito: walking and talking to

206
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:13.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Him.

207
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.780
Tito: Pretty much how I am now just, you know, just six months long road and

208
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.410
Yeah office program.

209
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:37.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Gave me one goal that you told me, said you want it to for long term goal you want it to retire from the military successfully.

210
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:44.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was a direct quote from you. So what would that look like. And is that still a goal for you.

211
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.230
Tito: Yes, I'm still I'm still in the

212
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.530
Tito: Garden. We just can't not have joy anymore because all the

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.810
Tito: Code 19 stuff.

214
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is still every month.

215
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you also said you wanted to become a pilot.

216
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.110
Tito: That's always like this is like a dream of mine, I

217
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.600
Tito: Don't know how to go about that but

218
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.800
That's just something that

219
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.470
Tito: I like the goals that you think

220
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:27.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is something that you've always dreamed about. Have you ever explored what that would look like. What's that, so the tape to get you to that point. Yeah.

221
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, they require.

222
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:33.480
Of course,

223
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can't hear you. And what was that to

224
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.190
Tito: Transfer to the Air Force and finished my

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, OK.

227
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So pilots use a math degree, you have to have like some sort of

228
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.680
Schooling

229
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was that last part you broke up an

230
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.290
Tito: Officer in the Air Force, you have to have some kind of schooling.

231
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:08.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What other short term or long term goals, but you want to add personal, professional relationship wise.

232
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.900
Just

246
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.750
Tito: But since I have my military one. I'll have to do is the writing test.

247
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you have your military CD, would you want a civilian one now.

248
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, okay. I thought you had just civilian one, but she wanted to get the military one

Tito: Tried to get like a car mechanic, but

254
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.810
Tito: In the garden. There's not really that much jobs.

255
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.890
Tito: So like the truck drivers, kind of like, next, next thing.

256
00:23:51.720 --> 00:24:05.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh yeah, like I said, I don't know much about military services are intriguing to me, that would be interesting. So you could take some courses from the military that you're in, to get one of these licenses.

257
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the civilian license you would be able to drive like what the tapes.
