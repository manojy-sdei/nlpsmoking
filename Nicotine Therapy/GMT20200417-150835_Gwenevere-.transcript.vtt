Gwenevere Abriel: I need you to face me so I can. I want to be able to hear you, you know, instead of doing that, you just kind of get pissed and brush them off.

21
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:58.050

Lauraluj87: You like to call you back. I'm like, Yeah, that might help you

24
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.130
Lauraluj87: Remember,

25
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If I ever run into that that little attitude right there. I'll check in and I'll say, hey,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying. I'll say.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.180
Lauraluj87: Yeah, that'll probably that's probably what it is like if I, if you ever remember treating. Yeah. It's that it's that I can't hear you. And I got my screen. If I can

30
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.960
Yeah.

31
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.840
Lauraluj87: I know it's not you know it's me.

32
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.870
Lauraluj87: So of course, naturally, but naturally. You know, I became me my instinct and blame you for everything. So, you know,

33
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.150
Lauraluj87: But it's totally my fault. You're saying

34
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.770
Lauraluj87: So, so

35
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.170
Lauraluj87: You're ahead of time and

36
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Remind me. Um, was this help. I can't remember what health was what was help

37
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoot. Yes.

38
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.450
Lauraluj87: Yay. Yeah.

39
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.820
Lauraluj87: So funny you like you are good at what I mean like doing it like this.

40
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm all right what is today. Today is it's been a minute. Where you and I have not connected on individual

41
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You were outside the hospital and really proud of you for doing that. I know that wasn't an easy thing to do to jump online with me coming straight out of the hospital. So thank you for. Hmm.

42
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.890
Lauraluj87: It was worth it.

43
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

44
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm noticing you look like you have an energy that's kind of a little closer to normal.

45
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus last night you looked distressed.

46
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

47
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.900
Lauraluj87: Whenever

48
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.800
Lauraluj87: I i log excited. I figured I might as well get ready for, you know, put on a decent shirt and everything.

49
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

50
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk a little bit about yesterday because I want to understand the signs I want I made up a story, right, because I didn't know what was going on.

51
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And the story I made up and you can obviously correct me. Please do. But the story I made up on my head was I'm thinking that that Laura is in a little bit of withdrawal.

52
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I think she probably wasn't getting the regular dose of the buprenorphine. I thought that. And then I also thought, I wonder, she's having a thought like, Well, I don't even dig opiates my deal is mass and I don't even know if I'm allowed to talk about that right now. Um,

53
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

54
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in an

55
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: In an environment that I can't even be myself and I like because your environment, your home environment is just like

56
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:16.140
Lauraluj87: Um, well, here's my thing. So whenever I did that video okay not video with service a he has to do before group, whatever. Yeah, so I knew that. Okay, and then video I saw

57
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.480
Lauraluj87: That you don't get in trouble if you relapse. Is that correct,

58
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's

59
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.750
Lauraluj87: All I could tell you

60
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.730
Lauraluj87: I wouldn't cry.

61
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.200
Lauraluj87: Like you wouldn't go and, you know, important my hair right away. Okay.

62
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.980
Lauraluj87: Would you

63
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's talk about what trouble is, so, um, let me reassure you first. This is a treatment program clients relapse. Now, you all you call a

64
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Alas for lunch.

65
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I caught

66
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.970
Lauraluj87: A second we have to be, you know,

67
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.740
Lauraluj87: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

68
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Very but sometimes a full relapse happens. I have people that that have left me for a few months, and are coming back.

69
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So full relapses happened to or it's a what I'll call a slip. They sound different. So I'm going to keep them really slip and relapse sound really different. So that might be kind of useful for us. So, yeah.

70
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.860
Lauraluj87: I think it's more useful to do it that way and then the other way because I just found me too. And I'm like,

71
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. So, um, so, the question has to do have will I get in trouble because then you're unlikely to tell me if you think you're going to get in trouble you're unlikely to say the truth be told, I did. I tried to hydro or I had some some math or I did align a Coke.

72
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then, your question is probably to me. Are you going to go and let my pee. Oh no, I'm it

73
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I've never done that, number one, I don't know if that helps. I've never done that.

74
00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I say to you, I never will. That would be a mistake, because I don't know how it how self destructive, you would be

75
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:13.740
Lauraluj87: I see what you're saying. So it wasn't turned to my mental health, like if I was doing it to like, you know, go already or something. Yeah, you might want to, you know, mention that you like. Right.

76
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to look at a sample of what basically all of my participations look letters look like and then you'll go, oh, this is what she would communicate to my PO. Do you want to look at it.

77
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.730
Lauraluj87: Yeah, kinda. Yeah.

78
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me show you what a sample looks like and then you'll get you'll get more reassured.

79
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.230
Lauraluj87: When I

80
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Do have yeah it's a little different. I have some people in a drug court where the reporting the accountability is higher. And so those drug screens every single one and self reports, there's more reporting going on but that's

81
00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:01.440
Lauraluj87: Really, the thing is, I have to call me money. So I got no room for, you know what I mean. I gotta call me morning and saying, you know, you would you not custody. My dad about coming. You're saying

82
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.630
Lauraluj87: You're saying, I'm just warning you. I know you're

83
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think I heard that part of something like, I think I'm getting drug tested on a regular basis. I get called in randomly. I think you said that

84
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.410
Lauraluj87: Yeah. Oh my god.

85
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

86
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:18.870
Right.

87
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.090
But talking

88
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I like that level.

89
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.600
Lauraluj87: You okay

90
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.120
Lauraluj87: Are you okay

91
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

92
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me give

93
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: An example here.

94
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.060
Lauraluj87: At that time I should go to prepare

95
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. That's nice.

96
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.440
Lauraluj87: Just curiosity.

97
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.590
Lauraluj87: Yeah, yeah. How many years.

98
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 going on 13 think

99
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.230
Let

100
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Me see

101
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.450
Okay.

102
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me open this up to participation. I know it looks like I'm not doing anything but I'm looking for a document.

103
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.170
Lauraluj87: I know

104
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.650
I know

105
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.820
Lauraluj87: Tell me later to get my

106
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is this worth it. Let's, let's, we're going to address this and this, this should really help. I'm thinking, this will help

107
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Well just taking participation part this

108
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.370
Lauraluj87: Know I get I have to call every morning for drug testing a lot of time.

109
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.430
Lauraluj87: And it says, you know, do, do, do not test today or whatever yesterday.

110
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.260
Oh,

111
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how what you're wanting is, I think, to find out hey can I be open and honest with you, or is it just going to result in it, messing with my probation.

112
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:35.850
Lauraluj87: It's not kind of the right BRENDA Yeah, once again, I can't really say I fucked up. But I do what I did. I kind of whirling because I had to call the morning so there's no room.

113
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.250
Lauraluj87: So I didn't do anything. You know, wasn't like I haven't gotten in trouble because it was, it would have been covered, but like

114
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

115
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be. You might be saying to yourself, Hey Gwen's gonna believe this. There's no way I could possibly use in between. But I want you to know, after having worked in felony drug court for 14 years

116
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, of course you can use in between did i'm not i'm not a fool. Like, I know it looked like one but

117
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I've learned

118
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys when it comes to addictive behavior, it's smarter than me, you will come up with a way, if you're hell bent on finding a way to get high. You will outsmart me now it'll self destruct. And it's only harming you but

119
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.360
Lauraluj87: Just don't happen.

120
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But just so you know. I know I look like a fool, and you can fool me you can but don't think that I think I'm like as if the daily drug testing as if you can't work around it.

121
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, my clients can work around it.

122
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.650
Lauraluj87: Do you have any

123
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:55.230
Lauraluj87: You really wanting point is like, I'm not trying to fool you. I'm just trying to I'm trying to tell you, but like I just don't want you to like I don't know you.

124
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I won't get mad and you don't. Right. We don't have this sort of long term trust yet where I don't get I don't ever get mad at my clients, all I may look like it to you guys because I'm

125
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.590
Lauraluj87: I'm, I'm not. You're getting mad at me earlier and group.

126
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.490
Lauraluj87: To be honest with you.

127
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I wasn't so you've heard of like that sort of resting bitch face. I think I have one of those. So if I'm

128
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm not smiling, then I kind of look

129
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: look angry with my resting face.

130
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So I'm not. I'm just relaxing because smiling does take it takes a lot of smiling all day long. You know, eight, nine clients a day. It's a lot. It's a lot of smiling.

131
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's important is that you're telling me, and you can always say, hey, are you mad at me or I'm feeling like you're judging me. Are you mad at me. Are you right now.

132
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.190
Lauraluj87: I'm having your

133
00:12:54.030 --> 00:13:03.780
Lauraluj87: Own rental. Well, that's the thing. It's like currently what it comes down to one whether or not you're going to go on.

134
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I, yeah, I hear you so that we're going to get into that now. So I do have the report. I'm just taking out another clients name right now. Okay. It's in front of me.

135
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have Dr up real. Okay, so this is an example of 99.9%. This is exactly what they look like. And I'm gonna share the screen with you. Okay. Okay.

136
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So in general, they would look like this. Miss or P. O. Whatever's oftentimes I write it right to the person. So it might be

137
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, probation or

138
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.800
Lauraluj87: As any quarter over

139
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so this letter is to notify you that, you know, Miss Laura blue hat on remains enrolled in bright heart health outpatient program for him. He assisted treatment that's medication assisted

140
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.620
Therapy.

141
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.600
Lauraluj87: Since for admission and either

142
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I would put the right date.

143
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:03.690
Lauraluj87: Mr.

144
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Mrs so and so has consistently engaged in individual, group therapy as well as effectively communicate for medication.

145
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: During weekly schedule medication management services with such and such.

146
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.080
Lauraluj87: Okay.

147
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it, it doesn't talk about

148
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.300
Lauraluj87: Anything that particular group or anything.

149
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no. I am probably the one of the most conservative people as far as disclosures go, I can't say Dr brielle isn't quite as conservative as I am. That's not kind of her role.

150
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't see the difference between what said an individual therapy even something you say in here. I'm not going to bring into group. I'm going to ask you.

151
00:14:54.150 --> 00:15:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something you know hey we talked about something and you mentioned that you wanted to bring it into group. Do you want to bring it in. Now I'm not going to say, hey, we talked about your participation letter.

152
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are afraid. I would go tell your PO like I won't say

153
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't say anything that said in here in group.

154
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.070
Lauraluj87: Is we talked about it further and I said it was okay.

155
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it, but even then I will say it'll look like this.

156
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura, you asked me to remind you in group today that you wanted to bring a topic in. Do you want to share it or would you like me to, what would you like to do. I'm still going to be getting consent consent consent consent.

157
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of my clients abused, neglected, I asked consent. I'm not going to take a chance the trust is too important in our relationship and in the healing process. I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to take a chance

158
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's how I roll.

159
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:06.870
Lauraluj87: So,

160
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.850
Lauraluj87: Number know we were in group work number and like you guys

161
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.250
Lauraluj87: haven't given medication or whatever.

162
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We were talking about medication and there were certain picking it up and not picking it up. And I think there was a concern that maybe you weren't picking up your medicine.

163
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:46.680
Lauraluj87: Right. Well, I had a medicine. Okay, I had two trips or whatever wall I came over here finally give me more front on the bike or whatever. So I came over here. Finally, and this was sons, and then I have like a half a strip of maybe

164
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:58.500
Lauraluj87: And my mom saw that I was going through withdrawals. Okay. And she was like, you know, what do you withdrawing from this and that. And I said, Well, technically, you know nothing. You know, I had the sub but you know I have. I'm working in the hospital. You know what I mean.

165
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.550
Lauraluj87: And so she thought it was a good idea to

166
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.680
Lauraluj87: You know, just helped me out until

167
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What did she give you

168
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you're gonna be

169
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.050
Lauraluj87: Nothing to just help me out. Oh.

170
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, why don't I guess. Did she give you a benzodiazepine like a Xanax or out of him.

171
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so I'm guessing correctly. I'm a good guesser on it.

172
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And that was code that was code for I can't talk.

173
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Body.

174
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.530
Lauraluj87: So that's what happened.

175
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I so she helped me out and step mom gave me was it added in on as a PM, or we think. So if you hear the word was it sound effect.

176
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.560
Lauraluj87: For one second.

177
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so clonazepam maybe or

178
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Our finance of him. Okay, that's actually, that's a good one. It metabolizes quickly. That's good.

179
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.140
Lauraluj87: So it gets out of this kind of

180
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a depressant, which means that lowers the heart rate and and the respiratory breathing. So when you also have an opiate and then you have to depressants definitely don't want to be taking those at the same time, because you could die.

181
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

182
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.880
Lauraluj87: We have been treated and I've been an awesome, awesome.

183
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so what's key is you don't want to be taking two depressants. At the same time, we don't want to be doing heroin percocet oxy and a benzodiazepine. Those are your ad Yvan Xanax clonazepam Pam all the Pam's

184
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Pam. Pam. Pam, most of your Danny's

185
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.780
Lauraluj87: Well, I have, I think, Lexapro on a weekly basis.

186
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay.

187
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay on the Lexapro.

188
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

189
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.920
Lauraluj87: Today is Monday or

190
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so on Sunday. Do you want me to guess the milligrams. It was it one milligram on Sunday five milligrams

191
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.980
One.

192
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: On Sunday, so one milligram on Sunday. Were there any milligrams taken on

193
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Monday.

194
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

195
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.480
Lauraluj87: Now I'm at that point, I was like, pragmatic level one.

196
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it feeling better, like, okay, I see I can, I can talk about

197
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.440
Lauraluj87: No, no.

198
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, well, why don't we keep doing that. Then, and let's really check in, because your drug of choice. Your go to is a stimulant you you like the math, so how how far back, has it been since you've even had any even residual on a pipe, just anything

199
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.260
Lauraluj87: That gets thought of it.

200
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: No, actually ingesting it

201
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.760
Lauraluj87: When I first got out. I had like

202
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.840
Lauraluj87: Half a shot, but that was it. And then

203
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:17.280
Lauraluj87: And then I after I stopped because I realized that if I can only then it would, you know, I mean, am I, what am I, it was my fault. I cannot wait, no one has done all this

204
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.100
Lauraluj87: And I'm like, well, what's really

205
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.670
Lauraluj87: Come on, like, you're not gonna, you're not under

206
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.120
Lauraluj87: Planner like literally on a platter in front of me and know who you're nothing yet.

207
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about, give me your boyfriend's name.

208
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, Kyle.

209
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Kyle so

210
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:48.120
Lauraluj87: Let's get to know it's my fault it was my fault. I'm on the told me to do it. I told him to do it because I didn't want and doing it in a bathroom and waiting for me. I'd rather hundreds in front of

211
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.350
Lauraluj87: Me and I'm saying that

212
00:20:50.820 --> 00:21:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to get to know you and Kyle's relationship, a little bit because our relationships are important, right, the relationships step moms important the relationship with having to live with it.

213
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.120
Lauraluj87: For about a year and a half. I played this game with him, where I wouldn't, you know,

214
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:11.460
Lauraluj87: Views in a week and then tell him. Okay, I'm not wasting any more than I did. And go leave someone else.

215
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:19.980
Lauraluj87: And then, you know, that was kind of like him for about a year and a half. And then finally, you know, I realized that he should regard, I can't do it anymore. I left.

216
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:30.360
Lauraluj87: And then after like six months and I, you know, want to go hustle do my own to the game and then I finally got arrested. This was in June last year.

217
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:39.960
Lauraluj87: And I realized, you know, sitting in jail saw on the course of their free trial. So I told myself that if I ever came back in the room now and you know that, you know, not

218
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:56.850
Lauraluj87: To be with him. So in August. I went back to him and I said, You know, I'm trying to do only young only guys. I mean, you know, we can wrap me to come back and I have been faithful to him ever since. Like I hadn't left him. I've been nice. I like ever since until I got arrested in June.

219
00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:58.980
Lauraluj87: So,

220
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.360
Lauraluj87: Unless I run a little warm

221
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And I remember, I can see my notes known him for five years, then together on and off for one and a half. I got serious nice nine months ago. He has been in love with me for three years.

222
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have some notes from that.

223
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

224
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask you about some of the basic changes that most people, and you'll come to know this on your own. I'll, I'll say it, but she probably won't believe me.

225
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll have to kind of come to it on your own timing, but I'll say it anyway, just because the frequency broken record does work for some people.

226
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say change people, places and things

227
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to roll your eyes. Do you want to be like, Oh, that's so stupid. I've heard it a million times, or do you are you starting to see that if you don't change the people, the places you're hanging out with the things you used to do.

228
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.520
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I might go back to old patterns.

229
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it's not because it has nothing to do with willpower that word. Actually, I'll never I'll never use it in part of our treatment together. It'll never be brought up because it's not a thing.

230
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Where once we used to think it was this willpower thing. Now we have neuroscience to explain

231
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Why all the sudden I had this smell. I didn't even know I had a smell, and all of a sudden I want to use and I can't get this thought out of my head, right. So this is not willpower. This is because you have

232
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Synapses you have neuronal connections.

233
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: They were fire together, which means you were wearing something listening something seeing something sitting somewhere feeling something and you used, and all of those thousands of connections in your brain millions probably have connections.

234
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: At some point they're going to fire again.

235
00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to call it a craving and you're going to say, oh, what's wrong with me. I've been clean for so long. What's the deal.

236
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to go to jail. Why am I thinking about is using. And I'm going to say is, you had a trigger you ran across one maybe not one that you even know because it may have been a sense how often are we aware of what we're smelling at any given time in the day, like what

237
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not paying attention to that you might right because you're because you have some challenge with hearing. I bet your senses are even more heightened in other areas. That's pretty

238
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.040
Lauraluj87: One sentence.

239
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:42.030
Lauraluj87: I couldn't like to touch with them on it. Honestly I can't, I can't smell. I can't hear. Okay. Here capsule can see I work on that. I can't see every other sentence I like touches like

240
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

241
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Tactile that's really going to be important for me to know because you and I are going to do probably down the line will do some will do grounding in the five senses. Well, I'll go over that technique.

242
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And I already taught you the belly breathing, but it's important because now I know that's going to be a go to that will be really good.

243
00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Like if you're experiencing distress, you know, let's say you're going to have to talk to the judge or something like that. You really want to stay centered and not not be freaking out. You might be some would keep an object in their pocket.

244
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you would be feeling it.

245
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you have that dual awareness and you'd be feeling

246
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: He'd be feeling that on your thumb and really paying attention to this. And then you could get out of that kind of negative thinking that could end up being something you and I do down the line.

247
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, very cool. So when I say change people, places and things which one seems the hardest for you to do. Would you say

248
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.620
Lauraluj87: People. People.

249
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And is that because you're living with

250
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: People or

251
00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.110
Lauraluj87: No, no.

252
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

253
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.630
Lauraluj87: Well, okay, my cell phone right now. Actually, I like what's on my act like she she has a missing forward and she has

254
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.730
Lauraluj87: She has

255
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:27.930
Lauraluj87: Two years. Okay, so technically what she does like she has reasons for everything. She does. She's been annex for 25 years or more, like, you know what I mean, like, and she only pick one. So technically, she's not she's not that she never got

256
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.600
Lauraluj87: My hand up.

257
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dad does

258
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.670
Lauraluj87: Yeah, and with all

259
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.770
Lauraluj87: That

260
00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And

261
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.520
Lauraluj87: She was the worst thing that can kill you.

262
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.260
Lauraluj87: Whenever you know

263
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.540
Lauraluj87: Whenever you're withdrawing from home. They can both

264
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever had a seizure that you've seen

265
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:58.290
Lauraluj87: No, I read off on a multiple times one thing for whatever mean like knowing and Joe whenever he goes to call the cops. I'm like,

266
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.660
Lauraluj87: But because I can go do if he goes to do. And she didn't

267
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:11.550
Lauraluj87: Because if he if he gets put in jail. I'm going right back to them, right. That's because I got really seen as

268
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so here's my question, I think you're there, because you don't have a stable grandmother or aren't right. Right. And so you're sort of stuck with this scenario.

269
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.860
Lauraluj87: So tell me, somebody that looks

270
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.610
Lauraluj87: good on paper.

271
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I know we all know I want to know what you're doing to survive staying the night there how your how you're doing it. I'm

272
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.710
Lauraluj87: Talking to my boyfriend.

273
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.560
Lauraluj87: My home putting stress on him kind of

274
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.880
Okay.

275
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.980
Lauraluj87: I mean, he might escape. One early like he keeps me going.

276
00:27:54.090 --> 00:28:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And, for example, is there a lock on your door. Does that help at all. Can you lock them.

277
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.420
Lauraluj87: Yeah, Trisha, Trisha locks the door. But like I said, I mean her shirt.

278
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, sharing the room. And how did that come about. Did you ask for that.

279
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:23.340
Lauraluj87: Her name's turtle. But yeah, but it be to be known stairs, because I was sleeping downstairs for a while and not being home, but I don't like you know my dad fucking come down through the roof for five minutes and bothered me so

280
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so good. That's better. Even though Teresa's not ideal. At least there's this sense

281
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.410
Lauraluj87: Better walk out or like

282
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:36.810
Lauraluj87: Okay.

283
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you noticed

284
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Any change in stomach problems, any kind of issues because you're back in that home with him.

285
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.830
Lauraluj87: Yeah, that's what's going on my side started like really bad and good lost my son.

286
00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:04.170
Lauraluj87: And then some painful and I'm like, like my Rican my needy about yesterday and like I know like put a British on it because

287
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.120
Lauraluj87: I'm

288
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:18.900
Lauraluj87: Sure being feeling like, like, like, even when I took a stripper yesterday i can i don't know i medication. You know what I mean I don't take a shower yesterday and I like it made me feel better, but like, it was kind of like

289
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. So do you want to discuss

290
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can do it in group, you can do it in what's called a breakout meeting with the doctor, you can say, hey, I'd like to meet with you for a few minutes in a breakout meeting.

291
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: She sends this little electronic message you just move into another zoom room with her talk with her and then come back to group, you can do that.

292
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And in there, you may want to consider talking to her that maybe that dose that you're on, it might be too high, you might say, hey, this is I'm still

293
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.300
Lauraluj87: Not sleeping.

294
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I will admit, I know, but it does mess with your sleep. You think it wouldn't, but it does messes with it.

295
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just saying, you may want to talk with her a little bit about that because if it's sleep, then it's things like, Oh, I can take quantity and right before I go to sleep, or maybe she'll talk to you about Sarah.

296
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe she'll talk to you about docs a pen or Galpin so if you stay talking with her.

297
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: About what your concerns are there might be other medications that she could explore and make sure you tell him also taking Lexapro, make sure that they're not contract indicated

298
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to consider doing that or scheduling an appointment with her, just to discuss that. Okay.

299
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

300
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So people

301
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the biggest challenge. So, ah,

302
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get up and get out of there, usually by now you'd be gone. You'd be gone by.

303
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.180
Lauraluj87: Yeah, but lately. Yeah. The men like that. Give me my boyfriend, but

304
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to talk a little bit about what you guys are arguing over

305
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.100
Lauraluj87: Me and Me and my son monkey angels

306
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. He's jealous of Teresa.

307
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about

308
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.010
Lauraluj87: Nothing. You just seems like it like

309
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:33.060
Lauraluj87: You can, you know, kind of your stuff like last night. I mean, we're talking over. And I said, Well, you know, I'll be over there. Morning, take care, because he is really bad. So I told him, I said, Okay, well don't know grab over here.

310
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:42.180
Lauraluj87: On our okay anyways let's walk over there and, you know, I'll just take your you like I have this

311
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:49.230
Lauraluj87: Money on I'll put on your back. It'll be fine. You know, I mean, like, I'll just, I'll take care of you come down like I'll give you a coconut water do you find

312
00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:56.940
Lauraluj87: And he was like, well, you know, even even bothering you so much. I think you just kind of step mom and you know she could fix it. Like, oh god.

313
00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do

314
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: He likes

315
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: She likes the role with you a hero.

316
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants to be the hero.

317
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:09.930
Lauraluj87: But I never let him.

318
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you do a little I lean on him all the time. I call him, he likes. He likes that role. And so now it's threatened because right Teresa's taking that on. I'll talk

319
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll talk to you about the drama triangle and a little bit. Not today really kind of want to zero in on more skills, just for a minute. Want to add one more. We did the belly breathing.

320
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you done it.

321
00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you remember the belly breathing. Did I

322
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.020
Lauraluj87: Do yesterday.

323
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it bring your heart rate down

324
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.250
Lauraluj87: A little bit because like I like actually you know that they're not like, Okay, calm down. And I was like,

325
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:05.520
Lauraluj87: Well, I can't hold it in. You know what I mean, like a lot of going on. And I felt like all like the stress that I had, like, my response to him was, OK, I will

326
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:14.310
Lauraluj87: If you, if you're going to act like that. And I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of the argument that you want. You know what I mean, you're gonna be like, oh, maybe I'm not going to do

327
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.140
Lauraluj87: Okay.

328
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:17.730
Lauraluj87: Thank you.

329
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. I want to do one more clarification. I just watched you do this.

330
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

331
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.460
Lauraluj87: I know but

332
00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see you do it then come on girl. Let me see you do the inhale.

333
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, don't move the shoulders and only thing. Notice I'm not moving. Just the tummy. Watch.

334
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, just have that belly pooch out. The only thing that goes out. Look, my shoulders don't vote.

335
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You see how about you know I can.

336
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull desk down. Let me just

337
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Put a little pressure. Okay, here we go. How about how about now.

338
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:11.970
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

339
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's my inhale, watch my inhale.

340
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice my shoulders.

341
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Hands come out.

342
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard because I watched you earlier. And I know you were animating it to be kind of cutesy about it, but this

343
00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we always did. And yes, that goes with. Hey, take a deep breath and chill and I get that. But remember, I'm wanting that that Vegas nerve to get activated, that is going to signal up to the brain. You're safe that heart rate that demand for oxygen can go down.

344
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what that blood can go to the prefrontal cortex, it can get back into your fingers and your feet, they won't be cold anymore.

345
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So that might seem crazy that I keep focusing on that belly, but it can make a difference. So whatever benefit you're already getting is going to get even better when you do this, okay.

346
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now. Did you feel the difference versus

347
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.100
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

348
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus, this would look. This doesn't even move and I was cracking on Dr. Real yesterday. She's like,

349
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That. And I'm like,

350
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I know what I know.

351
00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Science. Okay. So anyway, that's the key. I'm really glad, first of all, that you remembering it though. That's really cool. I want to teach you another one.

352
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just, you can always interrupt me if I've already taught it to you or you don't want to refresh, or just let me know. But these two things, the belly breathing and the grounding and the five senses are things that I grounding in the five senses.

353
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Are really cool. I'm going to teach it to you and then I'm going to do it with you. Okay.

354
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to teach it, and then I'm going to do it with you.

355
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to teach it, and then do it with you. Okay, um,

356
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So you saw that poster. Right.

357
00:36:47.400 --> 00:37:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The way it's written it's five things you see four things you feel three things you hear two things you smell. One thing you taste. I don't do it that way. I do as many things.

358
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That I can see but it's only data coming through my eyes. It's not a name. It's not lizard. It's metal shiny black angles um dots hands, arms triangle line flat bumpy shiny gray words, did you hear those

359
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good. So they're adjectives. They're not

360
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Self West lizard magnet. You know, I don't say that not labels. I want to get as many adjectives, as I can.

361
00:37:43.980 --> 00:38:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to do one with you. I mean, I ask you to do as many things as you can that are coming from what you see color, shape angles blighting words as much as you can from just from your eyes, not a label. It's not rock. It's gray shiny rough BLACK, PURPLE, you see that it's not block.

362
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You okay

363
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.060
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I'm just looking around. I'm like,

364
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm gonna give you one I

365
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Think

366
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you what I got to

367
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.010
Lauraluj87: Wait, I'm like, I don't know how to describe it.

368
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:31.950
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

369
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: No Labels only adjectives descriptions. Here we go. You ready, here it goes. And I got a good one for you.

370
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.740
Lauraluj87: Okay, so that's pink, orange, blue

Lauraluj87: Let's call like

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That like it looked like a hollow kind of thing. Beautiful. All right, now, now you get to do tactile so take your right hand and put it on something. Um, how about your

395
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got,

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.390
Lauraluj87: Hello. I don't know. Let me grab this one.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how about you do it on your bracelet feel feel your bracelets.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.850
Okay.

399
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it in your right hand, right hand only

400
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now describe what you feel.

401
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.320
Lauraluj87: Bumps I'm

402
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.330

Gwenevere Abriel: Temperature.

404
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.440
Lauraluj87: Metal cold.

405
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.460
Haha

406
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.500
Lauraluj87: Maybe

407
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.210
Lauraluj87: Of course,

408
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

409
00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.560
Lauraluj87: Um,

410
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.280
Lauraluj87: Plastic

411
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Bottles plastic like it doesn't feel solid, right, it feels kind of like

412
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, keep going, white light guy.

413
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.670
Um,

414
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Are some of them different from another. And so your fingers move to one that has some ridges to it, maybe

415
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.140
Lauraluj87: Yeah ridges on I just

416
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:28.770
Lauraluj87: Don't know. Um, okay. And I said three and

417
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now. Now close your eyes and just see, it's about what you do here, see what you can hear just sitting here, it could be a humming sound a buzzing sound. A rumbling sound.

418
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.840
Lauraluj87: Does a journal. Yeah.

419
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so refrigerator went

Lauraluj87: I can hear.

422
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about, do you hear any crippling from

423
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming from the zoom Tele

424
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Conference anything coming through, they're

425
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.720
Lauraluj87: Not really. Didn't you

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Write you can hear my voice. So we got a little voice coming through there. I'm

427
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.240
Lauraluj87: Like I said, the refrigerator.

428
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.810
Lauraluj87: I don't know how in the morning it on them and your name. Don't ask me, but

429
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.400
Lauraluj87: Miracle.

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that now now to know that out and see if you can catch a smell even one. What would you say is in their

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: All your close up to your nose.

434
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.730
Lauraluj87: Plastic for the bracelet.

436
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Good call. Good. And now one thing that's a taste, see what's in your mouth.

437
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.940
Lauraluj87: I don't know my lipstick clinch with chopsticks.

438
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that lipstick is it does it have a flavor to it. Is it better.

439
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.590
Lauraluj87: Kind of describe them will just tastes like mango chopsticks. I got car, my friend.

440
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got it any leftover coffee subs juice toothpaste.

441
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:14.970
Anything.

442
00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.560
Lauraluj87: New. Yes, I was.

443
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.420
Lauraluj87: Good girls.

444
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice.

445
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm going to tell you

446
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice, while you were doing this activity that you are working very hard to give me what I was asking for. Did you notice your mind was very fast on that.

447
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.040
Lauraluj87: That's not about female

448
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But did you notice you were working very hard to give me those adjectives.

449
00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good.

450
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Did your mind drift off into 100 different places.

451
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.310
Lauraluj87: Or were you like, oh,

452
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.150
Like

453
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like really joining

454
00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.670
Lauraluj87: Me, I should try and get

455
00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Now guess what

456
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still

457
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: On supervision still living with that still trouble with boyfriend, all those things still existed. What you did was move from a part of the brain.

458
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: A neural network and you moved it you focus all your attention on something novel novel means new

459
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The mind loves new things. It will catch new like what was that notice it's like, Oh, what was that the brain wants something new. He loves it. Like what system. What does that say, what does that

460
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, Okay, what's distinctive to Denton, okay. So it wants to know what that is, it's like, Oh, hey. So immediately is going to zero in on it. So we take advantage of that and we say all right brain listen here.

461
00:44:54.060 --> 00:45:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're freaking me out in this whole thing like I'm feeling sad and scared and angry and all of these things over here and I'm going to use thought stopping and say thank you. You've kept me alive so far. Thank you.

462
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're kind of stressing me out. So I'm going to do grounding in the five senses and I'm going to get one object. And I'm going to look at it.

463
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to just focus on it. Oh, it's black. It's rigid. It's gray. It's shiny sparkle smooth sparkle glossy while laminated flat.

464
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to feel it. I'm going to do grounding in the five senses to get out of that neural network. I'm going to focus my brain on something else.

465
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

466
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.080
Yeah.

467
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.330
Lauraluj87: Okay.

468
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:56.730
Lauraluj87: Are you okay

469
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:00.570
Lauraluj87: Continue.

470
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're learning something new that's going to take all your attention when you literally focus on five things you see

471
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: as many things as you can hear, as many things as you can taste or smell.

472
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to get your mind out of the negative neural network. This may seem really oversimplified, but it works. It's the reason why

473
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You might call your boyfriend. And you might say, I want to be distracted. I don't want to think about this anymore. Let's talk about something else. It's the same thing.

474
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get my mind off of it and you since we now know that tactile is an important one.

475
00:46:43.590 --> 00:47:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to have a lot of little things like I have this little bowl and I have. I've got lots of little things. I've got lots of little stuff that I use in case I wanna, I want to get out in my head, or of course I'm teaching this all day long to but

476
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, especially this one. See how is this got little crystals in it.

477
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It hurts out

478
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can really get into this one. It's very rough

479
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's got a lot of visual and a lot of sensation. So when you're about to go to court or you're going to have a conversation with someone difficult

480
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be something I could keep

481
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can keep this in my pocket.

482
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. In pocket right in here, and I could be. I could feel that in my pocket. This almost hurts. See how sharp that is

483
00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, look how there's so much going on. There's all these little bumps in here. And then there's I can play with this. It's like a Fidget

484
00:47:54.990 --> 00:48:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of things going, I can be. And it can get out of my head. What that's going to do it's going to lower

485
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And lower the heart rate, which is what we want, because then the rest of our brain is working. I can remember. Other things that I can do to get through a difficult moment.

486
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you think of a time when you might use grounding in the five senses. Can you think of a time when you would use that

487
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:28.020
Lauraluj87: Thank you say going to court. Maybe you've had a few um once. Actually, no, but I guess you're talking about feel like I just talked to him earlier and I don't doesn't trust me.

488
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:35.400
Lauraluj87: I'm going to end well. So why, you know, I mean, like, I don't know if that makes any sense or not, but I'm regardless. I'm

489
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:50.220
Lauraluj87: Like there's not any stress and not feel like like my dad was a call you. Okay, you know, how's your people, you know, are you okay talking to you. I'm like, Yeah, right. Like you just a person like all he wants to see me succeed and get on. I mean,

490
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:51.870
Lauraluj87: There's no stress.

491
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: When, could you use it, I'm want this so

492
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: My god, yes. There we go. That's the one.

493
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, if you know you're going to have to talk to him right you can stay in your body and not dissociate staying your body, not having to kind of leave your body

494
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get all that deeper work another time, but this will help you stay stay in here. Oh, I'm going to focus on how my feet feel in my shoe.

495
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can feel the bumps. I'm feeling the weight. It's kind of squishy here on the left, I notice all my weights mostly on my left.

496
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Was mostly on my heel. Now it's going back and forth. I can get back in here and then out of my fear my threat response up here. I'm not focused on my gut turning. Okay.

497
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I can have a positive experience. I can survive this. I'm okay.

498
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You're at a crummy situation. I'm not gonna lie. I wish I could get you out of there.

499
00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this would be this would be one that would keep you in your body so that you can think straight. Okay. Because I don't want you just associating where you're leaving your body

500
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because right, you're going to need to stay sort of in a relaxed vigilance.

501
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed how you're like, are you okay. Everything okay like you're you're you're alert you're staying alert and I want you to continue to have that this will keep you sharp without having you be. And what's a threat response okay for the hardest racing and you can't think straight

502
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: To keep you in your body. So I definitely think having some you have your bracelets right there. You could easily just just be twiddling with them.

503
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:37.500
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

504
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah now also tell you the right side of my body is run by my left hemisphere, the left hemisphere is whereby logic is and

505
00:50:53.160 --> 00:51:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Language. So if I'm feeling emotionally activated, like let's say I'm having a really big stress response. I can also put this object in my right hand. That's why I had to put it in your right hand.

506
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's going to activate this left side of the brain, the right one is typically where all those big emotions are being processed and I kind of want to get you out of there.

507
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get you over into sort of language and be able to say, oh, I'm scared. Oh, I'm afraid. Oh, I'm angry. I want you over here on the left side in those in those moments.

508
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can also go to if you're in a really big stress response. You can go over to the fridge. Get an ice cube and your right hand and just pay attention to the how that feels in a really, really bad way. Go get a piece of ice and hold it in your right hand and feel it. It's cold.

509
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how long it will take before it melts. I can feel it in my index finger. I can feel it moving here. I can feel it here. Oh, I can feel it in my hand now. Oh, I can feel the drip, drip,

510
00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Start to breathe again. Well, I just remember, once I did this. Then I remembered my breath. It's like, oh yeah, I'm okay. I'm in my body. I'm okay.

511
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of cooling. Yeah, that's a great one that comes out of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy from DDT. Good stuff. All right, let's schedule another appointment for next week. Okay.

512
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Use my pencil.

513
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You definitely want to know things about me and my married house and apartment.

514
00:52:55.230 --> 00:53:00.300
Lauraluj87: I do. Well, I know, I know you're not supposed to talk about yourself, but you can tell me that. Like, come on.

515
00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:01.800
Lauraluj87: Well, we

516
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Will make a deal if you can tell me why it's important to you, then I'll do it.

517
00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:09.750
Lauraluj87: Because I want to know more about you.

518
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What will that do for you will

519
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:14.640
Lauraluj87: Develop, trust me, maybe I don't make you feel better.

520
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.600
Lauraluj87: Then I will like you're not just on a camera.

521
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

522
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I know I feel uncomfortable with it because I don't share with people, but I'll give you a

523
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.390
Lauraluj87: Question. If I then come on

524
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Up. This is a house. This is my office. My office in here. So if you were here, you'd be seated on this couch.

525
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:51.180

546
00:55:51.870 --> 00:56:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can remember to practice grounding in the five senses. How many things am I, what am I seeing I'm looking at one thing I'm going to try and describe as much as I can about this one thing I'm going to describe it.

547
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to focus on it.

550
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I shoulda coulda woulda none of that. Just do grounding in the five senses, you're going to see that it's going to bring down the intensity of whatever distress you were in, it's going to bring that down.

551
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what we want. This is a coping skill. It's a great one. And for you, tactile
