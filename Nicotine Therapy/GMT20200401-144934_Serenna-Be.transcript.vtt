Galaxy Note9: Most emotional

267
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.780
LSD.

268
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.430
Galaxy Note9: We use

269
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.810
Mm hmm.

270
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.900
Galaxy Note9: So I'd like to actually not go back

271
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.960
Galaxy Note9: To that

272
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:44.160
Galaxy Note9: Mindset like now on a more serious because I'm you know because of lack of, you know, putting you know drugs in my system not

273
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:56.040
Galaxy Note9: Like now well my girl says, you know, now your eyes opening really seeing things as they really are, you know, because you've been in a daze for 30 years so

274
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.780
Galaxy Note9: So like everything pisses me off.

275
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.300
Galaxy Note9: I mean, I got a short fuse and

276
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.310
Galaxy Note9: Not necessarily sure for us. They just i just i have low tolerance for stupidity.

277
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:32.610
Galaxy Note9: Know maybe he wants to get in there. No, I don't know, but you know certain things are to hell out of me. Like if I'm standing in line. It makes me mad for so wanted to just walk in and cut it everybody and ask for what they want and then trying to lead real quick. You know I'm saying

278
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:47.970
Galaxy Note9: Huh. It pisses me off. You've seen standing in line. Why would you just cut in front of me just even if you want one you've been if you're just purchasing one item real fast, is one way, just like I'm doing. I got one item to

279
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.850
Serenna Beers: Right, so

280
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.630
Serenna Beers: Sounds like maybe learning how to

281
00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:05.790
Serenna Beers: regulate your emotion, but I'm I am sure that you understand after 3334 years of addiction. You've done some damage to your frontal lobe.

282
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:18.120
Serenna Beers: And not to say that you can't get that back because over time what what you're explaining our paws symptoms and those are post acute withdrawal, which I know that you know about right.

283
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:33.300
Serenna Beers: So, and, and the research shows that it can last up to 18 MONTHS. I BELIEVE from a clinical perspective that it can last a hell of a lot more. And the reason I say that is because I like to, you know, I feel like there's times

284
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.920
Serenna Beers: I have 13 years clean and I sometimes feel like there is

285
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:55.350
Serenna Beers: residual effect, I call them permit tweaks. I feel like there's things that I still do that make me feel like I like I have that same

286
00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.000
Galaxy Note9: Be

287
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.790
Serenna Beers: Are you know that I act the same and it's just

288
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:05.880
Serenna Beers: Different times when I'm trying to regulate my my emotions, but

289
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.070
Serenna Beers: There's days when I can deal with it pretty well. And then there's other days when I think what is wrong with me.

290
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:20.400
Serenna Beers: You know, and so just really, I just want to make sure that you understand wholeheartedly that that's everything you're feeling is a normal

291
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:29.910
Serenna Beers: Normal, normal to us normal to who we are being recovering addicts. You know what I mean.

292
00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:46.140
Galaxy Note9: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I would like to describe it as, you know, typically been impossible to, you know, gain good mood because you're moving that you know that euphoric feeling that you had that came from the drugs and stuff so that your body has to kind of read on the things that

293
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:56.640
Galaxy Note9: You know, not produce those chemical. What is it, serotonin and dopamine, meaning you know what it was.

294
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:01.950
Galaxy Note9: And all that

295
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:16.020
Galaxy Note9: Effort to thank you ma'am, and it's impossible for a person and being a good mood because the body haven't been producing those chemicals so that you can have those before feelings that regulate the

296
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.240
Galaxy Note9: Things of that nature.

297
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.980
Serenna Beers: That comes back, it comes back with with time.

298
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:36.540
