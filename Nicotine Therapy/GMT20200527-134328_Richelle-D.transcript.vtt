Brooke Oaks: Now, I have not. They the doctor told me to set up appointments, but she didn't say which group. I was supposed to be. And so they left a note and

12
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.450
Brooke Oaks: Said that I needed to be said for group, but I didn't know which one yet.

Brooke Oaks: 12

34
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.680
Brooke Oaks: How much are the groups because I'm self pay, right now I'm working on getting insurance but

35
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.950
Brooke Oaks: I'm just kind of curious, what am I looking at

36
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.030
Richelle Direny: That when you see you have to speak.

37
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.420
To

38
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.980
Richelle Direny: In terms of your the feet. When you say you have no insurance whatsoever.

39
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.000
Richelle Direny: Right, yeah. So you'd have to speak with the virtual clinic and they will tell you.

40
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.810
What the fees.

41
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.300
Brooke Oaks: By the way, my mom is with me, she have a

42
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.830
Brooke Oaks: What's it called

43
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.900
Brooke Oaks: That paper.

44
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:54.090
Brooke Oaks: What paper release of information for her. She knows me just about as well as I know me so I'm if I can't come up with the words for something she is here. So if you hear somebody talking. I'm going to be her if it's not me.

45
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.880
Richelle Direny: You you provided that release of information on

46
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.030
Yeah.

47
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.130
Richelle Direny: That's right.

48
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.400
Yep.

49
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.370
Brooke Oaks: She usually helps me out with the initial appointments, because she helps me like word things and helps me kind of explain things better and I have anxiety. So

50
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.370
Brooke Oaks: Okay. Definitely first time.

51
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:13.350
Richelle Direny: Alright, so if you could just, you know, just jot that down only for tomorrow. You could come at the 12 o'clock or myself and Natalie runs that group, um,

52
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.990
Richelle Direny: Are you hearing me

53
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.700
Brooke Oaks: Yes. Sorry, I had an alarm go off and I had to shut it off.

54
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.070
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, yeah.

55
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:32.940
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry. So, Natalie and myself are in that group. So we and like I said I'll be here sign counselor and kind of at the end of this

56
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.790
Richelle Direny: We will kind of review and discuss kind of how your

57
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.660
Richelle Direny: Your appointments will go from here. Sorry.

58
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.360
Brooke Oaks: He said, what, I'm sorry.

59
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.430
Richelle Direny: So I said, myself.

60
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.450
Richelle Direny: I'm a

61
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:56.160
Richelle Direny: Therapist and Natalie's the one that arm. She's the physician assistant and she will be the one to do your medicine so she which her and I run the group on Thursdays.

62
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:12.780
Richelle Direny: That you will weekly. So just kind of given that this is outside of meeting with her for the initial appointment and now with me. So I'm going to go over some of the rules and then we'll get into the intake process by kind of that getting those what I call it. Um, so

63
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.100
Richelle Direny: You come, especially when you come to group.

64
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.190
Richelle Direny: I know you're, you said that your mom is with you, like when we're doing one on one.

65
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

66
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:34.320
Richelle Direny: Right, but not for the groups. Yes, because there are so many people there. We ask that you have a headset in just for the purpose of confidentiality and things of that nature.

67
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, especially when you're looking for the groups and and you know always being in a private area.

68
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:57.900
Richelle Direny: Know, sometimes I know. Because of this, this, this platform being on a video chat. It allows you the ability to move up and down or what have you. And if you're going to do that especially again in a group setting you just keep your, your headset in

69
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.790
Brooke Oaks: You can't should do Thursdays at six because it'd be a better time for me to know when my appointment is for sure be awakened by then.

70
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.740
Brooke Oaks: I was, I don't know you, said I. Okay.

71
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.390
Brooke Oaks: I may end up changing my group. Time to six.

72
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.680
Brooke Oaks: But I'm not certain yet. So I'll leave it as it is right now. But you said I can change it whenever

73
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.430
Richelle Direny: It's

74
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:43.890
Richelle Direny: Fine to the 12 O'clock group which is, I mean, the thing is, you know, people are assigned to different groups. I also when we created the groups we created that you know because things happen, like you said, Maybe 12 O'clock Mondays at 12 works for you.

75
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:52.050
Richelle Direny: But then you get a job. And that changes. And then, so you would have to come on a Thursday at noon or six because of your schedule. That's fine.

76
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.430
Richelle Direny: You just have to come to

77
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.330
Richelle Direny: The other, the other so

78
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.800
Brooke Oaks: Look, you guys before

79
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.570
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

80
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.940
Brooke Oaks: When I was with you guys before

81
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.040
Brooke Oaks: You could only change it. Like, do a one time change for your appointment time

82
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.620
Brooke Oaks: For the group's okay

83
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:21.330
Richelle Direny: If I know. So this is the other piece of it because your, your prescriptions are written weekly and so it's written based on

84
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:29.610
Richelle Direny: The day you attend group. So if you do Mondays, then every Monday, you wouldn't you would have needed that refill.

85
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.160
Brooke Oaks: That's just the only thing

86
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:38.160
Richelle Direny: So that's the other reason why you know say to try to keep it consistent on the day. So if you want me to

87
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:48.150
Richelle Direny: I mean, if you're if you're working on getting you know job during the day, then maybe for you, Thursdays at six will be fine for us. The other thing is that those groups are very large

88
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:56.460
Richelle Direny: So Mondays at six where the group is a little bit lighter that's, you know, so you take come tomorrow.

89
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.690
Brooke Oaks: 12 x

90
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.900
Richelle Direny: Kind of see the feel of it will see the layout of the way

91
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.310
Richelle Direny: Then that's on Monday. See the layout of the land and then you can say, Okay, listen, I prefer right

92
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.220
Brooke Oaks: At 10 o'clock tomorrow and then

93
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.880
They'll

94
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.830
Brooke Oaks: Welcome clock.

95
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.990
Richelle Direny: There's 12 and 6pm

96
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.300
Brooke Oaks: Thursday at 12 and then Mondays at 10

97
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.280
Richelle Direny: Know 12 everything is 12

98
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.010
Brooke Oaks: Maybe

99
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.820
Brooke Oaks: At 12

100
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.540
Okay.

101
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.830
Richelle Direny: Maybe if it's an individual

102
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.100
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, um,

103
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:51.540
Richelle Direny: Now, we talked about the group and you know the other thing is just, you know, given that you had your appointment today and you came in, you know, on a timely manner. Thank you.

104
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.660
Richelle Direny: So much for that, you know, if it is a situation where

105
00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.740
Richelle Direny: You're not going to be able to make your appointment. I'm just call virtual clinic and let them know so that

106
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.640
Richelle Direny: They will be they're able to reschedule.

107
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:06.870
Okay.

108
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.330
Richelle Direny: Um,

109
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.580
Richelle Direny: What was the other thing.

110
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:19.410
Richelle Direny: In terms of the privacy and oh, the other part of it is. So, what I find is that

111
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:33.030
Richelle Direny: appointment scheduled in the morning. Around this time, the traffic in virtual clinic may not be as bad. But when it comes on to group. A lot of people are checking it all at one time.

112
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:48.930
Richelle Direny: So we encourage everyone you have up to six hours before your group appointments to check in, you just call into virtual clinic go through the check in process when the group when the ID becomes available, they will send it to you.

113
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.040
Richelle Direny: Okay then.

114
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:56.730
Richelle Direny: You have to do is just come straight to your meeting. You don't have to go through the virtual can just come straight to your meeting one that sent to

115
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.810
Richelle Direny: You okay

116
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:11.460
Richelle Direny: Because sometimes that the, you know, with group, you can meet showing up very late. And then we have the ability to say whether or not you're allowed to come into the group. So that's why we just say come as early as possible. Just check in. As early as

117
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.450
Richelle Direny: Possible. Yeah.

118
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:13.470
Richelle Direny: I

119
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.940
Brooke Oaks: Didn't think about that. That's nice.

120
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:26.910
Richelle Direny: Okay, now. Um, so, for the purposes of our time together. I'm in, you know, just starting this process.

121
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.530
Richelle Direny: So you said that you were with us before. How long ago was that

122
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:40.080
Brooke Oaks: That was I'm gonna say August I think I actually had you for my groups I changed over from

123
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.620
Brooke Oaks: Am I have had you before I think

124
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.800
Brooke Oaks: I'm not certain, but

125
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.120
Richelle Direny: Who was the doctor.

126
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.180
Brooke Oaks: It was good.

127
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.110
Brooke Oaks: Okay, it was. Do you remember the name

128
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.410
Brooke Oaks: It was a man and then she

129
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.900
Brooke Oaks: Got deployed. Yeah.

130
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.250
Richelle Direny: Dr. Malik.

131
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.660
Brooke Oaks: Okay, it's to the email doctor. She was a blonde.

132
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.770
Richelle Direny: You soon.

133
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:17.820
Richelle Direny: Dr. James. Okay. And where are you going on. Did you go to groups on Tuesdays, or Thursdays.

134
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.820
Brooke Oaks: Both at one point in time.

135
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.160
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, because it wasn't, it was myself on Thursdays and Maggie was

136
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:35.610
Brooke Oaks: I was on Thursdays and Thursdays were big days at work server. And so I switched to Tuesday's

137
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.790
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, so, um, so then hold on. If you

138
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.430
Richelle Direny: So were you discharged from the program and then

139
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.980
Brooke Oaks: I lost my insurance so I stopped going

140
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:53.310
Richelle Direny: Okay, I see you were, I see that you were attending and then you never had anything

141
00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:03.630
Brooke Oaks: I am I had trouble with appointments, a little bit, getting to them because at the time I was 12 months and

142
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:21.900
Brooke Oaks: I didn't really have phone service. So a lot of the times I would have to go to McDonald's or something to get Wi Fi and a lot of the times that I wasn't in Wi Fi. So I would look at the time, and I'd realized that I had to be in my appointment. So it was just a hard time in general. So

143
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.490
Uh huh.

144
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.870
Brooke Oaks: But now saying I moms and waiting on my apartment and I have phone service, so it will not be

145
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.140
Richelle Direny: Okay, yes I do see okay

146
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:49.290

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.060
Brooke Oaks: I'm

279
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.070
Brooke Oaks: The kind of most of its after I would say

280
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:26.670
Brooke Oaks: I used to hear myself before all this but um

281
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.870
Brooke Oaks: The cutting is more so started after

282
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:43.920
Richelle Direny: Now since being in our program is that the first time that you've ever been in any

283
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:52.110
Richelle Direny: are happy that this is the first time like you've ever had, like, a counselor or

284
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.670
Richelle Direny: Had a mental health counselor that you're working with no

285
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.570
Richelle Direny: But you've had counselors in the past. Yeah.

286
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.130
Richelle Direny: And even with them. Did you complete their program successfully or is it that you kind of just stopped.

287
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.490
Brooke Oaks: I kind of just stopped. She fired them lunch use them in high school.

288
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.300
Richelle Direny: Oh, so since high school. You've been

289
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.170
Brooke Oaks: She, she started having issues.

290
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.490
Brooke Oaks: Probably between sixth and seventh grade about onset of puberty.

291
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.960
Richelle Direny: Okay.

292
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.550
Richelle Direny: And as a teenager, you would fire your counselors.

293
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.720
Brooke Oaks: Yeah. The first one I remember

294
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:58.260
Brooke Oaks: He diagnosed me with odd oppositional defiance disorder because I would sleep and I slept a lot so I MISSED A LOT OF SCHOOL AND WE TOLD ME. I DID IT voluntarily, which I'm looking back on it now. I feel like

295
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:14.130
Brooke Oaks: That kind of describes odd saying like him telling me that I'm missing school because I'm intentionally doing it. So I fired him because I didn't like what he had to say. But

296
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.890
Brooke Oaks: I didn't agree with it at the time because I didn't really understand it because

297
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:33.510
Brooke Oaks: I knew that I wasn't intentionally missing school and I wasn't intentionally sleeping. But I think subconsciously now thinking about it. I think I was subconsciously probably doing that. And I would get stressed out. So I would just sleep.

298
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.990
Richelle Direny: What was there any medical things underlining that would while you were sleeping a lot

299
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:49.320
Brooke Oaks: No, I saw your note will get you want to just sleep tasks, but we wanted to do a sleep test, I guess. But she said I fired him.

300
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.940
Brooke Oaks: And now looking back on it. Honestly, I wish I would have done it. But I was a kid.

301
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:06.870
Brooke Oaks: You still there.

302
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:09.900
She's

303
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.960
Brooke Oaks: A baby after eight hours worth of testing.

304
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.510
Brooke Oaks: Oh, she left

305
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:49.740
Her

306
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.040
Brooke Oaks: There.

307
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.390
Brooke Oaks: Yeah, I mean, the blue on here.

308
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.760
Richelle Direny: From here.

309
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.290
Brooke Oaks: I am

310
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:11.700
Richelle Direny: I thought it was awesome. I thought it was you who froze. But then I realized I think my internet keeps everything. Also I switched it over.

311
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.240
Richelle Direny: Okay, sorry about that. Um,

312
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:15.900
Richelle Direny: So, yeah.

313
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:24.180
Brooke Oaks: Go ahead, I'm sorry. After was also the one that died, she got her tested for a learning disorder.

314
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.680
Brooke Oaks: And they decided that she had add because there's nothing else wrong with her.

315
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.520
Brooke Oaks: There's eight hours of testing and occupational

316
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.230
Brooke Oaks: Health

317
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:44.610
Richelle Direny: So, so they diagnosed did till she was not diagnosed with a learning disorder. They tested her, but then found out she did not have a learning disorder.

318
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:46.380
Brooke Oaks: Right.

319
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.150
Brooke Oaks: Yeah, they

320
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:49.860
Richelle Direny: Add

321
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:51.930
Brooke Oaks: Yeah.

322
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.060
Richelle Direny: No. Interesting.

323
00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:03.120
Brooke Oaks: Sense definitely feel like I have a DD but well I mean she's, she's smart, she's incredibly intelligent, she just

324
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.960
Brooke Oaks: doesn't remember the things she's reading and things like that.

325
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:19.770
Brooke Oaks: And so because she was having trouble with reading routine and retaining the information. Even when I talked her through it, they decided to test her for learning disorders and they did eight hours.

326
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:26.820
Brooke Oaks: And they said she learns fine. It's just, you know, she just can't me there's something going on there. So we're calling it add

327
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:30.570
Brooke Oaks: Sorry.

328
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.490
Brooke Oaks: My whole family is like just scatterbrained like all you all get out

329
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:44.190
Richelle Direny: Where could it be that you just weren't interested because sometimes people, it's, it's all about interest if you're not interested in something

330
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.600
Brooke Oaks: I have

331
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.640
Brooke Oaks: A hard time concentrating

332
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.370
Brooke Oaks: I'm like, thinking, sometimes we have a lot going on.

333
00:31:54.990 --> 00:32:02.310
Brooke Oaks: And it's not necessarily like even things that I enjoy. I can read over a sentence. And then just not take it in and then have to read over it three times.

334
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:12.480
Richelle Direny: So it's your, your, so you have a difficult time as you saying retaining just processing the information and

335
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.110
Brooke Oaks: Retain that

336
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.480
Richelle Direny: Now,

337
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:36.330
Richelle Direny: With moving that but for the oppositional defiance. You said that he had diagnosed you with the oppositional defiance from a child that was only thing from childhood, which was more of a childhood diagnosis. That's a diagnosis frickin

338
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:44.850
Brooke Oaks: He also diagnosed with a DD, and he diagnosed me with no market research, there's

339
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.070
Brooke Oaks: No doubt the precise was 30 odd doctor

340
00:32:51.420 --> 00:33:00.360
Brooke Oaks: What's his name I can't remember. Either way around Bauer was the bipolar. But he diagnosed with bipolar general anxiety of leaving depression.

341
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, I mean with with oppositional defiance. A lot of it is having issues with

342
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:19.890
Richelle Direny: authority figures. So you would always have an issue with anyone that's what that's in authority like based on your behavior. Behavior outbursts or not wanting to follow rules.

343
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:37.290
Richelle Direny: So it's whether it's your parents, your teachers anyone that's in any type of authority figure in your life is who. So that's kind of where the oppositional defiance comes from a society. I do my own thing. When I want and I don't want anybody to tell me what to do type of what

344
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:53.400
Brooke Oaks: If somebody tries to tell her she would just shut down completely just, I mean just blank stare and just not be verbal just shut down completely. There's only one man in her life who could yell at her and get her to act and that was her best friend's dad.

345
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.050
Richelle Direny: Huh.

346
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:04.800
Richelle Direny: It must be something in terms of she is kind of being that authoritative figure in her life where she can

347
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.890
Brooke Oaks: Bizarre because we're in a softball game.

348
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:15.960
Brooke Oaks: And he was yelling at her about her position. I said, Don't yell at her, she'll just shut down. She did exactly what he said. And I'm like, What's this about

349
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.310
Richelle Direny: The sport you playing or did you

350
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.400
Brooke Oaks: So I like the sport. Yeah.

351
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:36.900
Richelle Direny: You like the sport and you are focused, then you want it to be good at what you're doing. So you gave that that degree of respect because you want to instill you saw him in that light that he's only helping you to get better at what are these the

352
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:50.820
Richelle Direny: And you didn't see it as a you didn't feel like you need to put up a defense to it. And so it just, it's all about your perception of how you look at a person and how they're giving you the instructions and how your brain computes it it's like are

353
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:56.520
Richelle Direny: They are, they look at me or are they trying to tear me down and make me less of who I need to be

354
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:02.610
Brooke Oaks: Yeah, kind of like, I guess I see it. Now I can think of it like I guess in a way that

355
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:17.580
Brooke Oaks: Like when I'm at work. Obviously, I'm going to have a better benefit if I listen to my boss. But if I'm working on a project with someone, and I think the idea that I have would be better. I don't want to hear from somebody else to do it a different way.

356
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:20.520
Brooke Oaks: That makes sense.

357
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:35.610
Richelle Direny: Yes, it's always how your how your, your mind perceives the information coming in at you. It's all about how your brain is taking it in and it's it's making me better or making me feel less than and not worthy or it's how

358
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.780
Richelle Direny: How your brain is telling you how the information is coming. It

359
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.190
Brooke Oaks: explains a lot. That's big. That's huge.

360
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:51.300
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's just, it's really how your, your, your mind and a lot of times, sometimes it goes back maybe even so

361
00:35:52.380 --> 00:36:01.080
Richelle Direny: Often, and we'll talk about your individual is kind of how your mind is taking in the information and a lot of that how we become and who we are. Later in life.

362
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:08.550
Richelle Direny: Starts from her our earlier years and how information was if you grew up in someone was always doubting you and your

363
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:14.550
Richelle Direny: Your opinion and what you're seeing was never a valuable enough you develop this wall that later on in life.

364
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.020
Richelle Direny: I you. It's like I'm going to have control in everything that I do and I'm not going to allow and you made that decision.

365
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:32.100
Richelle Direny: That I will only listen to people who is going to benefit me I don't know this, and I need to learn this. Those are the only people I'm listening to everybody else that I feel

366
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:47.010
Richelle Direny: Like is making me less than or anybody that then your brain shuts down because your brain brings you back to maybe earlier in life, who did that to you who took that away from you, what becomes like I'm control of I'm in control of what I taken and what I allow

367
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.570
Richelle Direny: That could be what it is.

368
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:52.590
Okay.

369
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.740
Richelle Direny: Alright, so moving into

370
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.920
Richelle Direny: The history as it's related to family.

371
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:12.540
Richelle Direny: History in terms of as it's related to mental illness and with your biological parents mom and dad. Is there any history of mental illness.

372
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.530
Yep.

373
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.740
Brooke Oaks: Yes, I'm sorry.

374
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:26.250
Brooke Oaks: And we've got, I was diagnosed bipolar postpartum depression severe depression.

375
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.800
Brooke Oaks: Not bipolar.

376
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.300
Brooke Oaks: Bipolar to I've had a lot of it.

377
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:47.010
Brooke Oaks: There's a lot of live in. I tried suicide. A couple times when I was younger. Her dad. It was depression, but I think he also has anger issues and anxiety and anxiety I have anxiety to

378
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:49.890
Richelle Direny: Get about

379
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:51.660
Richelle Direny: Maternal

380
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:59.220
Brooke Oaks: And yes on maternal don't know a lot about paternal

381
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:03.420
Richelle Direny: earthier

382
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:07.650
Brooke Oaks: Anything, and they talk about those things. That's the way they were

383
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:16.170
Richelle Direny: There because I think mental illness is something that's more in the past. It was a lot more frowned upon. It's not. It's kind of like those times we'll talk

384
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.730
Richelle Direny: We'll talk about it type of thing.

385
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:33.210
Brooke Oaks: Right and her dad was a older like he's like 77 now and it said he came of that generation where they still and my dad was just like a dress. So we talked about all the time.

386
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.440
Richelle Direny: Huh. Okay. Okay. Um,

387
00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:46.650
Richelle Direny: Did your dad agree with your diagnosis is your grandfather. If you agree with those notices for yourself.

388
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.560
Brooke Oaks: He was kind of deep into Alzheimer's when she got to that point.

389
00:38:53.880 --> 00:39:02.340
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, okay. Um, so they're definitely in terms of the diagnosis. There's some predisposition.

390
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:15.780
Richelle Direny: Correct. With the that I was so, to some degree, based on what mom is saying, I can perceive where the odd came from.

391
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:28.560
Richelle Direny: Because it almost seems like that odd was more of a defensive stance, mostly more than more than anything as it's truly related to an oppositional person back part of that.

392
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.030
Richelle Direny: Came from a lot of that predispositions from both sides, growing up.

393
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:41.370
Richelle Direny: And how things worked out with and how you develop kind of that wall in terms of what you allow and what your what your brain computer. And what I'm going to allow

394
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.630
Richelle Direny: Allow so I can definitely see where that odd may be fitting

395
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:54.690
Richelle Direny: Or even some of that depression or those emotional things that lead to, because that's what a lot of lot of what bipolar is a lot more emotional

396
00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:10.440
Richelle Direny: The inability to control a lot of your emotions and how they are displayed the output was a lot of what's going on internally and that's where maybe the mania would come from is the inability to control a lot of those emotions or knowing how to control a lot of those emotions.

397
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.870
Richelle Direny: In terms of art. Do you have any siblings. Are you an only child, a

398
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.790
Brooke Oaks: Sister older sister.

399
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:32.700
Brooke Oaks: She has, she's got anxiety, she's never been depressed, which are diagnosed with depression but she's got anxiety anxiety.

400
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.030
Brooke Oaks: Doesn't she hasn't been diagnosed with depression, but probably has depression, a little bit.

401
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:49.140
Richelle Direny: Um, what about history within the family of suicide or homicide or self interest behavior.

402
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:55.170
Brooke Oaks: Mom tried suicide and shoes that probably are 20

403
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:57.900
Brooke Oaks: early to mid 20s.

404
00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.880
Brooke Oaks: When you're there with

405
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.500
Richelle Direny: Your grandmother

406
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.330
Richelle Direny: Mean, okay.

407
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:13.710
Brooke Oaks: You and then there were times I considered it but I got myself check into quite get it in my 40s. This is going through a bad time. And so I just

408
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.940
Brooke Oaks: Yeah, so I checked myself and

Richelle Direny: On both sides, our grandparents living or deceased.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.010

422
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:27.390
Brooke Oaks: So that I'll pay it played a factor pushing out like what I suspect is a lawyer, Dan list, but they diagnosed, it is fiber of my algebra.

423
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:30.480
Richelle Direny: All of them and

427
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:46.020
Brooke Oaks: Some he had medical issues, because I think he had a shot in his brain at the end.

428

432
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.890
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what about

433
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.770
Richelle Direny: Parents side.

434
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.630
Brooke Oaks: Lots on both sides, but not that they would know.

435
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.620
Brooke Oaks: But it still affected their upbringing, I'm sure.

436
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.740
Richelle Direny: Okay. And this is from

437
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.970

Richelle Direny: So you said that, not that. Not that they will know. So growing up. There was the history of addiction on both sides, but they weren't exposed to it.

440
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:49.350
Brooke Oaks: They didn't really Yeah, pretty much. They didn't really see it because we were high functioning.

441
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.330
Richelle Direny: Gotcha.

442
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.220
Brooke Oaks: And it was not. It wasn't like

443
00:43:54.690 --> 00:44:07.050
Brooke Oaks: It was like you know when they would go away to their friend's house for the weekends, then, you know, or at night after they were in bed or now their dad their dad drank a lot and they saw that more than anything else.

444
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.870
Brooke Oaks: That I drank.

445
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.040
Brooke Oaks: I drank every day, but I was like, like I said, high functioning.

446
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.030
Richelle Direny: Now, um, any history of yourself. I broke off.

447
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.230
Incarceration

448
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:27.330
Brooke Oaks: For me,

449
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.410
Brooke Oaks: Yes, is an incarcerated once

450
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.060
Richelle Direny: So you're not you're not on probation. You're not any kind of

451
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.990
Pending doing

452
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.370
Brooke Oaks: I was not charged. Yeah, yeah.

453
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.980
Richelle Direny: refunds or that was some time ago.

454
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.820
Brooke Oaks: That was little morning

455
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.430
Brooke Oaks: A little more than a year ago.

456
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.460
Brooke Oaks: It was not

457
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.690
Brooke Oaks: Charging is. Oh yeah, literally a little more than a year ago.

458
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, um,

459
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.920
Richelle Direny: So currently, you're living with just mom.

460
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.410
Brooke Oaks: Mom and her boyfriend.

461
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:27.870
Richelle Direny: And mom is pretty supportive. Yeah. Okay. Have you been in treatment and

462
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.730
Richelle Direny: Assistance. Okay.

463
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.440
Richelle Direny: Um,

464
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:40.500
Richelle Direny: Now, what about in terms of the living arrangement boyfriend also month is pretty supportive and involved as well, or just kind of

465
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.940
Richelle Direny: Their

466
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.500
Brooke Oaks: Neck. Yes.

467
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:59.130
Brooke Oaks: He sees that she's working really hard for this. And so he's been very supportive. He's retired law enforcement and so he had some doubts about behaviors, but now he sees that she's working really hard. So he's he's just, he's right there in a corner.

468
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.110
Richelle Direny: So there's a little bit of bias because of the fact that he's in law enforcement.

469
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:05.670
Brooke Oaks: Yeah.

470
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.640
Well, but the attitude.

471
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:18.300
Richelle Direny: And even in there. I guess it's understandable his background seen a light bulb definitely nice

472
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:28.500
Richelle Direny: From a place of a little bit of love, but a little bit of hesitation, because of what he seen so he looks at you through that lens and it's kind of hard to read it.

473
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.560
Richelle Direny: And you said no children. No, you've never given birth to a child or anything like that. Right.

474
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:50.310
Richelle Direny: Were you born and raised in. I know you said that you were living in another state. At one point, but were you born and raised in Ohio.

475
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.810
Yes.

476
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.880
Richelle Direny: And currently unemployed.

477
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:58.770
Brooke Oaks: Excuse me.

478
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:00.930
Richelle Direny: Are you

479
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:16.320
Richelle Direny: Okay, from a program standpoint. And at this point, having rejoined the program. What are your personalized when you thought, thought about, you know, what I want to start this program again because at the end of the day.

480
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:32.100
Richelle Direny: This is all voluntary you're doing this. Was it your actions is saying that you want to change you're entering into that stage of I want to change. Life has to be more than this.

481
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:49.020
Richelle Direny: From this in this platform. It shows it speaks more volumes, because it's different about them getting into a car and figuring out going through a location and a little bit different. What is info that speaks volumes and I highlight that because that speaks volumes within itself.

482
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.270
Richelle Direny: For our time together that we will be together.

483
00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.050
Richelle Direny: What is it that you

484
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.790
Richelle Direny: Would like to work on. What is your purpose. And what is it, what are your goals.

485
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:21.090
Brooke Oaks: Necessarily figured that out yet. Um, it definitely. I mean, I just, I need to focus on myself and learn how to I guess cope with things better, or learn different ways to do things. I mean,

486
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:24.300
Brooke Oaks: Anything else I should add

487
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.450
Richelle Direny: More so for you.

488
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.610
Richelle Direny: It's more for you if

489
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:30.750
Brooke Oaks: You know,

490
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:44.130
Richelle Direny: What I mean because mommy supportive mom is there to help with like I'm in terms of recalling certain information is in in that way. But at the end of the day, this is going into your core.

491
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:45.600
Brooke Oaks: I know

492
00:48:46.560 --> 00:49:00.960
Richelle Direny: Well, for you, like at this point in time when you said I'm going to call back up right heart and I'm self paying because the ST know you know walk in the park in terms of, I don't know how much it is, but I'm sure it ain't costing you find others every visit

493
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:14.130
Brooke Oaks: I, I tried to come off of the subs and I was pretty much out and

494
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:22.830
Brooke Oaks: I went to the hospital and they gave me hydroxyl seen for anxiety and quantity and patch and

495
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:45.720
Brooke Oaks: promethazine for stomach and I tried to come off of it. But I realized I think I need to be on anxiety medicine and maybe in my own place and whatnot, to get off of it. So, and I could use more depth in

496
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:54.390
Brooke Oaks: My understanding of things and knowing how to handle situations better and

497
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:59.160
Brooke Oaks: I'm definitely not the best I could be

498
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:07.020
Brooke Oaks: A lot better than where it was, but I know I have a lot. I can learn and grow and

499
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:12.750
Brooke Oaks: I guess probably learn from other people and groups and have that support and

500
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.240
Brooke Oaks: I mean just guidance to be better, I guess, I don't know, I mean,

501
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.400
Richelle Direny: That's that that speaks a lot because the reality of it is

502
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:30.480
Richelle Direny: If your goal is to one day not now and not in the near future. But if it's to one day.

503
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:52.380
Richelle Direny: Come off of the Suboxone or come off of anything in order to achieve that you have to like you said put in the work to understand what's behind these emotions and why am I getting so anxious and why am I getting so overwhelmed in these diagnosis. And to do that, the thing is,

504
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.650
Richelle Direny: Taking Medications

505
00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.390
Richelle Direny: Only help to some degree, you have to do the other part of the work.

506
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:06.000
Richelle Direny: You get to that place and that level of understanding and that

507
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.520
Richelle Direny: Your ability to

508
00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:10.950
Richelle Direny: Understand

509
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:27.360
Richelle Direny: What feelings come at you, how to effectively unhealthy and cope with them in a healthy manner until you get to that place, you will be able to get off the medication because the medication is somewhat of a band aid in no matter how whatever it is that you're taking medication for

510
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:34.620
Richelle Direny: You have to get to that place of, like you said, understanding, a lot of our pass is

511
00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:47.790
Richelle Direny: The driving force to how we are thinking how we act today. You just have to tap into that and you have to be at that place to be open to tapping into that and to understand those emotions and how to deal with them.

512
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:56.520
Richelle Direny: On because oftentimes we have our past. But you know what today's problem is also adding to my past. And if you only focus on today alone.

513
00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.710
Richelle Direny: You will never understanding

514
00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:07.380
Richelle Direny: That what hype heightens today stressors are from those past memories that I have. And those things that has occurred in the past. That's also adding to this.

515
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:13.860
Richelle Direny: So it's going through that and working through a lot of that and and as you based on what you're saying and just the history that you've shared

516
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:26.460
Richelle Direny: Your freedom, your pre disposed to a lot of things simply because of just even your family structure and everything that they have gone through and what you were exposed to.

517
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:27.810
Richelle Direny: The emotions that we

518
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:34.200
Richelle Direny: Had and suppressed over the years and found different ways to deal with it. When you look at addiction.

519
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:43.050
Richelle Direny: Nobody is born and be like, well, let me just try, let me drink some alcohol because taste good, or let me do cocaine. Let me do this. And that means that

520
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:53.430
Richelle Direny: You don't do we don't, we're not born into doing that we're not born with the first thing on my mommy outside of that milk. I want some of this this other stuff. No.

521
00:52:53.970 --> 00:53:06.750
Richelle Direny: Things occurred in life situations and circumstances and those pain and the hurt and everything that we've dealt with, I needed to release this pain I needed to stop. And so we do things to nominate

522
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.240
Richelle Direny: Guess what it's

523
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:18.210
Richelle Direny: Like when you go to the dentist. If you've ever been to the dentist and the best thing to numb the pain to numb it so you don't feel what happens once that that notification wears off.

524
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.810
Brooke Oaks: Feel at all and

525
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:28.410
Brooke Oaks: When I might go without taking sub

526
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:42.660
Brooke Oaks: It's kind of like a lot of things I started to think about and i realized i don't i don't think i process that right because, I mean, I have been using on and off for five years and

527
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.470
Brooke Oaks: I mean, I've been using Suboxone as well and

528
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:55.230
Brooke Oaks: It kind of all suppresses everything that I've been through for the past five years, and

529
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:03.930
Brooke Oaks: I think it's going to be a lot to deal with when I decided to come off this box right now it's kind of keeping it at bay.

530
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:15.300
Richelle Direny: But keeping it at bay. But that's all you're doing is keeping it at bay. But eventually late. So the longer it takes for you to work through them all. If you're just, you're just

531
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:24.120
Richelle Direny: lengthening the process is kind of like to do this at some point really gonna have to do this at some point it's how long is it going to take you

532
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:34.980
Richelle Direny: The medication just helps keep a lot of those intensity of the emotions and everything at bay. So you're able to work through it. You're taking antidepressants, you're taking any

533
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:43.710
Richelle Direny: Medicine for depression, you're taking all of these. It just helps you to be able to cope with it to go through it.

534
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:53.700
Richelle Direny: As you're working through it, you're going to find that you're less and less dependent upon these things because now you're learning how to work through it.

535
00:54:54.330 --> 00:55:06.360
Richelle Direny: That's literally I'm learning how to work through it. I like to often associate an imagery that I use different imagery to kind of associate with what I'm talking about.

536
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:13.440
Richelle Direny: Your issues are like giving birth to a baby and I know you've never given birth to a child, but

537
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.360
Richelle Direny: That's how I got to come out one way or the other.

538
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:19.320
Richelle Direny: Thing and now

539
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:21.660
Brooke Oaks: You stand a little

540
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:29.370
Richelle Direny: Bit and the doctor say hey listen. We don't do this willingly or what but but we got to get out.

541
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:39.060
Richelle Direny: And so that's just kind of how it is. You could take as much pain as you want to, but it's baby guys to get out and that's just kind of, we need to give birth to those things.

542
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:46.980
Richelle Direny: It's it's happening. We need to give birth. And once we give birth and release it, then we're saying, Okay, I feel

543
00:55:47.760 --> 00:56:00.090
Richelle Direny: Now let's work through this one issue at a time. But you got to give birth kit, you know, because we could keep taking all this medication. Okay, I'll feel the pain anymore. That's fine. But this baby still got to get out.

544
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:07.410
Richelle Direny: And that's kind of how thorough counseling. It helps you

545
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:17.430
Richelle Direny: To go through. Hey, I'm, I'm here with you and I know it hurts. And I know I know it hurts like a mother. So the question is it take payments this morning. Yes, I did. All right.

546
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:32.250
Richelle Direny: Now let's take our time to work through this because you need to make a payment. And now we can work through it because it helps you to follow the processes. Now you're able to cope. Eventually, you'll get to that point where you're no longer going to need it. It ain't today.

547
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.660
Brooke Oaks: But even a

548
00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:35.730
Brooke Oaks: little at a time.

549
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:37.080
Richelle Direny: And time

550
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.100
And

551
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:42.090
Brooke Oaks: It all hits me it's not all like crashing down

552
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:55.200
Richelle Direny: It's not crashing down on. It's kind of like giving birth to a baby that they didn't go yet that baby out, they're gonna say push. Now stop push not stop. You see it's a little bit at a time. Eventually,

553
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:57.150
Brooke Oaks: It.

554
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:03.060
Richelle Direny: Mean, and so that's just kind of how and soul together. I will definitely

555
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.250
Richelle Direny: Recommend

556
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:12.540
Richelle Direny: And this is how we're going to put it for the purposes of definitely recommend bi weekly counseling.

557
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:29.130
Richelle Direny: And I know for the purposes to for you financially, I would. This is what I would recommend. Now if you actually you're not able to come by weekly. Listen, if it is coming once a month, I would say you do something to do nothing at all is not going to be helpful.

558
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:43.680
Richelle Direny: To do I know from a program standpoint, they do recommend um twice a month counseling and with group its weekly so I know like some people what they do, especially when they're self pay

559
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:49.140
Richelle Direny: They will do one week. Group one week counseling one week group when we counseling.

560
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:56.940
Richelle Direny: If for that financially, then you can I, that I would recommend doing that from a financial standpoint, I mean, because at the end of the day.

561
00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:03.750
Richelle Direny: I want to get. I get want to get through my problems, but the new problem is because I'm trying to get help them going broke while doing it.

562
00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:15.330
Richelle Direny: And that's just now we only going to be working on that we will be working on other things because we worked on. I was stressed, just to get out. So, um, that's what i would i would recommend

563
00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.510
Brooke Oaks: You know, from an

564
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:25.620
Richelle Direny: Agency standpoint, maybe I'll send an email, just to let them know. This is my recommendation in terms of and that's what I'll say, my recommendation is

565
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:39.150
Richelle Direny: To not do anything at all, or you can speak to them from a financial standpoint if you're able to do until you get your insurance up and running. Maybe through one week counseling. So every week you're with something

566
00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.480
Brooke Oaks: And hopefully shouldn't take that long and

567
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:47.100
Brooke Oaks: I believe there should be a chance that I could be reimbursed.

568
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:53.910
Brooke Oaks: If I apply and I do pay until I get approved or what I've heard, get my card or anything, but
