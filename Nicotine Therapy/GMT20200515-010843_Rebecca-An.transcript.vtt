00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.890
LG Stylo 5: I miss two meetings with you.

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.980
LG Stylo 5: I work at a cemetery here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and they got me on call. So we've been burying. A lot of people here.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.720
LG Stylo 5: And that's the reason I missed. And this week, my wife stuck a nail to her and take her to the hospital.

7
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.870
LG Stylo 5: Go ahead.

8
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.240

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You call in or reschedule or something.

10
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.660
There was

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.240
LG Stylo 5: This last one I had talked to him, I was like, maybe 15 delay.

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.740
LG Stylo 5: And he said he's gonna let you know. So I don't know if he did or not.

13
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would have to look I didn't get a direct message, but it doesn't mean that they didn't change it on my schedule.

14
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.220
Right.

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on, let me

16
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.600
LG Stylo 5: And I'm sitting in my car right now.

17
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you getting ready to go back into work or

18
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.340
LG Stylo 5: No, I just got out a while ago.

19
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.810
LG Stylo 5: I met a park. I was going to try to make it because they live far from where I work. So make it home, but

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

21
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of people, you know, when they get off work. They'll sit in in their vehicles for

22
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To do the meeting, so that there on time so no worries. It's fine. Don't have to be at home, you know, to me, wherever you can get internet service and make your meeting is perfectly fine.

23
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, how are things going

24
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.040
LG Stylo 5: Good. I'm doing good.

25
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.900
LG Stylo 5: I missed a meeting with Chris. Nice. Nice big called Big baller was like six

26
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did you call them.

27
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.350
LG Stylo 5: I don't know if they let them know or not, but

28
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.890
LG Stylo 5: I didn't get my Suboxone so

29
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah yeah, they probably

30
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Didn't it's I understand the job thing and that you've got to be there for that but you know this too is you got to be there for this to you know

31
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.470
LG Stylo 5: Right.

32
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:43.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can't be missing your appointment and then still I still thinking that you know he's going to give you meds because he won't until you start engaging and treatment. It puts you in high risk, you know,

33
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:57.720
LG Stylo 5: Right. Nope. I talked to him right now the crime, talk to you and he told me to call back and get back with them and then reschedule a meeting, I guess, sometime maybe tomorrow or whenever he could so

34
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you if you're in group tomorrow.

35
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.540
LG Stylo 5: What's that

36
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you in group tomorrow.

37
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.790
LG Stylo 5: No, I haven't been on Wednesdays ever

38
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because Chris and I do agree on Fridays. That's why I was asking. I don't remember you being there. So that's why I was wondering

39
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.310
LG Stylo 5: No.

40
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.120
LG Stylo 5: Wednesday. There's another lady I forget her name.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is Dominique when I hear

43
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.050
LG Stylo 5: There you go. I think that's her, I'm not sure I'm bad at names.

44
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, so tell me what's been happening. The last couple weeks.

45
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.310
LG Stylo 5: No, I'm doing good. Other than working

46
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.160
LG Stylo 5: And

47
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.020
LG Stylo 5: I'm doing good.

48
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.550
LG Stylo 5: I'm sorry, I missed the meetings with you, but I didn't want to miss this one.

49
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, try to if you're going to miss try to get them to reschedule you when you call in. All right.

50
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, and it has to be every other day. It's any other day except for the day that you're a group because you can't do two things at once your insurance won't cover it. So you want to make sure that it's an

51
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Off day from your group. All right.

52
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That way you continually. That way you stay in compliance and you get your medication and don't

53
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: miss it. Okay.

54
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important. How's your head been

55
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.880
LG Stylo 5: Good, I guess.

56
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:53.610
LG Stylo 5: It's just, everything's getting crazy out here. They this area, they made it a lot or whatever you're not wearing a master going to give you a ticket. And then from there, though I just find you and

57
00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.390
LG Stylo 5: So, but at work. We got to do that anyway but going into the stores here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. You got to do all that knowledge started Saturday.

58
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.580
LG Stylo 5: So,

59
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

60
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, I've been like that here.

61
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.870
LG Stylo 5: Right.

62
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you can't go into. So I'm asking

63
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.440
LG Stylo 5: Right. It wasn't that bad here. No, it's game, I guess, I don't know. That's according to the news anyway.

64
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just kind of catching up with the rest of us.

65
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.080
LG Stylo 5: Right.

66
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is it in

67
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.950
LG Stylo 5: My head that messes up my head, Rebecca, you know, because you go out to the store, wherever you go. I mean, I work over there.

68
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:57.150
LG Stylo 5: And it's just crazy because like when we're at work, we bury the people and before they we could we would bury them we drop the coffin while they're right there and how they got to get in their cars before we even get close to the coffin or anything like that. Now, so

69
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh wow, makes it different difficult

70
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:10.890
LG Stylo 5: Right, and then you know I trip on and all. Everything you touch you don't know. You don't know what you're touching. I got hands on died in the car. I don't know if it works.

71
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.990
LG Stylo 5: It's crazy.

72
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got gloves anywhere.

73
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.160
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, we got to where they gave us latex gloves. Every morning regarding

74
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.130
LG Stylo 5: This issue to smash there and everything, but we already got some

75
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

76
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, yeah. You just got to do the best to protect yourself. You know what I mean. And it's a weird time right now.

77
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's about being protected so that you don't go take anything home to give to your family.

78
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.560
You know,

79
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So think about it in that those terms.

80
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.580
LG Stylo 5: We got three little ones at home. We got a five month old three year old and a four year old.

81
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You want to keep them protected.

82
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. This it, you know, putting a mask on and putting these gloves on, is protecting them, you know,

83
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's what's important.

84
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just remember that when you get frustrated because of these masks that you can't breathe on or these gloves that making your hands wet.

85
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just remember that. That's what it's about. It's about protecting those babies.

86
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

87
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

88
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, how's your head.

89
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any triggers any issues going on in there any anxiety.

90
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:52.500
LG Stylo 5: Starts fishing out some time that I want to get. I know that ain't gonna work. So it goes away after a while I take my Suboxone and I'm good.

91
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And is there any time that you have not been able to

92
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:07.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To offset it with either taking your Suboxone or getting out of your head or has that been working for you all the time.

93
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:24.690
LG Stylo 5: That works for me because, you know, I already know by because I guy ain't gonna lie, I'm a P. Once I started fixing heroin. I will stop. So I already know I am been like that with drug all my life.

94
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.620
LG Stylo 5: So I know I won't work. I'll end up in prison. And again, you know, start robbing and same bullshit. I went through all my life.

95
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, no good.

96
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.230
LG Stylo 5: It's too nice out here to miss everything up. You know, I got my family, my wife.

97
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: grandbabies

98
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.840
LG Stylo 5: Right.

99
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.510
job for you.

100
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:02.700
LG Stylo 5: Know I have four years old now and August. So that's, that's a goal for me.

101
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.870
His

102
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hand, how long I'm sober.

103
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.200
LG Stylo 5: Well, I have

104
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:28.830
LG Stylo 5: The last time. My pics heroin was like June 3 the prison and I got rid of my surrender. I haven't done it since I started taking Suboxone in there that's, that's where I started the Suboxone in prison. I was in Hazleton Virginia on the USB there.

105
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah,

106
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.970
So,

107
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.470
LG Stylo 5: It's already been a little over four years because I got on.

108
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.610
LG Stylo 5: August 12 of 16 so

109
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.070

LG Stylo 5: out of prison but I got high in there. The, the day I left on Suboxone

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm busy.

132
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.040

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And a stuff na stuff dot.org I can't speak on virtual na meetings is what you're looking for. And the amazing part about it is that you can go to that website and go to a meeting in a different country.

140
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you want to run

141
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.390

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which I think is pretty fascinating. You know,

144
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.130
But
