7
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.200
Jo Delgadillo: And I met her. When we first moved here like literally the demon moved here, which was the beginning of the summer in June or July one of them.

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.490
Jo Delgadillo: And I can tell like there was something wrong or like a 10 minute like dementia, but I thought it was. She had MS and that does it to his pain and all that well.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.890
Jo Delgadillo: He left her and took everything literally everything he messed up the owners of the trailer you took over money. I took her to the pain.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.060
Jo Delgadillo: She got a new provider.

11
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.190
Jo Delgadillo: And the new provider is the guy. The pervert guy that everyone knows us a pervert behind this. It's his mom attorney provider.

12
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.700
Jo Delgadillo: Well, I've been trying to help her I raise money. I got a whole bunch of donations, like in she didn't have to meet none of those people just to keep her safe. She's already been taken advantage of.

Jo Delgadillo: My son's girlfriend Mercedes to the hospital because she's pregnant and she six months pregnant.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.340
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, so that they're not. Yes, I've been running her back and forth to the doctors and stuff. And there's no

16
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sign down

17
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh my. Yes. Okay. Like that.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.150
Yeah.

19
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.410
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, we found out last week because her. She's been getting fat like her Tommy's been growing, but it's hot.

20
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.250
Jo Delgadillo: And then she's losing weight in her face. And I'm like, she's got to be pregnant and memorable unsuspecting for like three months.

21
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.400
Jo Delgadillo: So we got her pregnancy tests and I'm closer with it now because my cousin in California made a really good point.

22
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.850
Jo Delgadillo: And my grandma made my life hell when I had someone, and I was like, she's like you didn't like the way it felt like you're right.

23
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.830
Jo Delgadillo: So I gave him, given our chance and she's impressing me. I gotta say that she's doing really good actually like taking effort and doing things for herself. Instead of making me do everything for

24
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.570
Jo Delgadillo: Today, and we took her and her mom. She's begging her mom like like emotionally begging her I would say to be your mom and among just wants to fight and screaming yell at her.

25
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.330
Jo Delgadillo: Tried. It's so sad endeavors. My friend, and she's wrong. Like, I don't agree with what she's doing.

26
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.050
Jo Delgadillo: And it's hard to keep my mouth shut. But I have I have for Mercedes because show up to suffer for it. If I say anything.

27
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.370
Jo Delgadillo: She turns everything I say around and it drives me crazy. Like, I'm going to tell people when I say because I said it because I say it because I wanted them to know what

28
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:24.000
Jo Delgadillo: She likes to argue and fight and get her kid in it. She resents her so bad and I see it. And honestly, I can't figure out why. She's only been in Mercedes live per se at 17 and she's only been in her life or career.

29
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.670
Jo Delgadillo: So she doesn't really know her.

30
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.450
Yeah.

31
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.290
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah and now it's deliberate other girls latching on to me isn't Intel I'm given a chance

32
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.710
Jo Delgadillo: But anyways, I kind of need your opinion on this too.

33
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:50.940
Jo Delgadillo: So the Neighbor Lady. I've been helping her I raised $185 for her and I wouldn't told her it was 115 first and I went and told her well

34
00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:03.030
Jo Delgadillo: Building some lady shows are no first this guy back here. The perfect guy found out that I know he tried to have sex with her one night. She's an old lady, she can't remember anything barely walk like

35
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:15.810
Jo Delgadillo: He knows better and his mom is for provider. So she, I got it on record that she you told her new provider that her son was being appropriate weather in staying all these nights with her and turned on sex with her while he's drunk.

36
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.140
Jo Delgadillo: And I got I got everything like I recorded everything and everybody tells me that's legal because I told her, but

37
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.440
Jo Delgadillo: To me that she's elderly and she never remembers anything and now they're using me of stealing stuff.

38
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:37.230
Jo Delgadillo: They're saying that I have the donations to pay my rent and that I was, I don't know, I've been behind on my rent because I live in this trailer. I'm just like, what

39
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.650
Jo Delgadillo: So I went to the lady, and she starts yelling at me. I get out of here, we're calling the cops and I was like why

40
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.470
Jo Delgadillo: I was like, oh, can you explain to me and she was just like, get out, you know, you're even. Okay, and what did I feel

41
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.440
Jo Delgadillo: And then she was I said are you just mad because she told me that you know what your son said to her,

42
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.570
Jo Delgadillo: And she was like, I called are ready to have your kids taken away because you live in that trailer. And I was like, okay, okay, that's fine. And she was like, Okay, fine. I'm just calling

43
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.940
Jo Delgadillo: And I was like, do you want to use my phone call the call, if I have some audio that I would like them to hear

44
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.390
Jo Delgadillo: frightening me because I got something on or any she got mad and she was like, Fine, I'm calling

45
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:24.090
Jo Delgadillo: Amber care and for care on you. And I was like, call them because I want to send them or have them call me my phone number is on this lady's refrigerator.

46
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:35.580
Jo Delgadillo: I said, I have to go pick up my prescription. How about you have them call me and dial that number of errors. That's me. I put that note there just in case she needs me. I'm next word concerning but she's on the phone. I was trying to get her.

47
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:50.760
Jo Delgadillo: I was going to give him the money just because I'm so worried about like everyone takes advantage of her including this man or this woman. She's a provider and she supposedly she has five people that she takes care of and she's been doing it for 30 years you

48
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.970
Jo Delgadillo: Know,

49
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The one that's disabled now was the time

50
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.980
Jo Delgadillo: That was her new provider is the perverts, son.

51
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:12.540
Jo Delgadillo: Okay, it's her son. She knows better and she was letting him say that right there. Even after that. And then he took her necklace and he's taking money from her that the mom gives him because he says, my mom that came to mind.

52
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.280
Jo Delgadillo: But I got all this on audio and then I called adult protective

53
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.420
Because they're keeping me away.

54
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Services.

55
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:28.920
Jo Delgadillo: I but I don't feel like they're going to do enough because a lady already called me not even an hour after I called and told them all this

56
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.840
Jo Delgadillo: lady was like, did you call the cops and have her. Tell them what he said. And I'm like, That's the point. She doesn't understand

57
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:45.390
Jo Delgadillo: Where it's wrong. And I don't think she wants to she likes for provider she feels like she says the guest studies row. He shouldn't have said that.

58
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:56.040
Jo Delgadillo: Then providers going to get mad. So I don't know, but I got it on audio are saying her admitting it she did her provider knows and Tina. He knows that everybody knows

59
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:04.620
Jo Delgadillo: And I told the manager here has been in on it, help him. He's been doing the deliveries for her when donations come when I'm not here because I wasn't here for three days.

60
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:13.560
Jo Delgadillo: So he did. That's what I came back to all this that I was a thief and all this. And I was like, when I wouldn't ask the lady I stayed so calm, like I was on fire inside

61
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:21.300
Jo Delgadillo: Then I mean on fire, but I on the outside. I was so calm. I was like, when I walked out of there. I wanted to explode. I started crying.

62
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In motion. Yes.

63
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.550
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, and then always hurt because I got it. After what I've done. Like why would I do all this

64
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:37.530
Jo Delgadillo: And then I said, Can I show it all to you. And then I had my receipt, because I was accused of having my rent paid for the for my rent was Pete. Last month we always been

65
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:45.570
Jo Delgadillo: In the month before, like, way ahead because I stress about it. So it's like, Can you look at my receipt. I haven't had nothing paid my rent and

66
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:54.960
Jo Delgadillo: We can almost two weeks. And she was like, I don't want to see nothing. I was like, Okay, can I show you, Facebook, I haven't even cashed out on the money. I'm waiting to she tells me

67
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.100
Jo Delgadillo: She goes, You were never supposed to do that. That's you should be taken advantage. I was like, No, me and her side here together and do this.

68
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:10.800
Jo Delgadillo: And then she was like, did you Sandy. Sandy was like, Yeah, we did. And we answered people last night. And then that's when I woke up to the 185

69
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:20.790
Jo Delgadillo: And then now I left and I she wanted to the door for me. She scared, but I'm waiting for the Adult Protective Services. I'm not going to push if she's scared. I'm leaving it alone because they got

70
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Into which one is the vulnerable adult right

71
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:25.920
Yeah.

72
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:40.140
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, it's so bad, like I need someone in to see over here like witness or I put it on Facebook like someone that knows saw like I don't know, I just need someone to see what I'm seeing.

73
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:56.190
Jo Delgadillo: This wrong and see if the provider is a good bullshit or which she seems like she's gonna get away with it. But luckily, I have the audio at least it'll keep her son away at least. Yeah, away from because she literally when you answer she was walking over there.

74
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:04.680
Jo Delgadillo: She doesn't understand like when she repeats herself and then I've been looking at like researching dementia.

75
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:18.750
Jo Delgadillo: And then when stress comes and makes it worse. And then she can like timeline can get flipped it up. And that's exactly what she does on anything, but in the past, she can tell me something detail 20 years ago.

76
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:28.890
Jo Delgadillo: So I'm like, it looks like the mentor and that lady has to know and see all this and they still leave her in a trailer with three space heaters.

77
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:40.140
Jo Delgadillo: In the breaker keep slipping and they told her, just to flip it back on. I'm like, No, you're not supposed to do that if the breakers flipping that there's a reason why you have to unplug stuff and only run one eater.

78
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:46.170
Jo Delgadillo: She was like, just one and wouldn't let me unplug another one. I was like, so your provider knows

79
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:53.610
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah. And then we all the donations. I got her they're gone. Her fridge and our freezers empty.

80
00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:03.540
Jo Delgadillo: I think the provider took it and she told me the provider she gets a diapers and those pp pets for her to lay on the promoter truck goes

81
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:12.240
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know if I wanted to call the cops. But if she's not. She's not gonna speak up. I don't know what to tell them

82
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.300
Jo Delgadillo: Because I can't let it go at this if APS doesn't do nothing.

83
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.720
Jo Delgadillo: I'm not, I can't just because of what I see. Why do they keep pushing me away. Why are they so scared.

84
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.800
Jo Delgadillo: Like, that's just a big red flag to me. Yeah.

85
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you call it into adult protective services.

86
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.330
Jo Delgadillo: And if you feel like there's an urgent crises in the end you should call the police.

87
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:52.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it seems as though there's definitely some manipulation going on and they are taking advantage of her. If this is the case in this scenario scenarios that you've explained, and as he had known sex offender, or he just, he said he liked the neighborhood. Perfect.

88
00:10:53.370 --> 00:11:05.550
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, everyone knows him as a sick guy like her because he's always drinking and he when he fasted, she told me something about my boots that he said I walk around looking off sexy was my boots on for him.

89
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.250
Jo Delgadillo: And then when we were arguing, I stopped in sat down and I ignored him I tuned into my phone.

90
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:22.800
Jo Delgadillo: And then he was like, Hey, Joe. Joe and I ignored him and you say, Hey, Joe. Joe and I was like, what, and he was like what's up with you on them sexy boots and I was like what was like their boots for the snow snarling like to run my boots.

91
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.680
Jo Delgadillo: Boots. Like, that's gross their boots on my feet.

92
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.290
Jo Delgadillo: For you. It just shows or is that in mind.

93
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:40.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you, when you call the API. Did they give you like a case number so they pointed

94
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Out that it wasn't accepted.

95
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.390
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, they gave me a case number of

96
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.390
Jo Delgadillo: Open have to look for it. It was in here. But yeah, I got a case number. I'll call back if I have to.

97
00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:03.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that's what I was saying, well, you can always follow up. If you don't like what the person that you're speaking to is same with the caseworker is

98
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:14.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can always request to speak to the supervising because I know what these adult cases, it takes a while. There's a process because they have to investigate find enough evidence and then decide what's a safe placement

99
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:20.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For this person if there's going to be any criminal action so far from what she explained

100
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They would have to do some further investigation to decide what the next steps would look like.

101
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.800
Jo Delgadillo: What about for care if that's what the lady works for

102
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me what what amber curious.

103
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:38.220
Jo Delgadillo: It's a home health thing because she has them convinced that I'm a thief, she said. They said,

104
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.950
Jo Delgadillo: What did I do

105
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.770
Jo Delgadillo: Nothing else. I was a thief.

106
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:55.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, it goes back into the conversation last week we talked about you taking on this protective role.

107
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.660
Jo Delgadillo: And almost broke

108
00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.920
Me.

109
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.360
Jo Delgadillo: Know, I think it was my phone rang, and then it must something up.

110
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you can hear me.

111
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.650
Jo Delgadillo: Barely. Yeah, I can hear you. A little bit.

112
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I said it brings me back to what we talked about last week with you being in a protector role.

113
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:29.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is a key example of you know you going above and beyond to help people in that protector role, but the outcome that attack for you and the impact that attack for you. And that's not to say that

114
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:43.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You shouldn't do your due diligence and help other people, but in this aspect of the protective role. Didn't work in your favor. And once again, it's creating adage dresses on you like in the packs.

115
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:53.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The protective role with your son, the protective role with your son's girlfriend to protect the role when it came to the relationship, your grandmother had with her ex.

116
00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:03.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All of these coming into place, even in the relationship with your husband being in so much in the protective role that nobody has an opportunity to step up because you're taking action.

117
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.820
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, and I tried. I tried to sit back and then this happen.

118
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:16.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm just concerned because I don't want your hard work and your efforts to come back against you and now you're

119
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.330
Jo Delgadillo: Worried about

120
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:35.190
Jo Delgadillo: Should I just give up. That's it. Like I was going to take the donation out and just put it on towards her rent and just leave it. But I got to get to like the law part out of the way, like just somebody here to see what I seen. That's it. And for me to give my audio what I got to them.

121
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.710
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, so they can hear which at her mouth.

122
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.520
Jo Delgadillo: So then they'll be able to hear the way she repeats herself and stuff.

123
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:50.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you call them the report to the adult protective services and you know you can remain anonymous. And then they'll get updates.

124
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From you. You can be a collateral contacts so whenever they want. You know, you provide them your phone number and he can provide them updates as necessary.

125
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can do that, fine. I like that idea of just putting that money that you say that you collected towards her rent, but taking a more distant approach.

126
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:20.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because the hands on approach is a lot of allowing your character to be compromised and now these people are written you and your parenting and

127
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:28.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know abuse reports against you, like, that's definitely a sign that the people that you are involved with

128
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:37.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then Matt rational people and so they're going to do some bad things, even though you have good intentions, you have to weigh the, the, the risk

129
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:46.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so your family is primary. So you've already done the right things. You called in the report, you want to take an extra step further, you could

130
00:15:46.650 --> 00:16:01.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, call into the police department walk into the police station and explain the situation so that you have a police report on record, you know, something to support that, hey, I've done everything that claim this aspect, but now I have to pull back.

131
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.450
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, you're

132
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.870
Jo Delgadillo: Gonna be hard.

133
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Haven't go over there anymore, Joe.

134
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:18.360
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, I haven't been ever since she knocked price is like. And then I said I enter the door crack. I said all go away and I walked away and I got it I recorded that do

135
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.060
Jo Delgadillo: That obviously says she was scared. And I'm not pushing it. Yeah.

136
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Universe and then you become the one that they're investigating

137
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.000
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

138
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.690
Jo Delgadillo: I cannot. I don't know how to fix my phone.

139
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.230
Jo Delgadillo: It rang, and then all of a sudden I couldn't really hear anything. Oh.

140
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:57.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's evaluate some of some of the benefits that you have noticed in your protector will think about the relationship that you have protector in and tell me some of the benefits you have seen

141
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.030
Jo Delgadillo: Right now with Mercedes. I've heard I've saved her from a lot of hurt from a mom.

142
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:16.650
Jo Delgadillo: By and then by being there for that too. It's helped her cope with her mom not being there. Yeah. And the doctors even asked her about that today. And there were saying, so sorry. They were like, Who are you

143
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:24.300
Jo Delgadillo: And then, at first I don't, she was. She didn't know what to say. So I just said under GRANDMA SHE GOT in Paris. I can see she

144
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:32.970
Jo Delgadillo: Didn't want to have to explain. So as I spoke up. I didn't want to share what he had told them. She had an STD in front of me. And then when we left

145
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:45.900
Jo Delgadillo: She was just like, I'm sorry that I had an SD. I was like, totally sorry that that was before my son like I've had it. I had when I was 16 I get it, like it happened and helmet.

146
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.940
Jo Delgadillo: Was Co. She said some motion can just chill. I can ever happen.

147
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.090
Jo Delgadillo: But she's trying, I see the effort.

148
00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:03.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You see the benefits and being a protective from Mercedes, I'm hearing that she trust you and that your support to him.

149
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:21.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that that's important to have characteristics that people feel are trustworthy. So those are some benefits in regards to Mercedes. How about any other relationships where you are the protective. What are some of those benefits that you've identified

150
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.360
Jo Delgadillo: All my kids, my girls.

151
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.550
Jo Delgadillo: Especially my girls or and Haley, she's a girl, but yeah.

152
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.150
Jo Delgadillo: I was relationship going, what's one Haley.

153
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:44.130
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I always get singled out when I tell when I say my girls were like, You mean daily Jaden Haley and I'm like yeah like I have to stay step daughter.

154
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:53.370
Jo Delgadillo: And then I got used to and then it makes you feel bad when they're around because they don't know they're on their stuff. But I tell my girl, and everybody else, it doesn't matter even or dad.

155
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:07.560
Jo Delgadillo: Or he doesn't take over just like they don't want to hear that they just want to thank tell everyone that we're one happy family. That's a mom that know if explain ourselves. That's how I was needed. It sucks.

156
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:16.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about with your husband, since we last spoke, have you pull back and see if your husband rises to the occasion and being the protecting

157
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:28.410
Jo Delgadillo: Our full back and started telling him to do things are walking away but protector know yeah I feel more protected from my dog is getting huge than him.

158
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.460
Mm hmm.

159
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, some disappointment in that what

160
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:40.470
Jo Delgadillo: What happened, he's broken there. I don't know. It just does not like conflict with his parents. His mom was

161
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:52.920
Jo Delgadillo: I don't even know she just loved the drama. She liked to fight with everybody know she didn't really like the fist fight. She just like to start stuff and then sit back and play the victim to do that with us. When I was pregnant.

162
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.960
Jo Delgadillo: Telling you, all kinds of stuff because I WASN'T LEGALLY on pain pills. I just found out I was pregnant.

163
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:12.150
Jo Delgadillo: And then I was trying to get off of them. And they told me I can keep taking it, but I don't want to, because I know it, what they did to me. I'm like, No, there's no telling what they're gonna do my baby I wing myself off and even though the doctors that I can be on me. She knew that

164
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.480
Jo Delgadillo: And like, it was probably three months before I had the baby. I finally stopped. I was finally went off all the way

165
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:28.950
Jo Delgadillo: And I was three months before at the baby. And then I had one left and probably like I would say two weeks before I gave birth. I took one

166
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:41.250
Jo Delgadillo: Because I was it can't hurt and i was i fibrocytes hurting, like, ever. I just couldn't sleep. I didn't sleep for weeks. I took one and I have my bottle. My doctor even said it. We even moved from some from

167
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:50.940
Jo Delgadillo: Spring to Fort Worth. So I really had everything and they even called and I had it and she still called on me and she knew all this

168
00:20:51.330 --> 00:21:06.240
Jo Delgadillo: And then told my husband and I was a drug dealer and I was doing it and all and I hung out with her all day long. It was just me and her and he believed her everything that she said, I'm like, Okay, if I was doing all this one was I doing it before she came and he didn't believe me.

169
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Again, his mom.

170
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:16.920
Jo Delgadillo: His mom, he never ever protected me from her. And ever since then. I don't feel if he can protect me from her. He's never going to protect me from anybody.

171
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:23.790
Jo Delgadillo: Because I was pregnant with this kid and then have another kid. And then it was still going up because she left and came back and did it again.

172
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:32.370
Jo Delgadillo: And lived with us and it's just all oh my god it ended badly, like we still hold a wrench towards each other because

173
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:43.380
Jo Delgadillo: She came over there starting crap and she was wrong about it and he still he will. He wanted me to stay and he hates us all she discussed him. He told me that she molested him when he was little.

174
00:21:44.970 --> 00:22:02.100
Jo Delgadillo: He fills it but he doesn't remember nothing because when he she touches him, he he he printed. I swear. Everybody even his own sister. He doesn't like her to touch them, and they mess with them. They're like sit on him and tickle him and he will freak out, like she doesn't like it.

175
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Challenges with intimacy in your relationship as well.

176
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.450
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I have no interest.

177
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.990
Jo Delgadillo: And I feel bad because he asks.

178
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:25.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that's my next question from Indian if he has had this such abuse and it was never treated, you know, is he requesting, you know, is he and she stayed intimately

179
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:37.410
Jo Delgadillo: No, no, not at all, we first got together. It was like the normal, but he's just he was. I don't know how to explain it like we would have sex, but he's just not a shame. But he felt

180
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.810
Jo Delgadillo: I don't even know how to explain the way he filmed, but I could see that it was just wasn't normal yeah you always

181
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.060
Jo Delgadillo: Know how to explain it.

182
00:22:46.110 --> 00:23:01.080
Jo Delgadillo: But it wasn't just I knew him when he was with destiny and it was the same with her. He said, like he just she couldn't explain the way he felt, and then I knew him when he was with Sabrina and stay would complain. So everybody we're all knew each other back then so

183
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.020
Jo Delgadillo: He's had it for a long time. It's not just with me.

184
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.130
Jo Delgadillo: But he's never told anybody else what he's told me

185
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.450
Jo Delgadillo: They don't know that, but

186
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:17.970
Jo Delgadillo: Tell me what he tells me if you don't remember saying that he had a panic attack and like blurted out a whole bunch of stuff.

187
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:30.840
Jo Delgadillo: And then it was like, kind of like you passed out. I mean not explain it turned on whitening lift for purple and he didn't. He never had one that that I wanted to take him to the hospital. But he, like, all of a sudden came out of it. It's like he wants to sleep and woke up.

188
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:43.500
Jo Delgadillo: And then he was like, I was like, do you remember like what you said he wants to sleep, but after when he woke up, I was like, do you remember, like, when are you sad are you okay and I was like, feeding him and he was like, What are you doing, I was like, you had a horrible.

189
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:45.300
Jo Delgadillo: Asleep.

190
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.520
Jo Delgadillo: freaked me out.

191
00:23:48.570 --> 00:24:00.660
Jo Delgadillo: He doesn't remember you don't remember arguing me telling me not to call an ambulance, all kinds of stuff. But he happened and then he had another one like that when we moved here, like, a year after we moved here in our apartment.

192
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:09.900
Jo Delgadillo: And he hasn't had one sense, so he's do and it's building up but today. He just, he's moving up in this company and he got a race. So

193
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When

194
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.380
Jo Delgadillo: This

195
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anxiety, what

196
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:21.270
Jo Delgadillo: He likes everything build up and just one thing goes wrong. I tried to leave them. That's what happened that time.

197
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:35.610
Jo Delgadillo: The last blow up because it just doesn't show me any emotions like like I get a hug and a kiss. And we're leaving each other like the by high every once in a while I'll walk by, like, grab my ass. I'm just like, what, like I missed that.

198
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.190
Jo Delgadillo: I missed that affection or dispute coming in. When you're on the little things. I

199
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:54.150
Jo Delgadillo: ever wants to all hold his hand and you'll hold my hand and in the last I guess everybody says we've been together so long, but I'm like before we gather 30 years and then

200
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.100
Jo Delgadillo: We lose it.

201
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:03.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, how are you feeling right now on a scale of one to 10 on on the status of your relationship.

202
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.590
Jo Delgadillo: Or 10pm, I want out

203
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, one being one being a very low I

204
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:23.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me see how this. So it's a level of happiness. So, one being unhappy 10 being the fully satisfied.

205
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:24.990
Jo Delgadillo: About a true

206
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:37.380
Jo Delgadillo: So I told him I was like, No, we're going to get an income tax and we can both go our separate ways, and he doesn't believe me, because I've said it so many times, but I'm just like,

207
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.090
Jo Delgadillo: There's only so much I can say before I have to do it and he doesn't get it.

208
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:50.550
Jo Delgadillo: I've threatened. I've been threatening for like since alienating got here because he doesn't show them an emotion, he doesn't pay attention to them enough like

209
00:25:51.060 --> 00:26:00.060
Jo Delgadillo: Actually, I shouldn't even say enough because he doesn't at all like he's not and he doesn't. He's not dad to them when it comes to discipline or anything.

210
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:08.670
Jo Delgadillo: And then it affects our relationship to like every little thing that sucks it all comes back to me and him working together and that doesn't happen.

211
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:18.120
Jo Delgadillo: Because I have one way up there and they got to earn privacy when they don't earn it, and prove it. And they don't get it.

212
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.760
Jo Delgadillo: And he doesn't think that's fair. I'm like, no, because Haley's already done so much to lose the trust.

213
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:33.540
Jo Delgadillo: Now it's time for her to get back. We didn't do anything wrong. And she treats me like I did not anymore, but she's just getting really lazy and I remember that phase when I was lazy.

214
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:52.530
Jo Delgadillo: And I would complain and cry to do dishes. So I get it, I get her. She's kind of lenient on right now she's about to leave to her mom's on the 14th Valentine's Day at 5am she's gonna be gone. You know, it's gonna be so we're gonna totally miss

215
00:26:53.790 --> 00:27:02.040
Jo Delgadillo: She drives me crazy, but her sisters lover. I love her. Her brother's gonna be lost without her. Because every time like eight and do this. He looks at the sister.

216
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.470
Jo Delgadillo: For her approval.

217
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.990
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah together I get it was just them. She was like mommy to help her with her mom.

218
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He's eating going to

219
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.950
Jo Delgadillo: KNOW HAYLEY Hayley and her mom have not

220
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:25.050
Jo Delgadillo: So when he was born. He was a mama's boy and then she was walking holic and supplement all the time. Haley was old enough to see all this

221
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:38.640
Jo Delgadillo: She has been in recovery for three years now. Nobody wants to give her cancer, except for me and Haley tells me alone all the time that she wants to fix things with her mom, she just scared to

222
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:48.030
Jo Delgadillo: And then she started doing all this and I finally got her to break down that one day outside when I was I poured my heart out to her and chef. She finally broke down and told me

223
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:58.620
Jo Delgadillo: She it's homeowners bothering her like she wants to fix things because I'm on calls and talk to Adrian for hours on video call and not her. So we like hi Hayley Hayley. That's it.

224
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:16.590
Jo Delgadillo: So she's like, I want my mom to myself and I'm like, I get it i to i totally get it. So we she's leaving on the plane and then we have a password when she calls us this she misses having spaghetti with us and I hear, I must have a spaghetti with you guys then.

225
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.910
Jo Delgadillo: On us to Texas doing it already promised her

226
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And again, that protective. Oh.

227
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

228
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:36.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How come this has been established with you, but his father has not made that commitment to Haley that in the event, this happens I'm coming to get you

229
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:37.890
Know,

230
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:48.000
Jo Delgadillo: At all, he's mad because she's going, but she told her that I need this. And she pushed that's also say she won't she wants to cry when she talks.

231
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:56.760
Jo Delgadillo: She won't talk about nothing because she can't do without crying, she's she told me she's struggling and I'm like, I can see that I I feel the way I feel

232
00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:04.260
Jo Delgadillo: I can imagine where she feels she doesn't talk to us, she talks to her little friends, but that's not what she needs to say to her mom.

233
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:20.040
Jo Delgadillo: Needs to fix that. If I'm almost here. My mom's just like her mom, I would love to fix that. So I feel like we're giving her the chance to show ever ultra result. She's never had that and now she's older she can be able to, like, Nope, not gonna do this, I'm leaving.

234
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:31.590
Jo Delgadillo: She has done, I've already told, Sabrina. If you screw this up, you're going to fight in your front yard. She thought it was funny because I don't hurt this girl, man.

235
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.130
Jo Delgadillo: let her talk. Just listen. Don't get mad because there's a lot of things that she did that, she doesn't remember

236
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:49.590
Jo Delgadillo: To do when I would tell them all. You did this to be like I did it. You're lying and beat me for it and she knows she did. She didn't believe it, we should all remember

237
00:29:51.450 --> 00:30:02.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, going back to the relationship with your husband, how come up with it to what makes it, what would be needed to make you

238
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.330
Jo Delgadillo: Spend time with the kids.

239
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.140
Jo Delgadillo: Like emotionally like all into maybe doing homework with Julie and not getting frustrated

240
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:19.950
Jo Delgadillo: Playing with Jade and not getting mad cuz he's on the phone trying to play stupid invasion.

241
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.270
Jo Delgadillo: I think it's always they get him.

242
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.240
Jo Delgadillo: What's the Grammar Girl That's I keep telling them, they're gone. There's no going back.

243
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:38.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm just gonna go back to something that you said you can come last as long as the kids are taking care of

244
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:51.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so back protective role. While it's admirable. And the reason I keep using that language is so that you'll find the connection that type of mindset is what almost contributes to him.

245
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being able to just go through the motions.

246
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:11.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Remember, and we talked about me, maintaining certain things and wanting it to be enhance so you're deserving to be in a relationship where it's not someone that's just a good father. He's also a good lover protector and housing to

247
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.150

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's already set up on the back. Yeah.

Jo Delgadillo: On there.

Jo Delgadillo: I'm sorry I'm there. I've been there. Yeah, some food for

259
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:45.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That would definitely be in realizing the areas in where you are selling

260
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The way you're taking the bare minimum.

261
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.310
Jo Delgadillo: In every area I do everything.

262
00:32:54.750 --> 00:33:05.340
Jo Delgadillo: I'll get him to cook when like on Monday. So I do therapy books. That's the only time and then when I walk in, it's like I have to pat them on the back or give them a cookie.

263
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.040
Jo Delgadillo: Or do I have to babysit. They're not. It's not called babysitting their European

264
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:11.940
Yeah.

265
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:28.200
Jo Delgadillo: I'm like, can I go do laundry by myself why you should take one who I just want to go by myself, if I go to the store and I'm I wander around in touch and look at everything when I'm by myself will call me like one second here. So,

266
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.450
Jo Delgadillo: It's always something I can't find the wipes look for him.

267
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:42.510
Jo Delgadillo: Did you did you buy some yes I just bought I bought a box and it's just like he wants me to count or instruct me nuts.

268
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, but he's awesome. How long have you been with him.

269
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.190
Jo Delgadillo: 11 years

270
00:33:52.500 --> 00:34:01.020
Jo Delgadillo: We broke up once for a year and then we got back together, it would have been like a full 11 years but as or minus the whole year somewhere in between there.

271
00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:12.780
Jo Delgadillo: But I've known him since my son was too and that's like 18 years and my son's gonna be 22 sisters

272
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Boyfriend sister is

274
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That complicates things

275
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.150
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, it didn't the beginning

276
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.740
Jo Delgadillo: And he has a kid was my other best friend Nestle

277
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:37.440
Jo Delgadillo: And my cousin is raising his kid as her is as my cousin kid, and she doesn't know it's remember Sarah Nathan

278
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, younger. Remember that

279
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.480
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, we got to Jerry Springer Show over here.

280
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's a lot of hold on to, um,

281
00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:02.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I just want you to end and I'm hearing that you're not happy with the situation and and as long as you continue to allow for these things to happen it will continue.

282
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:11.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what are some of the consequences are potential consequences. You can identify if you continue to operate this way.

283
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.690
Jo Delgadillo: extreme depression. I've been feeling

284
00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:25.440
Jo Delgadillo: It's just, it's getting worse, or I, I used to be able to keep myself so busy or just stay out of it. And I think that's why I do everything that I do.

285
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:31.320
Jo Delgadillo: It's getting to where it doesn't work anymore. Like I it's hard to have a conversation with a friend.

286
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:39.810
Jo Delgadillo: And I talked to everybody. Yeah, I use Perfect Strangers and I meant to them and they let me

287
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:41.580
Jo Delgadillo: This weird

288
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.950
Jo Delgadillo: Always managed to find the perfect person to talk to you.

289
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:56.520
Jo Delgadillo: I've talked to an old lady in a chair for like two hours. One time standing in front of a lotto ticket thing and Smith here.

290
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.690
Jo Delgadillo: And I used to see around town. But I don't anymore.

291
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.100
Jo Delgadillo: When I was when I first had my step mom.

292
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.270
Yeah.

293
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:14.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you say the the okay the consequences would be the depression that you see that already.

294
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.450
Jo Delgadillo: I think my babies are starting to feel it.

295
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:31.260
Jo Delgadillo: Because date has been acted out so bad and Julie's just know so emotional and attached to me.

296
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.930
Jo Delgadillo: And I know it's

297
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.130
Jo Delgadillo: They see me upset and then they see me trying to hide it. I come up. I never used to come outside a lot and now

298
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:45.960
Jo Delgadillo: And they don't like it.

299
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.490
Jo Delgadillo: Paints new thing is

300
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.940
Jo Delgadillo: She goes, You just can't leave me here with her little head.

301
00:36:52.290 --> 00:37:03.270
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't know where I was outside. She goes, and every time. Like, I'll leave and she's fully closed off that I come in and she's all naked and just a diver every time.

302
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:13.080
Jo Delgadillo: And then I can't find her close anyway. And I'm like, How does she do this and I'll find them in the accounts and her dad does nobody sees it, like how

303
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.600
Jo Delgadillo: She does it all my girl us to

304
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:32.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Joe I mean you're taking on a lot. You've seen some, some of the correlations between what you're taking on and how it's affecting your body. You've identify is also affecting your mental health.

305
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With depression and then the impact on your children.

306
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:43.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I've already come up with a physical, emotional, mental well being.

307
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.950
Jo Delgadillo: And anxiety is my

308
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.390
Jo Delgadillo: It's become my best friend always there. Now, you

309
00:37:52.590 --> 00:38:08.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wouldn't be you see the separation. When do you see that this is just whatever this diagnosis may be that the doctors are still trying to figure out, or this is inviting them to feel separate or does it always feel like it's one thing

310
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:29.040
Jo Delgadillo: One of the same because it's like, I have an anxiety all day. But when I hit like upset or I start thinking or getting my thoughts. I can like I get a little tiny or I could feel it. But if I go off and like get into my feelings and

311
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.680
Jo Delgadillo: Then it starts with the shooting.

312
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:41.610
Jo Delgadillo: But I haven't. I've been making myself, stay calm lately and I know that's dangerous for me because I'm going to explode when I finally had it.

313
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:44.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: was the last time you exploded.

314
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.200
Jo Delgadillo: I'm a girl is like right before I left to California.

315
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.410
Jo Delgadillo: Punching everything and screaming going crazy.

316
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:06.720
Jo Delgadillo: Mother told me that I'm, I'm a bad mom that I'm not trying hard enough that I El a Yo yo yo

317
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:20.640
Jo Delgadillo: And I was like, how many times did I ask and ask and ask, no matter what it is you're right you do ask a lot, but then you go. Okay, but how many one. One more. Anybody listening to what will you back me up.

318
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:27.000
Jo Delgadillo: And then that's what she said, Well, you're just a bad mom and I was like two weeks ago you were so proud of me and how far I

319
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:34.410
Jo Delgadillo: Just went out and went crazy and start going crazy and my cousin that one that I was raised with

320
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:48.750
Jo Delgadillo: He's on drugs for bad and he's drinking a lot, but you don't know that. I know, but I know that's my cousin, he come running out there. He opened the door real fast in the door screen door. It's one of those black screen doors. He was like, stop.

321
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.170
Jo Delgadillo: Don't believe when anybody says you're a good mom.

322
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.740
Jo Delgadillo: And I just stopped and rest.

323
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:11.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's think of this okay I'm hearing all of the stresses coming from every thing imaginable. Your neighbors, your husband and your family.

324
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:25.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then you know you're seeing the impacts on your children and it's affecting physically. So I want to share my screen with you so we can watch the video. It's called the drama triangle.

325
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:37.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you'll, you'll find the know how you identify with certain roles. I've already brought to your attention, but just so that you can hear it in a different version.

326
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:54.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All to help us understand how conflict arises between people, often in dramatic or intense relationships or interactions and it was conceived by a guy called Stephen Cartman in 1968

327
00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:09.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it involves three different roles one that's kind of cold one down role and two that are called one approach is three roles are the victim, the rescuer and persecutor

328
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:19.800
And I think understanding how these roles work can really help us to identify how we could be resolving potentially destructive interactions that are quite

329
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:33.990
Draining on our energy. So let's start with the victim role. I think the victim role is quite self explanatory. It's the person who feels helpless and powerless, like they can never cut a break.

330
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:39.660
Or they can never get ahead in life. They often think things like, you know, this always happens to me.

331
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:49.770
Another role in this drama triangle is the rescuer and this person is someone who takes responsibility for other people's problems.

332
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:58.470
And they kind of make it their own problem, but at the same time, they don't really look at their own life, which could in fact be a complete mess.

333
00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:14.880
And they'll say people who might be going through a difficult time and think, oh look at that person you know they need help. I'm nice so I'll help them or maybe something a bit more parental like if that person did what I said they'd be happy.

334
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:22.020
And I think the dynamic that we often say fly out between the victim.

335
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:31.740
rescuer is something that we see in movies and, you know, romantic comedies all the time. It's something that we almost think is normal.

336
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:44.400
But it really is an unhealthy interaction. So the third row on this triangle is a persecutor. This is a person who is frustrated. They kind of self righteous and a bit of a bullied.

337
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:50.160
You know, and they might think things like you know they're wrong. And I'm right may need to do what I say.

338
00:42:50.460 --> 00:43:05.610
Or that person will get what's coming to them. Another thing that's really important to recognize that this triangle is that each of these roles move between each other. So, you know, the rescuer can become a prostitute or or the persecutor can become the victim.

339
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.170
The victim can become a persecutor so they all kind of move around.

340
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:21.630
Another concept that's really important to understand when talking about the drama triangle is this idea of the starting gate, we tend to have this one role that we most naturally sort of enter into

341
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:28.950
So for instance, you know one person might often go straight to the victim law where someone else might jump into the rescue.

342
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:40.830
The other thing that's really interesting about this is that as starting get role, sort of, is part of what we see as our an identity and like I said before, we shift from one role to the other.

343
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:54.180
Inevitably, we all end up in the victim role feeling powerless and helpless and then I able to do anything. And that's why it's really important to work out strategies for how to get out of this triangle.

344
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.280
So I guess that brings me to the next question. How do we get out of this drama triangle.

345
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:09.870
So let's take it by looking at each row. And again, it's in the one down victim role, we need to become a survivor. In order to do this.

346
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:22.620
We need to think like a problem solver and ask ourselves questions like what do I want and what steps can I take to get what I want another useful thing to do is to reflect on the good things that are going our way.

347
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.210
So we can make a note of it in a calendar or a diary.

348
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:32.490
You know, ask ourselves questions like What are three things that I'm grateful for today.

349
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:38.490
Or at the end of each week we could ask ourselves, what did I change this week.

350
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:50.040
So let's move on the rescue roll again, if this is where you tend to find yourself sitting, you need to think of yourself as a teacher or a coach.

351
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.720
Rather than as a rescuer you need to remember the golden rule that teaching a man to fish.

352
00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:01.950
So you need to support and encourage the person in ways to identify and solve their problems rather than rushing into solve it for them.

353
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:09.540
You can ask them things like, what is it that you want to say happen in a situation or what do you think you can do to changes.

354
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:16.770
Also, you need to make sure that you set boundaries setting boundaries around the time that you're able to listen to the person and letting them know that is really important.

355
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:26.760
In some ways it's a similar situation with the starting gate persecutor who like the rescue output. Some cells in these sort of one not power powerful position.

356
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:34.470
The difference is with this role is that you need to become a challenge, need to be firm but fair in your approach to people.

357
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:48.120
And to help the person recognize how you're feeling, you need to sort of address the consequences of their actions and set boundaries. So for instance, you could say something like, if you if you keep your side of the agreement, I can Kate long

358
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:56.070
As we're the rescuer. It's important to remember to set these boundaries and recognize that this isn't your problem to solve.

359
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:10.650
By freeing ourselves from this drama triangle, we are able to have happier, healthier relationships with people. We won't feel so drained and powerless and will also be able to identify toxic relationships that we may in fact be better off without

360
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.540
What did you think

361
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.290
Jo Delgadillo: Definitely the rescuer

362
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:30.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I agree, as you're talking. I'm like, you know, I've been using the language, but I love this video and how it ties up the different roles.

363
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.180
Jo Delgadillo: I used to be one I send them. Yeah.

364
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:50.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's a big that each of these roles can be interchangeable. Because at the end of the day, even though you're the rescuer and when you start to feel defeated and you feel like you try to help people. You go into that victim role.

365
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:56.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I try to help people and why they come in against me.

366
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.390
Jo Delgadillo: I love my husband for so

367
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Long I'm such a good mother. I'm a good, why, why did he give me what I need and set victim.

368
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.920
Jo Delgadillo: It's crazy. I have a monster.

369
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, it's called the drama triangle.

370
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.500
Jo Delgadillo: He loves, He loves stuff like that. Yeah.

371
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.030
Jo Delgadillo: Come up with facts. Watch.

372
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any times we've identified as the prosecuting

373
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.100
Jo Delgadillo: I'm

374
00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:30.330
Jo Delgadillo: lelay know

375
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.320
Jo Delgadillo: I'm all rescuer like

376
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:36.330
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

377
00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:40.350
Jo Delgadillo: Like all the time with anybody and everybody

378
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.730
Jo Delgadillo: Part of me is I know it's just to keep me busy.

379
00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:56.640
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I know. It's like, I feel it, because what if I don't have something to do or not, like, going, going, going, I get in my head. And that's when it gets worse. But like I said, it's not

380
00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.980
Jo Delgadillo: Helping that much anymore.

381
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:05.160
Jo Delgadillo: Because I haven't cried driving now and that's dangerous and I love driving and always striving.

382
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:16.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To hit pound for pound in you can to rescue others, in turn, those are you risking yourself to. Yeah.

383
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:23.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From the invoice from getting distracted with your troubles by focusing on other people.

384
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.320
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

385
00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:35.760
Jo Delgadillo: And as I know, and I tell myself. I'm a standard people's drama. I'm stop helping out which gets shipped out and then this happens. And I'm like, I just have to like

386
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:44.040
Jo Delgadillo: It just got in me and then she was crying to me. She told me she wanted to die and then that got me because I've been there. I felt like that before and

387
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.730
Jo Delgadillo: Getting there is a bad place to be.

388
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:53.040
Jo Delgadillo: I want to know that there's people to care it. Not everyone wants something

389
00:48:54.180 --> 00:49:00.630
Jo Delgadillo: But when you find them. It's, it's hard to keep them because you got everybody else around trying to sabotage it

390
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:08.880
Jo Delgadillo: And that's exactly what's happening. And people are like, don't give up just keep trying. They want you to give up and then another part of me is like, it's scaring her

391
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:17.340
Jo Delgadillo: Because they're they're getting loud with her. They're telling her what do. And that scares her. I can tell it does because she started like

392
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:24.630
Jo Delgadillo: Stepping her feet a lot and then doing with her hands like she got worked out. So I just

393
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:35.880
Jo Delgadillo: I just thought was like, oh, that's why I was like, I'm gonna go get my prescription. And I'm like, if anybody needs to talk to me. There's one number because I feel bad for her, my aunt, with cancer status your lunch I

394
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:37.950
Jo Delgadillo: Like

395
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:39.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Dogs identity, you're

396
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Finding your identity.

397
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:51.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You these situations. And the hope is you want someone to rescue you. So, in turn, you continuously to seek

398
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:59.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: you're seeking Him out opportunities, we need to be the rescuer but like I've been saying, and as well as the video attested to

399
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:17.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of identifying with the best view of the rescuer. Think of yourself as the coach, the teacher. It's like what I said last week set back and identify ways that perhaps you can allow your husband to be the rescuer he said he tried it, it didn't really

400
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:26.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nothing happened. But I'm wondering what boundaries. Did you set. So then he knew he needs to do agency.

401
00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:37.680
Jo Delgadillo: I basically come on TV as well. I don't tell them, but at first, I'll tell him, hey, this is going to happen, like she was off. Last Friday I said

402
00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.390
Jo Delgadillo: It was Thursday analytics and drop off tomorrow. And on another case you are. You already told me your own and then he'll mess with me all night long.

403
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:56.820
Jo Delgadillo: Scene, he's not, he's not, he's not all and then confused me and I'm like, Well, you're picking up Julie in the morning or you're taking a school in the morning I'll pick her up and then every morning, you won't get up and then I'm like,

404
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:14.040
Jo Delgadillo: Why I'm I'm up already. I'm getting her dress her and then you'll get mad and if I get him to do any comes back, he's a jerk. When he comes back and you'll come in. It'll be fine about money, or just random. Oh, that he hates living here in the trailer and

405
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.870
Jo Delgadillo: All you did was take her to school in the world. Yeah.

406
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So he picks a fight. Whenever he has to do something.

407
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:22.860
Yeah.

408
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:26.790
Jo Delgadillo: Just to make me feel bad and it works.

409
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:38.580
Jo Delgadillo: Like I work. What do you do. I'm like, are you kidding me like you can't even take your daughter to school. I do that every day and pick her up and take Jaden Jaden bad right now.

410
00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:56.100
Jo Delgadillo: She's acting out so bad and I noticed because we live in this stupid trailer, but it says income tax, we're out of here. Like, I'm just, it's just a countdown ready to get out of here and then he's like, well, we get the money from my dad. Like, honestly, I forgot about it.

411
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was a while ago.

412
00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.060
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, well it's supposed to be next month.

413
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:17.520
Jo Delgadillo: But I don't want to depend on it. I don't want to go there if I get if I get myself all into it and just be expecting it, and it doesn't happen, or there's, you have to do this in order to get this. I don't want it, like, no. And plus, I want a house that we got. And we're paying for

414
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.060
Jo Delgadillo: If I wanted something given to me. I believe in my family.

415
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:30.060
Jo Delgadillo: Because that's just how they are. And I like the life the struggle that we have makes you appreciate everything that we have

416
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:42.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People about your week and we're going to expand it. So it's not just with your in your relationship with your husband, but identify ways that you can create boundaries.

417
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:57.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you've already identified that you are a rescuer and you're a rescuer because you're trying to keep yourself up, you're trying to keep yourself distracted from this victim state of your mental health, physical health and things that's going on.

418
00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:07.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But in this ability to be a rescuer because it's the core. It's your sparring gate which you initially start off with what boundaries can be created.

419
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.980
Jo Delgadillo: I don't never know there's

420
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:13.740
Jo Delgadillo: Something nothing. I haven't tried

421
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:23.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As you go about your day as you go about your day. That's why I keep using the language. I want this to be embedded in your mind to rescue rescue rescue

422
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:40.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so when you see that that identity is coming up that the rescuers coming up, stop and reflect if there's any way that you can create a boundary that will not allow you to now become the victim and question. How did I end up in this situation.

423
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:41.580
Yeah.

424
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:42.930
Jo Delgadillo: Okay.

425
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:50.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because we decided describing the scenario with the elderly lady I saw so many red flags, but oh gosh, this isn't going to end well.

426
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:51.660
Jo Delgadillo: No.

427
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:53.190
Jo Delgadillo: I don't do all night and I

428
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was like

429
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:54.390
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, yeah.

430
00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:03.450
Jo Delgadillo: Like they're trying to do whatever to get me like, and then there. She said she already going to lose their job because it's called a conflict of interest.

431
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:13.950
Jo Delgadillo: Their sons already crossed on and because I have it on audio, no matter what. And she knows better because she works for that company. So she won't lose her job with everyone with just her

432
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:20.160
Jo Delgadillo: Just it's too much. They don't chance it, they just put in a new person.

433
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:35.610
Jo Delgadillo: So I so I'm like, we need to get out of this trailer and I don't know what Cassie, the lady. I'm friends with the lady that works here. She's and Brian, the owner and they said, I don't have nothing to worry about that. Don't make it to where they can't come on the property. They have to

434
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:37.650
Jo Delgadillo: So,

435
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:43.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When, when do we need to get one on one to get an update on the boundaries you created

436
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.250
Jo Delgadillo: Or we're going to do every choice. Yeah.

437
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:48.900
Jo Delgadillo: Okay.

438
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That the 20th work for you.

439
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.850
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah. Around the same time.

440
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any questions for me.

441
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.310
Jo Delgadillo: I've been wanting to talk to you about this overhead.

442
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that's, that's my advice.

443
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.210
Jo Delgadillo: Because there's no limit on what I can tell you, and you're not going to run until everybody

444
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.040
Jo Delgadillo: That's why.

445
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.380
Jo Delgadillo: It is for me like

446
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:21.780
Jo Delgadillo: Like I'm all into this therapy stuff because I needed him, and when I was a kid, I was in therapy all the time like because my mom went crazy and used to be real time.

447
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:30.360
Jo Delgadillo: So if I've got upset or anything. My grandma had it set up for I just tell the teacher, and they would get my therapist there and she would come to school and meet me a little therapy room.

448
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:46.290
Jo Delgadillo: Lot. So I learned how to like just vent to just let it all out. And if I tell people do therapy. You don't have to worry about what you're telling them, like, Oh, you're hurting yourself. You're good, or somebody else and you're good. Like you let it out. They're not going to judge you, and

449
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I want you to get better physically, emotionally

450
00:55:50.940 --> 00:56:03.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we want that for yourself to and boundaries are going to be the very start, the foundation for you getting to a better you and then when you're getting to a better you, the people around you have to ship.

451
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:05.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know either.

452
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're going to adjust. Boy, you're going to make the adjustments yourself.

453
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.660
Jo Delgadillo: You must that needs to happen.

454
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.400
Jo Delgadillo: I do boundaries, just going to make a big difference because I don't have any

455
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.210
Jo Delgadillo: That's a good yeah that's like the best advice on that.

456
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well,

457
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:25.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I hope you have a good night, and I'll see you next time.

458
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.030
Jo Delgadillo: All right. Thank you.

459
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:28.980
Jo Delgadillo: You're welcome. Bye bye.
