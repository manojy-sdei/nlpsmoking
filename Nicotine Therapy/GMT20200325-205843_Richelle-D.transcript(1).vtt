35
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.600
Yeah.

36
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.070
Richelle Direny: Are you up to date with your urine tests and everything that you need to do. Are you up to date with them.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.370
Richelle Direny: Yes, ma'am.

38
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.840
Richelle Direny: How do you pronounce your last name.

39
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.640
How do you

40
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.830
Richelle Direny: Not have

41
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:37.920
Richelle Direny: Alright so I'm kind of like, you know what the general rules are with, you know, the general rule of bright heart is that you always have on a headset. I

42
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:46.530
Richelle Direny: For the most part, to try to follow that rule and kind of tell everybody about that rule when it's coming onto your bio. You know, and it's you're just by yourself.

43
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.330
Richelle Direny: That's fine. But when we're in group, I really try to encourage everyone to have their headsets on simply because if there are other people in the room.

44
00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:03.510
Richelle Direny: I mean, if you have other people in your room, it's kind of not keeping everybody what everybody else seen is saying in the group confidential. So we really encourage that you do that.

45
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.010
Matthew Knauff: I'm glad you

46
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.180
Matthew Knauff: Told me that I get know that

47
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:16.830
Richelle Direny: Yes, especially when we're in the group because, you know, it's kind of like if you're sharing something and you know I don't have on a headset and I have a whole audience behind me, they're hearing what you're saying. Send.

48
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:27.360
Richelle Direny: Individual I always try to be. I have to honestly say things feel like I'm going off. So, you know, always in like an office setting or what have you.

49
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:37.350
Richelle Direny: But that's the one thing I'm just kind of going over the rules of bright heart in terms of what the expectations are each time that we meet

50
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.400
Richelle Direny: And I kind of implemented. I don't know how anybody else's but I kind of implemented, just for

51
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:57.360
Richelle Direny: My own peace of mind also to help you. Is that I tried my best to send out reminders of your sessions, um, you know, I try to tell people, the number is, I, I literally got a number, just for this.

52
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:11.250
Richelle Direny: So if you're unable to make your session just shoot me a quick little text, just like you did and just say, Hey, Michelle. Listen, you know, something just came up. I'm not going to be able to make my session or I'm sitting, I'm here, I'm just sitting in the I'm on

53
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.140
Richelle Direny: Hold on. They're saying that you didn't

54
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.850
Richelle Direny: Hold on.

55
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.380
Well,

56
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.100
Richelle Direny: He said the weight was 10 to 15

57
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.130
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, that's what I just said.

58
00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.160
Richelle Direny: Okay.

59
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:11.340
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I don't know. They said that maybe you didn't check in properly so I don't know for sure. I think virtual clinic has like the one standard number

60
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:19.320
Richelle Direny: So I'm you know after I meet with you if they need to meet with you to go over anything, then I'll just tell you to go over in a virtual clinic, but let me see.

61
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.460
Richelle Direny: Um, but, however, you know, just always just kind of let me know whether email.

62
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:37.980
Richelle Direny: Text typically usually when I send my reminders. I also put an email in there that if you can't get me by phone to send an email. I mean, I checked my email. Pretty much throughout the day text messages I check it all the time.

63
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.030
Richelle Direny: Because all of it is downloaded to my phone. So I am able to check in and respond to you accordingly.

64
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:56.040
Richelle Direny: If you ever, you know, we'd meet at the end. Like I said, for individuals, we will come up with. How we will do that for groups, it is weekly

65
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.230
Richelle Direny: 12 o'clock, and of course, like I said, starting April will do the 12 O'clock session and six o'clock session.

66
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:17.100
Richelle Direny: I'm going to leave it open for anyone who the 12 O'clock sessions are very large. So, you know, I'm going to kind of split that you know if the evening is that are few then attend the evening.

67
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:25.470
Richelle Direny: If you're not, you meet with the doctor to get your scripts refilled during the group.

68
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:33.420
Richelle Direny: If for whatever reason you're unable to make it. I don't know how the communication is set up or how Natalie has the communication setup.

69
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:41.700
Richelle Direny: But I really tried to just be as transparent as possible and helpful as possible to everyone that I work with, so I don't mind.

70
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:49.830
Richelle Direny: If you shoot me a text or shoot me know and says, Hey, Michelle, I was not able to make it to group today, but I'm running low on my script.

71
00:08:50.310 --> 00:09:07.020
Richelle Direny: And I can reach out to the cure team or to Natalie and just say, Hey, this is the situation, you know, can you refill his script and then I can let them know. I do have an appointment scheduled with you. But if you're going to use it all the time now and be like slow your old no

72
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.330
Richelle Direny: He said, I'm saying

73
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:09.810
Yeah.

74
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.610
Richelle Direny: So,

75
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:23.940
Richelle Direny: Okay, they're saying that that's the new waiting. Waiting image, but it doesn't apply at all times.

76
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.500
Richelle Direny: Okay.

77
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:19.980
Richelle Direny: Um, so that's kind of like the gist of kind of how I operate and how I try to do things like I'm here for you. I'm here to help everyone that I were all my patients. I try to do the best by each and every patient that I work with.

78
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:30.840
Richelle Direny: I believe if you work with me. I work with you if you're really, really want to work the program and do what needs to be done.

79
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:43.950
Richelle Direny: I'm here for you that's just kind of the model that I have. And that's what I try to work within those rooms. Okay. Um, did after I meet with after I finish meeting with you. I'm going to have you go back to the

80
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.860
Richelle Direny: Virtual clinic. Okay. And they said,

81
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.810
Matthew Knauff: When you're finished with me.

82
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:59.160
Richelle Direny: So that's kind of the general thing every time that we meet, it is going to be a recorded session group individual

83
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:10.740
Richelle Direny: It's always a recorded session. Everything Adult Health confidential, just like even if you're in your doctor's office or wherever you go, who is privy to the information is who is a part of your care.

84
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.860
Richelle Direny: That's just how it goes. Unless you share something or say something which is

85
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:30.180
Richelle Direny: harm to yourself or someone else and you know kind of confidentially kind of Europe's flies. Right, I'm doing in crime. So any questions thus far.

86
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:33.960
Matthew Knauff: Not low

87
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:43.920
Richelle Direny: Alright, so let's get started and let's get started by mom if you could just share a little bit of what, um, how did you hear about break harmony.

88
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.510
Matthew Knauff: Online.

89
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:56.670
Matthew Knauff: Either I was looking for a new doctor and I had it was that when the sites that I went to, had a thing about it. You guys were advertising on their

Richelle Direny: And I'm

Richelle Direny: So you already looking if you weren't in our rehab program before or it was just like through your primary care and you just wanted to be in a program that's how you

93
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.670
Matthew Knauff: You came about looking. I was driving to it was in another state. So it was a good it was a far drive

94
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:29.250
Richelle Direny: Okay, um, where you have you ever been in any kind of rehab prior

99
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.760
Matthew Knauff: And then

Matthew Knauff: Just probably in the last two years, have I done actual like counseling.

101
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.450
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you've never done any counseling before is what you're saying.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.010
Richelle Direny: Um,

109
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:51.270
Richelle Direny: Now, if you can just give me a little bit of background or insight on kind of your history.

110
00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:03.690
Richelle Direny: Your history of addiction. Okay, like your, you know, your drug of choice, the things that you've, you know, tried you know length of sobriety. If you've had in the past.

111
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.580
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, I've

112
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.530
Matthew Knauff: Since the

113
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:21.960
Matthew Knauff: Second week that I well since the first month, I was on buprenorphine in 2007 I've been clean from opiates. Ever since I've never had a relapse will never be it.

114
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.370
Matthew Knauff: But I have one instead amphetamines.

115
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.320
Matthew Knauff: Before

116
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.800
Richelle Direny: What so in your history, what, when did you start

117
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.290
Richelle Direny: Like, when was your introduction

118
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.790
Matthew Knauff: Um, I was when I was 16 I

119
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:48.450
Matthew Knauff: Started getting I had some dental work done for my braces and I got pain medicine prescribed and then

120
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.060
Matthew Knauff: By time I was 17 I was getting extra strength like it in prescribed

121
00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:06.420
Matthew Knauff: And then I'm in healthcare. So I tempted these doctors offices in right at that time was when they would come the reps from like Purdue Pharma and endo we come and teach you like

122
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:17.040
Matthew Knauff: Every lunch like what to look for in a drug seeking patient. What was so I knew all of that stuff. So by time. I was 19 I was prescribed 200 milligrams of morphine, a day.

123
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:26.340
Matthew Knauff: Ms content. And so, and I had myself convinced that I had this terrible pain that which I really didn't. It was my addiction and so

124
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.320
Matthew Knauff: I think I was 24 so when I got clean

125
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:38.910
Matthew Knauff: But it was never I'd never even heard of anything, but I have actually been impatient one time. I'm sorry.

126
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:47.160
Matthew Knauff: And you just had to. There was no they give you. Clonidine, and that was it. I mean, you had to be

127
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:54.960
Matthew Knauff: Miserable. So I just never even. It wasn't even something that entered my head. I never thought about every possibility of being able to get clean

128
00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:11.820
Matthew Knauff: So when I heard about Suboxone and everything. I was like, it was really, I guess like latched on to that because I was so sick of the way that I was exist in my existence was miserable Miserable. It was no way to live. And so I

129
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.550
Matthew Knauff: I don't know. I have a lot of willpower. But I really stuck with it and just

130
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.200
You know,

131
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:28.800
Matthew Knauff: Never wanted to. I remember for the first couple years, I would even be taking a shower and I would feel so free, like, wow, I can you know

132
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:41.490
Matthew Knauff: I'm not liking that sick every day. And I can just someone can call me and I can run out the door and do something. I mean, they had really impacted my life alive. And so I was really happy.

Richelle Direny: Ok and

134
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:55.710
Richelle Direny: Now after the age of 24 you said that was kind of when you acknowledge that you were addicted, or you acknowledge it from

135
00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:01.200
Matthew Knauff: The age of 19 I knew I was, I had known for quite a few years that I was

136
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.810
Matthew Knauff: Addicted I mean my life had to come completely unmanageable. And anything of

137
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:11.520
Matthew Knauff: Any type of way. There was no denying that that I was, you know,

138
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:19.650
Matthew Knauff: I the last two years, I, I knew what it was. I mean, I knew what was up that it was nothing but my

139
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.420
Prediction.

140
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.330
Richelle Direny: Now you did say that you work in healthcare, you still work in healthcare.

141
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:29.850
Matthew Knauff: I do

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.540
Richelle Direny: You said I want

147
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.340
Matthew Knauff: I'd been CMT

148
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.550
Matthew Knauff: CMT ok and a minute being empty.

149
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.850
Richelle Direny: Okay, you know, it's like empty as a paramedic right

150
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.300
Richelle Direny: Right. Okay. Um, now

151
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.250
Richelle Direny: Did you

152
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:07.740
Richelle Direny: Was there any kind of childhood trauma or, you know, any kind of abuse or anything that you've experienced growing up.

153
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.080
Richelle Direny: No.

154
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.870
Matthew Knauff: Not really, you know,

155
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:20.610
Richelle Direny: When you say not really. It's kind of like it's kind of yes no

156
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.440
Matthew Knauff: I would say, kind of, because I'm

157
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:34.080
Matthew Knauff: I had I'm gay. And I had never even seen another gay person because I'm from a real small town until I was probably 17 so

158
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.330
Matthew Knauff: That was really, really.

159
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.610
Matthew Knauff: Hard kind of

160
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:50.610
Matthew Knauff: Fit. I really had like feelings of like alone. And so even though I was had a lot of friends and everything. I still had it was still really

161
00:18:51.690 --> 00:19:05.400
Matthew Knauff: I still felt completely isolated and I realized when I finally like graduated and moved away to I have for years. I didn't even know who I was. I just played these parts and just, that's what I

162
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:15.000
Matthew Knauff: I went, I didn't even realize I any three free thought that was real bad about I actually a certain way around whatever group. I was around even sides of my family.

163
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:32.220
Matthew Knauff: Because they didn't want anyone to ever think anything bad about me or anything. So I just played these parts and I'd be good back and forth from and when I finally got my own life, just like wow that was I'd even know anything about myself real leg, which is sad, but I didn't. And so

164
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.720
Matthew Knauff: Now,

165
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.810
Matthew Knauff: I'm and I always like anything that

166
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.580
Matthew Knauff: turn the volume up on this.

167
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.120
Richelle Direny: Whole there. Are you are you hearing me in a delay.

168
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.790
Matthew Knauff: Sometimes it cuts out the volumes. Whoa. Whoa.

169
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.290
Richelle Direny: Okay.

170
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.570
Richelle Direny: Is it still is your volume up now.

171
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:10.920
Matthew Knauff: Anytime someone called in like someone I started receiving a call and after that it went real low. So it's something with my phone, but I don't know. I can hear you better now.

172
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:25.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think it's I've noticed. Everyone experienced that when they get a phone call it either mutes everything or you have to like turn it off and come back in. That's what happens when you get a phone call, I do hear a lot of people saying

173
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:44.430
Richelle Direny: Now when you said like the isolation. We did you feel like isolated by your friends and family when you started identifying as being gay or is it was just isolated in terms of the way you were feeling was contrary to everything that you saw around you in the town that you live.

174
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.620
Matthew Knauff: Right, and definitely feelings of like that was

175
00:20:54.270 --> 00:21:02.670
Matthew Knauff: My family like part of it was really, really big Christian and stuff. So I always had like this. Like I was something I was terrible. Like, you know,

176
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:09.810
Matthew Knauff: But it wasn't something I ever really struggled with because it was something I knew

177
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:18.000
Matthew Knauff: I mean I'm I didn't go through any of that, like struggle with who I was, or anything. I always knew that I just, it was really

178
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.510
Matthew Knauff: Lonely. I would say

179
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.180
Richelle Direny: Never felt like I really

180
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.210
Matthew Knauff: Connected with anybody, much like

181
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.710
Matthew Knauff: Is what I guess I would say, is how I felt.

182
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.250
Richelle Direny: Now with

183
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.710
Richelle Direny: Now, what was your, your, so your drug of choice was always pills opiates.

184
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.370
Matthew Knauff: Yeah.

185
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.950
Never alcohol OBS I've had

186
00:21:54.690 --> 00:22:03.330
Matthew Knauff: No opiates, benzodiazepines, I was on those for over a decade and I tapered off. There's about two years ago.

187
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.580
And

188
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:15.210
Matthew Knauff: I've had some problems with the amphetamines, but I take some for ADHD and that seems to help suppress that

189
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.880
Matthew Knauff: Really well.

190
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.300
Matthew Knauff: I think was my at my ADHD what caused the

191
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.620
Matthew Knauff: Use of amphetamines because I haven't really really bad in it, like, really.

192
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:46.800
Matthew Knauff: Is really affects my life pretty it's pretty has a pretty big impact. And so I i think that that's what has had to do with that because I don't really have any problem with it when I have my medicine.

193
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:54.810
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah. Do you have any underlying medical conditions.

194
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.000
Matthew Knauff: I had depression.

195
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:12.810
Matthew Knauff: Since I was young, I've been. I've been in a depressant every service depressed, since I was a teenager, but I've been on antidepressants since I've been 18 or so.

196
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.990
Matthew Knauff: And

197
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.090
Matthew Knauff: Anxiety.

198
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.770
Matthew Knauff: Which

199
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:28.140
Matthew Knauff: I was really caused by the medicine. Now I think worse than anything now that I'm off of it. I really don't seem like I have anxiety that much anymore.

200
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:35.670
Matthew Knauff: But my depression and stuff is I battled with it. Nothing ever really completely helped and I suffered a good bit from it but

201
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:43.440
Matthew Knauff: I found that my testosterone is low. A couple years ago, two years ago, and I started on testosterone replacement

202
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:55.260
Matthew Knauff: And it changed my life like now I don't really, I would not even consider that I have depression. Like I never have any symptoms of it at all, which is really, really new for me. I'd never

203
00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:58.920
Matthew Knauff: It's really nice.

204
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.110
Richelle Direny: You said that your they tested in they realize your testosterone levels were really low.

205
00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Okay, so you're still on medication for that.

206
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.090
Matthew Knauff: Or

207
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.220
Yeah.

208
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.830
Matthew Knauff: Or in a depressant.

209
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.720
Richelle Direny: Know the testosterone and I see your, your mouth moving and then

210
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.570
Richelle Direny: I'm OK.

211
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.890
Richelle Direny: I see your mouth moving and then later on I hear your voice.

212
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.680
Voice

213
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:42.450
Richelle Direny: Now we feel for the antidepressants was that being managed by a psychiatrist or just your regular doctor

214
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:57.630
Matthew Knauff: I went to. I went to like fighters before, but now it's just mainly by my regular doctor. I've been on the same thing for years and it seems to work, which I really don't know if I would still need to take it, but I've been on it for so long.

215
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:05.280
Matthew Knauff: I don't want to try. I'm so good mentally right now. I don't even want to mess with anything, it's

216
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:20.100
Richelle Direny: Okay, do you don't, um, so that's the only thing from a mental health standpoint or mental health issue history. The only thing you've ever had to deal with was just depression and you feel like you're pretty stable right now.

217
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.950
Matthew Knauff: Definitely depression, anxiety in the ADHD.

218
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.660
Richelle Direny: You're not on any medication for the ADHD. Right.

219
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.960
Matthew Knauff: No, but I'll be starting back on that now I'm

220
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.450
Matthew Knauff: Had to find another doctor that

221
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.460
Matthew Knauff: Because my moved

222
00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:54.810
Around here.

223
00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.770
Richelle Direny: You buy what around

224
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:08.700
Matthew Knauff: Oh, it's a dead comment around here as doctors will come for a short period of time and then they leave so

225
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.820
Matthew Knauff: I've had to find another doctor

226
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:19.320
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, do you have, have you ever had any history of suicide attempts.

227
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.650
Richelle Direny: Or suicidal thoughts.

228
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.280
Matthew Knauff: Uh huh. Yeah.

229
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.610
Richelle Direny: Attempt something

230
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:33.930
Matthew Knauff: Three.

231
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.630
Richelle Direny: Three in what was your most recent

232
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.410
Matthew Knauff: Oh, it's been years ago in my 20s.

233
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:52.800
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what was surrounding that like depression, like what was surrounding those those attempts were like the overdose.

234
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.730
Matthew Knauff: Accident and

235
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.280
Matthew Knauff: All that align with that relationship breakup.

236
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.310
Richelle Direny: Sorry. No, go ahead. Go ahead. One was a relationship breakup.

237
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:18.450
Matthew Knauff: Yeah. And then that is about a year or so after it and and then the other was just my depression. I mean, I, I always wanted to die actually was my always my mind standards always miserable and never

238
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:28.590
Matthew Knauff: Like that was just normal for me was, think about Diane and because I always suffered from it like so nothing really ever released it. Very much so.

239
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.090
Matthew Knauff: That was a common thing for me to think about, but

240
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.860
Richelle Direny: And you said that you're lacking so

241
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.130
Richelle Direny: So the three attempts was like within the same year.

242
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.110
Matthew Knauff: Know,

243
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.020
Matthew Knauff: Probably

244
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:58.530
Matthew Knauff: You were probably like two years within each other. And then the other one was like several years later.

245
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:06.600
Matthew Knauff: I remember I i can't exactly remember when that's how long it's been so, thank goodness. Yeah, yeah.

246
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.590

Richelle Direny: And is there any history within your family context of severe

290
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.390
Richelle Direny: Mental illness or suicide attempts overdose.

291
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.380
Matthew Knauff: I would say depression or my dad side, but it was very

292
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:26.220
Matthew Knauff: That's just like when I went on antidepressants. That was, like, just like the world had ended. I mean, like, that was the most horrible thing in the whole world. They're very mature like kind of a

293
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:39.300
Matthew Knauff: Really like known around like the area and Stephen said day like a real weird about stuff like that and they and plus, they don't really believe in things like that. But they really should

294
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.920
Matthew Knauff: So they really that's not like anything that they will

295
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.020
Matthew Knauff: They would never go to a psychiatrist or counseling or anything like that.

296
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.690
Richelle Direny: But you said that they they never did what was counseling.

297
00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:01.800
Matthew Knauff: No, no, no. Like I said when I was in a depressant. That was like

298
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.720
Matthew Knauff: Just like I was the world had ended because I was

299
00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.960
Matthew Knauff: Doing that I'm like guys are idiots.

300
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:26.490
Matthew Knauff: And my but my mom's side the complete opposite like complete opposite like No, none of her cousins or anything, have no one's ever been an alcoholic or had drug problems or anything like that.

301
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.320
Matthew Knauff: Can play like night and day difference

302
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.450
Richelle Direny: Now you said that

303
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:43.890
Richelle Direny: You said that your family were you grew up in a Christian household or is it that more your mom side or was it your dad side or your parents.

304
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:51.390
Matthew Knauff: So side. And I mean, my parents would go to church and stuff later on.

305
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.450
Matthew Knauff: That will my dad side they were

306
00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:03.930
Matthew Knauff: Like very, very, like, you know, the women were supposed to cut their hair and all that, all that stuff like that so

307
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:16.830
Matthew Knauff: on my mom's side they are good at church and everything, but they're like, well, I would say like normal, like, you know, just, it doesn't every single thing about their life is it constantly about

308
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.260
Matthew Knauff: I know you can. You don't have to watch church 24 seven and listen to church and

309
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.760
Matthew Knauff: Now know the reason why I asked because they go to church and that's fine.

310
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:35.640
Richelle Direny: Um, the reason I asked the way you said that, like your mom and her side of family was completely night and day from your dad and his family.

311
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.960
Matthew Knauff: Oh yeah yeah they. I mean, they get a turkey everything but not like

312
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:57.030
Matthew Knauff: It's not. They're not like obsessed with it and like everything's about that. No, no. Oh, you thought you meant like David David's completely like Wilder, you know, the outside is real Christian a

313
00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.490
Richelle Direny: Real Christian no

314
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:09.810
Richelle Direny: No, no, no, I wasn't, I wasn't thinking like that I'd be what you're describing is like a holy roller. Like, I mean, they

315
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.510
Matthew Knauff: They're yeah they're really like

316
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:26.670
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, like my dad his dad lived in South Carolina, and we went down there. One time, and I went to church with them and there was people like running around and carrying the one that stuff like that. I mean, they was

317
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:33.450
Matthew Knauff: Really to get down. Yeah, that's perfect description of a perfect description of them.

318
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:44.520
Richelle Direny: Okay, what about your grandparents. Now you said your dad. Your mom side. No, no history of suicide or anything like that. But what about your paternal grandparents.

319
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:55.140
Matthew Knauff: Oh, my dad side his dad's good and he never had any

320
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.770
Matthew Knauff: thing like that either. But I in his family, though it did. I think his

321
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:20.910
Matthew Knauff: Dad might have had alcohol problem. I'm not for sure, but I know that my grandma that her one of her brothers has always had a drinking problem. I'm actually two of her brothers always had a drinking problem. And I think that her dad. My have but I'm not, for sure.

322
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:27.570
Matthew Knauff: He was passed away like long time before I was born. But I think maybe so.

323
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.800
Richelle Direny: Now, were you born in you're in Ohio. So were you born and raised in Ohio.

324
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:43.830
Matthew Knauff: Yeah.

325
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:52.680
Richelle Direny: You said your highest your highest level of education is getting you're an advanced EMT

326
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:55.980
Richelle Direny: paramedic and

327
00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.520
Matthew Knauff: Yeah.

328
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.870
Richelle Direny: No legal

329
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.020
Richelle Direny: Any pending financial or legal issues.

330
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.270
Matthew Knauff: No, no.

331
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:32.640
Richelle Direny: Now this is where. So what are you hoping to

332
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:47.820
Richelle Direny: During your time and bright heart like what, what, when you thought about, you know, joining the program. You see what the offering right hard with their program offers. What is it that is your goal. What is it that you would like to work on.

333
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.760
Matthew Knauff: Just maintain sobriety and

334
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.170
Richelle Direny: Now how long you said that you've been sober. You said you've been sober for a couple of years, right, or

335
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:09.540
Matthew Knauff: Even SOBER SINCE 2007 from opiates and probably about a year or two from amphetamines.

336
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:16.740
Richelle Direny: Okay, and you still you don't you no longer to do our painful are going

337
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.290
Huh.

338
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.770
Richelle Direny: Do you still go to outpatient counseling.

339
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:33.480
Matthew Knauff: The last place that I went to. I had to go to counseling to there, but I don't go to any other

340
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.120
Matthew Knauff: Than this no

341
00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:37.410
Okay.

342
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:51.480
Richelle Direny: Now is it like, what is your goal that you're so you're one goal you said to maintain your sobriety, which you know you've been made for a few years now. Um so 2007 you're looking at what 13 years

343
00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:01.950
Richelle Direny: Did you go to any outside meeting, whether it's any, any kind of outside meetings.

344
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.140
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, sometimes. I will. I usually try to get like once a week at least.

345
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, my understanding. Now, I hear that they're having some type of they're starting to move them online. Now you can do online.

346
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:17.940
Matthew Knauff: So that's something that

347
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.630
Matthew Knauff: You can look into today. I would just went with my sponsor was and

348
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.760
Richelle Direny: You for you like it.

349
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:31.650
Matthew Knauff: Yeah. And that was the route. I took once I first because like the first doctor, I went to. I didn't like

350
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:44.310
Matthew Knauff: The ritual drinking about needing good in a or anything. You just went and got your medicine. And so when I started and addiction all just and he was like, you're going to get in a and everything. And so that really

351
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.710
Matthew Knauff: Helped me. And so I just have always kind of

352
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.100
Matthew Knauff: Done that I don't really know anything different. So

353
00:39:54.210 --> 00:40:02.040
Richelle Direny: Now, I mean, I know the concepts of a any and all the different types of anonymous and you know you're getting you're maintaining

354
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:11.010
Richelle Direny: Going, you know, whether it's your groups or to your doctors and whether it's an addiction specialist or you're getting medication you're on.

355
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:21.240
Richelle Direny: A maintenance program I truly believe outside of you I know like the concept of a your, you have no clue what does it control.

356
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.760
Richelle Direny: Like the whole concept of all of the different steps of a day and what you go through

357
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:32.460
Richelle Direny: Admitting that you have no control over something I forgot.

358
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:37.530
Matthew Knauff: But either way, that you're powerless over your addiction. You got it.

359
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:54.780
Richelle Direny: You got it, you got exactly what I'm trying to say. But, um, you know, I do truly believe that while that helps you to become fully aware that you're powerless and it allows you to make amends with people that you've heard, and you kind of go through the steps.

360
00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:02.700
Richelle Direny: I think deeper than that. It's also important to identify some of those

361
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.530
Richelle Direny: Things that at some point in life that you had lost

362
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:16.410
Richelle Direny: The ability to cope with different things like I thought about it this morning that oftentimes we have this where we're kind of

363
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:25.440
Richelle Direny: We're on this journey and right now on this journey things is good, you know, life is going great. I'm having no worries and then you hit a wall.

364
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:33.690
Richelle Direny: And like when you hit that wall on the other side of that wall is a period a season of trials that you're going to experience.

365
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:44.880
Richelle Direny: And the reason why you go through them is so when you get on the other side, depending on the choices you make while you're going through those trials. When you get to that other side

366
00:41:46.890 --> 00:42:02.460
Richelle Direny: It's depending on, you make it either builds you up prepares you make you mentally and emotionally better to handle what is on the other side of that and what your ultimate purpose to accomplish on the other side.

367
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:11.730
Richelle Direny: And then as you get there. Then you go through another pretty smooth patch before you get to the next season of trials that you're going to experience.

368
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:29.820
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes, especially when you're looking at a person who, at some point in time kind of travel that road of addiction, whether it's to opiates alcohol, whatever it may be, they lost the ability to cope. They

369
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.270
Matthew Knauff: lost the ability that me completely. You're so right.

370
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:46.860
Matthew Knauff: You're you lie me. That's what I use for anytime somebody there. Right. I would just get high. If I didn't like house. It was going to just get high. And I didn't know how to cope with stuff at all. And I still not real, real good at that. Actually, can we can implement for sure.

371
00:42:47.340 --> 00:43:04.260
Richelle Direny: So, and that's literally what happened when you're in that season or that period of your life, you're like, oh, I don't feel that on here. And so you take something to numbing you take something to somewhat freeze time, but you didn't really freeze time you froze yourself.

372
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.480
Matthew Knauff: But you still was smooth and right through it.

373
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:21.180
Richelle Direny: And you were kind of ignoring everything that was going on around you. But guess what, while you're ignoring the problems. The problems are still attaching itself you can be numb friend, but I'm come with you. So it's almost like you just linger.

374
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:28.020
Richelle Direny: longer and longer simply because you refuse to have to deal with it.

375
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:37.710
Richelle Direny: And so, I believe, truly in individual counseling. This is where now you have the opportunity to come head to head to face it, because guess what

376
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:50.910
Richelle Direny: All of these different things that you had to go through to become stronger to meet your ultimate purpose. They're still there, because they need to be addressed. You just need to learn how to, how do I

377
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:58.320
Richelle Direny: Address it. It's kind of like I might my scenario is you got a monkey on your back and you need to get them off.

378
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:09.090
Richelle Direny: But you have to acknowledge that he on there and you have to be willing to let go, your low. What you're going to you on baby your monkey for a minute. Are you going to get rid of it or I usually say either monkey or gorilla.

379
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:19.710
Richelle Direny: What you're going to, you're going to keep them there. Are you going to learn how to one at a time, remove each thing so that you are free enough

380
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:34.440
Richelle Direny: To move on with your life and to code and to just just cope healthier emotionally and mentally with life and anything else that comes with it. And that's kind of where you're able to do that through that one on one.

381
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:46.590
Richelle Direny: It's very hard for us to come to acceptance that we all have some degree of issues that we need to work on.

382
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:58.380
Richelle Direny: A lot of the times we know it, but we refuse to go through the process, the healing process of dealing with it. Um,

383
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.490
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes we push it in our subconscious.

384
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:13.230
Richelle Direny: But then we don't realize that those issues that are buried in your subconscious. It's really truly forcing its way out. And that's the reason why you feel an act the way you're doing now.

385
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:24.300
Richelle Direny: And you say, I don't really understand why I'm feeling that way. Or why did I do this. It's because there's something there that needs to get out and you're refusing to get it out individual

386
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.980
Matthew Knauff: That's how you address those issues.

387
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:26.820
Richelle Direny: Absolutely. I

388
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.420
Richelle Direny: So,

389
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:48.630
Richelle Direny: Sure, I can only extend and just let you know you know that's what I'm here for. And a lot of those things that you don't necessarily want to bring up in discuss in group groups are great, but certain things is not for everybody's ears.

390
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.790
Richelle Direny: And so

391
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:56.790
Richelle Direny: You know, right. That's where you have, you have to come in, you have to make that conscious decision to say

392
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:03.060
Richelle Direny: You want to be open to me to do that individual into do that work.

393
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:13.920
Richelle Direny: So if your goal is to maintain your sobriety while you've done it for so many years. If your goal is to continue maintaining that sobriety.

394
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:30.510
Richelle Direny: I encourage that you even if it's once a month, you kind of tap into this resource of saying, hey, you know what, Rochelle. Can we meet or you know you want to. Whether it's here or it's outside it's whatever you prefer.

395
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:46.710
Matthew Knauff: So definitely now that I'm going to start back to work, too, because I had like an illness for with my lungs and stuff for like two years now I'm starting back to work. I definitely will definitely need that because I get I take

396
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.150
Matthew Knauff: I have like see it like a different way than most people do. And I get I'm really feel like responsible and stuff for my

397
00:46:55.170 --> 00:47:06.660
Matthew Knauff: Patients and their parents. So I really don't handle. If I can't save someone or something. I really don't. I don't deal with that. We're willing. So I definitely will use it because I get really, really.

398
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:24.180
Matthew Knauff: And I took a test before when I got into school and it said I would always have a problem with that because I have such a such a, you know, I see it as honor you know that someone allows me to care for me. You know, I don't see. So I feel really

399
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:25.860
Matthew Knauff: It's really

400
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:39.840
Matthew Knauff: I get really heavy load and I can't just leave stuff at work it whatever I see it comes home with me and I think so. I definitely that would definitely be good for me to do because it's real. I really

401
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.570
Matthew Knauff: Like that.

402
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.130
Richelle Direny: That's working on

403
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:50.370
Richelle Direny: Understanding what you can control and what you can't control and understand the difference between the two.

404
00:47:50.850 --> 00:48:04.020
Richelle Direny: And you're absolutely right, learning not to take things home and knowing that it's okay that you leave work at work and home is home it it takes art. It takes time takes a long time.

405
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:23.430
Richelle Direny: But it can be done, but it's first understanding that I am I don't have all power and control. That's not the gifts that was given to me. So it's, it takes some time. So let me look at my calendar, because I do want to do a follow up session. And then from there we can you know

406
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.740

443
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:06.810
Richelle Direny: Okay.

444
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:18.870
Richelle Direny: Well, it's not it's not it's not all that horrible where some people they're laid off in definitely

445
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:20.730
Patrick S: Yeah, a lot of

446
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.150
Patrick S: Words that like big cities.

447
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:33.960
Richelle Direny: Where I mean, here and there. There's people like hotel chains and stuff like that that shut down day like late them off. Definitely.

448
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.000
Patrick S: Okay.

449
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.030
Richelle Direny: So that's

450
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.420
Richelle Direny: Where some people kind of live with.

451
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:44.580
Patrick S: You know,

452
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.290
Richelle Direny: Everybody is everybody's kind of hanging on. They are trying to figure out

453
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.280
Richelle Direny: Trying to figure out, you know what they're going to do or you know

454
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.980
Richelle Direny: If they're if they're going to have a job or, you know, it's kind of touching go

455
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:03.450
Yes.

456
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:25.260
Patrick S: What day was a Tuesday. This dude left work because he was hanging out over the weekend with people who had the coronavirus and he didn't know until Tuesday the that they had it and I don't think they knew either. So he comes to work and

457
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:41.010
Patrick S: He goes, he tells them, and then he goes the tested moral he didn't have any symptoms. So doctor's office didn't test him, and they gave him a return to word no and

458
00:53:43.890 --> 00:54:07.080
Patrick S: So he's working with us next day and because the company want to want to pay him to stay home and I thought that was, you know, I can understand the company saying, yeah, we're not going to pay even though they probably should. But I thought that was his duty to to stay home and not

459
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.720
Patrick S: without pay. Regardless, I thought he should have done.

460
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:18.750
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. I mean, especially if he knew later on that the people were exposed

461
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.630
Patrick S: look kind of

462
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.850
Richelle Direny: Cool to come to work, knowing that

463
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.670
You are exposed

464
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.530
Richelle Direny: And not things

465
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:45.360
Richelle Direny: So how have you been like trying to like I know when we, the last time in our group that we spoke. We talked about like your own self care and, you know, just being mindful of how you yourself to things so that

466
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.830
Patrick S: That's hard getting worse. We're stir crazy and it's a

467
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.680
Patrick S: She's been kind of difficult

468
00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:57.750
Patrick S: But

469
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.000
Patrick S: In what in what way I'm

470
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:09.960
Patrick S: Just upset that I'm not paying 100% attention. They're like, I feel like playing a video game.

471
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.770
Patrick S: It's kind of annoying, but after we worked it out. We had a great day today.

472
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:19.110
Patrick S: But it's

473
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:31.110
Richelle Direny: Frustrating. I think part of that is going to come in because of you know cuz she you said you guys work together, right, or no no you don't.

474
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.730
Patrick S: You work in the same building.

475
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.710
Patrick S: Okay.

476
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.140
Richelle Direny: Why weren't you working soon.

477
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:45.000
Richelle Direny: Okay. But either way, I'm

478
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:57.630
Richelle Direny: This is like that hurt her feelings of not having getting me enough attention that was just like started this week because you guys were laid off right

479
00:55:59.550 --> 00:55:59.940
Patrick S: Yeah.

480
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:21.600
Richelle Direny: And if you're not necessarily used to just kind of been bottled down and closed and everything like that. It's, um, it's definitely on to frustration intention and uncertainties and anxiety and fear and everything is going to be like mixed into that you know that attention.

481
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:23.370
Patrick S: Like I want attention because there's

482
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.260
Richelle Direny: Only so much and no more attention.

483
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:43.740
Patrick S: Right. And, you know, it'd be nice to go to a meeting with their clothes, Michigan. I don't know how Florida is with Michigan were under the don't leave the house thing but it's ridiculous because there's so much stuff open

484
00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:47.970
Patrick S: Like today. I walked in a coffee shop.

485
00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:57.060
Patrick S: It's checker records they got that's a record that shop. It's been around for since I've lived in Hillsdale for 30 years

486
00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:08.010
Patrick S: But in the last five years, five to 10 years they started selling coffee to There ain't no reason a place like that should be open and it's open. Like there's not like

487
00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:13.140
Patrick S: I don't understand this order at all.

488
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:23.070
Richelle Direny: I mean, you know, it's so this is the thing. And it's almost like you, you know that. Okay. Are you quiet. Are you following the rules.

489
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:39.060
Richelle Direny: But at the same time, you know, people are looking at, especially the smaller places if they're just looking like these mom and pop shops, they're just looking at the bottom line, you know, the income piece of it can really truly afford to

490
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:50.280
Richelle Direny: Stay close for one day and you know still be able, because it's not just about their employees there. It's also about their own livelihood.

491
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:58.650
Richelle Direny: Not the store, but you know the story is what pays their bills. And if that doesn't say open, then they

492
00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.040
Will

493
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:03.060
Patrick S: But, you know, I'm not getting a paycheck right now.

494
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.870
Richelle Direny: But you see you have at least in their minds. They're looking at it like if I stopped working.

495
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:25.410
Richelle Direny: I, you know, that's the one I depend on where in if I had my own company. It's a whole lot of marketing and it's a whole lot of things that goes into my small business so

496
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:34.020
Richelle Direny: It's if I stop working. If I close down for a week or two, it's going to take a lot of marketing, it's going to take a lot of effort.

497
00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:47.790
Richelle Direny: To generate the money in which I just lost because you're talking about pay for the overhead. The light the this, the that and then even with the stimulus package that they're coming up with who knows how long that's going to take before you get that

498
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:49.560
Richelle Direny: Yeah, where

499
00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:58.140
Richelle Direny: Are you go back to work. I the small business person, what am I gonna do. Okay, depending on myself.

500
00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.250
Right.

501
00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:05.520
Richelle Direny: There's some small businesses. That's my understanding will never really truly recover from it.

502
00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:07.980
Patrick S: Yeah, imagine

503
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.710
Patrick S: I heard that.

504
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:23.340
Patrick S: My wife sister called her freaking out because they're taken the government's taking our money to pay for this stuff like she they took her 401K.

505
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:33.060
Patrick S: I DON'T LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE TAKING EVERYBODY'S 401k and they plan on giving it back or what

506
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:39.390
Richelle Direny: You know, I, you know, Patrick was I don't follow politics and I don't want I've learned today.

507
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:53.160
Richelle Direny: I've actually learned today, you know, you have to tread on like waters when it comes on to stuff, you know, I can only say my opinion of what I think I haven't read anything. I haven't

508
00:59:53.670 --> 01:00:03.990
Richelle Direny: Watched anything but the little in my logics that question. Where are you getting all that money from are you giving me that my own money that I pay in taxes, where you get all this money.

509
01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:13.890
Richelle Direny: You know, I'm getting excited. I'm getting this money or you just giving me about my own tax dollars or, like you said, for one came out of, I

510
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:22.260
Patrick S: I just started 401K, like, five months ago, so I don't really get shit in there but

511
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.710
Richelle Direny: You have something in there. Probably nothing in there now.

512
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:33.660
Patrick S: Yeah, yeah. But, uh, somebody who's been fucking putting money into that for five years.

513
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.730
Patrick S: That I mean

514
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.180
Richelle Direny: 20 3040 50,000 miles.

515
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:40.380
Already

516
01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:45.720
Patrick S: Know that's that's ridiculous.

517
01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:56.880
Richelle Direny: A lot of the more money you have in in the morning good you lose a lot. I know I was talking to my mom and she says that she doesn't even want to look

518
01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:09.600
Richelle Direny: Busy woman should see what I see how much she lost because you think about the last recession that we had and how much people were losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

519
01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:10.470
Yeah.

520
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:18.960
Richelle Direny: And, you know, you're the you're the little late person, even if you had, let's say you've had for one k for the last 10 years

521
01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:26.430
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm whatever amount of money you had in there. Even if you lost like 20 $30,000 how it's going to take you to recover that money.

522
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.490
Patrick S: What your the rest of your life.

523
01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:38.700
Patrick S: It's, it's so, so I got bailed out by not being responsible and putting all that money away like everybody else.

524
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.740
Patrick S: That's bullshit.

525
01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:53.190
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I honestly don't know. I mean, listen, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, you put you put you you put in

526
01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:02.250
Richelle Direny: A certain percent in your 401K your company if your company matches it. After this I doubt your company's going to match it anymore.

527
01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.090
Richelle Direny: Yeah I bout they're going to match anything

528
01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:20.070
Richelle Direny: And if they match it. I mean, I don't know by the time you're ready to retire and you're eligible take that money and even when you're ready to retire. They try to encourage you not to take the full amount only take some and leave the rest in it to continue to get invested

529
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.960
So either way you put it, I don't know.

530
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:35.940
Richelle Direny: Listen, all I could say is, try your best it you know I can't stress it enough, find your own self care because sitting and watching this stuff will make you go nuts.

531
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.060
Patrick S: Yeah I don't I try not to watch it.

532
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.560
It just really makes you go nuts. It makes you question.

533
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:45.660
Patrick S: It makes you

534
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:46.800
Question everything

535
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:59.580
Richelle Direny: I mean, let me ask you this. Now, I mean granted it's only been a week. But what is something new and innovative that you've done. Like, do you see your parents more

536
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:11.580
Patrick S: Know they took they that this is weird. They told me they didn't want me to come over for a while and I'm you know i'm i'm glad they're being careful. I'm glad they said that

537
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:24.990
Patrick S: But the first day that they said that, like, I'm almost 40 years old. I'm be 40 in October, I felt like a little kid, the day they told me that, but

538
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:38.430
Patrick S: Coming over that. They told me they said they asked me not to come over and I felt like that day I felt like the little kid, like I didn't have any parents like not they

539
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.580
Richelle Direny: Did you like don't come don't come out.

540
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:57.270
Patrick S: Yeah, they did. And my dad, he's diabetic and 70 and a mom 60 a no. She's 6971 I'm glad they're being careful and because I told him I

541
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.620
Richelle Direny: hit you, you, you weren't expecting that it hit

542
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:08.160
Patrick S: It hit me hard like yeah, hit me hard. I felt what I made me feel like a kid.

543
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:25.500
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean, listen, and that's a legitimate feeling because I think in that moment, even though like I know the coronavirus is real. I know that people are getting sick and I know this is happening. But then I can't see you. What do you mean I can't come over and see you. It's like

544
01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:32.970
Richelle Direny: It just kind of confirmed that hey, you gotta say what you can't do anything.

545
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:42.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so hey listen. I mean, I know you said you bought 50 packs of cigarettes. I mean, when you start running low, then it's going to really hit you a second time.

546
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:43.800
Yeah.

547
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:47.370
Patrick S: Well, I got a couple bags. It's a backhoe

548
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.460
Patrick S: that'll last a few months. Well, no two bags and pray last month.

549
01:04:54.990 --> 01:05:01.110
Richelle Direny: No. Wow. Well, you did say you're heavy, you're a heavy smoker heavy tobacco you chew tobacco.

550
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:02.580
Patrick S: I do at work.

551
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:07.800
Patrick S: But yeah, I'm smoking way too much now.

552
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.690
Richelle Direny: That's anxiety.

553
01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.840
Patrick S: That's getting anxiety and

554
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:18.840
Richelle Direny: anxiety and fear. You just, you just display it a little bit differently than how your wife.

555
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:27.060
Patrick S: I went outside to smoke. I would cut out at least a pack a day but I smoke indoors.

556
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.430
Richelle Direny: What's the difference between inside and outside

557
01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:39.000
Patrick S: I don't want to get up and go outside to smoke a cigarette. It's like a

558
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.520
Richelle Direny: Are you outside because I hear birds chirping

559
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.320
Patrick S: Yeah, I'm outside right now.

560
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:47.790
Oh,

561
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.580
Patrick S: Yeah.

562
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.370
Richelle Direny: So, um,

563
01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:09.210
Richelle Direny: What what is something that you can do because I mean the intensity of your smoking. I mean, I think that leads, it's like surrounds your anxiety or fear of something. So what, like, what do you think that anxiety is coming from.

564
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:11.520
Patrick S: A

565
01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:13.680
Patrick S: I don't know.

566
01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:20.340
Patrick S: See, I've been. I was on benzo for five years arm.

567
01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:33.990
Patrick S: Then they took me off those when I first got on. When I first got in the Suboxone stepped down program, a year and a half ago, they took away my men's owes arm.

568
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:46.950
Patrick S: But I'm pretty used to anxiety. So now it's just part of life. Like, I don't, I don't know what I'm sure a lot of anxiety is

569
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:59.550
Patrick S: Like, I don't know if I i know that i need to get back to work and make money, but since I got bad lungs. I'm scared if that means if I get it on. I'm automatically dead.

570
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:13.710
Richelle Direny: About to say that because I think, look at this point it's not so much situational as it could possibly be medical because of the fact that you knew that was the last time you've been to the doctor.

571
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:16.110
Patrick S: It's been a while.

572
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.990
Richelle Direny: Was a while like a year or two, three.

573
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:32.670
Patrick S: Other than for going for Suboxone Um no I went to the doctor. I was sick month ago, I was sick as hell sick, so I've ever been, I think, for about

574
01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:43.470
Patrick S: And it might have been five weeks ago for about a started feeling kind of shitty Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday. I was on the couch. I didn't do nothing.

575
01:07:44.280 --> 01:08:00.060
Patrick S: Monday. Well, I got up and tried doing laundry and stuff. I did a little bit of housework, but for the most part, I was on the couch and then Monday I called in took a point at work and I threw up Monday night.

576
01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:10.740
Patrick S: But I, it wasn't like it wasn't like regular when I was a kid when I threw up. I'd, I'd add her all over

577
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.600
Patrick S: Um,

578
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:24.660
Patrick S: But yeah, and then Tuesday I went back to work and I was pretty tired and I went, got a flu test. And that turned out negative. I went to the doctor Saturday and

579
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:46.740
Patrick S: Sunday didn't have the flu, but my body was so tired. I had no energy and I was coughing, I ended up shaving my chest. So I could put Vicks on my chest, all the time because i i i like it doesn't feel like big gets in anywhere but I don't do that.

580
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:51.480
Patrick S: I put this on my feet before I went to bed and throw some socks on.

581
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:57.900
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And you said like he rubbed your chest, your like I under your nose and your back.

582
01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:03.630
Patrick S: Yeah, I didn't put Vic's on my back. But yeah, my back and shoulders eight

583
01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:06.720
Patrick S: Everything.

584
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:07.500
Know,

585
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:15.600
Patrick S: I took a food. I had a flu tests and they, they, you know, they put that thing up my nose. It was negative.

586
01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:18.270
Patrick S: But

587
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.620
Richelle Direny: Because of the fact that you're a smoker, it's all, it's gonna make you feel worse.

588
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:26.790
Patrick S: What is

589
01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.680
Richelle Direny: When you get sick.

590
01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:32.700
Patrick S: Yeah, I mean it could have been

591
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.600
Patrick S: Just made me feel worse because I'm a smoker.

592
01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:40.410
Patrick S: Time since I've been sick. I couldn't be it.

593
01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:47.670
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think that's that's partly what it is, it's because of the fact that you're a smoker.

594
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.260
Richelle Direny: You're pretty heavy smoker, do you, um,

595
01:09:55.050 --> 01:10:01.650
Patrick S: But I know, I know some people who get coronavirus or asymptomatic order.

596
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people. That's why they say you pass it because you don't know that you have it.

597
01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:08.970
Patrick S: Yeah, and

598
01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:16.230
Patrick S: I'm I know there is a blood type that you're better off with and I got that blood type.

599
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:17.880
Patrick S: I got

600
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:19.740
Patrick S: I got the good blood to

601
01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.990
Richelle Direny: What is that blood type.

602
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:23.430
Patrick S: O positive,

603
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:33.600
Richelle Direny: Oh you have that your lady, there's one that's a universal donor. One is a universal receiver, but it's kind of, it's like a rare blood type, because

604
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.820
Patrick S: Well for coronavirus

605
01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.840
Patrick S: The people who have all positive seem to handle it better.

606
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.980
Patrick S: It's either that or they're less likely to get it.

607
01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:45.990
Richelle Direny: Oh, that's what makes sense.

608
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.250
Patrick S: Yes. With this

609
01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:57.390
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, I think he's just overall. You just have to be if you sit there and worry about

610
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.380
Whether or not you're

611
01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:07.950
Richelle Direny: If you're too overly cautious. I mean, all you're doing is just putting additional stress on yourself unnecessary stress on yourself.

612
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:14.100
Richelle Direny: I think it's just important that you, you know, just be as cautious as possible.

613
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:15.120
Patrick S: Yeah, like

614
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.120
Richelle Direny: wearing jeans. That's it.

615
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.400
Patrick S: If I go back to work. I just

616
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:31.590
Patrick S: Try to maintain my distance, but it's hard not to touch your face when you're when you're in a factory sweat and it's hard as this real are not touch your face.

617
01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:48.780
Richelle Direny: I think it's hard just naturally just, you can actually if you know like I my face. It shows me my nose itches me like, what am I going to do go. It is hard. It is hard. But I mean, but outside of that, like I said, it's practicing proper hand hygiene.

618
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:56.310
Richelle Direny: Just hygiene. Overall, you did when you come home, you take your clothes off. You put it in the wash.

619
01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.350
Richelle Direny: You know you don't go laying around in your clothes that you just got off of work.

620
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.840
Richelle Direny: Things of that nature.

621
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:04.860
Yeah.

622
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.070
Richelle Direny: Is what we encourage you to do.

623
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:21.060
Richelle Direny: You know, and, but, but, again, like I said, when do you feel. Do you feel that there's a certain time of the day that you smoke more or less.

624
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:24.390
Patrick S: In the morning as an attendee to smoke.

625
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:28.800
Patrick S: Well, the first hour I'm up, I'm pretty much smoking the entire time.

626
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:44.880
Richelle Direny: And do you feel like more anxious in the morning, like when you have to go to work or just preparing for the day, get on the road. Do you feel less anxious, like, what, what do you think if you're supposed to identify

627
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:51.810
Richelle Direny: And the times that you smoke. The most like what's going on at that time.

628
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:57.600
Patrick S: Let's heard it. Oh I smoke law. It's our heads are that though.

629
01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.520
Richelle Direny: Huh.

630
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.160
Richelle Direny: Do you think you don't take medication for anxiety. Do you

631
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.350
Patrick S: Not oppressor

632
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:16.230
Richelle Direny: Have you been feeling with this whole thing going on. Have you been feeling more anxious I mean more depressed.

633
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.610
Patrick S: Situational um

634
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.380
Richelle Direny: Well, especially with this now that you've been laid off for a week.

635
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:35.070
Patrick S: I haven't been to the press have been annoyed quite a bit.

636
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:37.260
Patrick S: When I

637
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:40.290
Richelle Direny: Was of like with your wife wanting the attention or

638
01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.370
The

639
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:46.980
Richelle Direny: I mean, what's different.

640
01:13:48.030 --> 01:14:00.990
Richelle Direny: Okay, you guys are home yes a little bit more. But what's the difference. Now your whole then when you go to work and come home regulars you paid her more attention after you've been out all day.

641
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:18.150
Patrick S: Um, yeah. Thanks. So there we miss each other and then we come home and we're there. And every now and then I'd play a game like maybe every other day of a basketball game and

642
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.130
Patrick S: Since I'm off where I'm playing more and she just never liked

643
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:25.830
Patrick S: The

644
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:29.580
Richelle Direny: Now you're you're forced to kind of

645
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:43.620
Patrick S: Yeah, I'm kind of I'm I've been enjoying the time off, because I can play video games instead go to work, but she says she's ready to go back to work.

646
01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.480
Richelle Direny: So play video games teach her how to play a game. Find a movie that you guys will watch together.

647
01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:54.030
Patrick S: I've been trying like she's just sick of it she she needs to get out.

648
01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:14.100
Patrick S: Like as we she has watched TV, she doesn't. She can't do that like constantly. I can't do it constantly either, but I can hand if I don't work. I can handle watching TV or playing video games for at least 10 hours and all that sounds like a lot but

649
01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:20.100
Patrick S: I can handle just chillin better than she can, I guess.

650
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.250
Richelle Direny: Is it is it that she um

651
01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:31.920
Richelle Direny: She's always been one to like she's a workaholic, like she always has to be on the move one on the goal.

652
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.050
Patrick S: No, no.

653
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.330
Patrick S: She likes being at work when I'm there, I'm

654
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:47.400
Patrick S: Like she'll even sign up for a Saturday. If I'm working but

655
01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:58.830
Patrick S: She likes her days off, too. But she did it when we do have a day off. I'm ready to relax because I think it's because I'm worn out from working.

656
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:22.560
Patrick S: I mean, I will go and I will go out and do some like go on a family function or whatever but it. I don't like doing it both days I like one day where I can chill and i don't know i'm just better sitting around in front of the TV and she is

657
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.970
Patrick S: She's not

658
01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:25.050
Necessarily

659
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:28.920
Patrick S: I guess.

660
01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:39.840
Richelle Direny: I mean, if there was this funny thing that I saw was Steve Harvey on Family Feud ask the guy like if your

661
01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.400
Richelle Direny: If your wife decided to leave you on a Saturday night. What would you do Sunday morning.

662
01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:51.540
Richelle Direny: What do you think that he said

663
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:56.280
Patrick S: Oh, I've no idea.

664
01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:09.540
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I'm going to ask it this way. You're regarding if your wife, we decided, hey, you know what, I'm out of here on a Saturday night. What is something you think you would do the next morning.

665
01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:15.480
Patrick S: I, I'd be devastated. I would were pretty cold and

666
01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:23.610
Richelle Direny: It's okay well that's different, because you're codependent the guy said that he was sleeping because that's extra sleep because then you're not waking

667
01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:32.580
Richelle Direny: And I could see my husband saying the same thing, something because he just want to be bothered me that morning. He'll. He'll probably be devastated. But maybe after he fully wakes up.

668
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:34.140
Patrick S: Yeah.

669
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:36.210
He doesn't want to be bothered.

670
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:45.270
Richelle Direny: Me. But you know, it's just kind of like a guy just likes to relax, that's, you know, just kind of relax, kind of, I want to do nothing day

671
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:46.380
Patrick S: I just want

672
01:17:46.860 --> 01:18:01.380
Richelle Direny: To go to mush a whole day. Just leave me alone. I can sit here watch TV and just make my brain, go to mush where the woman's mind is constantly working through this, what I'm doing to being busy. I can't sit still. So it's the dynamic

673
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:13.980
Richelle Direny: You know just how a man. But then, like you said, she just wants to work. And then there's also the security of having some kind of money to be able to pay your bills.

674
01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:15.300
Yeah.

675
01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:20.010
Patrick S: Yeah, I'm not plan on paying the bills for a little bit.

676
01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:28.110
Richelle Direny: But I think this is giving you the opportunity to be able to defer a few of your bills.

677
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:29.640
Patrick S: Yeah, I'm hoping

678
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.850
Patrick S: To stay in tune on what happens about bills now.

679
01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:39.390
Patrick S: Why, what what the

680
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:48.060
Patrick S: I don't need to know how many people got it. And how many people have died, but I need to find out, like what I need to find out.

681
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.500
Patrick S: Like what are they, how they're planning on

682
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.470
Patrick S: Bye.

683
01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:57.690
Patrick S: What does

684
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:03.960
Patrick S: Not pay bills for a month or something other than making it up later.

685
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:16.080
Richelle Direny: Like, especially if you don't know if you pay rent how that will work because then you would have to go to your renter to see what they're saying. What if it's

686
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:25.500
Richelle Direny: Like your mortgage company, you can call and you know defer your payments for three months on certain payments you can differ a little bit longer.

687
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:28.590
Patrick S: Once we can do three months.

688
01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.530
Richelle Direny: I believe so. I believe that's what three months.

689
01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:39.240
Patrick S: Does that mean yo three months, all at once, or they tack it on to the back.

690
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:49.770
Richelle Direny: So like if you have a mortgage instead of you if you're new to pay off your mortgage in 2030 January 2030 you will play it off and maybe March or April of 2013

691
01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:50.700
Patrick S: loca

692
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.840
Richelle Direny: Or big factor. They find a way to factor it back into your loan. Yeah.

693
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:59.940
Patrick S: I could see the bank doing that. But what about the gas company and the power company.

694
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.220
Richelle Direny: They I don't. I know, I know here in Florida, they're not

695
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:14.070
Richelle Direny: Forgot what they said that they're doing. You would have to speak to your power company in you have guests there in Michigan. Right.

696
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:15.930
Patrick S: What's a

697
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.130
Richelle Direny: Gas like we don't want to guess you guys have gas right

698
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:21.510
Yeah.

699
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:28.200
Patrick S: I got a gas Michigan gas. I gotta guess, well I don't got propane.

700
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.880
Richelle Direny: Yes, like here everything is electric so

701
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:44.220
Richelle Direny: You would have to contact. I think this is the time if your home longer than the lead, I would start making phone calls like evil. The school loan.

702
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:48.870
Richelle Direny: Loan that they're garnishing

703
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.980
Patrick S: Yeah.

704
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.290
Richelle Direny: It, find out about ways for them to still garnish that amount of money.

705
01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:03.420
Richelle Direny: You know, see if there's any way they can work something out where their own garden, she more like whatever little income, you're getting you're

706
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:04.860
Patrick S: Saying I

707
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:11.430
Patrick S: Should call and ask them because I get my last check Friday.

708
01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:21.930
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. So that's something that you can definitely look into to see if you could

709
01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.660
Richelle Direny: You know if that will be helpful for you.

710
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:35.910
Patrick S: How isn't in Florida is is there. Is it one of the more the bigger states got a bigger problem or

711
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:43.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah I know they they said that we have. Last I checked, it was like 22 deaths in Florida total

712
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.060
Patrick S: It doubles every day.

713
01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:50.820
Richelle Direny: Like it doubles every hour.

714
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:58.140
Richelle Direny: Seems like it is doubles every minute.

715
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:01.320
Richelle Direny: You're hearing something different.

716
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:02.610
Patrick S: Yeah.

717
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.270
Richelle Direny: I mean I don't necessarily follow it as much.

718
01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.580
Richelle Direny: I want to review your treatments.

719
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:21.240
Richelle Direny: Well, when do you see Dr. For Bravo.

720
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.320
Patrick S: Monday.

721
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.540
Richelle Direny: You see him every Monday.

722
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.430
Patrick S: No, I'm

723
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.800
Patrick S: I'm gonna see him next Monday.

724
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.180
Richelle Direny: Whatever happens to the discussion we talked about with your

725
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.860
Richelle Direny: Your wife.

726
01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:57.630
Richelle Direny: And you wanting the firearm and she wasn't too keen on the idea

727
01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:58.980
Patrick S: Oh, we're not getting

728
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:03.990
Patrick S: I don't, I mean,

729
01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.920
Patrick S: I don't see coming down to the

730
01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.830
Patrick S: No, I don't think it will be needed.

731
01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:21.900
Richelle Direny: So you came on, she what you guys talked about it and then she just, you just said, Okay, I agree.

732
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:23.730
Patrick S: Yeah, well,

733
01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:26.250
Patrick S: Yeah, pretty much.

734
01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:36.090
Patrick S: It wasn't that big of an issue. I thought like I was thinking it might be necessary, but

735
01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:41.190
Patrick S: I don't know, I just stopped thinking it was something I had to do.

736
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:55.500
Richelle Direny: I just think, you know, like I said, it's between you and her, but I think what she says speaks

737
01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:00.210
Richelle Direny: Speaks volumes.

738
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:08.190
Richelle Direny: Who you know the current situation, because once once a person starts getting stress.

739
01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:17.760
Patrick S: I know she's more worried about the money than I am. And that's crazy because when we're working. I'm always worried about money.

740
01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.580
Richelle Direny: So what a little bit more comfort comfort. Now, in comparison to

741
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:34.890
Patrick S: Just the feeling like that what they need. I, I felt like they needed to shut us down. And so I was relieved when I did.

742
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:40.350
Richelle Direny: It because the knowledge that the guy had been exposed

743
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:46.140
Patrick S: Yeah, and and the fact that I have COPD hours.

744
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:59.400
Patrick S: Thinking, I was definitely a gone or by got it. So I felt relieved and I still like I'm still thinking the yeah I'm not ready to go back to work.

745
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:05.160
Richelle Direny: But fearful of losing of you're fearful of

746
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:10.890
Richelle Direny: It being fatal for you because of the fact that you have COPD.

747
01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:11.730
Yeah.

748
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:20.490
Patrick S: Um, I don't know why I'm not stressing about money. But when we're working. I got all those bills.

749
01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:24.900
Patrick S: I'm more to stress as she doesn't right now.

750
01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:30.960
Richelle Direny: You're thinking about you're thinking about life in depth, that's why.

751
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.250
Patrick S: You go

752
01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:33.210
Live

753
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:38.520
Richelle Direny: And whether or not you have money in your pocket.

754
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:39.840
Patrick S: Yeah.

755
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:51.600
Richelle Direny: Because that's going to be another stressor. If you end up in the hospital and you're trying to maintain all those meals that you have in your own able to work and

756
01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:56.040
Richelle Direny: Not being around for her. So it comes down.

757
01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:56.850
Thinking about

758
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:09.990
Patrick S: Is this pretty much all your talks, if everybody else is going, talking about the corona.

759
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:11.940
Richelle Direny: Said again.

760
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:15.870
Patrick S: Is this what you're talking about. With all your clients coronavirus

761
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:20.160
Richelle Direny: Not necessarily. It's just as it's related to them individually.

762
01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:23.250
Richelle Direny: Taking it and i mean

763
01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:29.670
Richelle Direny: When I thought about the current virus, because the current of ours is it's look. It's a virus, but it's

764
01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:38.400
Richelle Direny: Is the side effects of all of it. What is it doing for you. How is it you know if your home.

765
01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:45.870
Richelle Direny: If you look, you lost it. I know someone else that lost their job and they have a lot of kids to take care of.

766
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.660
Richelle Direny: So you're the stress factor.

767
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:55.770
Richelle Direny: You know what is something or what are you coming up with a group we talks about

768
01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:06.480
Richelle Direny: You know, at this point, thinking about your own creativity taking an introspective look at yourself and see how can you become creative

769
01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:22.320
Richelle Direny: And starting your own thing to generate income in comparison to depending on an employer, how can I become creative with the dawn of now everything is going online. Maybe you can start something online to make money, so it's it's not

770
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:32.370
Richelle Direny: We're not talking about the corona fire because I'm not a medical professional our really know how it affects you were what what it's what is the impact it's having on you in your day to day life.

771
01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:36.420
Richelle Direny: And focusing on that because

772
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:38.550
Richelle Direny: Ultimate ultimately

773
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:47.730
Richelle Direny: The side effects of it and what it's doing to everyone becomes paramount to everything else.

774
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:57.570
Richelle Direny: Your, your homestead like you said that your wife. She's home stress. She's not working know money's coming in. All these things are going on.

775
01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:05.760
Richelle Direny: What do you think a person does when they get overly stressed and overwhelmed in this losing all sense of control.

776
01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:11.310
Richelle Direny: As a person that is an addict. What do you think will happen to that person.

777
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:16.350
Richelle Direny: If they feel like they have no sense of control and they don't know what else to do.

778
01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:31.830
Richelle Direny: It's an increase the possibility of her relapse. So it's, you know, I think it's very important to check in to see how each individual is coping with the health care.

779
01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:35.730
Richelle Direny: In moving forward.

780
01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:37.620
Patrick S: I think

781
01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.610
Patrick S: The one call that I probably should make is the

782
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:53.700
Patrick S: The courthouse no annoyed about the child support. Mm hmm. A surprise definitely find out about the because I am behind already

783
01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:57.690
Richelle Direny: You not thought about asking you that work, how does your daughter.

784
01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.600
Patrick S: She's gonna be 15 in July.

785
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:12.990
Richelle Direny: I will definitely call I saw it I you know I would recommend that after we you know you we we we wrap it up. I think it's making a list of all the people that you need to call

786
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:18.720
Richelle Direny: To see you know what

787
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:21.390
Richelle Direny: What bills. You can defer

788
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.100
Richelle Direny: You're not hold accountable and responsible or you're not.

789
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:31.680
Richelle Direny: Going to come down to the child support that they're not holding holding you

790
01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:34.410
Richelle Direny: What is that called in default

791
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:46.170
Richelle Direny: Opinion, or at least you call to make an effort to say, Hey, I just got laid off on what can I do in in you know inside of

792
01:29:47.520 --> 01:30:00.360
Richelle Direny: Whatever, whatever with everything that's going on and not being able to make your child support payments. So those are things like, you know, hey, for the week. Those are the things that you could have done bit being a little bit more proactive.

793
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.120
Richelle Direny: In making those calls because

794
01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:14.610
Richelle Direny: While there's the fear of getting sick and you're kind of relieved that you're home. But at the same time. You don't want to procrastinate.

795
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:17.220
Patrick S: And then

796
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:22.860
Richelle Direny: Bounce off on you, and then they become unforgiving and says well you should have called us right in the heart of it.

797
01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.330
Patrick S: Yeah.

798
01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.050
Patrick S: Yeah. Do I gotta

799
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:32.700
Patrick S: Get my own employment claim done tomorrow and

800
01:30:35.490 --> 01:30:36.300
Patrick S: All that stroke.

801
01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:42.780
Richelle Direny: Did they did. They lay you off. Like what, like, you know, but they do, they say, just take a weekend and come back.

802
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.810
Patrick S: The latest off.

803
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:54.450
Patrick S: And he said, all he could tell us was were laid off next week, and they would be getting a hold of us.

804
01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:02.430
Patrick S: I don't know, I'm assuming, I'll hear something Friday.

805
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:05.940
Patrick S: And if I don't, I'll be calling Friday.

806
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:08.730
Yeah.

807
01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:14.760
Richelle Direny: I think calling them Friday. But I think your first phone call tomorrow should be to the courthouse.

808
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:16.110
Patrick S: Yeah, it will be

809
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:17.910
Patrick S: Because

810
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.650
Richelle Direny: You don't want to be in a position where

811
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:21.930
Richelle Direny: You're on.

812
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:43.590
Richelle Direny: The it's the difference in calling now and waiting till later they're going to say, well, no, this is everything is kind of back to normal. If you call in the heart of it at least they can make a plan with you to say okay well let's resume payment until in X amount of days.

813
01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.750
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I think

814
01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:51.270
Patrick S: There be until this year until this year, I've never had a problem with child support.

815
01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:57.750
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, but give them a call. You don't see your daughter anymore. Right.

816
01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.960
Patrick S: Now text during the

817
01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:05.640
Patrick S: I'm told her how much I loved her, and

818
01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:18.960
Patrick S: told her that I was worried about the coronavirus and all that. And I just wanted to let her know that she's very loved and all that. And she didn't respond.

819
01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:23.880
Richelle Direny: Do you guys talk everyone so long.

820
01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:38.730
Patrick S: Now we haven't talked to her since Christmas. I said, Merry Christmas, and she returned a Merry Christmas, and I left her alone because she told me that she didn't want to talk to me ever again in July.

821
01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:47.070
Patrick S: I wasn't expecting her to say Merry Christmas back but she did.

822
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:49.950
Patrick S: Earn a

823
01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:55.080
Patrick S: Over was last week, I think it was last week.

824
01:32:57.390 --> 01:33:08.190
Patrick S: Might have been the week before I got a phone call from her step dad, they can I claimed Natalie for taxes and it wasn't my year

825
01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.350
Patrick S: And I didn't

826
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:16.710
Patrick S: I didn't claimer but my account or lady did our taxes, she

827
01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:18.750
Patrick S: Um,

828
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:27.600
Patrick S: Was going over all my like best options and she put something called

829
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:36.150
Patrick S: I don't know my daughter was a had a household qualifier.

830
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:38.490
Patrick S: So I got

831
01:33:39.810 --> 01:33:42.930
Patrick S: Some little bit of money, but it wasn't claiming her

832
01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:45.120
Patrick S: So,

833
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:55.770
Patrick S: Um, I was looking at my paperwork and I called him back. And I said, Yeah, it looks like I did. Kramer and I don't know how it happened because

834
01:33:56.310 --> 01:34:17.520
Patrick S: I'm 100% sure that she knew that I couldn't claim her because I forgot all about the head of household qualifier thing didn't even know what it was. But, uh, so I got a hold of the accountant. I drove out there and I love to know and she never returned our call other than

835
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:29.460
Patrick S: My wife. This was Thursday, she called she got sent home for not feeling good at work, Thursday, which was my last day and

836
01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:35.760
Patrick S: And she had Friday off to we both put in for a vacation day

837
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:48.030
Patrick S: Well, she called the accountant and the accountant told her to have me color. Then I called her and she told me about the head of household qualifier thing and then I told him.

838
01:34:48.990 --> 01:35:02.370
Patrick S: What that was and said, yes, she said, I did not claim her like she I didn't get her as a credit and he said he was planning on sending some paperwork for me to

839
01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:08.100
Patrick S: Well, basically, he was going to turn me into I'm

840
01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:18.360
Patrick S: IRS because his accountant said that somebody claimed her in nobody claimed or so.

841
01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:29.550
Patrick S: I don't know, like if he got back for his accountant told him what happened. I don't know if there's some confusion on his part, but he thought I claimed or not dinner.

842
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:34.410
Richelle Direny: So, oh, so putting her at the hospital is not really playing her

843
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:41.070
Patrick S: No, I didn't. I didn't claim her and get 1500 dollars in a

844
01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:52.860
Patrick S: Big earned income credit because of it. I got some little I got something little that's legal to do, is my understanding of it.

845
01:35:58.410 --> 01:36:00.240
Richelle Direny: Also you claim her every other year.

846
01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.120
Patrick S: Yes, every other year, I get the claim.

847
01:36:04.170 --> 01:36:04.470
Patrick S: And

848
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:13.830
Patrick S: I'd feel rotten like next year when it's my year if I'm still way behind on child support, and she won't even talk to me. I don't even want to claim it

849
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:20.430
Richelle Direny: Oh, you just told her mom. She's playing

850
01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:29.490
Patrick S: Well, either that or if I claimed her I get I'd spend all the money getting caught up on child support.

851
01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.320
Richelle Direny: Which is probably what would really happen.

852
01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:48.450
Patrick S: That's probably what I'll do is if I get the opportunity claimer then pay all my child support, get it back up to date.

853
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:59.010
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think I just would definitely encourage that you kind of sit, you know, in this time that your home.

854
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.460
Richelle Direny: Is really review.

855
01:37:03.090 --> 01:37:04.350
Richelle Direny: You need to do kind of

856
01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:13.530
Richelle Direny: Prioritize all the things that you need to do, you know, and then go from there. So,

857
01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.440
Patrick S: Everything I need done in one day.

858
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.700
Patrick S: To

859
01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:21.690
Richelle Direny: Get it done in an hour, at least, you need to have an idea.

860
01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:27.120
Richelle Direny: Of, you know what's going on on things that you need to do and you at least

861
01:37:28.410 --> 01:37:42.510
Richelle Direny: Way, even though you're not necessarily stress about money, but at least your wife has some assurance that whatever little money that you guys do get you can actually save it or do something else with it puts us to the side.

862
01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:45.420
Richelle Direny: It gives you some assurance.

863
01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:48.780
Patrick S: That we're going to be okay.

864
01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:59.640
Richelle Direny: That you're going to be okay. Yes. I mean, if you get, let's say if you guys get $2,000 per pay period, both of you. Come on. Let's just, for argument's sake.

865
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:07.290
Richelle Direny: And other that $2,000 you're paying all your bills but then if you're able to speak to all of these your creditors or whomever

866
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:17.760
Richelle Direny: And they say, okay, well given in light of everything. You guys got laid off, let's just go ahead and defer all of these things and you're not really making any payments, at least you can

867
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:30.060
Richelle Direny: Just get your beer essentially with the money you have put down the rest so that when you do get back on your feet you do start working, you would have some money already in the bank, and you're somewhat okay

868
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.160
I don't

869
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:37.470
Patrick S: Offer another week or two, we're not gonna have any money at all.

870
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:50.520
Richelle Direny: Well, I'm sure. But that's why I'm saying you you will you would have to start thinking now, and making phone calls. Now,

871
01:38:51.930 --> 01:38:54.780
Patrick S: I see. I see what you're saying. Yeah, you

872
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.850
Richelle Direny: Need to do it, just so you have an idea.

873
01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.670
Richelle Direny: Is going to be in that same boat.

874
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:05.670
Patrick S: Everybody's gonna be in that same boat. For the most part, like

875
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.520
Patrick S: Everybody in our neighborhood.

876
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:16.530
Richelle Direny: Everybody's going to be in that boat. But if you can offset it if you can offset your financial

877
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:29.130
Richelle Direny: For a week or two in terms of what you have and what you don't have. If I'm going to go hungry, and I'm going to go. Let me see if I can offset it where I don't go hungry for another two weeks.

878
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:30.930
Patrick S: Oh, we're not. Yeah.

879
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:40.020
Richelle Direny: No, but I'm just giving you an idea, the concept of when you make these phone calls and you start putting things in place, at least it buys you some time.

880
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.190
Patrick S: Right.

881
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:55.440
Richelle Direny: There's a difference between having zero dollars in the account today, simply because you paid all your bills in comparison to having something in the bank for the next one, two weeks because you offset your bills. Right.

882
01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:07.710
Patrick S: Yeah, I'll see. I wasn't gonna pay bills, but I guess I will call and tell them, find out what I can do won't make a plan or something.

883
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:12.810
Richelle Direny: You can plan it and that and that's what it is, it's me, it's at least having that that

884
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:14.880
Richelle Direny: Making that conscious

885
01:40:14.910 --> 01:40:17.610
Richelle Direny: Effort to speak to someone, instead of just acting like

886
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:19.410
Richelle Direny: Having the money from not calling

887
01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:32.100
Richelle Direny: Them pay the bills. I think they'll be more willing to work with you if you have a conversation with them in comparison to if you just say, Hey, you know what, I don't have any money. I'm not going to call them.

888
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:35.490
Patrick S: Right. A BIG DIFFERENCE. SO,

889
01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:43.560
Richelle Direny: Let me see if I could schedule you um so you're going to come to group next week. Next week is the first week of

890
01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:45.630
Patrick S: Yeah.

891
01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.460
Richelle Direny: Actually next week is the 31st.

892
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:04.050
Patrick S: Was gonna come to group next week.

893
01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.310
Patrick S: Or unless you want to move it to two weeks I'm fine of the

894
01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.910
Richelle Direny: What the what the group, the group, I would say, Come

895
01:41:15.930 --> 01:41:16.860
Patrick S: Every two weeks.

896
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Cuz that's how you do it. I think you come every other week to group.

897
01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:21.720
Yeah.

898
01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:29.730
Richelle Direny: Because financially, it's going to be even harder now that you're not working.

899
01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.190
Patrick S: Yes.

900
01:41:35.370 --> 01:41:36.990
Richelle Direny: So let's move

901
01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:37.530
What

902
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:43.830
Richelle Direny: Have you scheduled for the eighth

903
01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:49.290
Richelle Direny: For individual

904
01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:50.790
Patrick S: Okay.

905
01:41:51.780 --> 01:42:00.000
Richelle Direny: So you have a group next week and then the following week you have you meet with me on the eighth you're already on my calendar.

906
01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:08.490
Patrick S: All right, I guess. Another thing I gotta do is talk to my HR and find out what's going on with our insurance.

907
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.470
Patrick S: Since we're laid off.

908
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:16.740
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, that's another, like I said, start jotting down all the people you need to call

909
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.870
Richelle Direny: Maybe you

910
01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:25.830
Richelle Direny: Know I'm anxious because now you're getting down to the nitty gritty, or you're using her stressors.

911
01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:35.250
Richelle Direny: You're eating her mind because now you're making phone calls, you're finding out what you guys can do and at least you have some idea, you know, moving forward.

912
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:39.090
Richelle Direny: What creates fear of the unknown.

913
01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:45.360
Richelle Direny: But once we start becoming more and having better understanding then kind of decreases our enzyme

914
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:58.410
Richelle Direny: Right. Well, you can always send me a message if you, um, you know, if you can't make group or or individually. Just send me a message and say, hey, we're shall I won't be able to make it because this is the situation.

915
01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:02.700
Patrick S: Okay, I'll do that. Okay.

916
01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:05.730
Richelle Direny: All right then, Patrick. So I'll see you next week for group.

917
01:43:07.770 --> 01:43:08.910
Patrick S: Will time on the eighth

918
01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.230
Richelle Direny: Six o'clock. I'll send you a reminder, like I did yesterday.

919
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:15.810
Patrick S: Alright, cool.

920
01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.610
Richelle Direny: Alright, man. Have a good evening.

921
01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:20.490
Patrick S: BYE BYE. I'LL SEE YOU.

922
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:21.990
Richelle Direny: All right.
