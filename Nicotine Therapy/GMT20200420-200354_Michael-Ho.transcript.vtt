Michael Hoefer: And we have about 30 or 40 minutes today we'll be talking about your opiate use but also your medical and psychiatric history, and then we'll come up with a plan together after that.

17
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.230
Suzanne malos: Okay. Sounds good.

18
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.330
Michael Hoefer: Great. So if we could start. I just like to hear how you heard about bright heart health.

19
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.510
Suzanne malos: Okay. A friend of mine got in the program. And he know be easier to and told me all about it.

20
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.880
Suzanne malos: And then another girlfriend of mine join to

21
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.210
Michael Hoefer: Oh, great. So you've got some social supports that are also involved in our program.

22
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.390
Michael Hoefer: I do. Excellent. Okay. Well, um, let's start by you telling me what's bringing you into treatment today and how we can be helpful.

23
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:09.660
Suzanne malos: Let's see. I've been a user not opiate user but user since I was about 11 years old and straight through. Always use something I had about two years clean but started chipping with pills and

24
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:23.460
Suzanne malos: Other things. And so I did get my drug and alcohol license. When I was clean for a minute. And I just want to quit using drugs to run my life.

25
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.890
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Oh.

26
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.180
Suzanne malos: I don't want to die on opiates. It's my, my family doesn't like it.

27
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.340
Suzanne malos: I like it somewhat, but I'm not. I'm more motivated to not use it now.

28
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.600
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha, gotcha.

29
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.910
Suzanne malos: Makes sense. I want to be honest, as I can so

30
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.920
Michael Hoefer: Oh yes, I appreciate that. And it's very, it's, it's very common to feel ambivalent about, you know, the use, there are things that you like about the things you really don't like about it and there's

31
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.010
Michael Hoefer: Like important to be

32
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.290
Michael Hoefer: Honest about. Yeah.

33
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.370
Suzanne malos: I have

34
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.270
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, I'm

35
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.340
Suzanne malos: Sorry, I have been on Suboxone before. I've been in a program with it and it worked well for me.

36
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.210
Okay.

37
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.180
Suzanne malos: Why didn't it work, it did. I

38
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.360
Michael Hoefer: The audio went away for

39
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.470
Suzanne malos: There we go.

40
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.960
Suzanne malos: Okay, my husband and

41
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.990
Suzanne malos: He had recently died, and after I got in the program and so

42
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.220
Suzanne malos: I don't know, I just, it wasn't enough for me. Does that make sense.

43
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.110
Suzanne malos: Yeah yeah yeah

44
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.320
Michael Hoefer: And that's a that's obviously a huge stressor that can make things hard, especially in early recovery.

45
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.130
Suzanne malos: Yeah.

46
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.240
Suzanne malos: It was hard.

47
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.830
Suzanne malos: Yeah, Liz.

48
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.190
Michael Hoefer: So can you tell me you know when were you. How old were you the first time you ever used an opiate

49
00:04:51.300 --> 00:05:03.960
Suzanne malos: And first time I ever used an opiate I was probably 12 with coding cough syrup, but I'm pills. I never use heroin actual heroin until I was just about six years ago.

50
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.080
Suzanne malos: Okay, seven I tried it a couple times.

51
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.540
Suzanne malos: Never thought nothing of it, and then

52
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.070
Suzanne malos: It was about a year before gave died that I got into it.

53
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:25.290
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Okay. And did you ever and up until six years ago. Did you ever feel like you had an opiate problem, or was it really just in the last six years that you felt like you had an opiate addiction.

54
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.870
Suzanne malos: And it was actually probably in the Ansari my grandson.

55
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.220
Michael Hoefer: Oh, that's okay.

56
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.120
Suzanne malos: Thank you. Okay. Sorry about that, and probably more in the last six years, it was more always speed with me.

57
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.950
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha.

58
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.670
Yeah.

59
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.710
Michael Hoefer: And, um, you know, right, you know, in the last few days and weeks, are you using opiates daily

60
00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:02.430
Suzanne malos: And actually, I wasn't, I had been awesome and was in withdraw and I went to the hospital and had an abscess. I got poked by tree branch and had surgery.

61
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.350
Suzanne malos: Okay, there

62
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.840
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, they have a pack there. Yeah.

63
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:17.790
Suzanne malos: Yeah, it's a straw thingy hanging out a drain. He's going to remove it, but all they gave me opiates the whole time I was in there. And then when I got out, I got a few pain pills.

64
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.920
Suzanne malos: And I needed but otherwise.

65
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.690
Suzanne malos: Nothing. I've been really good.

66
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.370
Michael Hoefer: Great. Well,

67
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.200
Michael Hoefer: LAST TIME YOU USED ANY HEROIN

68
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.450
Suzanne malos: That's time I USE ANY HEROIN was when this abscess first started to that was at least

69
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.550
Suzanne malos: 10 days ago.

70
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.350
Suzanne malos: GREAT DAYS AGO MAYBE

71
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.580

Michael Hoefer: And and that's great. And when was. And when you use how parallel. And how do you use it.

73
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.600
Suzanne malos: Normally idea.

74
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.380

Michael Hoefer: Yeah, you are your veins. How are your veins.

78
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.800
They're

79
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.450
Suzanne malos: Horrible.

80
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.320
Michael Hoefer: Okay, and I

81
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.650
Suzanne malos: I mean, I could hit. If I wanted to, I just don't, it's not

82
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:06.030
Suzanne malos: I'm not one of those. I don't know. I can't explain it and to muscle it's easier for me, I guess, to be honest, because I was doing speed and I wanted to have a vein through speed.

83
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.170
Michael Hoefer: I see.

84
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.910
Michael Hoefer: Guys. Yeah, okay.

85
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.600
Michael Hoefer: I'm appreciating the honesty. This is a real great

86
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.800
Suzanne malos: No problem.

87
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.860
Michael Hoefer: And when you muscle. What do you usually do it in your legs, your arms or

88
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.310
Suzanne malos: Where did my arm and my hip usually yeah

89
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:31.050
Michael Hoefer: And we talked about apps us a little bit. Do you have any other infections from injection do Pepsi or HIV or anything like that.

90
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:45.150
Suzanne malos: I was diagnosed with Pepsi when my daughter, my youngest daughter was born, and I didn't have it when my youngest son took 15 months window there after that I'd been tested and it has disappeared.

91
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.700
Michael Hoefer: Oh wow you fought it off.

92
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.390
Suzanne malos: I did fight it out. I have a pretty good immune system when it comes

93
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.530
Suzanne malos: To that, but I don't

94
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.340
Suzanne malos: Think that I'm out of the clear. But yes, I did fight it off.

95
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.780
Michael Hoefer: Okay, excellent.

96
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.380
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. And have you had any overdoses on opiates ever where you needed Narcan

97
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.260
Suzanne malos: And never in our cans. But yeah, they've had to walk me and I knew I'd done too much. A few times. Yes.

98
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.750
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Okay. And any legal issues from your opiate use

99
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.390
Michael Hoefer: Now, no. Okay, that's good.

100
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:25.440
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and what kind of problems, you know, generally, would you say opiate uses OB uses caused in your life.

101
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:39.870
Suzanne malos: And my daughter is been clean since she gave birth to her son, which was 14 years ago off of speed and I live with her and she doesn't want me using knows that I do. And she's been very tolerant, I want to do the right thing.

102
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.790
Suzanne malos: And

103
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.640
Michael Hoefer: Whether it was put strain on relationships.

104
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.560
Michael Hoefer: So yeah, we're really close to you.

105
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:55.020
Suzanne malos: Oh yeah, and they worry and my brother, does it. My mom has Alzheimer's, my brother doesn't want me to be hanging out unless I'm clean

106
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.520
Suzanne malos: In recovery.

107
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.890
Suzanne malos: So family, more than anything.

108
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.570
Michael Hoefer: Families when the big one. Yeah.

109
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:09.180
Michael Hoefer: Um, and has it aside from the abscess. Have you had other physical or psychological effects from your op is

110
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.210
Suzanne malos: I've had quite a few abscesses and

111
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.910
Suzanne malos: It's always I'm pretty open, honest person, but when it comes to my family. It's kind of a dark shameful thing.

112
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.440
Suzanne malos: Yeah, I didn't. I don't know if I'm

113
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.240
Suzanne malos: You know how drugs mask everything I'm depressed a lot

114
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.480
Suzanne malos: I've huge anger issues.

115
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.710
And

116
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:43.980
Suzanne malos: I get panicked that that was I was diagnosed with that years ago, though. So I don't think that opiate use has caused that

117
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.190
Suzanne malos: That's No, go ahead.

118
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.770
Michael Hoefer: You were diagnosed with panic disorder.

119
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.510
Michael Hoefer: Or yeah, yeah. Okay.

120
00:09:52.290 --> 00:10:03.750
Suzanne malos: I gotta say one thing. My daughter said not too long ago because we were living in a small town. We recently moved to reading, we were living in Crescent City and my daughter said everyone knows you're an IV drug user mom and that hurt me.

121
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.730
Suzanne malos: Um, yeah.

122
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.660
Suzanne malos: It hurt me.

123
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.130
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, that's a really hard thing to hear

124
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.670
Suzanne malos: Because it affects them. That is why, yeah.

125
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.790
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, because of the stigma and yeah

126
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:29.010
Michael Hoefer: Yeah yeah yeah that's really, that's a really tough one. And, and also sounds like it's, it's something that's motivating for you to want to take

127
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.300
Suzanne malos: A beating. No one asked me to come here. I really want to change.

128
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:43.710
Suzanne malos: I want to get a job. And I want to just, I don't know. I'm tired of living my life like this all the time. My mom when my mom dies. I'm going to inherit money and

129
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.170
Suzanne malos: I don't want to spend it in my arms.

130
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.120
Suzanne malos: Yeah, you know,

131
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.760
Michael Hoefer: Yeah yeah there's much more

132
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:57.930
Michael Hoefer: Positive things and things that you can use it on for your family for your grandkids for yourself. There's

133
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.330
Suzanne malos: Right. Yeah. You're right.

134
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.560
Yeah.

135
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.290
Michael Hoefer: Okay and I in the past what when you tried to stop.

136
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.730
Michael Hoefer: Opiates before on your own. How, how has it been, and how's it gone

137
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.110
Suzanne malos: I did it once with this box. And like I said that lasted

138
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.850
Suzanne malos: It took me till I stopped in the program to get a clean test so

139
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.860
Suzanne malos: I don't think I ever stopped.

140
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.100
Suzanne malos: It hasn't been. I mean, this time in the last two weeks has been the most since I've come back to reading

141
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.410
Suzanne malos: It's been the most I've had clean time

142
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.750
Suzanne malos: And I've only started out one time and that was when the abscess formed and I went and sought it out.

143
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.430
Suzanne malos: Otherwise, I don't have hookups here or anything. So that's a good thing.

144
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.380
Michael Hoefer: That is good. Yeah.

145
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.830
Michael Hoefer: Make it inconvenient as possible. Yeah.

146
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.000
Suzanne malos: That's, yeah.

147
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.680
Michael Hoefer: That's a smart approach.

148
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:56.430
Michael Hoefer: Um, okay. And aside from the Opiates are you using any other substances these days.

149
00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:02.760
Suzanne malos: And I got dead medication. The doctor prescribed me Narcos which are like Tic Tac To me, but

150
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.120

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.360
Michael Hoefer: That is good. Well, so

164
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.830
Suzanne malos: That was pretty good.

165
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.470
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And the last one you took was when

166
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.080
Suzanne malos: Last one. I took was, I have a hard time sleeping with yesterday afternoon.

167
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.010
Michael Hoefer: Okay, that's fine. One Norco yesterday afternoon or two.

168
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.210
Suzanne malos: To yeah

169
00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:03.570
Michael Hoefer: Okay, no problem. Um, and then are you using anything else these days, like any meth or cocaine or marijuana or alcohol or anything like that.

170
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.420
Suzanne malos: Math sporadically but not really like I used to use it just, I woke up and used

171
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.420
Suzanne malos: Okay, well, it's been no I haven't been using it.

172
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:18.630
Michael Hoefer: Okay, great. And is that like once a week or once a month or on average, what would you say

173
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.310
Suzanne malos: Couple times a week.

174
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.180
Michael Hoefer: Couple times

175
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:29.370
Suzanne malos: Already since this abscess. I haven't been I smoked. I think once a day or two ago. And that's about it.

176
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:38.280
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Okay. Um, and do you have math connections and reading or do you have math still in your house or anything like that.

177
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.200
Suzanne malos: Nope. I don't actually

178
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.730
Suzanne malos: A friend of mine came by and had some and that's how I got some. But no, I don't.

179
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.840
Suzanne malos: Have connections here.

180
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.540
Suzanne malos: I don't even know people here really so

181
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.340
Suzanne malos: Few people

182
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.280
Michael Hoefer: So this is a new start.

183
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.390
Suzanne malos: Yeah, it is.

184
00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:01.980
Suzanne malos: But I know you can drop a drug addict in the middle of the jungle and they'll land in the drug dealers house so

185
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:10.680
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, this the whole thing of kind of the geographic cure and the, you know, it goes back and forth, but I think it's like the thing of like

186
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:21.420
Michael Hoefer: You know nothing changes nothing changes. Right. So go to a new place. And then you also do a lot of work on changing other things, and that can be helpful.

187
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.200
Suzanne malos: That

188
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:30.900
Michael Hoefer: The time it's problematic is if you go to a new place, and don't do anything different, and expect a different response you know outcome. And that's where people, I think, get in trouble.

189
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:40.710
Suzanne malos: You know, the funny thing is, I have been doing a lot of things different. And I mean there's a lot of old behaviors stick but i know i mean like I said, I became an addiction specialist and

190
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:50.670
Suzanne malos: Almost. You know how they say you get too smart for the program. I don't think I'm too smart for it, but I know that it's me. That has to do it, isn't it, no one else can do it for me.

191
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:56.100
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, so you get your did you do like the Kodak or the addiction counselor degree or. Wouldn't you do

192
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:02.160
Suzanne malos: I did the addiction count addiction specialist one certificate and took me two years in

193
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.100
Suzanne malos: And community college

194
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.020
Suzanne malos: And got my MBA and then yeah I signed up with a deck.

195
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.670
Michael Hoefer: That's cool.

196
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.160
Suzanne malos: Yeah, I'm excited about it. So you

197
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:21.570
Michael Hoefer: Know, just talking to you. You have you have a lot of wisdom and knowledge and know a lot of this stuff. So that's really good.

198
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.360
Suzanne malos: Thank you. It didn't keep me clean. No, I'm hoping something else. Well, I think my motivation. Well,

199
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.170
Suzanne malos: Yeah.

200
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.250
Michael Hoefer: I'm did you actually as an addiction counselor for a while. I mean, did you

201
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.450
Suzanne malos: I did.

202
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.790
Suzanne malos: I did and it depress me so I didn't get a wait to go back to that field that

203
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.350
Suzanne malos: Really, I think it's

204
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:50.520
Suzanne malos: I don't know. Hearing people's stories makes I. The reason I get it was i'll tell you why I did it because since I was a little girl, people have been telling me their secrets.

205
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.090
Suzanne malos: And I just thought it would be a good thing for me and

206
00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:01.380
Suzanne malos: You know it hasn't been the best, but that doesn't mean it will change. I have aspirations to do something with children so

207
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:01.890
Michael Hoefer: So,

208
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.170
Suzanne malos: Hopefully. Maybe that'll be different. Yeah.

209
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:10.020
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, great. Um, any alcohol use, or benzodiazepine use

210
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:25.920
Suzanne malos: I take Xanax, usually on a regular basis, but I haven't had a regular doctor and that's not. I mean, I don't take them every day but I take them if I need them every day, cuz I have bad panic attacks and then I take them one at night, usually

211
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.980
Michael Hoefer: And no alcohol. So, have you had any of that.

212
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:36.930
Suzanne malos: I have actually the doctor in the hospital. They checked on my all my records and gave me some dynamics. So

213
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.740
Yes, I

214
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.530
Suzanne malos: Yeah, I have a couple. Yeah.

215
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.720
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. All right.

216
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.970
Suzanne malos: I'm in no alcohol my

217
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.410
Suzanne malos: Parents, I just

218
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.420
Suzanne malos: Don't do alcohol, maybe once a year. I'll have a glass of wine or something.

219
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.680
Michael Hoefer: You're experienced them was with them was enough to avoid alcohol.

220
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.980
Suzanne malos: Yeah. Yeah, they were functioning alcoholics that they fought a lot. It was just, I don't like alcohol.

221
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.730
Suzanne malos: Yeah.

222
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.260
Michael Hoefer: I gotcha. Not for me now us tobacco.

223
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.450
Michael Hoefer: Do you smoke and bad though I know

224
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.760
Michael Hoefer: Okay, how much would you say

225
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:18.660
Suzanne malos: I'd gone down. It was about a pack a day, and I've gone down to maybe a half to three quarters. Okay.

226
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.530
Suzanne malos: Gotcha. My daughter makes me smoke outside and everything else. So

227
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.470
Suzanne malos: I'm thinking about buying one of those

228
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.740
Suzanne malos: E cigarettes. I like them. So it's cheaper. Yeah.

229
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:36.000
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, it's cheaper and it's and it's like we don't have all the data yet. But it's likely. I'm very likely healthier than

230
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.750
Michael Hoefer: writing something on fire. And then, so yeah.

231
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.820
Suzanne malos: I think so, too, and no tobacco. So that's good. You know what I mean. Yeah.

232
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:53.340
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, you can do the ones that are just flavored with no you know nicotine or you can decrease. You can change the levels of nicotine, just depending on how you want to do it, you know.

233
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.020
Michael Hoefer: So you can connect

234
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.480
Michael Hoefer: With that was helping play with that like that. Yeah.

235
00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.880
Michael Hoefer: Okay, great.

236
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.410
Suzanne malos: Yeah, that's, that's what I'm hoping.

237
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:10.500
Michael Hoefer: Great. Go ahead. Um, okay, so you know history. Have you seen. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist in the past.

238
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:11.880
Suzanne malos: Or accounts.

239
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:12.600
Yeah.

240
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:26.730
Suzanne malos: Yeah, I saw one as a kid I licensed psychologist named Mallory Lynch and Alan Oregon saw him for a couple years. And then on and off. I've been to mental health and referred to mental health.

241
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.180
Poker.

242
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:38.580
Suzanne malos: saw Dr chauffeur and Crescent City, California for a little while and then just recently when I was on the Suboxone program. But Dr they're referred me to a psychiatrist, so

243
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:46.650
Michael Hoefer: And it's and the things that you mentioned earlier where, you know, depression, anxiety, panic where those the main things you you have been working on.

244
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.410
Suzanne malos: Yeah, my thinking is a little off too. But I don't know how much

245
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.130
Suzanne malos: Okay.

246
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.080
Michael Hoefer: What do you mean, if you

247
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.980
Suzanne malos: Sometimes I can be paranoid. I guess people would say,

248
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.600
Suzanne malos: I think people are sometimes I don't know.

249
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.710
Suzanne malos: They're together in on things. Does that make sense.

250
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.480
Michael Hoefer: Yeah yeah

251
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:21.390
Michael Hoefer: Like people are hiring against you or is it mostly like planning to do or watching you without you knowing or what, what do you think

252
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:36.390
Suzanne malos: I'll tell you what I think I when I was 2122 23 my kids were very young and I ran from a cult down a mountain. And I think I got met to do psychosis at that time.

253
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:45.090
Suzanne malos: And it was scary. And I don't know. It's been almost 25 years now. I mean I it affected me

254
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.410
Michael Hoefer: Sure bad

255
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.330
Suzanne malos: Yeah, that's me. Yeah, I've gotten better through the years, but it did affect me bad

256
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.400
Suzanne malos: Yeah, it was scared.

257
00:19:53.910 --> 00:20:06.660
Michael Hoefer: That's, yeah, they're fine and did so with that experience do you have like a. Do you have a history of trauma like either as a child or a young person of physical abuse or sexual abuse or things like that.

258
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.930
Michael Hoefer: Or emotional abuse. Okay.

259
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:23.700
Suzanne malos: Well, man. Man, my parents thought that they were great parents, they love me. I grew up grade I had everything. No, it was that experience with the first thing I ever knew about anything evil, I guess.

260
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.740
Michael Hoefer: And how long were you with that you said cold. How long were you with that for

261
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:37.830
Suzanne malos: I wasn't with them at all. They tried to kidnap my kids didn't take me. I was up at a fourth of july event that someone had invited me to

262
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.270
Michael Hoefer: So, um,

263
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:40.860
Suzanne malos: Yeah.

264
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.630
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, it was.

265
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.000
Michael Hoefer: Up so you got out of there with your children.

266
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.760
Michael Hoefer: You escaped. I got out of there with my

267
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:57.870
Suzanne malos: Children. Gotcha. Yes, I did. I wound up. They didn't take my kids and put them in CPS. I mean, it's a long story, but they did put me in the psych ward for the weekend and

268
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:07.860
Suzanne malos: gave my kids, my mom. And then I got him back. But yeah, it was, you know, people thought I was crazy for a long time until it happened to someone else. So

269
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:09.660
Suzanne malos: We can

270
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.980
Michael Hoefer: Talk about that sometime

271
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.240
Michael Hoefer: Oh yeah, sure.

272
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.520
Michael Hoefer: And do so in patients.

276
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:31.110

Suzanne malos: I get way too many kills. Okay. This was about a year ago.

279
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.700
Suzanne malos: And I just took a bunch of pills and

280
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.230
Michael Hoefer: Go ahead and do you think that you were trying to end your life or was it more like I don't really care what happens, I just

281
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.490
Michael Hoefer: I'm just gonna take all of these

282
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:05.550
Suzanne malos: I was in a panic disorder. Right. Then I was having panic attack. I was freaking out and I didn't care. I was depressed and I just said. I mean, you're gonna live or die and I took him. Okay.

283
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.100

Michael Hoefer: Please continue. I was

288
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:28.560
Suzanne malos: Just gonna say I've had the thoughts of crossed my mind and but I don't have a plan. I'd haven't acted. You know what you're really on. It's not something I do. But I thought, you know, I just want to step out in front of a semi

289
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:29.850
And

290
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.580

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.140
Michael Hoefer: Sure, yeah.

292
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.760
Suzanne malos: You know, that's about the suicide. I know.

293
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:49.290
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. Well, no, that's that's helpful for us to know and I think it'll be certainly something we can monitor and also, you know, our first

294
00:22:49.680 --> 00:23:01.110
Michael Hoefer: Step will be trying to get a new start on Suboxone and get you stabilize there but you know after we do that, we also can start to look at, you know, your mood and your anxiety and making sure those things are addressed as well.

295
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.580
Michael Hoefer: So,

296
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:10.410
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah. Um, any history of kind of jail or prison or extensive legal issues.

297
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.420
Suzanne malos: And I was locked up a lot as a juvenile um

298
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:22.080
Suzanne malos: Well, not a lot. They made me a legal adult 15 but from probably 11 to

299
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:31.530
Suzanne malos: 15 I was locked up a lot. Then, and I've done like not a lot of adults y'all time maybe at the most 60 days.

300
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.330
Suzanne malos: Okay, gotcha.

301
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.330
Michael Hoefer: And any correlation or people in my life.

302
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.160
Michael Hoefer: No.

303
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.320
Michael Hoefer: Okay, no. Okay, no.

304
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.130
Suzanne malos: I bench probation for a

305
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.050
Suzanne malos: Syringe

306
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.530
Suzanne malos: And a dragon has been suspended. That's it.

307
00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:04.140
Michael Hoefer: And with the paranoia. Do you find it all that it doesn't seem related to the meth use at all. Like if you use math, will it get more if you stop using will get better. Does it do they are those things associated at all.

308
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:11.820
Suzanne malos: When I was younger, but not now, now, now I can kind of sit back and separate what's real and what's not.

309
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:12.780
Michael Hoefer: Okay, kinda.

310
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.410
Suzanne malos: Gotcha.

311
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.820
Michael Hoefer: And, you know, yeah, I know.

312
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.430
Michael Hoefer: It won't be like the math makes it whether you're better

313
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:18.900
Michael Hoefer: Than

314
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:19.680
Suzanne malos: No, that's

315
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.450
Michael Hoefer: A good one. It work whether or not

316
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.080
Suzanne malos: Oh no, to same whether I'm using or not.

317
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.090
Suzanne malos: It just

318
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.160
Suzanne malos: depends on the circumstance one

319
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.720
Michael Hoefer: I saw had

320
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.550
Michael Hoefer: Like if you feel safe or

321
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.080
Michael Hoefer: Absolutely trusted

322
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:41.070
Suzanne malos: Correct. And I think also, I can't say that because you know what I use every day.

323
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:51.510
Suzanne malos: Up until recently. So, you know, it could I, but I still have it since I haven't been using. So, and I still had it that two years, but I had clean

324
00:24:53.700 --> 00:25:01.560
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, so the math sub there is something I don't know if you have it. There is something called like, you know, chronic map psychosis, you know, and that can

325
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:09.210
Michael Hoefer: So that can last part, you know, months to a long time after stopping or it can be kind of permanent but usually

326
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:20.100
Michael Hoefer: It's helpful to know like you know if periods that even if it doesn't go away like periods where you're using a lot of math versus periods where you're not using math. Does it change the intensity of it, you know.

327
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.130
Michael Hoefer: That's something that's useful to kind of track.

328
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.980
Suzanne malos: Maybe the intensity

329
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.880
Suzanne malos: Okay, not necessarily situation, but the intensity maybe yes

330
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:42.750
Michael Hoefer: Okay, good. Okay. Um, and then we talked a little bit about the medication Xanax earlier. Do you have a history of any other psychiatric meds. You've been prescribed, especially ones that you feel are helpful.

331
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.450
Suzanne malos: Abilify didn't do it was helpful. Um, let's see here.

332
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:57.750
Suzanne malos: There's been semi forgotten the name of one started with an S not Cymbalta. It's a little stronger.

333
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:59.490
Suzanne malos: And

334
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.270
Suzanne malos: Circling

335
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.970
Suzanne malos: Not Seroquel. Say that again.

336
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:03.990
Circling

337
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.290
Suzanne malos: No, no, I'm

338
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.260
Suzanne malos: I think Paxil

339
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.660
Suzanne malos: What's the L one not LeBron um

340
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.940
Suzanne malos: I forget the name of that to um

341
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.300
Suzanne malos: Let's see, what else there's been

342
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.790
Suzanne malos: Good. I wish I could I have it written down somewhere. I'll find them.

343
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.140
Michael Hoefer: Okay, cool.

344
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.970
Suzanne malos: I can't think right now I'm

345
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.640
Suzanne malos: Lots of different you know what they never tried me on now.

346
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.770
Michael Hoefer: Well, it's Prozac. Oh.

347
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.340
Suzanne malos: Ever

348
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.300
Suzanne malos: Which I thought was strange. No, um,

349
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.780
Michael Hoefer: Has anybody ever diagnosed bipolar.

350
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.040
Or schizophrenia.

351
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.670
Suzanne malos: Back then it was manic depressive

352
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.770
Michael Hoefer: Okay, people

353
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.600
Michael Hoefer: people diagnosed with that I've been told.

354
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:13.080
Suzanne malos: I have extreme highs and extreme lows and I know this. I'm shoplifting. It's a bad thing with me i if i Maliki I didn't did shoplift

355
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.160
Michael Hoefer: Okay, yeah, that that's that can get in trouble.

356
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.240
Suzanne malos: We didn't know about a person

357
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:31.050
Michael Hoefer: Periods to where you can go you know days without sleep and not have it be a problem and that would probably be most useful when you work using math like

358
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.730
Michael Hoefer: You know periods. We aren't using math and you can

359
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.570
Michael Hoefer: Go to sleep and you feel like you have lots of energy and you feel like

360
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:45.090
Suzanne malos: You can all that's when I'm usually manatee. Yeah, that's when I'm usually wanting to gamble or wanting to go steal

361
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:52.590
Suzanne malos: Things like that. Okay. And then if I'm depressed. I'm in bed. The thing about my depression is though I have a hard time sleeping, no matter what.

362
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.310
Michael Hoefer: So whether you're manic your depression. Your leap.

363
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.390
Michael Hoefer: Is a big issue for you.

364
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:04.770
Suzanne malos: I, yeah, I just lay in the bed. Instead, or Sam sick, you know, something like that.

365
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.050
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever been prescribed. I hate

366
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:08.970
Michael Hoefer: Oh,

367
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.690
Michael Hoefer: I'm sorry, I'm almost done to to move on to happier stuff here.

368
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.310
Suzanne malos: I just

369
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:15.780
Michael Hoefer: Have I

370
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.560
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever been prescribed lithium or Depakote before

371
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.080
Suzanne malos: Neither one I was asked that on my intake. No, no, I haven't.

372
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:25.710
Suzanne malos: Yeah.

373
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:43.230
Suzanne malos: In fact, a friend of mine told me that had a bad meth addiction told me that he had been diagnosed with some he had been prescribed lithium. I mean, and he said, It's a miracle drug, you have to try it. This was years ago and I never ever tried it. So it's strange, but yeah.

374
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.760
Michael Hoefer: I have you ever been on

375
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:52.050
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever been on a La Raza known or latika or Sarah Quill or La Mota gene or any of those medications.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.620
Suzanne malos: Seroquel Sarah. Sarah and

377
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.330
Suzanne malos: There's another one too. I just remembered and they use it for putting smoking now they want. They say they do, it's

378
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.060
Michael Hoefer: Like that. I hate it.

379
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.290
Michael Hoefer: Will be

380
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.260
Suzanne malos: Future and and it's horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.

381
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.160
Michael Hoefer: It made you like chocolate. Chocolate since like

382
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.880
Suzanne malos: Yeah, through my body like every like 1520 minutes. It's horrible.

383
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.770
Michael Hoefer: Know, geez. Okay.

384
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:23.640
Yeah.

385
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:33.360
Michael Hoefer: Um, any history of like hearing voices. Other people can't hear or seeing things other people can't see when you're not using math.

386
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.530
Suzanne malos: That I couldn't answer honestly because I missed so much and not yeah maybe that

387
00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:51.780
Suzanne malos: You. Yeah. Because, I mean, it was scary. What went, what happened to me. So I'm always seeing stuff like that. I don't know. It was

388
00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:03.600
Suzanne malos: Yeah, it was a surprise. You know what I mean, he didn't expect it and it just, it was scary. Yeah, I do still see stuff like that are here things. Okay.

389
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:14.430
Michael Hoefer: I'm switching topics a little bit on any medical issues that you have that we should know about. We talked about the abscess, but any, any other medical issues you have

390
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:23.910
Suzanne malos: And my eyes are poor. I'm getting my mentors. Okay. And my ears are poor, but otherwise. No, not really.

391
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:32.340
Michael Hoefer: Okay, do you take any other medications right now, other than the Norco and Xanax or other supplements, we should know but

392
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:50.490
Suzanne malos: Usually I'm prescribed Gabba Pittman, because I have, I forgot about my shoulder impingement. I have a shoulder impingement in my right shoulder. That makes it can't be fixed with surgery. I was getting like 180 more tabs for him and I stopped that like

393
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:57.810
Suzanne malos: Eight years ago and didn't do that. And then it hurts me so the Gabba pittances help

394
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.420
Michael Hoefer: And what does he have repented. Do you take

395
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:09.420
Suzanne malos: Their six or eight their white oblong tablets. I believe they're eight. Maybe they're sick. I'm not sure.

396
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:11.760
Michael Hoefer: And how many do you take a day when I

397
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.800
Michael Hoefer: Three. Okay, one with each meal, basically.

398
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:27.180
Suzanne malos: One to two, three, it says my things that one, two to three times a day. And yeah, that morning, noon and night if and that's if I need it. Gotcha.

399
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.760
Suzanne malos: And then I also thought bad

400
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.200
Suzanne malos: Oh, go ahead.

401
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.030
Michael Hoefer: Do you have that

402
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:43.200
Suzanne malos: I don't, I wish I did. But the doctor gave it to me when I was in the hospital, but I don't have a new doctor yet so I'm stressing out about that too. So

403
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.060
Suzanne malos: Don't

404
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.600
Michael Hoefer: Go ahead.

479
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:54.630

480
00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:04.590
Suzanne malos: I usually clean houses. I do it on my own. Right now, I'm just to incur my grandkids when my daughters at work and she helps me great

481
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:17.640
Michael Hoefer: Great. Okay. And then family history anybody in your family ever been diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder. Anybody in the family diagnosed with those

Suzanne malos: I'm adopted.

483
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.470
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. So

484
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.940
So on the outer

485
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.570
Suzanne malos: Okay, no one in my adopted family now.

486
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.550
Suzanne malos: And my kids know yeah

487
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.020
Michael Hoefer: They're all doing fine that not they've never been to a psychiatric hospital or

488
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:41.640
Suzanne malos: Anything like that. No, my grandson has been diagnosed with um I think both my grandkids and my son have ADHD.

489
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.050
Michael Hoefer: ADHD and

490
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:54.300
Suzanne malos: Yeah, and they case, it goes to a special school, he's my grandson for. It's called the Excel Academy and actually it's great for him tailor made, but he has anger issues so

491
00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:12.090
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. Um, alright, well those are the the main questions. I need to ask for the intake. I appreciate you answering them. So, uh, honestly. And also is there anything that I important that I left out, or I missed that you think we should no

492
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.010
Suzanne malos: Not right now. Okay. And I'm sure they've had 10

493
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:34.410
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. Yes. I'm sure that, yeah, we'll have, you know, lots of other opportunities to to talk about things. So, um, so as far as a plan. I mean, I think, you know, it's very clear you have, I guess what we call an opioid use disorder, which is, you know, medical terms for opiate addiction.

494
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:39.480
Michael Hoefer: It's good to know that you bet on Suboxone in the past and that you found it helpful.

495
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.280
Suzanne malos: And I have

496
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.570
Michael Hoefer: And so I think you'd be a really good candidate to restart it. Um,

497
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:54.420
Michael Hoefer: What we can do is once we're done talking, I can just put in a electronic prescription to your local pharmacy. You can go pick it up, um,

498
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.290
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Are you having any withdrawal symptoms right now, or how are you feeling

499
00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:08.520
Suzanne malos: And last night I had the legs. I started with the sneezing and, you know, and so I just stayed away from the opiates today because I knew we are appointment. I'd rather train smarter than

500
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:16.350
Michael Hoefer: That kills graph. So yeah, so you sounds like you already know this. The only thing you know Suboxone is a really

501
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:32.580
Michael Hoefer: safe and well tolerated medication. The only thing that is somewhat tricky about it is that first dose, you take, you got to make sure you're in, you haven't had any other opiates for a period of time and you're in mild to moderate withdrawal. So when you take a bath you know better.

502
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.080
Suzanne malos: Um, yeah, I don't, I don't want to go into present day withdrawal. I know that so

503
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.290
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. Have you ever had that in the past precipitated withdrawal.

504
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:47.580
Suzanne malos: No. Actually, actually, when I started this boxing program last time I only had six hours off heroin and

505
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.680
Michael Hoefer: And we find it.

506
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:50.700
Suzanne malos: Okay.

507
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:58.830
Michael Hoefer: Cool. Yeah. So yeah, so to Narcos yesterday should be totally fine to pick up the medication today and start it you know as soon as

508
00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.340
Michael Hoefer: You can

509
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.530
Suzanne malos: You recommend is for the

510
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:06.870
Michael Hoefer: Four hours just take them in four milligram increments. So half a tablet, you know,

511
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:17.790
Michael Hoefer: Just take it and you can take four milligrams every couple hours till you feel okay and you can take up to 60 milligrams a day okay um

512
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:22.470
Michael Hoefer: I needed to take much it, you don't need that much take less. It's up to you.

513
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:29.340
Suzanne malos: That's what I was taking on the program before I was in it for like I think six months.

514
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:39.030
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. And that's some and based on this our interview here I can give you a week supply of the medication at 60 milligrams a day.

515
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.780
Michael Hoefer: And then what will happen next is one of our lawyers will call you.

516
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:50.520
Michael Hoefer: Today, probably tomorrow or the next day and talk to you about getting you involved in our groups and our continuity things and they'll have

517
00:40:50.700 --> 00:41:00.540
Michael Hoefer: The program has groups via this video and also there's drug screens about once a month and then there's other kind of scales and things you fill out and we try to help with the

518
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:07.230
Michael Hoefer: Suboxone but also teaching kind of coping skills and ways to address other you know co occurring psychiatric issues.
