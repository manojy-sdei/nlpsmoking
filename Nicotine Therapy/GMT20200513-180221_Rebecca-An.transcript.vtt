00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.560
Dawn Ninham: Hello.

2
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.700
Dawn Ninham: Hi. Hi. Let me turn you up when

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:25.590
Dawn Ninham: I finally figured out to turn that my TV. My PS4 off and then he went fix the router box down there. And hopefully, nobody else was on Wi Fi. So I guess perfect single right here.

4
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.570
Dawn Ninham: Yay. Yeah.

5
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.760
You've been building. Yeah.

6
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.220
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I've been busy. I'm actually I've had a lot more like my natural anxieties coming back.

7
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.200
Dawn Ninham: Which sucks. Most of all, because I'm like that that shit sucks. You know, I mean, just a feeling of like Thomas smoking weed and I can say, okay, wait, I guess, through the EOD program.

9
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about what about through the DHS program.

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.520
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, they said it's not a problem.

11
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right. Good, good, good.

12
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you want to

13
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Comply no matter what anybody else says you want to comply with whatever they tell you to do you know what I mean, because they're the one that's holding all the cards right now.

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.890
Dawn Ninham: Right, exactly. All the kids.

15
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The whole nother cutter holding all the cards right

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.320
Dawn Ninham: Right and

17
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I so

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.310
Dawn Ninham: I've been doing my workbook and I did.

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:33.270
Dawn Ninham: It. So there's a lot of reading. So, um, so I did chapter one, which I'm the new life diary. But I want to skip to like self imaging, you know, and do that one because I think that's, that would be my first people first thing is how I see myself.

20
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what chapter is at

21
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.320
Dawn Ninham: Chapter

22
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.410
Dawn Ninham: Five or six level five

23
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a reason why they're the books are created the way that they are. And so you want to follow suit and go through it step by step. You know what I mean.

25
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

26
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.230
Dawn Ninham: I was thinking if I did it now and then did it again, you know, later on when I get to number the number five or whatever I want to see.

27
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.030
Prince, there was hope.

28
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right.

29
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That sounds like

30
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fun. Yeah.

31
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.640
Yeah.

32
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely so out of the first chapter, you did the first chapter, or you read the first chapter.

33
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.020
Dawn Ninham: Oh, I read. It's like a huge long theme. And then you get to the, like, um, it says New Life diary statement one

34
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.450
Dawn Ninham: And then it says the exercise. Just to note that the last three years.

35
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.570
Dawn Ninham: Have been happy and unhappy under the input. So I put. I don't think I ever had a happy time. You don't mean like I was miserable throughout the whole thing. So like I'm I am happy is once over

36
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you get like

37
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

38
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go ahead. No, go ahead. What were you gonna say every time you happy.

39
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.190
Dawn Ninham: When I'm happy. Everybody else maybe maybe I'm sucking the energy out of them. When I walk into a room, I don't know, but I I have like

40
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.430
Dawn Ninham: Natural you know like positive energy, but it seems like the people that around me aren't happy.

41
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

42
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.250
Dawn Ninham: Well, that's

43
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:25.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, well, because we can't change anybody else. Right. It's about us and we have to stay in that positive mindset, no matter what, no matter what's going on.

44
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With the other people and their energy. And what happens is, you know, good always prevails over over bad. And it's that way with energy to

45
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As long as you stay positive. No matter what, no. As long as you stay on that mindset as long as you're feeding your mind positivity. As long as you're working your program feeding your brain recovery. You know what I mean. It kind of shuts that addictive side down a little bit.

46
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:14.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, you know, everybody else. It's their that's their stuff they can be happy. They can be sad. They can be mad frustrated, whatever. But you know for you. You've got to stay in that positive space and then they start the wrong then they start drawing that energy from you.

47
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

48
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like why why can't I be

49
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:26.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, why can't I be happy. And why can't I, you know, it doesn't matter what happens, you keep a happy visit. You know what happened you smile on your face.

50
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:37.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's about changing that mindset to, you know, when we is all we think about is negativity and how, you know, everything is screwed up and life is so screwed up, then that's the energy that we put out there.

51
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: chaotic mess.

52
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:50.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But when we start the morning out, we start to the process out in our head with no matter what's gonna happen today I'm gonna I'm gonna face it.

53
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to have a smile on my face. And I'm going to walk through it with grace.

54
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You keep this in your mind.

55
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

56
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.330
Dawn Ninham: I like that.

57
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.980
Yes.

58
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.140
Dawn Ninham: That's what I'm doing.

59
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how's it working.

60
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.410
Dawn Ninham: It just, it's working great for me. But yeah, I feel guilty because like everybody around me, and so I'm always saying what's wrong, what's wrong.

61
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.070
Dawn Ninham: You know, I mean like I maybe I should just leave it alone. Didn't don't worry about how they're feeling, but I do

62
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can present it in a way of, you know,

63
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, how's your, you know, how's your day going, I hope it gets better. I hope you have an awesome day. You know, little words just of encouragement can change somebody's day

64
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah, but you don't have to carry what they're carrying. You don't have to carry those emotions, you know, from them.

65
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And you don't have to solve anybody else's problems you have to solve your own

66
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.680
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, that's what I got to work on. Yeah, that's true.

67
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, this is about dawn. This isn't about anybody else, you know, the kids are going to be coming home to dawn, they're not going to be coming home to anybody else. You know what I mean.

68
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:19.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so your mindset needs to be focused inward on that piece. Instead of worrying about what you know everybody else is going through. You can be a listener.

69
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you've got to have

70
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.600
Dawn Ninham: People that I love like my daughter or my boyfriend or, you know, it's like those kind of people that's

71
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.700
Dawn Ninham: What I'm worried about

72
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, like

73
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:40.950
Dawn Ninham: They should be, they should be happy with me and around me. It just sucks it when they're happy. I'm upset I'm happy. They're upset, like what's going on here. Free spot but

74
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It cake gets in line. Once everything you know cells down, there's not so much chaos. You know what I mean. And then it's almost like when you have a house full of women at one time.

75
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:05.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: After they've been living in the same area for a little bit of time. It's almost like their monthly cycle kind of comes together. And it's all the same date.

76
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.570
Right.

77
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's

78
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.420
Dawn Ninham: Gonna be my it'll be my like my daughter, my daughter.

79
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.250
Dawn Ninham: Lady down there and then me I'm like oh shit I didn't start or something. But yeah, he

80
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, he is.

81
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

82
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:33.810
Dawn Ninham: Hey fast fattening fast food for two days in a row. And I felt really Chuck yesterday and I was looking at my dog. I'm like, whoa. She did you like it works retaining water, you know, I mean, but

83
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:42.390
Dawn Ninham: I felt chunky. So I have to go back to salads. I felt great first week I felt awesome and then obviously, I'm sorry. The fattening food and the

84
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.040
Dawn Ninham: You know, I mean like not getting the whole hour and a half nap and login 45 minutes

85
00:07:49.140 --> 00:08:00.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it makes a difference. You just saw the difference from eating good to eating. Not so good. And what the effects are on you that we don't even realize it has when we're eating that way every day.

86
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:01.740
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

87
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.100
You know,

88
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:09.840
Dawn Ninham: Instead of doing that Metamucil when I couldn't go potty and using it as an excuse to go us because I couldn't go party, you know,

89
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

90
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.280
Dawn Ninham: And I bought these five bills. They're like troubles.

91
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

92
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For sending that working

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many days you got

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What he's a

99
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:04.260
Dawn Ninham: Toy one talk to him in a couple days and you still like, I think, I think a couple days today or tomorrow. He is let me know cuz I'm you know I don't want to wait till next week.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

106
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:31.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's what you gotta do step back a little bit and let them handle their own stuff because you know what, when we do things like that for other people, it doesn't

107
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They don't get everything out of it that they should they have to do it for themselves, which shows a willingness

108
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:50.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A willingness to want to make those changes in the beginning, or even a contemplated willingness to say, you know what I'm going to make the call. I'm going to possibly engage in it.

109
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:58.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to explore my options, but that's it. And that's totally fine, because you can get, you know, that person will then get in the door at least

110
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.150

Dawn Ninham: I have a life threatening problem that once had me. I now take charge of my life and my well being. I accept the responsibility.

133
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.340
Dawn Ninham: And so that's why I said it said

151
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.330
Dawn Ninham: It's a joke.

152
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And who, who is this lady that said that you

159
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.690
Dawn Ninham: And I'm thinking, well, that's weird. You know, I mean, like, why would it not be answering the phone. So then I'm

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She can't make a recommendation about

182
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:20.340

We doing wrong.

206
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:30.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe there's a

207
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.650
Number of missing.

208
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe there's a number missing.

209
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.210
Dawn Ninham: So I thought

210
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's the county name that you're going to see that you're

211
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working with over there.

212
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:53.340
Dawn Ninham: Um, I don't know, I guess we have our intake. I guess it's an intake. I've already did the paperwork part where sign all is really simple mentions, but am I going to do an intake tomorrow with her where she asked me a bunch of questions. So

213
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.230
Dawn Ninham: It took an hour.

214
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now that's about bio psychosocial

215
00:17:59.400 --> 00:17:59.850
Open

216
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.240
Dawn Ninham: Okay.

217
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So asking all kinds of in depth questions.

218
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.180
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, like a bright her, didn't the initial intake appointment or whatever. Yeah.

219
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.660
Yeah.

220
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.690
Dawn Ninham: And I'll call families, stuff like that as well.

221
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's what it's about.

222
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you stayed consistent with emails and checking in and I like that open communication because

223
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If anything comes up people

224
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

225
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.220
Dawn Ninham: Yeah I don't freak out. Now, don't freak out and

226
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:44.520
Dawn Ninham: You don't mean I just like I'm upset or whatever. But I don't say anything. I keep it to myself. And then I either, you know, text you how I'm feeling or what I'm thinking and then leave it at that.

227
00:18:46.560 --> 00:19:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good. Because when you're working with, with outside entities. You want to DHS, you know, the court, you want to hold your composure. You know what I mean. Because the minute that you show any kind of emotion, you know, you're, you're either, you know,

228
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.520
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

229
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally. And so you want to hold your composure. So if that works for you, for you to be able to get it out in an email before you, you know, deal with them been doing. Keep doing it that way. That's totally fine. Okay.

230
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:25.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It gives you an avenue and i'm i'm reading them watching them.

231
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know what I mean. So I just want to tell you that

232
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:31.710
Dawn Ninham: Awesome.

233
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:41.880
Dawn Ninham: Okay guys, I'm thinking, well, maybe I wonder where she didn't email back. I'm like, probably because it was all negative and she had nothing, you know, she just didn't want me to keep doing about it or I don't know but

234
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes just putting it on paper and you know what I mean. And knowing that somebody is reading it, you know, this just how you were feeling in the moment. It doesn't mean it's how you you're going to feel all day. Right.

235
00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:00.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So once you get it out on paper. Does it take it away, or do you continue with

236
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.120
Dawn Ninham: That no i don't like it immediately like it gets it off, like I've said it and

237
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:07.560
Dawn Ninham: It.

238
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.600
Dawn Ninham: fresh raw. Yeah.

239
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.830
Okay.

240
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, then it's doing its job.

241
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:21.840
Okay.

242
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:32.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If there's something that if there's something that you put in there that needs to respond to. Then I'll respond to it. But other than that, I probably won't for the most time

243
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just because it probably doesn't need a response.

244
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

245
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

246
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:41.640
Yep.

247
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.260

00:25:49.530 --> 00:26:03.300
Sherrie Martinez: I guess my maybe drinking I struggle with, because I do like to drink, but I don't drink a lot, a lot, but I do so, and I would really like to completely stop that and my smoking too but

322
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:08.820
Sherrie Martinez: I cut down on smoking, drinking, I cut down to

323
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:15.240
Sherrie Martinez: But it's not like an everyday thing, but I do like to take up like half my shots here and there.

329
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.260
Sherrie Martinez: Not all day or anything. I'm not drinking all day long. You know, I have a

330
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.330
Sherrie Martinez: Drink like a gene, but like five and then I'll have another game.

331
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:53.820
Sherrie Martinez: Three. And then five and then maybe when I go to bed. I'll have another like a little you know the little shooter shots.

332
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.630
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, I'll have like maybe three of those.

333
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.310
Sherrie Martinez: Three to four times a week, maybe five

334
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

335
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.520
So,

336
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you on meds, the right heart.

337
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.440
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, I'm on Suboxone okay

338
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:22.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And tell me, what does it do physically for you whenever you whenever you take your drink.

339
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:33.690
Sherrie Martinez: I don't know, it just like relaxes me and I just like the feeling of it, like, not the feeling of the busyness the feeling of it it going down my throat. I don't know.

340
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.950
Sherrie Martinez: People think it's weird. I know it's where I like that feeling of the burning of the sensation of the burning in my throat.

341
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:54.480
Sherrie Martinez: And saw a once I get that feeling down and it's gone, then I'm okay. I feel good. I don't shake i don't i'm not i don't shake or anything for it or anything. I just like that feeling.

342
00:27:55.770 --> 00:28:01.710
Sherrie Martinez: I like that feeling of the coldness and the burning sensation why I don't know if

343
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.430
Sherrie Martinez: That's what I want to know. I don't know why.

344
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.120
Sherrie Martinez: But that's one thing I like why I like to drink.

345
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.370
Sherrie Martinez: Vodka. It's the Smirnoff I drink or not or big goose or one of them.

346
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:31.170
Sherrie Martinez: And I don't know, I just like the feeling of it, and then I'll have, I'll take one and then about a couple hours later I'll feel like I need another one. And I did another one I'd like the burning again and then I'll have a secret.

347
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:40.320
Sherrie Martinez: And that I know I need to cut out I'm getting too old for this. But I don't know it's there. Now, I've been doing it. I think a little bit more often now that I've been home.

348
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.580
Sherrie Martinez: before my eyes.

349
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.310
Sherrie Martinez: And stuff. I wouldn't do it as much.

350
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

351
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you get too much.

352
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: time on your hands.

353
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:53.640
Sherrie Martinez: I'm getting bored. Yes, I'm getting bored so I'm like, I'm like, we'll have another one, you know,

354
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Might as well.

355
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:04.590
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, so, and I try to keep myself busy, but I'm, I'm just, there's not any more things I could do around the house and everything.

356
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:17.880
Sherrie Martinez: We do every, you know, the usual dishes has to be done. The laundry, stuff like that. But moving around the I can only move the house around so many times with them. Yeah.

357
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

358
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

359
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.380
Sherrie Martinez: And so, you know, so that's that's pretty much it.

360
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so tell me what level of

361
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What level of commitment to you have to stop drinking

362
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:53.940
Sherrie Martinez: Like, how much do I want it like that. Is that what you mean. Yeah, I want it. Pretty much, yeah. Because I know it's gonna mess up my house. If I don't, eventually will

363
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.890
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, so I really do.

364
00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:06.540
Sherrie Martinez: So I really want. I really want to, but I just, I just need to find something else, you know, to take that paving away.

365
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. And you're already on Suboxone and

366
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Suboxone usually helps with cravings.

367
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, usually

368
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:26.190
Sherrie Martinez: It does it really it actually is working, it does because I'm not, you know, drinking as much

369
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so our goal is to get you to where to that point where you're not drinking at all. Okay. Okay, that's, that's our goal.

370
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:41.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is to get to that point if you if you have to

371
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To cut back one shot a day.

372
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until you're at no shots a day.

373
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me what how you would be able to do that.

374
00:30:55.050 --> 00:31:01.620
Sherrie Martinez: I don't know. I don't know how I'm able to do that. I just, just not buy it. I guess just not go out and buy it.

375
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.470
Sherrie Martinez: That's the only thing

376
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:06.930
So, yeah.

377
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that something that you think you could do.

378
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:17.790
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, definitely. And sometimes I can't. And I sometimes I don't have money to do it. So I can't. So

379
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.480
Sherrie Martinez: You know, like, okay, well then I

380
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.130
Sherrie Martinez: Know it was that day.

381
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.520
And

382
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In those times. What do you replace it with

383
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:43.620
Sherrie Martinez: A sprite water. What do I like I like my ice with a cold, right, or seven up or something that I don't know that helps the craving like that. That's better, because it's cold. It goes down whole

384
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Icon.

385
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.750
Sherrie Martinez: That's why I like that feeling. I don't know, it's weird.

386
00:31:50.220 --> 00:32:01.980
Sherrie Martinez: And if I get a nice cool thing i or what else would you know what else I like the sonic drinks the ocean waters that will helps it. I think it's a sugar. I don't know. For some reason, it's the sugar.

387
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:10.410
Sherrie Martinez: You crave all the sweet drinks, which I know I drink water I drink tons and tons of water. I know I have to put my kidney

388
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.270
Sherrie Martinez: Yes. Um, but I do crave this drinks victim.

389
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:24.570
Sherrie Martinez: Now, yeah. And if I don't drink. I'll just go get some switching. I'll go to like Sonic at night, whatever, but it has to be cold with ice.

390
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.240
Sherrie Martinez: So I can do that.

391
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, makes perfect sense. And a lot of people that are getting off of opiates and alcohol do have that sugar craving all the time.

392
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.310
Sherrie Martinez: Uh huh. Yeah.

393
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:49.890
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, I do. I crave sugar. Big time. And when I don't have alcohol. But, you know, and I think I've just do because I'm

394
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.510
Sherrie Martinez: That I've been doing a little bit more because I'm bored.

395
00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:03.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what can you replace replace it with like when you have those cravings of sugar.

396
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:15.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instead of going for a drink. What are some of the things that you can change it, change it for that would give you the sugar intake, but not the, the rest of it that you're willing to

397
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have around your house.

398
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:27.480
Sherrie Martinez: I don't know what I don't know something non alcoholic. I've tried that before. It worked for a while. But then I got bored of it.

399
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.840
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, so

400
00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.510
Sherrie Martinez: I did it. I did it for quite a while and then I got bored and then I went right back.

401
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to combat that boredom.

402
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.450
Sherrie Martinez: You know, dying. Yeah.

403
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I read an article the other day that was talking about. Yeah. How we combat you know the boredom and really it's just about accepting the fact that in that moment you're bored right

404
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:01.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not trying to not trying to replace it, but not adding anything in that moment.

405
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Either but just sitting in the boredom. Does that make sense.

406
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:10.620
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, it does make sense because I've done that before. And I just stable and

407
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.120
Sherrie Martinez: There's nothing else to do but they weren't

408
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:27.060
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, if I don't have a drink or whatever. I don't have then I've done that I've just sat in my boredom played on my phone, watch something on TV, some, you know,

409
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.150
Sherrie Martinez: That's, that's about it. Yeah.

410
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Offline about

Sherrie Martinez: Oh,

456
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.410

459
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pick up your phone login. Take a look, see what's out there you know if you're if you struggle with, with the zoom thing or being on. Oh. Some people get anxiety when they have to go in with a bunch of people that they don't know

460
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can do it, you can do it with your, with your video off and just your voice on and just listen.

461
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you want to. They have some by phone, they have some, you know, by zoom by this area, but it, it will help combat that boredom.

462
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:13.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, when you feel bored and you don't have anything to replace it with do that.

463
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. In those moments. Here's the bigger challenge.

464
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.760
Sherrie Martinez: Okay, I love. Thank you.

465
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:29.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The biggest challenge is going to be that when the the times that you normally have a dream.

466
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want you to replace it login

467
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.470
Sherrie Martinez: Okay, not into that. But

468
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.360
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, all right. Yeah.

469
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.780
Sherrie Martinez: Now it seems pretty cool. That's something I would like

470
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can do it. You don't have to go anywhere yet you know they're not opening it yet, but I get you familiar with.

471
00:40:49.800 --> 00:41:06.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With the program bits you familiar with, you know how it works and what they do and it fills your head with positivity and recovery and hearing other people's stories you know so takes your mind off of those those cravings in that moment.

472
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

473
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

474
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:16.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're done, if you as when you get off of it and you go about your normal day. If at any time you start

475
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your mind starts going get your butt back in there and just, just keep listening, just keep doing. And if you if you feel the urge to participate participate

476
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.670
Sherrie Martinez: Okay, I'll do it.

477
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, just

478
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.830
Sherrie Martinez: Traveling. Yeah, that might be good because I used to like going to the meetings.

479
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:35.850
Sherrie Martinez: I'm

480
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.140
Sherrie Martinez: Do my church here.

481
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:43.860
Sherrie Martinez: And yet haven't named meetings and I like to outset and back because I was kind of like kind of shy. Don't want to be up there talking but I

482
00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.650
Sherrie Martinez: Ended in the back in. I missing to everybody.

483
00:41:47.250 --> 00:42:02.430
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, and they went to pressure me to talk or anything like that, but I would just mostly listen and towards the end, I may be some sometimes I'll say a little bit, but most of the time I'm just kind of I got kind of shy right away.

484
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:09.060
Sherrie Martinez: But i think i think i'd like this one, this one on the phone.

485
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally. Because it's right in your own house. You don't have to have your video on if you don't, if you don't feel that you want to. You don't have to participate if

486
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're struggling with that I encourage you to go in and check it out and and just listen for a while. But again, if you start

487
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: feeling the need

488
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:42.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To participate start typing away started talking in the meeting start engaging, nobody knows who you are. It's the most anonymous form that you can possibly get which

489
00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is right.

490
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.810
Sherrie Martinez: Which is what it's about.

491
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, and

492
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, you can go to go to a meeting in any state in any country and listen to people from around the world. It's pretty amazing.

493
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.790
Sherrie Martinez: I would like that. That would be interesting to me. I would really like

494
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:05.040
The idea.

495
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the idea behind it.

496
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.720
Sherrie Martinez: Is it's just my boredom and my cravings.

497
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. And so when you order in to get you to a point where you can go a full day without taking them without taking those shots. Yeah, right.

498
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's not something

499
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:36.450
Sherrie Martinez: And I know I can do it. But unlike wine, you know. Yeah, I know I can do it. But then when I do feel like I need want to then I'll do that.

500
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:38.580
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah.

501
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:42.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try it and see if you can use it for a replacement for both of those things.

502
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For boredom.

503
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:58.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And for your turkey and see if it helps if we could get you for the first for the first seven days. If we could get you to replace your drink with a meeting, two times out of the day.

504
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's successful even one time out of the day is successful. That's progress.

505
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know what I mean.

506
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.430
Yes.

507
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a process. So it's not something that I it's not something that you're going to fail or pass on.

508
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's something

509
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.040
Sherrie Martinez: You know, to really help me.

510
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.200
Sherrie Martinez: In the long run, yes.

511
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Okay.

512
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:34.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you tried it one day and, you know, you couldn't replace one for the other at all, then the next day. The next day, get up and try it again.

513
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, right. We always get up when we try it again.

514
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We don't stop trying

515
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.690
Sherrie Martinez: No. You try. I don't like to quit.

516
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not, not a quitter. Oh.

517
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.080

524
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:23.160
Sherrie Martinez: No, I haven't got it for a little bit. It's mostly when I I get really like depressed and down when I'm going to start my period.

525
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:38.760
Sherrie Martinez: That's when I start getting all that anxiety and emotional wreck and really bad. That's the first the first of the month around the area that's when I get all excited out in freaked out. And that's what I'm doing.

Sherrie Martinez: My half that he's gonna leave me. I don't like it.

540
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.250
Sherrie Martinez: But what go

541
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a tough one. That's where your anxiety starts a reason and where your emotions are going a little crazy.

542
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your fear was

543
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:25.980
Sherrie Martinez: Thinking about it and I know it's gonna get worse when we get closer, I know it's gonna be a file because he still has a whole year, but I know it's gonna get close to that. I'm going to start freaking out.

544
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But make sense.

545
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.790

546
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what does he say about it.

547
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:52.500
Sherrie Martinez: He's excited he wants to go. He's been doing every all his tests, everything has to get done. And he's happy he wants to go. He just at least wants to try it out. And I said, Okay, and you don't like it, call me I'll get you

548
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.160
Sherrie Martinez: I'll get to meet Lee, I'll get you set homes on whatever

549
00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.350
Sherrie Martinez: But go ahead. I can't tell. No, because he's already. His mind is set on

550
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's

551
00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not a bad

552
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:14.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not a bad decision. You know what I mean you know if if he really likes it, he can make a career out of it, you know.

553
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.710
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, and I hope he does. I just want him to be safe.

554
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:20.760
Yes.

555
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable.

556
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:34.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's tough when our kids pick you know make these hard choices and choose something that we know could possibly put them in some kind of danger, you know,

557
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that that's the tough part about it but supporting him and

558
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, walking through this with him is going to be huge, you know,

559
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:46.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

560
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:49.470

Yeah.

562
00:48:52.500 --> 00:49:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, once he goes through it, whether he stays in it or not there's gonna come a point in time where you and him are gonna be able to sit and talk about now.

563
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how afraid. How afraid you were you know that something's going to happen. You know what I mean.

564
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:21.690
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, I'm such a baby, you're fine. And look at how awesome you came out to be, and turned out to be. And I'm going to look back on this be like this is stupid. Why did I get away with. I think you'll be okay.

565
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think he will be to, you know,

566
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you'll have some pretty good experiences.

568
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And hopefully he'll be able to go to some pretty

569
00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome places.

570
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:47.580
Sherrie Martinez: Places. Yeah, he's never been out of New Mexico. So, you know, so this will be like a whole new wow this is gonna be crazy to him.

571
00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:57.930
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah. Well, he's I don't even think he's seen the ocean, he's never seen the ocean. Well, I took him to Florida when he was like, like, three, but he doesn't remember

572
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:17.100
Sherrie Martinez: So I took him to Daytona and Clearwater, but he was just a baby you know Pampers still so she doesn't remember being at the ocean. So I think he's you know he's gonna be on the ocean and and he's a good swimmer and everything. And I think that's why he likes it because he loves water.

573
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.170
So,

574
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.610
