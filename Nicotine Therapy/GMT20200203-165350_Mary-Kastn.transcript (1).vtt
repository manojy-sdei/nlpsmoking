00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:54.300
How many Republicans is a regional entity needs to be tackled and more needs to be done to be overwhelming.

2
00:44:54.990 --> 00:45:10.050
Even to be bipartisan, obviously, in the end, her hand was forced and you have an impeachment. That was neither overwhelmingly nor bipartisan and you have a president that will undoubtedly he

3
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.600
He was

4
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.810
Very permission to action, the action.

5
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.290
Of the campaign around

6
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.170
The

7
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:29.970
Survive.

8
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.730
Survive. It's a

9
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.230
It's

10
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:42.210
A reality or female, all of them, the extent it the way

11
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:51.000
It here he is going to impact famously said over and over every employee counter

12
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.380
Counter on followers sure will answer to that.

13
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.290
As the chief executive.

14
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.400
And

15
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.920
Are very few people

16
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.970
Who bring him in. Bring him back from that brink of near catastrophe and they came to

17
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.610
La for a long time.

18
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.690
Order in near the

19
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.420
Alliance on Apple

20
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:45.720
Has been very successful in its way. So far from me from using Twitter for the normally would.

21
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:54.090
Right now that that syntax about the sense that the President has as

22
00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.100
He it's time to sing.

23
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:08.850
And after

24
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.380
He has very little fear.

25
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.840
After this, and so

26
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.210
Now, how he exercises this agent.

27
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:39.270
The world, which is the nationalist gets empowered and starts to grading the institutions that particular right and in terms of sort of important

28
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:40.770
Or cat.

29
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.140
Magnets

30
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.630
Drop the farmers.

31
00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.370
Agent and

32
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.640
If people are that simply don't

33
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.670
Have your

34
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:59.340
Product.

35
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:09.900
It's

36
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:13.920
A

37
00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:15.780
Sacrifice

38
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.880
So it will take

39
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:21.750
With

40
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.270
Our

41
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:29.220
Ads.

42
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.300
Than sense that air pollution that's present

43
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:51.720
Here is all for not a whistleblower. It's an important

44
00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:04.830
Mary Kastner: contenders say it shouldn't happen just this shouldn't happen. I mean, that's not saying it was criminal. It was, you know, certainly not it.

45
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:18.420
Mary Kastner: shouldn't happen right here you have enough to say more than this wasn't the perfect call and to follow up on serious point about the binding in this question and you would have

46
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.500
Created

47
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.280
That. And now, according to the house managers.

48
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.660
Meeting itself so

49
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:33.390
You're out there.

50
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:36.630
That's the patient.

51
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.080
Enough rather than going

52
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:45.840
In general, or something else that's the big thing go live.

53
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:48.180
Evidence

54
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.430
Agent

55
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.380
may mean

56
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.590
That it's been done and

57
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.860
There's an extension of

58
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:13.740
Certainly an option and how to get it rolling that out and grab rushing

59
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:22.950
And do they want to add on to our weapons weapons. I have a department now.

60
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.860
They are in a

61
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:28.830
House.

62
00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:32.130

Own Count with me just open as a record.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.150

Even more public

78
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:48.480
Supporters there are four major for me, that's perfect.

79
00:51:50.040 --> 00:52:03.930
And who is probably one of the arguments if it's not cross the line, we want to we want to let him know that and it will require more space for the fact that

80
00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.180
It's

81
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.340
Wrong appropriate word tomorrow then

82
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:14.610

Shane Vanwinkle: Yeah, I had, I had a blood clots in both legs so

182
01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:18.930
Mary Kastner: Oh, okay.

183
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.050
Mary Kastner: And you just got Social Security Disability years

184
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.340
Mary Kastner: Okay, can I see the other leg. Are you able to sit down. Is there a chair out there.

185
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.280
Shane Vanwinkle: Yeah, I'm sitting down. Okay.

186
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:48.240
Mary Kastner: Because what you're showing me is like a person who has peripheral vascular disease.

187
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:50.670
Mary Kastner: Probably ever said that to you.

188
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.630
Know,

189
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.650
Mary Kastner: Did you have any other skin problems.

190
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.340
No.

191
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:01.470
Mary Kastner: No. Okay. You never injected

192
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.430
In the arms.

193
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:06.330
Shane Vanwinkle: Well yeah, I have in my neck injected, pretty much everybody.

194
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.040
Shane Vanwinkle: Can really i mean

195
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.700
Shane Vanwinkle: I don't have track marks like I haven't used so

196
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:14.940
Shane Vanwinkle: But most, the most the time, I just

197
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.820
Shane Vanwinkle: In my stomach or in my, you know,

198
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.330
Mary Kastner: Yeah, the stomach. What I saw there was just like

199
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:24.390
Mary Kastner: Small puncture wounds.

200
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:25.710
Shane Vanwinkle: around on your

201
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.580
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I can see I can see some track marks on your stomach.

202
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.990
Mary Kastner: To the, to the side of your belly button. Yeah, like this and some bruising.

203
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:56.340
Mary Kastner: Okay, how about your arms. Can you show me those

204
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:06.630
Mary Kastner: Okay tattoo on your right arm of a skeleton, but I don't see the veins circle but discolored around and a cubicle fossa.

205
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:10.350
Mary Kastner: And that's the right arm. What about the left arm.

206
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.060
Mary Kastner: Same way tattoo.

207
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.550
Mary Kastner: Kind of covering it up.

208
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.720
Mary Kastner: Don't see a whole lot about your neck. Let me see your neck.

209
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:26.250
Mary Kastner: Another chat shoe on the right neck.

210
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:28.110
You

211
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.840
Mary Kastner: Don't see any markings there. Good. Well, I'm glad you stopped because the impurities in heroin can

212
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:40.890
Mary Kastner: Break off and go right to the heart valve.

213
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:50.070
Mary Kastner: Is called bacterial in cart endocarditis. And if you've ever seen mistletoe in a tree. It's sort of like that. It sort of attaches

214
01:04:50.460 --> 01:05:05.580
Mary Kastner: To the valve and each time the valve opens that mistletoe or that impurity flies and if it just detaches then it can go and cause a heart attack or a pulmonary embolism. So it's very, very dangerous.

215
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:12.810
Mary Kastner: So I'm curious why they gave you some text instead of Suboxone

216
01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.720
Shane Vanwinkle: I'm not sure.

217
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.880
Mary Kastner: You're not sure. Okay, this

218
01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:23.280
Shane Vanwinkle: Is what the doctor gave me I'm not really sure why.

219
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.730
Mary Kastner: And how much are you smoking.

220
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.180
Shane Vanwinkle: Probably a half a pack a day.

221
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:38.430
Mary Kastner: Can you tell me how anxious, you are right now 10 being the most anxious. You've ever been.

222
01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:46.590
Shane Vanwinkle: Honestly, the subjects makes me not really anxious. Like, I don't really have no desire.

223
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.330
Mary Kastner: Okay, and how are you depressed at all.

224
01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.250
Mary Kastner: No good.

225
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.250
Shane Vanwinkle: I'm actually doing pretty good with the Suboxone

226
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.290
Okay, okay.

227
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:04.860
Mary Kastner: So your audit see score zero, meaning you don't drink at all. Is that correct,

228
01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:06.570
Shane Vanwinkle: Yeah I don't drink.

229
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:18.330
Mary Kastner: And the Gaston scores five, you don't have a cures report. Would you happen to go under another name.

230
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.230
No.

231
01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.650
Mary Kastner: It's always Shane Van Winkle

232
01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:30.480
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and the Winkle is not capitalized. So it's not. It's just goes with it after the end

233
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:34.950
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and your birth date is 1212 1985

234
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:39.390
Mary Kastner: Yes. Yeah, where are you getting texts from

235
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.660
Shane Vanwinkle: Hospital. I go, every time I need a refill, I think, give me a weeks.

236
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.910
Shane Vanwinkle: And weeks. Okay.

237
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:55.950
Mary Kastner: Well, probably just sit hasn't hit the state register yet but that's what the cures report isn't I don't find anything.

238
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:02.700
Shane Vanwinkle: Maybe on the van, or maybe space it after van.

239
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:05.310
Shane Vanwinkle: Winkle

240
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:14.820
Mary Kastner: Well, that's why you know I asked about that because it didn't make a lot of sense that I wasn't getting anything

241
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.080
Mary Kastner: Are you having any pain.

242
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.020
Shane Vanwinkle: In my lower back.

243
01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:27.750
Mary Kastner: I bet. What's the level of pain.

244
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:35.160
Shane Vanwinkle: Right now, it's probably a five, but it's been pretty bad. The last week. It's been hurting for about a week.

245
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:38.460
Mary Kastner: Okay, and that's you said in your neck.

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:39.810
Shane Vanwinkle: No, my lower back.

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:43.020
Mary Kastner: Lower back. Okay, and what's causing that.

248
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.940
Shane Vanwinkle: I'm not sure.

249
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:54.300
Shane Vanwinkle: It could be just a mixture of getting off the heroin and sleeping in the bed that I'm in, or I'm not really sure.

250
01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:55.470
Yeah.

251
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:59.070

Mary Kastner: Um, you can't just go back to your old. You know what I mean. After being off for a while.

iPad: Okay.

743
01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:54.150
Mary Kastner: So your pain today is two out of 10 your anxieties six out of 10 depression is more grief.

744
01:45:56.490 --> 01:46:02.760
Mary Kastner: So not really depressed, but still grieving and getting angry about what you went through.

745
01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:03.450
Yeah.

746
01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:04.830
iPad: Any

747
01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:08.070
Mary Kastner: Any said no thoughts of hurting yourself or others.

748
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:11.400
Mary Kastner: So satirists remain slow

749
01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:12.720
Continue.

750
01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:22.590
Mary Kastner: As far as a mental status, you're on time. You're welcome. Good eye contact, good interaction memory. Probably the same as it's been

751
01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:27.660
Mary Kastner: Pretty having any memory issues. You know, I

752
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:32.700
iPad: I thought that I would after this stroke. But no, it's

753
01:46:33.150 --> 01:46:34.110
iPad: Okay affected.

754
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:39.360
iPad: Different part of my brain, thank God. But, you know,

755
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:39.930
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

756
01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.640
Mary Kastner: I still have you're able to

757
01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.230
Mary Kastner: I would say a little bit of hesitation with your speech, but

758
01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:50.520
iPad: Yeah, it's sometimes a little worse than this.

759
01:46:54.870 --> 01:47:00.480
iPad: Well, after the stroke. I could barely talk, even a little bit but

760
01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:14.340
iPad: Unfortunately, the, the hospital didn't get me speech therapy and so well after my stroke or like a six weeks or something and

761
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:19.950
iPad: You know, the part that would have been

762
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:24.000
iPad: Able to

763
01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:28.470
iPad: Be fixed I guess in my brain, you know,

764
01:47:29.850 --> 01:47:48.480
iPad: It was passed the time, you know, and I was dealing with my brother's death at that time, too, and I had a lot going on. So I never did get speech therapy, but I got a book that my son got me for

765
01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:59.220
iPad: What you can do, after a stroke. And it doesn't have much on speech, but it has a little bit but

766
01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:02.790
iPad: I haven't read know

767
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:22.800
iPad: A lot about that. I don't know. Okay, I just thought that it would come back, naturally, and it has. And this withdrawal syndrome has also affected my speech, a big way. So that's, you know,

768
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:48.240
iPad: Being in dress. So you know I hoping that things will return to normal. Somebody told me in the hospital therapist that it takes at least six months for things to go back to normal. So it's only been about four months. So maybe we'll improve within

769
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.200
iPad: The next two months, I hope. Yeah.

770
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.540
Mary Kastner: Good, good, good, and you're able to get in.

01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:27.060
iPad: I don't think I know more than normal, you know,

780
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.310
Mary Kastner: And you can read and concentrate on what you're

781
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:30.450

785
01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:14.940
Mary Kastner: Well, I'm normal habits speeches, a little hesitant buying coherent normal thought process appropriate for age development normal sir content logical non tangential no hallucinations, delusions known today's exchange and site self reflection on today's issues is adequate.

786
01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:26.340
Mary Kastner: So any current medical issues that you're concerned about any runny nose, fever, cold like symptoms stomach problems sleep. How's your sleep.

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:50.340
Mary Kastner: I'm sorry it took them that long to get you referred to us.

795
01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:51.330
Mary Kastner: So,

796
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:58.410
Mary Kastner: We're going to continue, I would see that this is the ongoing process because of your pain, chronic pain.

797
01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:09.480
Mary Kastner: So we're going to continue at Suboxone eight to sublingual film T ID. I gave her a 10 day supply. She's going to come into group on Monday.

01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:28.410
Mary Kastner: And we're gonna hopefully get you set up for good month at that point and I put in a referral for individual therapy and you're going to be looking in your area for

800
01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:38.070
Mary Kastner: For our grief group. I think you could benefit from just kind of getting this all out getting this aired

801
01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:42.540
Mary Kastner: You had a double punch to the stomach as far as loss.

802
01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:47.340
Mary Kastner: It takes years to get over that and

803
01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:50.910
Mary Kastner: It actually takes as long as it takes.

804
01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:54.990
Mary Kastner: So chronic pain syndrome.

805
01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:16.740
Mary Kastner: And we're in the canoes opioid dependence or sort of hand in hand. So I'm complicated mood disorder due to your medical condition and that's our diagnoses and we're going to hopefully get you contacted with the group for grief.

806
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:18.210
iPad: And so

807
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:32.070

809
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.390
Okay.

810

1257
02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:16.410

Mary Kastner: And chai. See you next weekend group.

1260
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:37.950
Mary Kastner: And how you take the film, very similar to the tablet, you would have a wet mouth before you take it put under your tongue.

1261
02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:48.390
Mary Kastner: Don't talk don't smoke.

1262
02:31:51.810 --> 02:31:54.060
Mary Kastner: Don't eat or drink until it's fully dissolved

1263
02:31:56.130 --> 02:31:58.140

1264
02:32:00.090 --> 02:32:04.050
Glen Jamison: 9am and 9pm. Okay. Sounds good to me.

1265
02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:07.680
Mary Kastner: If you have any side effects, please let me know.

1266
02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:09.780
Glen Jamison: Okay.

1267
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:25.080
Mary Kastner: And so then the nice part of the group is you get, you know, kind of talk to other people with the same issue and we keep track of the surveys that we require and your urine drug screens.

1268
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:30.570
Mary Kastner: I need you to get the labs done that we ordered for this initial visit

1269
02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:33.360
Glen Jamison: Okay.

1270
02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:43.050
Mary Kastner: Let me see if I can get this in for you.

1271
02:32:58.680 --> 02:32:59.880
Mary Kastner: Any questions for me.

1272
02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:03.660
Glen Jamison: Now,

1273
02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:15.450
Mary Kastner: So our goal is that you would not have cravings comfortable and you don't use non prescribed opiates.

1274
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:17.910
Mary Kastner: Sound okay

1275
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:21.990
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Okay. Are you comfortable now.

1276
02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:25.740
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Okay. Any cravings.

1277
02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:41.880
Mary Kastner: No. Okay. And as far as the length of treatment. I don't imagine it's going to be that long, we can lower it as we through the time and get you off entirely because it sounds like you're useless definitely related to a pain issue.

1278
02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:44.670
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so then addiction issue.

1279
02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:59.250
Mary Kastner: So, um, we'll, we'll go with the flow out usually like since you've been on it for about three years. Like you keep you on this about nine months, at least so we can prevent a relapse.

1280
02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:07.440
Mary Kastner: And then, you know, when you feel you want to lower the dose that know and we'll try it and see how you do.

1281
02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:08.550
Okay.

1282
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:17.490
Mary Kastner: I'm just a rule of thumb, sometimes it takes about as long as you've been on the opiates.

1283
02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:29.310
Mary Kastner: For your brain to kind of get back to normal and feeling like your, your normal self without having those receptor sites sort of hyper stimulated.

1284
02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:44.580
Mary Kastner: Okay, so I will see you in group maybe tonight. It's up to, if you want to come tonight, but definitely next Monday you check in at 345 with the front desk and your medication has been sent in

1285
02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:46.110
Glen Jamison: Okay.

1286
02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:50.790
Mary Kastner: Okay. And if you don't have any further questions we can stop.

1287
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:53.040
Glen Jamison: No. Not at the moment.

1288
02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:56.250
Mary Kastner: Okay, take care. Nice to meet you.

1289
02:34:56.730 --> 02:34:58.260

1331
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:50.640
Kera Turner: I'm hanging in there.

1332
02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:53.670
Kera Turner: I

1333
02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:06.840
Kera Turner: Basically am off almost all of my medications, because I took a trip and somehow left all of my medications, besides my as needed ones.

1334
02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:17.700
Kera Turner: And so I the and I was on a flight, all the way to LA and so I basically cold turkey off of all of my psych meds inadvertently

1335
02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:27.360
Kera Turner: And I didn't get a chance to start the lithium because we were trying to figure out where it went. It was supposed to go to Walmart, but I guess it was a Walgreens.

1336
02:39:28.050 --> 02:39:38.370
Kera Turner: And so we didn't know until Walgreens called like two weeks later and said, hey, we have these two prescriptions. Here the results you want. And the lithium 150 or whatever it was.

1337
02:39:38.910 --> 02:39:45.840
Kera Turner: And so my husband went and picked the lithium up but we weren't able to pay for the results because for some reason, it wasn't covered

1338
02:39:46.320 --> 02:40:03.450
Kera Turner: So we haven't picked up the results one yet, but I haven't started the lithium, just because I've been off of the Wellbutrin and off of the the rig zolty for pretty much a week now.

1339
02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:05.910
Okay.

1340
02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.130
Kera Turner: I feel

1341
02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:23.580
Kera Turner: Now I have it. I just haven't restarted it i i felt awful. And I'm like, I'm not sure if I should restart it at the levels that I was taking or if I should start it at more minimal levels or what I should do. I was waiting to speak with you.

1342
02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.260
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okey dokey, and you have the looking now.

1343
02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:30.450
Kera Turner: Yeah, I have all of it.

1344
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:32.250
Mary Kastner: Okay, good.

1345
02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:36.780
Mary Kastner: So what I would do is I'd start the lithium. Okay.

1346
02:40:37.890 --> 02:40:38.970
Mary Kastner: A couple days.

1347
02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:41.610
Mary Kastner: And then you can restart.

1348
02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:48.990
Mary Kastner: Your other meds. Let me just take a look at the dosages to make sure it's okay to start at those dosages

1349
02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:54.360
Mary Kastner: And get your lab labs done for the lithium. We kept you started

1350
02:40:55.170 --> 02:40:55.530
Okay.

1351
02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:00.450
Mary Kastner: Appreciate your being responsible around all this

1352
02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:13.830
Kera Turner: Yeah, I only brought him the prize, the language me and then my Zocor in just my as needed medication. So I have those

1353
02:41:14.250 --> 02:41:24.570
Kera Turner: But I had everything separated into pill containers and then just completely just didn't put them in my bag. I don't know how that happened. But yeah, they just didn't wind up in my bag.

1354
02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:42.840
Kera Turner: And so for honestly like the past few days have been awful I've either been like sleeping, way, way, way, way, way too much, or I haven't been able to get to sleep until like three in the morning. It's been a nightmare been off my man.

1452
02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:17.700

1453
02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:32.400
Mary Kastner: She hasn't started anything because she didn't know if she should start at full strength after regaining all of our medic routine medications or depression is nine out of 10 today anxiety seven out of 10 and pain is

02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:04.200
Mary Kastner: Breathing okay no feeling of flu or cold and you said you're vaporizing how often

1483
02:53:05.460 --> 02:53:27.090
Kera Turner: I believe every day, but I've been decreasing the nicotine amount. So it's been like a gradual decrease the little. The next step is to hit a zero percent nicotine level which is as soon as this, the bottle that I have the small bottle that I have this hour is your percent nicotine so

1484
02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:32.760
Mary Kastner: Good, good. So I'm just going to enter these

1485
02:53:35.490 --> 02:53:43.740

Kera Turner: And didn't

1487
02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:59.370
Kera Turner: owe you. Yeah, that's right. The easiest thing for me to do is just to look back through Kaiser records or ask a Kaiser doctor to, like, because I don't know if I can see what they used to prescribe I can only see what they prescribe now.

1488
02:53:59.850 --> 02:54:08.310
Kera Turner: But I might be able to have a doctor just pull up what has been prescribed before in the past, and that would probably be the easiest way to do it.

1489
02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:11.550
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and then just calling the front desk and

1490
