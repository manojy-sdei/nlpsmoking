Mary Kastner: So tell me what you're on.

30
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.510

31
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.970
Calvin: Over 10 years now.

32
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.080
Mary Kastner: And what's the, what's the dosage.

33
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.490
Calvin: It's 16 milligrams and it's pretty much like that whole time.

34
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.280
Mary Kastner: So are they stripped, sir.

35
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.210

Mary Kastner: And it's 8822 students

37
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.320
Mary Kastner: Taking them.

38
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.530
Calvin: I think I'm both in the morning. However, in a week. I'm going to get an injection of the medication sub located. I don't know if you're familiar

39
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.390
Mary Kastner: Yes, uh huh.

40
00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.550
Calvin: Okay, yeah, it's wonderful. I mean, the last two months and you don't have to take medication, but you still get the effect. So I'm looking forward to that. Anyway,

41
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.410
Mary Kastner: So you take the eight to both in the morning and you get the injection

42
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.720
Calvin: Know I'm going to end a week.

43
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.480
Calvin: Just to, you know, see how it works. I had in a long time ago, and then went back to the scripts and now I'm gonna go back to the injection

44
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.230
Mary Kastner: Okay. So, and that's in a week. So you need

45
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.110
Mary Kastner: You need a week's worth to get to that point.

46
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.210
Calvin: No, I'm actually, I'm I am getting this Suboxone provided by a different provider.

47
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.910
Mary Kastner: Oh, okay. So you don't need us for that.

48
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.930
Calvin: No, no.

49
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.000
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okey dokey.

50
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.190
Calvin: So the I take a quantum

51
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:58.560
Calvin: two milligrams per day once in the morning and valuable. So I've been on for about 10 years pretty much the same dose.

52
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.690
Mary Kastner: Okay.

53
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.310
Calvin: And

54
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.440
Calvin: I take effect sir 100 milligrams. And that's one time of day.

55
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.350
Mary Kastner: 150 yeah okay and what time of day.

56
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.790
Calvin: In the morning

57
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.440
Mary Kastner: OK. OK.

58
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:30.210
Calvin: OK. And I think Abilify five milligrams. Well, actually, as a guest today we switched it to 10 milligrams of Abilify once in the morning.

59
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.340
Mary Kastner: And who's we

60
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.980
Calvin: Me and Dr.

61
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.780
Calvin: Our daddy.

62
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.170
Mary Kastner: Okay, yeah. So you doubled it

63
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.910
Calvin: Yeah yeah

64
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.050
Why

65
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.540
Calvin: You know, I just my depression isn't too bad it's but it's just kind of agreement in there and I just

66
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.540
Calvin: I was just wondering if maybe increasing the Abilify might help with

67
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.070
Calvin: With the overall regimen and medications. I'm taking and, you know, increasing

68
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.170
Calvin: But

69
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.790
Calvin: I also realized that I had ran out of

70
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.080
Calvin: My gap was like three weeks ago and I just completely forgot about it and I

71
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.790
Calvin: So I just picked it up yesterday and I think 300 milligrams of that three times a day.

72
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.550
And

73
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.140
Calvin: Yeah, I realize. Now why might be might have been feeling a little funky for the past few weeks.

74
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.550
Calvin: I can't believe I forgot about it.

75
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.870
Okay.

76
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.190
Calvin: Okay, so yeah and then

77
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.770
Calvin: What else is there.

78
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.530
Calvin: Any just double check. Oh, I mean, this isn't a site, site before I take math. The carbon wall as a PRN you know once every couple days.

79
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:11.010
Calvin: The last one is going to be our 30 milligrams to two times a day.

80
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.770
Calvin: So quite a lot of medications.

81
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.190
Mary Kastner: Okay, and what is your diagnoses.

82
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.440
Calvin: And

83
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.130
Calvin: anxiety, panic attacks.

84
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:37.590
Calvin: I've had seizures in the past because this doctor had prescribed having me on eight milligrams 20 milligrams per day.

85
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.830
Calvin: And when I was coming off it in the medical detox facility. I did have a seizure, and I have had one previous to that coming off of it.

86
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.760
Calvin: But not recently. So anyway, I'm

87
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.740
Calvin: Just panic attacks, anxiety, like a horrible. Yeah.

88
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.290
Calvin: What happens when you have panic.

89
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:14.730
Calvin: Oh, you know, I did. I thought I knew a panic attack wasn't only had one and oh my god it was crazy. The first time it happened. I called an ambulance because

90
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.460
Calvin: My heart rate was 180 plus and

91
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:31.500
Calvin: It was, it was like that steadily from it started at like 10pm until like 430, it was still about that rate.

92
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.790
Calvin: And I was just feeling so terrible and scared. I ended up

93
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.990
Calvin: Calling an ambulance so

94
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.520
Calvin: Turns out,

95
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.200
Calvin: But

96
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.300
Mary Kastner: How often are you having those

97
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:56.520
Calvin: Right now, it's pretty controlled with the medication. I have one. I've only had probably less than 10 in my life because they're pretty severe

98
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:05.670
Calvin: But I had one about a month ago. And then before that it's been like a year, year and a half, so not very

99
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.530
Mary Kastner: Anything that triggers.

100
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:20.250
Calvin: Um, well, yeah, just not having the medical provider is all available to me that I needed and everything organized over the past couple months. It's been tricky so

101
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.170
Calvin: Some of my medication and that is mainly what triggered it.

102
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:36.870
Calvin: Pops in my head about something I'm worried about like my dog, maybe, you know, knowing that she's gonna die eventually in a few years, but

103
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.090
Mary Kastner: Future tripping.

104
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.620
Calvin: Things like that, you know,

105
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.290
Mary Kastner: Yeah okay so you we cover all the medicines that you're on.

106
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:56.640
Mary Kastner: Yes. Okay. Okey dokey. So effects or 150 in the morning Abilify which is just increased again, I would say, put it back down to five.

107
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.560
Mary Kastner: Gabba Gabba Penton 303 times a day mental

108
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.450
Mary Kastner: Problem. Long as you need it.

109
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.340
Mary Kastner: And boost bar 30 twice a day.

110
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.710
Mary Kastner: Exactly. Okay.

111
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.690
Mary Kastner: Um,

112
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.350
Calvin: It's kind of a lot of medications. I'm

113
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:21.180
Mary Kastner: Not really the target, target symptoms that these are for our anxiety.

114
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.490
Mary Kastner: And you had seizures with withdrawal from Klonopin some depression and panic.

115
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.250
Mary Kastner: Which is not frequent

116
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.900
Mary Kastner: And any other target symptoms that I might have missed as far as

117
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.270
Mary Kastner: What these medicines are treating

118
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:53.940
Calvin: Just the just the symptoms from anxiety. You know, I get sweaty is can be hard, you know, and okay Robin pulse.

119
00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:02.520
Mary Kastner: Okay, and so your PHP nine which is a assessment for depression.

120
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.100
Mary Kastner: Was 23 which is severe and so we're

121
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:18.930
Mary Kastner: It's an assessment tool that you took when you entered our program, probably a little while ago if Dr. Ella dog has been seeing you. I believe he did an H and P

122
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.430
Mary Kastner: For six so it's probably the early part of this month.

123
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:24.840
Calvin: Okay.

124
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.290
Mary Kastner: Um, so where would you rate your depression today 10 being the most depressed. You've ever been.

125
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.720
Calvin: I would say it's actually improved a lot, it's a lot less severe so I'm 10 being the worst.

126
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.610
Calvin: I would say right now. It's a six.

127
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.060
Mary Kastner: Okay. And where would you rate your anxiety.

128
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.570
Calvin: Overall,

129
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.970
Calvin: Probably

130
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.730
Calvin: I'd say seven

131
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.950
Mary Kastner: Okay. And have you had any recent laboratory or blood work done.

132
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.990
Calvin: Um, I'd say about six months ago.

133
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.120
Mary Kastner: Okay. Do we have that record. Have you provided that to us.

134
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.400
Calvin: I believe you do have that a from clinical late because they

135
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.710
Mary Kastner: Say that again, who sent the referral.

136
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.330
Calvin: Clinical a

137
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.510
Mary Kastner: Clinic clinical clinical what

138
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.150
Calvin: Clinic only over LTE

139
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.630
Mary Kastner: LTE okay if we don't have. I did not see that in your documents so

140
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.650
Mary Kastner: I think you need to request it again. Get it to us, call the front desk and tell them how

141
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.670
Mary Kastner: That you have it in your hand and how do you scan it into the record. If not, I have some

142
00:11:50.730 --> 00:12:02.520
Mary Kastner: Lab lab orders. I can put in, we would need to check your thyroid, we would need to definitely do a lipid panel because Abilify will increase your cholesterol.

143
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.450
Know,

144
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.520
Mary Kastner: And so, and of course I person depression.

145
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:20.370
Mary Kastner: So the other thing I have is a gap inventory of seven which God seven score was 18 which is severe anxiety when you took this

146
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.880
Mary Kastner: Your audit see score was zero your desk.

147
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.530
Mary Kastner: 10 was three and two are you using any alcohol at all.

148
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.230
Calvin: No for years.

149
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.940
Mary Kastner: Okay and tobacco.

150
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.690
Mary Kastner: I can't hear you.

151
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.580
Calvin: I'm sorry I spoke about

152
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:48.420
Mary Kastner: 1010 cigarettes a day. Okay. And any sedatives other than the Klonopin

153
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.370
Mary Kastner: Know any prescribed medications you're taking on prescribed

154
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.490
Mary Kastner: No. Okay. Any opiates.

155
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.000
Mary Kastner: No. Okay. Okey dokey.

156
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:13.740
Mary Kastner: So the cures report, which is a report of controlled substances was run and I see Suboxone subs off Klonopin and supplicate

157
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.100

166
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.190

169
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.490

171
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:40.110
Calvin: Okay. Um, that was due to me, not having access to the clinic in Napa anymore.

172
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:47.190

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.570
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I have that history from Dr. Yeah.

174

176
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.810

177
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:20.910

178
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:32.880

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.670
Mary Kastner: Okay, what is your weight now.

319
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.540
Calvin: Now it's about 280

320
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.420
Mary Kastner: And how trolley.

321
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.060
Mary Kastner: split into what do you attribute the weight gain.

322
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:15.090
Calvin: Mean I was never this heavy before, but when I quit using math. Yeah, it just went went up so fast.

323
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:16.800
Calvin: Yeah.

324
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.600
Mary Kastner: Do you think you're eating nutritionally

325
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.100
Calvin: Yeah.

326
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.920
Mary Kastner: Okay. He three meals a day, you get the full range of foods.

327
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.720
Calvin: Yeah, I think so.

328
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:37.320
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay, okay. So, um, as far as my impression. I would agree with you that you do have an anxiety disorder with panic.

329
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.250
Mary Kastner: And recurrent major depressive disorder, you're on 150 of effects are

330
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.480
Mary Kastner: In the morning, and do you take the Abilify in the morning or at night.

331
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.390
Calvin: Are generally take everything in the morning.

332
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:54.960
Calvin: Okay, we

333
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.210
Calvin: Got offense in the space out

334
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.070
Mary Kastner: Okay, and

335
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.580
Mary Kastner: Do you have any side effects from anything

336
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:14.850
Calvin: Yeah, the main side effect. I think would be two things sexual side effects and I attribute that to both the Suboxone and probably the effects are also

337
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.650
Calvin: And that's something I really struggle with. So

338
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.680
Calvin: The other side effect would be

339
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:44.250
Calvin: How I think this is due to the effects or how it kind of dole's my stress levels in that it makes me not stressed about anything to the point where I don't feel motivated to go and accomplish things that I need to, you know what I mean, like some stress is necessary in life.

340
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:46.830
Mary Kastner: Okay.

341
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.840
Mary Kastner: Are you seeing any marijuana now.

342
00:27:59.250 --> 00:27:59.850
Calvin: No.

343
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:09.900
Mary Kastner: Well, the typical answer to this will be to get you on a medication has more

344
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:18.630
Mary Kastner: Norepinephrine effect, which is the neural chemical. It helps us with cognitive function, and it's a little bit more activating

345
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.000
Mary Kastner: Which is what effects are is

346
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.710
Mary Kastner: So you know that you may want to increase your effects.

347
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.620
Mary Kastner: In the sexual side effects.

348
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.030
Mary Kastner: You know, have you had a testosterone level taken recently. Oh.

349
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.270
Calvin: No, but I really would like to

350
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.870
Mary Kastner: Know that might be that might be an idea.

351
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:52.500
Mary Kastner: Wellbutrin is what we typically treat that with however it lowers the seizure threshold. So since you've had seizures. I do not want to give you Wellbutrin

352
00:28:54.690 --> 00:29:06.810
Mary Kastner: If anything, you know, maybe I would lower some of these that are more sedating like the boost bar and the Gabba Penton but I think the Gabba Penton is very nice because it has a neuroprotective effect.

353
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:14.400
Mary Kastner: To keep you from having seizures. It definitely is in NZ analytics.

354
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.560
Mary Kastner: So,

355
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.780
Mary Kastner: I don't know.

356
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.670
Mary Kastner: Maybe we should lower the boost bar to 10 three times a day.

357
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.220
Mary Kastner: That's by half.

358
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.100
Calvin: Okay, and what are the reasons for that.

359
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.950
Mary Kastner: To be less a dating.

360
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.170
Mary Kastner: Okay, give me more energy.

361
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:41.700
Mary Kastner: And then actually increase that effects are the 150 in the morning and 75 at midday.

362
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.730
Mary Kastner: Is it Excel that you're taking a regular release.

363
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.700
Calvin: Yeah, it's a the XL.

364
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:51.480
Okay.

365
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.930
Mary Kastner: And I would definitely lower your Abilify back down to two five.

366
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.990
Calvin: When you think about it may be blocking the Abilify off completely like tapering down

367
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.600
Mary Kastner: That's a possibility. However, I'm

368
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:25.380
Mary Kastner: With your mother's history of bipolar illness. There's no

369
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.520
Mary Kastner: There's a possibility of you having a bipolar depression.

370
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.990
Mary Kastner: And the Abilify would definitely help that and also your mood.

371
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.520
Calvin: Your, your crush.

372
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.330
Mary Kastner: Your depression.

373
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:45.180
Mary Kastner: So that's why I didn't go for that right away but I certainly don't think you need 10

374
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.860
Calvin: Sure, sure.

375
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:51.120
Mary Kastner: And I think we do one thing at a time, you know,

376
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:55.440
Mary Kastner: You're and actually what we're doing is two things, because the juice bar takes so long.

377
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.690
Mary Kastner: To change.

378
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.320
Mary Kastner: We're going to increase that effects or because, again, it hasn't norepinephrine effect what should be energizing

379
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:05.760
Calvin: Okay.

380
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:16.200
Mary Kastner: So I'm going to give you a diagnosis of nicotine. Use Disorder methamphetamine. Use Disorder opioid use disorder.

381
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.920
Mary Kastner: Rollout bipolar depression.

382
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.100
Mary Kastner: But leave it at major depressive disorder recurrent

383
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:43.710
Mary Kastner: Yeah. And the reason why I'm leaving. Matt is because the hyper Samia sleeping too much in the weight gain.

384
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.680
Mary Kastner: But we really do need to get thyroid

385
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.570
Mary Kastner: So we need to abs.

386
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:55.080
Mary Kastner: Thyroid and cholesterol lipid panel and I'll put those words and you can tell them

387
00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.420
Mary Kastner: You say it's can't remember the name of the lab, you go to

388
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.620
Calvin: Quest

389
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.430
Mary Kastner: Oh quest. Okay, we can send that to quest what which one

390
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.690
Calvin: It's in Napa. Yeah, Napa on pear tree.

391
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.490
Mary Kastner: Care Tree Lane. Yeah, okay.

392
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:22.080
Calvin: And then can you is possible for you to order the testosterone.

393
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.180
Mary Kastner: Yeah. But the problem with that is that I can't read it.

394
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.710
Calvin: Oh,

395
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.070
Mary Kastner: No, I think your primary needs to do the testosterone level.

396
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.550
Calvin: Okay, well, what if you ordered it and then we just had a little file for next time I see her. Yeah.

397
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.360
Mary Kastner: We can do that.

398
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.920
Calvin: Okay, that'd be great.

399
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.240
Mary Kastner: And then

400
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.940
Mary Kastner: I would say, Are you doing any exercise.

401
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.940
Calvin: No, I don't.

402
00:32:52.260 --> 00:33:00.840
Calvin: But luckily it's getting to be the summertime, and I love gardening, more than anything else. So I'm going to start working in the yard and more and more. So that would be helpful.

403
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.700
Mary Kastner: OK. So again, our objective is to get you more active.

404
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.540
Mary Kastner: Under the major depressive disorder recurrent

405
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:20.520
Mary Kastner: To to therefore get your weight down in your sleep back to about six or seven hours uninterrupted a day.

406
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:30.210
Mary Kastner: And, you know, get your mood to five out of 10 or below on both depression and anxiety.

407
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.810
Mary Kastner: Okay, and then you're welcome to come back to see me and my mental health group.

408
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:45.750

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.830

429
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.710
Mary Kastner: And the venue Maxine er 150 in the morning.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.950
Mary Kastner: And what pharmacy. Do you go to

433
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.170
Calvin: It's called pharmacopeia in Napa Baraka integrative pharmacy.

434
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.000
Mary Kastner: Okay, I have it.

435
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.390
Mary Kastner: It in for you for

436
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.460
Mary Kastner: You'll have enough for two months, plus a refill.

437
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:56.220
Mary Kastner: And again, you would see me, especially in that group on the fortress check and see how you're doing with all this because I know you go to groups.

438
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.050
Mary Kastner: With Dr. Allah, Doc.

439
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:10.140
Mary Kastner: Anytime you see me for medications is going to be through that group format you call in at 645 and they will tell you what the real number is

440
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.090
Mary Kastner: The Gabba Penton you need refills on

441
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:23.040
Calvin: Yeah, I only have about a week left of that pretty, pretty much everything around like 710 days left

442
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.920
Calvin: Which is only a few days.

443
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.820
Mary Kastner: Okay, it's 303 times a day.

444
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.570
Mary Kastner: So the reason why I mentioned

445
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:14.670
Mary Kastner: The reason why I mentioned the exercises that you increase the same no chemicals in your

446
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:26.550
Mary Kastner: Brain as you do with medications with exercise. So that is an important part of your recovery.

447
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.850
Mary Kastner: As well as eating nutritious foods. Okay.

448
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.250
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay.

449
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.200
Mary Kastner: So we took care of those

450
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.190
Mary Kastner: clonazepam you needed a refill.

451
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:54.540
Mary Kastner: And eventually, I think we need to get you wind a little bit on that. Not completely.

452
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:10.650
Mary Kastner: But that is also a sedating medication and these others should take over some of the anxiety prevent you from panic. So were you eventually using it only as you need it for panic.

453
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:18.480
Calvin: Okay. I mean, I'm not 100% opposed to it. I'm willing open minded to try anything. If it works, you know,

454
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.360
Mary Kastner: And then own desk that we have with

455
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.370
Mary Kastner: With Suboxone are people that are taking it concurrently.

456
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.130
Mary Kastner: With it benzodiazepine

457
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.850
Mary Kastner: You taking one in the AM only

458
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.740
Calvin: Yeah, okay.

459
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:48.000
Calvin: I've been taking that for you know just about 10 years, like I said, so it's been a long time.

460
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.480
Mary Kastner: It's gonna be a long process to get you off.

461
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:52.710
Calvin: Oh, yeah.

462
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:55.980
Okay.

463
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.380
Mary Kastner: Do you have

464
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.770
Calvin: Big pit bull.

465
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.170
Calvin: He's a good oh

466
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.170
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I'm telling you the thought of a dog as hard

467
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.120
Mary Kastner: Because

468
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.580
Calvin: She's only eight, so I can't. It's years away, but

469
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:55.890
Calvin: My last panic attack. I don't know that thought just popped in my head that she would be gone. Some day and it just triggered it.

470
00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.310
Calvin: I love the dog so much. They're very

471
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.370
Calvin: Therapeutic and essential

472
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.190
Calvin: Yeah, I don't know what I do it at a dog.

473
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.370
Mary Kastner: Okay, I'm

474
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:23.070
Mary Kastner: Getting the vaccine right now. Um,

475
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.360
Mary Kastner: So probably what's going to happen is I'm going to give you

476
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.920
Mary Kastner: 75

477
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.110
Mary Kastner: Do you think you can take one midday.

478
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:53.430
Calvin: I do you think it makes much of a difference if I were to take the whole eight to 25 in the morning, as opposed to spacing it out or

479
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.840
Mary Kastner: No, it wouldn't make it wouldn't make any difference. Yeah, that's a good idea.

480
00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:02.040
Calvin: Because I prefer. Yeah, just like the one once in the morning thing just

481
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.040
Calvin: Like trying to take

482
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:06.660
Calvin: Sure.

483
00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.630
Calvin: But probably still give me the 75 anyways. They'll just take three

484
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.950
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that's right.

485
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.630
Mary Kastner: And you did you need any more Abilify

486
00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.110
Calvin: Yeah, I mean, in about a week or so.

487
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:46.470
Mary Kastner: I'm going to put the lab version. Okay. And so then I will see you in on March on May 4 you're welcome to come to the group next week, just without me.

488
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.050
Mary Kastner: It would be your mental health group.

489
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.730
Mary Kastner: OK.

490
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.380
Calvin: OK.

491
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.330
Calvin: OK, and then you got the testosterone test in there. Also, right.

492
00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.000
Mary Kastner: Yep, I will put that in.

493
