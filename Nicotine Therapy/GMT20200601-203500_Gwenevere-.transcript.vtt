00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.410
Joshua Lopez: Just sorry

5
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all right. It's just nice to see a smile on your face.

6
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.000
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, definitely, definitely feeling a lot better than the other day, for sure.

7
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing. Where is your mind been drifting off to what are you doing to manage that that restless mind. What are you doing,

8
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.820
Joshua Lopez: I'm just

9
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.020
Joshua Lopez: Getting myself excited for the future.

10
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.090
Joshua Lopez: Don't know what it has in store for me, but I just

11
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.200
Joshua Lopez: Do feel like it's got something in store for me, you know,

12
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.220
Joshua Lopez: believe in karma and don't i don't think I'm a person who deserves bad karma, you know,

13
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:50.790
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, then I do silly things like I read my daily horoscope I have an app on my phone. That gives me daily horoscopes and it's silly, but it also has like a tarot card reader.

14
00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:11.760
Joshua Lopez: I don't know how much you buy into that stuff. But I noticed the past couple of days. It's kind of full different cards, but at the same message. It's changes coming. It can be rough. It can be hard, but the sooner you embrace it. The sooner, things will get better for you, um,

15
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's amazing.

16
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.890
Joshua Lopez: Another one I pulled today was. It was called yet the card and it doesn't mean literal death. It just means

17
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.200
Joshua Lopez: A Death of

18
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:39.780
Joshua Lopez: Like an old situation and old relationship and it just same message, the sooner the sooner I can accept it. The sooner alter I'll return to a satisfying satisfying life and

19
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.660
Joshua Lopez: Try to try to see the

20
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.660
Joshua Lopez: The inside in that

21
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.260
Joshua Lopez: I apologize traffic is loud. I don't have an AC. So my windows are a little down

22
00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: For okay you don't do this very often, in fact, maybe once right so not very often, that's just fine. You're just fine.

23
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So what I'm hearing is

24
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Positive thought process its future oriented and I see you have your kids. So I want to ask you a question, but I'm not going to do it in front of your kids. Okay, I'll wait till you have some privacy.

25
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait till you're in private to ask

26
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple clinical questions.

27
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.060
Joshua Lopez: Just to see your kids. Gotcha. I'm probably like two minutes away from the house, I would have been there sooner but the

28
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.240
Joshua Lopez: People where I order food from forgot half of my order and I did I was halfway home and I

29
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.160
Joshua Lopez: Turned around because

30
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.670
Man.

31
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.930
Joshua Lopez: Like $15 worth of stuff that they forgot to give me so

32
00:03:46.230 --> 00:04:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do this. Do you hand. And this might not be good timing. But if it is we could do this on the front end of the session, while you're around your kiddos. And I would like to meet with you again next week. Do you have a sense of which days are off.

33
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.690
Joshua Lopez: My days off was supposed to be today and tomorrow, but they sprung up a training on me, so I don't get tomorrow off pitches.

34
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:26.280
Joshua Lopez: Pretty not upsetting just it kind of some kind of sucks because I just worked a three day stretch. I suppose that my two days off. And instead, I get one day off. And it's another three day stretch

35
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, which

36
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.150
Joshua Lopez: doesn't usually happen to me but it happens.

37
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

38
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.310
Joshua Lopez: At least I get paid for it.

39
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.970
Joshua Lopez: And they're

40
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Joshua Lopez: Going to spoil us with breakfast, lunch,

41
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So I definitely at a minimum, want to meet with you weekly for just the next two, three weeks just to make sure what you're talking about is really settled in that you've absorbed, what we're talking about right now and that there's no backslide

42
00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I can, I can meet with you. I can't tell if you're off this Thursday or Friday. My guess is you're working these next few days. Is that right, you're working all the way to Sunday.

43
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:15.270
Joshua Lopez: Yes, I'm probably I'm supposed to only be working Wednesday, Thursday, but if they sync up the training on Tuesday. So I'll have off, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, then I'm back to my long week

44
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:34.080
Joshua Lopez: I could let you know if they let me off this Thursday I did put in for PTO just because I lost a day with the kids. So I put in for time off Thursday I don't know yet if I got that day off. Yeah, just because I wanted to spend time with them. Yeah.

45
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see that. So I'm thinking what would just tell me if this would work. I'm

46
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of booking people before and after a training. I'm having on Friday and Saturday, would you be free at 310 on a fun this coming Friday. Just to follow up.

47
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.700
Joshua Lopez: Three fan this coming Friday I should be I should be

48
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.720
Joshua Lopez: should definitely be the free

49
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.040
Joshua Lopez: The only thing I got going Fridays, the kiddos are with me.

50
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.740
Joshua Lopez: And I just

51
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't want to pull from time at them, right.

52
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.950
Joshua Lopez: Um, preferably not, but I do believe that what we're talking about lately is been really helpful and meaningful.

53
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.240
Joshua Lopez: Definitely has your little text messages the past couple days were really enlightening.

54
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.600
Joshua Lopez: You say, How's your knee.

55
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you taught me that it was just having someone kind of care about what's going on for you, right. So then I thought, well, let's make sure we check in. So I'm glad that work that's that's its intent.

56
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so glad, so I'm

57
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So long week. So next week.

58

Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you might be off one of those days next week. Just curious. Looking to next week when

77
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of those feelings that we were talking about before.

78
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, are you able to talk freely now.

Joshua Lopez: Here you go.

83
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.190
Joshua Lopez: Daddy.

84
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.770
Joshua Lopez: I didn't know what you wanted on it. So I just

85
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.830
Joshua Lopez: Need you to stay here and

86
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.170
Joshua Lopez: That's yours, buddy.

87
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.030
Joshua Lopez: One thing.

88
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.940
Joshua Lopez: We're going to my room. You guys got this

89
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:22.950
Joshua Lopez: Thing.

90
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.420
Joshua Lopez: Okay.

91
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.920
Joshua Lopez: I'm so sorry. This is not how my day was planned out

92
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:48.060
Joshua Lopez: I got a pretty. I mean this for me sleeping in was like 730 this morning and no so good, especially after three days stretch

93
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:58.590
Joshua Lopez: I'm exhausted by Sunday when I have those long stretches, you know, probably, and a half hours I'm working properly for work at 37 and a half hours previous

94
00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.790
Joshua Lopez: To that

95
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:09.570
Joshua Lopez: That Sunday I am exhausted. I am one of my pet peeves when I get home from work. The first thing I do a shower. Yesterday I got home and I just

96
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:16.560
Joshua Lopez: brought myself on the couch. I'm so tired that I actually ordered doordash to deliver food to us.

97
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:25.830
Joshua Lopez: I fell asleep before you got here. My daughter woke me up and was like, Dad. Where's the food. And I was like, I'm they're supposed to bring it, you know, and

98
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:43.890
Joshua Lopez: Sure enough, like, five minutes later they got here, I ate, and I fell asleep on the floor. Watching TV with the kids and I was exhausted yesterday. So, this morning I got up 730 took the shower that I need is clean the house, then just kind of, kind of just

99
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:57.000
Joshua Lopez: Was lazy for about an hour. Then I. This was like, I'm hungry, I was pretty hungry so I ordered us food and I just my timing was horrible. Today I do apologize.

100
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so okay it's just fine. So let's move into other things so fine you know you can nibble have a little something to eat and

101
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to know if you've had any any after we met, did you continue to have suicidal ideation. Any thoughts or plans of following it through. What's that been like over the last few days.

102
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:30.030
Joshua Lopez: Um, was with a little sad right after we met. I did feel I did feel a lot better after we met.

103
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.330
Joshua Lopez: I don't think I realized

104
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.220
Joshua Lopez: The severity of that thought those thoughts until I saw your concern.

105
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:59.610
Joshua Lopez: Meeting with Dr. Aubrey our she kind of just like I see it in her face and her tone, just the concern there as well. And it just kind of made me made me like think about it, you know, just like you know, not in a bad way. Think about it, but more of

106
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.630
Joshua Lopez: You know, it made me realize the severity of it, you know.

107
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not. It's one of those

108
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: symptoms of depression, much like self injury. Some people cut themselves or burn themselves or some people start to want to kill someone else. Those are things that

109
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We really have to slow down and make sure we're taking care of our clients and make sure because that's not normal range stuff that's we've done outside of

110
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The typical spectrum of anger, depression, sad, we kind of we move and move in there for a while, we can call it grief, that's fine, you're grieving the loss.

111
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Of an expectation of a particular relationship and it makes sense that you would have some spare but getting to the point where you want to take your own life that takes more assertive intervention.

112
00:12:50.790 --> 00:13:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Than just validation. So I'm glad you heard that in my tone and my making sure you saw the doctor right away. He saw the urgency and then you snapped right and tell me more about what you realized that's at stake.

113
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.720
Joshua Lopez: Just

114
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:20.880
Joshua Lopez: How serious, it seemed, you know, like we don't have don't have a lot of people that could probably pick up on something like that. If I saw them on a daily basis. They might notice

115
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.130
Joshua Lopez: That I'm drowning, or you know that I was kind of floundering

116
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:33.840
Joshua Lopez: So just actually saying it out loud. It was probably the first time I've ever said that out loud, and it just

117
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.460
Joshua Lopez: You know, just sharing something that

118
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.210
Joshua Lopez: That surreal. You know, it just

119
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.920
Joshua Lopez: Men like I said just just seeing your doc Rob reality reaction kind of made me

120
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.630
Joshua Lopez: It made me snap to the severity of it just

121
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.240
Joshua Lopez: You know,

122
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:06.330
Joshua Lopez: And since then, I do notice the medication that she prescribed is one that I was already on for smoking.

123
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:25.440
Joshua Lopez: It was called a light or mild antidepressant and it was supposed to help with smoking, but she told me to take that for a week and then I can double the dose and it'll be more of an anti depressant because I kind of got lazy with taking it and I hadn't taken it.

124
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.910
Joshua Lopez: So the past few days that I've taken it. I've noticed that

125
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:38.340
Joshua Lopez: When I do get really down in sad. It's not as long, it's

126
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.400
Joshua Lopez: Okay, you know what I mean, it's

127
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.390
You

128
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.040
Joshua Lopez: Um,

129
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It moves in and and it passes.

130
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The intensity, duration is going down.

131
00:14:50.190 --> 00:15:04.260
Joshua Lopez: Yes. Yes. Where is prior. It was once I fell down that path that was so hard to dig myself out of it. Whereas now, it's like hits me I'm sad and then

132
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.160
Joshua Lopez: Five minutes later, I'm okay.

133
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so the duration of the despair last about five minutes. Now I had invited you to go on a particular type of detox to abstain from some particular behavior to remember what that was.

134
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.060
Joshua Lopez: Face at the moment, no. You say,

135
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.670
Joshua Lopez: What was that Facebook. Oh, um,

136
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:45.570
Joshua Lopez: I do, I do get on there just to see certain things. I don't get tempted to look at her profile or anything I mainly do it because I

137
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.960
Joshua Lopez: Just feel alone, sometimes and seeing what people pose to have my cousin's on there.

138
00:15:53.430 --> 00:16:10.260
Joshua Lopez: You know, they'll have pictures of their kids are, you know, they mean and I just put a like my cousin Marisa has a really cute baby you know put, like, oh, she's precious and to text back and just little things like that. I haven't really wild on there or

139
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.770
Joshua Lopez: been tempted to look at anything else.

140
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to throw something out and it's probably going to make you a little uncomfortable, but I want to see.

141
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can sit with it, just to even entertain the idea. So thinking about how

142
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: In recovery. One of the first things that we asked, right, is we say, change the people change the places, change the things. If it's not nearby. And when I do have the thought. I won't have it right here.

143
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be a fraction of a second away. No, it won't be in the house and won't be in my neighborhood. It won't be my cell phone. I won't be hanging out with those people not already going, I don't drive down that same street.

144
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything about people, places and things has changed, which should make

145
00:16:52.770 --> 00:17:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Resisting the impulse to go get a pill right that much easier because it's not right there, which means we have time to think it through. And think about the consequences.

146
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to throw something at you. That would be paralleling what that is and that is much like I invite clients to call

147
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell their connect. Hey, stop offering me pills. Don't call me ever again lose my number.

148
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact, I might even change my phone number, all together. That's hardcore that's taking recovery quite seriously, I'm done. That's severing the ties. So this would be a parallel to that. And that would be, Hey, Jacqueline, can you unfriend me

149
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.890
Joshua Lopez: Um, we've never been friends on Facebook.

150
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So she shares publicly. And so you just breeze across it. Is that right,

151
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.720
Joshua Lopez: Um, honestly, it was private

152
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:59.730
Joshua Lopez: It was private for the longest time and that particular day, I just saw a new picture of her and I clicked on it. And notice, it was actually not a private anymore and that's when I

153
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.270
Joshua Lopez: Had to curiosity got the best of me.

154
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.430
Joshua Lopez: And I started to

155
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.020
Joshua Lopez: Started to browse through it and I shouldn't have.

156
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.820
Joshua Lopez: But I guess what I could do

157
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.430
Joshua Lopez: Stupid truck is now I'm what I could do is

158
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.940
Joshua Lopez: You know how you get suggested friends on there.

159
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:35.160
Joshua Lopez: And you do have an option to remove them as a suggested friend. Yes. What I could do the next time I see I can remove. You know what I mean.

160
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. And not only that, notice what comes up for you.

161
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to

162
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Be proactive with that and say, I just don't want to know. I'd either block me unfriend whatever you need to do. I it's I've got to get over you.

163
00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that's the truth of it. I mean, she knows right it's your you're in process. There's no mystery here.

164
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't need the notice you said the curiosity got the best of me. Well, that was the other day. There's no reason to think another thing might come rolling through. And guess what, here we are again.

165
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to minimize that the chocolates, not in the cupboard. We don't want it there. We want it left at the store. Leave it don't buy it.

166
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And even if you say to yourself for a little while. I want to go back, you know, once I kind of move through this grief process. And I want to be able to share

167
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Because other family members and this and that. And the kids and we want to have an even flow. But for now, it's too much. I don't want to know.

168
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So my saying I'd like to know what's going on for you as an even entertaining bringing up the idea of you kind of severing connection even further. What, what are you thinking about what's happening for you.

169
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.370
I'm

170
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:59.310
Joshua Lopez: I'm a little like I want to remove her from the suggested friends, but I also don't want to see that picture of her

171
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:14.160
Joshua Lopez: So you know what I mean, like it's gotten to the point where I get on Facebook and the suggestive friends pop up and i don't i don't scroll left to see if she's there are not in it. I mean, I just, I see the suggested friends and I, right away, swipe up. So I don't see

172
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: An ad. Oh.

173
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.620
Joshua Lopez: So remember, I would have to actively look for her.

174
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.510
Joshua Lopez: Profile, so I can remove it.

175
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your friend could do it.

176
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.470
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

177
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you could have the phone. Say, listen, this just because it's going to piss me off, you know, however you talk to your friend just going to

178
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Be heartbroken. Again, I don't know how you talk to them, say, hey, just try it. Let's unfriend this the and let's okay because then you're not in it. But then you've you've made an actual manifestation of what you're talking about. It's an actual movement towards that.

179
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You made real what was just philosophical in your head. You're making it real.

180
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So give it something I'm you do what you're going to do, but it's just out there, something to consider. Which means you're closing an exit. That's what that is it's closing the exit.

181
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Your closing the door to that chapter or closing the book or flipping the page that chapter just stick with the same metaphor.

182
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me, tell me more about what you notice, while you're at work and looking at people. What you noticed

183
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.280
Joshua Lopez: I'm

184
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.380
Joshua Lopez: At work, it just kinda just grind through my day.

185
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.740
Joshua Lopez: I try to stay as busy as I can.

186
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.460
Joshua Lopez: There's times where I could just chill out in the control room because we have to watch our equipment or screen.

187
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.960
Joshua Lopez: But rather than do that, I tried to find something else to do.

188
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.510
Joshua Lopez: Yesterday packaging.

189
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:57.480
Joshua Lopez: Went down and I don't know if I described too much to you about my job, but I'm in

190
00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, I don't know what you're doing.

191
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:05.310
Joshua Lopez: I'm in processing so i i i run what they call slurry.

192
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:12.090
Joshua Lopez: Twin screw is also processing and they make like the dough. They have

193
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:18.480
Joshua Lopez: It's literally like this giant screw that pushes the dough through and it cuts it into the sheet of material we need

194
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.770
Joshua Lopez: And then it comes

195
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:26.370
Joshua Lopez: To me where I make slurry, which is a combination of different things. It's

196
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.250
Joshua Lopez: Like for instance, if I'm doing receive PCs cereal, the receipt puffs.

197
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:39.180
Joshua Lopez: All all in my slurry makeup kettle. I will dump like 200 pounds of cocoa sweetener.

198
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:48.420
Joshua Lopez: Salt, all that stuff. And then it goes into a kettle were both ingredients are added like canola oil and stuff. And it makes what they call the slurry.

199
00:22:48.870 --> 00:23:04.230
Joshua Lopez: And then I also have vitamin kettles where I make these big batches of vitamins and that all gets transferred through a line into what we call an introvert, like a giant barrel that flips the cereal and it coated with the slurry the vitamins, all that stuff.

200
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.840
Joshua Lopez: For me, it goes into packaging where they put it in boxes bags, whatever.

201
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:21.900
Joshua Lopez: But yesterday packaging went down which shut me down which twins crew down so we are down in there's no town. And how long were down for most guys are just gonna

202
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:35.160
Joshua Lopez: Kind of be lazy and be like, wow, we're down you know me, I, I still have a trainer, but he cut the training wheels off like week two. He's like, I'm confident in you, you know, I'm here. If you need me.

203
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:43.410
Joshua Lopez: But you're, you're basically on your own, you know, but I'm always here if you need it. And yesterday I hunted him down and was like a man. We're down

204
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.350
Joshua Lopez: Is there some work orders that I could do

205
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:58.590
Joshua Lopez: And work orders are kind of like preventive maintenance or things that, like people notice were broken or damaged and when your systems down, you have an opportunity to work on these things.

206
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:06.510
Joshua Lopez: And that's what I immediately did. I was like, hey man, we're down there. Some work orders. I can do to stay busy. I don't want to go idle. I don't want to

207
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:15.120
Joshua Lopez: Get tired. I'll get lazy. I just, you know what I mean. So he printed me up a few work orders and one of them was a little more than I can handle it was a

208
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:28.080
Joshua Lopez: Little advance you know it called for somebody who knew the equipment, a little better. But I did my best and it occupied about four hours of my day and they kept me busy. So I just try to stay busy.

209
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:39.540
Joshua Lopez: I tried to keep my mind from going idle and when I get home. I tried to get excited about coming home, even if my kids aren't here, I just

210
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:47.160
Joshua Lopez: Hey, you got a nice house, you can afford to eat whatever the heck you want, what are you going to get for dinner tonight you know cuz

211
00:24:48.150 --> 00:25:02.940
Joshua Lopez: I'm trying to look on the bright side of things. I'm not saying I'm making great tons of money but I make enough to be comfortable, you know, and I'm noticing it the other day splurged and bought me some sunglasses.

212
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.180
Joshua Lopez: And I'm excited about those coming in.

213
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:15.840
Joshua Lopez: You know, it's pretty cool. It just, I never I had been a while since I had the means to do stuff like this, you know, I was

214
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.850
Joshua Lopez: I needed to get off my ass.

215
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:30.930
Joshua Lopez: And it just, it feels good lately I'm noticing focusing on that, hey, you have the money to buy this or you have the money to do this or you you know to mean it's just

216
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:40.350
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, it just that that's kind of where I've been at, like I said, just trying to be excited about the future.

217
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's the key, the things you're talking about which are

218
00:25:47.280 --> 00:26:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Developing the relationship with this male friend of yours, spending time staying busy right and you fantasy sort of in this future oriented itself like giving imagining letting yourself. Imagine so that part getting excited about the future.

219
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit of what is possible in your imagination, what is possible. What's a great thing that could happen.

220
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:14.310
Joshua Lopez: Um,

221
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.590
Joshua Lopez: I knew bill goal, like a new car. I got showing you

222
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.410
Joshua Lopez: When I was talking to you in the car I'm roasting. There's no AC and

223
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.270
Joshua Lopez: I'm dying. So like a new car excites me

224
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:46.260
Joshua Lopez: Another thing that I didn't really think about to the other day was I've been trying these dating apps. And I kind of got discouraged. I haven't really really met anybody and then you were like, whoa printed up a sign that you're not ready.

225
00:26:48.000 --> 00:27:02.040
Joshua Lopez: To need to be a sign that the universe is telling you, you know, this and that and then it made me think like there's a possibility I could meet somebody that I'm attracted to that I can you know what i mean that I can

226
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:09.270
Joshua Lopez: appreciate them and they can appreciate me and there's no lies. There's no secrets. There's no

227
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.460
Joshua Lopez: You know,

228
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.050
Joshua Lopez: So that kind of excited me and then like

229
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:30.330
Joshua Lopez: this coming Thursday. I'm hoping I get that PTO so that way I can have time to rest because one day off and then three days on again will be rough for like Thursday. I'm looking forward to Thursday my bills will have been paid and

230
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.590
Joshua Lopez: Things are slowly opening. I wanted to take the kids out and just

231
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:44.640
Joshua Lopez: Buy him something nice. It's been a while since I treated them to something I'm definitely treated myself to a really nice pair of sunglasses that

232
00:27:45.450 --> 00:28:00.450
Joshua Lopez: On a treat them to something and just being excited that I can do that without hurting anybody without borrowing without, you know what I mean. I didn't have to lie, cheat or steal to do it, you know, um,

233
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

234
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: If I were to put a I mean do you want this new vehicle is that front and center so that I could even write a goal.

235
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could update me each month telling me how much you have saved because I wonder about you. Sometimes if it's

236
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: really tempting to just give your kid stuff versus getting that new vehicle and I will. I don't really know only, you know, but is it possible that, I mean, you tell me how great are you at saving is this one of those areas that there's some some challenges.

237
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you froze up hopefully I'll be back. Well, yeah, we got to say 20 $300

238
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Client will save money each paycheck and here for, as evidenced by self report.

239
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's achieved already have that one increase self confidence.

240
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.340
Joshua Lopez: So, sorry about that.

241
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.400
Joshua Lopez: Data. So when I got home, I didn't switch to my wife, I

242
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:37.350
Joshua Lopez: And in the middle of that conversation, my data ran out and you switched to my Wi Fi and it like throws you and

243
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.120
Joshua Lopez: So I thought the quickest solution where to be to leave in to rejoin

244
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a problem. I deal with this all day long. No worries. So my question was whether

245
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like what you did with your apartment. We could do the same thing with the vehicle were kind of in the back of your mind, you'll no one's going to ask me how I'm doing

246
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So I could go buy this throwaway toy for my child. But instead, I'm going to take this, you know,

247
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: $75 and I'm going to put it in the savings which is going to get us a vehicle, right, which is probably also going to be connected to dating to

248
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's all connected. You know, then you have a comfortable environment for your kids as well. So you tell me I will all stop typing. If it's not something you want to do, though, if it's not a real goal that you want me to check in on. Oh.

249
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.100
Absolutely.

250
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:38.400
Joshua Lopez: I've kind of had this in the back of my head like, once I got my furniture. Once I spoil myself a little bit, you know, like

251
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:47.250
Joshua Lopez: I had been wanting pair of glasses. I've been wanting a little cologne. A nice, you know, nice cologne.

252
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:59.430
Joshua Lopez: Then I wanted to just spoil the kid just a little bit and I had this in the back of my head like after, after I get all my furniture. After I buy these little things in life that I've been wanting to do

253
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:07.650
Joshua Lopez: That I'm going to set a goal, like maybe two to three months to see, but as much as I possibly can.

254
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:17.010
Joshua Lopez: And hopefully by then the little steps that I've taken to better my credit. Hopefully by demo of it, you know, to me, because I'm also we we talked about this in the past.

255
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:29.580
Joshua Lopez: So I'm hoping that once my credit goes up a little bit. Plus, I want to see at least three to $4,000 in about three to four months, which is very doable.

256
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:37.980
