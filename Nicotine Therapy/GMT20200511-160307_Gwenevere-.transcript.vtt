00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're you're at work.

7
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.160
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah I am, but I so I went to an empty room. Oh.

8
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.660
Jaime Crouchet: I have somebody here working the desk so

9
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.340
Jaime Crouchet: You have my full attention today.

10
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe try and stack that phone somewhere so it doesn't

11
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it.

12
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding and I'm going to open up a note, while you're doing that.

13
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.430
Okay.

14
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.600
Jaime Crouchet: Perfect.

15
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

16
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So, well, I'm

17
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of opening up a note to sort of take a look. Reflect back to her prior session or kind of how your week has been just get a sense of, maybe some place that you want to discuss or share or focus on

18
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To set your intention to that.

19
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.720
Jaime Crouchet: Doors the doors. I know.

20
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.490
Jaime Crouchet: That's

21
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.330
Jaime Crouchet: Not

22
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sneak peek into your world. They're denied.

23
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.300
Jaime Crouchet: He's the only one that knows I'm in this room, too. So of course he would knock

24
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that that doesn't bother you that kind of attitude, etc. You just kind of work it out.

25
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.540
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, he's mad because he, that was the maintenance guy.

26
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.350
And

27
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.960
Jaime Crouchet: So the last couple weeks. My boss has really been writing me about occupancy and making up for the last month or and

28
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.930
Jaime Crouchet: And so me and my revenue manager, we decided to drop our rates are super low to $31 a night on

29
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy cow.

30
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.820
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, which is definitely the lowest rates in town.

31
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.180
Jaime Crouchet: even lower than Motel six Motel six is at 50 bucks. Yeah. So you can imagine the riffraff but that's bringing in. And so

32
00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.010
Jaime Crouchet: I've been having to kind of retrain staff on what to look out for, and how to manage that kind of thing anyway. We've had a lot more graffiti.

33
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He was

34
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.340
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, he was showing me a picture of somebody tagged the elevator door. And so he's pretty furious about it.

35
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.820
Jaime Crouchet: But

36
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.520
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

37
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.550
Jaime Crouchet: We're gonna have to bring our rates back up here pretty soon, because it's just causing too much damage to the property.

38
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: As ending up costing right it's such an interesting

39
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not

40
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.790
Right.

41
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.090
Jaime Crouchet: Right, and I

42
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:49.950
Jaime Crouchet: Mean it's manageable. I've done this at other properties before in it. It's absolutely manageable. You just have to this this team here is just so underdeveloped that they're just it's just going to take time to get them to that place. No.

43
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you notice when I invited you kind of consider where you wanted to focus today what came up

44
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.070
Jaime Crouchet: Um, well. So a couple of things I did want to ask

45
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.170
Jaime Crouchet: Goodness.

46
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Phone doesn't want to stay

47
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.560
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, I think I got it now some weight behind it.

48
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.300
Jaime Crouchet: So actually, so there is one thing that I want to talk to you about

49
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.890
Jaime Crouchet: Is um

50
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.000
Jaime Crouchet: It doesn't really have anything to do with canceling part, I guess, but

51
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:38.280
Jaime Crouchet: I'm, I'm kind of scared because I'm and it's been only happening at night, but my heart is beating weird at night.

52
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.150
Oh,

53
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.640
Jaime Crouchet: Like, I feel

54
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:52.740
Jaime Crouchet: Like, it'll be really hard, like a couple beats. I can even feel the pressure in my head. And sometimes it happens to where it even takes my breath away.

55
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: On how long does that last

56
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.990
Jaime Crouchet: It only lasts a couple seconds.

57
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.770
Jaime Crouchet: And it does happen maybe periodically throughout the day. Maybe once, maybe twice a day.

58
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.690
Jaime Crouchet: But it definitely like when I go to bed at night. It happens a lot.

59
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.280
Jaime Crouchet: And

60
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: How many, how many times is a lot

61
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.740
Jaime Crouchet: Of uh like I'd say like I'm I lay in bed fully an hour before I go to sleep. And it happens.

62
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.540
Jaime Crouchet: Gosh, I'd say probably every 1015 minutes

63
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:41.910
Jaime Crouchet: So, and this happened, this has happened to me before, and I was seeing a primary care doctor

64
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.050
Jaime Crouchet: And it happened one day when I was driving, but it was the worst thing that ever happened. And I even

65
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:58.170
Jaime Crouchet: I could feel it coming on. When I was driving. So I heard it all of a sudden, everything started going bright white. And so I hurried and pulled over.

66
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:12.060
Jaime Crouchet: And I just, and also I there was just so much pressure and everything was white. I had to throw it in park and it was just very scary. And so I did tell my doctor about it at that time and she

67
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:23.490
Jaime Crouchet: She didn't really look into anything she just said, You know, I was explaining to her what was happening. And she said something about her explanation was

68
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.330
Jaime Crouchet: Is that

69
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.680
Jaime Crouchet: The, the electric shock that goes through our heart, she was saying, it sounds like it's skipping through my heart.

70
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

71
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.440
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, that makes sense to you.

72
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But she didn't label it a particular heart condition, some sort of a rhythm Nia or something.

73
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.490
Jaime Crouchet: She just said no.

74
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You just gave you the technical description.

75
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:55.710
Jaime Crouchet: Right. And I kept telling her that I was scared. And she said, yeah, I know it feels scary and it sounds scary, but she says not anything that's going to kill me.

76
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.620
Jaime Crouchet: But I'm worried I worry about blood clots. I worry about all that stuff.

77
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.280
Okay.

78
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's get a little bit more history. This episode of what you just described has been these 10 to 15 minutes

79
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Every 10 to 15 minutes between what like five o'clock at night or nine o'clock at night.

80
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.470
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I say,

81
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:37.470
Jaime Crouchet: Anywhere between like when I go to bed. So usually anywhere between like eight and 11 o'clock at night. And this is, you know, it's the last several years. It's happens periodically, but it's it's really bad. It's, it's never been an everyday thing for me. And that's what's scaring me.

82
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so was curiosity.

83
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the course of the last few years.

84
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.790
Jaime Crouchet: I'd say probably five years since I moved here. Yeah, okay.

85
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but never

86
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Until now, has it been daily

87
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.510
Jaime Crouchet: Right, it's probably been the last two weeks. It's been daily

88
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

89
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see any parallels between stress level. Do you see any parallels between things like the that that quantity in peace or tapering or any, anything else you can kind of we look for.

90
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Malicious look at medic medicine for a second and see if there's any connection or anything similar or anything changed. Right. Well, this is really different than these five years.

91
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:49.080
Jaime Crouchet: So when it's happened the last several years. I felt like it was more of a stress thing, you know, it seemed to happen more when I was, you know, in high moments of stress. I mean moments of high stress and

92
00:09:50.640 --> 00:10:07.500
Jaime Crouchet: But the last couple weeks I've been trying to really pay attention to it. And, you know, at night. I'm really trying to relax and shut off the TV and just kind of lay there peacefully and it's still happening but so i don't know i really i I am trying to figure it out.

93
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.940
Jaime Crouchet: I don't notice anything different that I've done.

94
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So these last two weeks.

95
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really worsened.

96
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

97
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.310
Jaime Crouchet: I should probably find a primary care huh

98
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean I think let's I like the team approach as many minds working at something as possible. I like it. I do. Okay, so let's let's add that. So you're sort of that homework is going to be kind of getting primary care appointments set up.

99
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.550
Yeah.

100
00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So the, the other piece sort of from the psychological part or the psycho biological

101
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.990
Mm hmm.

102
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just write the piece.

103
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Well yes exam.

104
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

105
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We'd like to think that we're in control of her body. We'd like to think that it runs perfectly all the time, but it doesn't. And if it turns out that there is a connection to to a stress connection.

106
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you hold this space, but since you said that there's some history of it being associated with increased stress. It could be that there's something about your day where there was a smell a site or laying down in bed.

107
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it may be almost an unconscious thought that's coming up. It could be

108
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: A trigger right a, what do you call it, not a precursor. But, uh,

109
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah precursor until I get the right word.

110
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Before. So in the past has led to some negative outcome. And now the something's reminding the unconscious mind, perhaps. So if you just go psychological for a second. If you can open

111
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of your mind to this idea that possibly what's happening is you think on laying in bed. What am I, stressing I'm ready for rest. I'm not particularly fretting over anything

112
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But your body might be responding to some familiar laying down

113
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be reminded of a smell a site something going on that you might not be conscious of. So I hold that space, right, I mean, that's kind of what I do is I wonder, I wonder if the body's remembering something or there's a

114
00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something that's triggering it to to a familiar stress response in the past.

115
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't, I don't know what that is.

116
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.070
Jaime Crouchet: Of course, yeah.

117
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.360
I'm wondering

118
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:20.670
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I mean, that could be. I mean, I mean it. Maybe that's why it continued on for two weeks because you know my dad died from a pulmonary embolism, and I have had like your rational fears about blood clots ever since.

119
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.300
Jaime Crouchet: Maybe because that's my first thought when it starts happening is, holy crap blood clots, because I can even feel the pressure in my head. And so it gets scary.

120
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also then it starts to make me think, when are you taking the quantity and could that be a part of it. Could that are you taking any during the day, just want to check

121
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:55.230
Jaime Crouchet: I haven't so it's been probably since I've even taken any quantity and it's probably been a good three weeks. I haven't felt like I needed it. So,

122
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the moment when you feel

123
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The. Let me see how you described it.

124
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, beating really hard.

125
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.750
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, it's almost like it's skipping beats or something. No.

126
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.500
Jaime Crouchet: That's, yeah.

127
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have beating heart and that's why I'm coming back to your description. So it's as if the rhythm changed.

128
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

129
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. So

130
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Beating hard. I think it's pushing more blood through the way I would after I did a little sprint down the block, but that's not it. This is about the rhythm changed.

131
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.560
Jaime Crouchet: Right.

132
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to change it from beating really hard. Do you think I should take that out and put the rhythm. It's as if it skipped a beat a regular rhythm.

133
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.630
Jaime Crouchet: It's kind of a mix between both honestly

134
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:03.210
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah. Cuz it'll like skip a beat and then it's almost like it just goes through

135
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.130
Jaime Crouchet: And then

136
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:13.590
Jaime Crouchet: Like it's weird how it and I can feel it like it's like it's beating harder. I don't know how to explain it.

137
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Describing just coincidentally, I definitely what you're describing, I would describe something that I've had. I would say, I've had that. And

138
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

139
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that it's the same experience. But I just wanted to share that. That sounds familiar, like you don't sound insane to me, you sound like a heart does that. Well, I only know mine. I'm not a pulmonary specialist or something, but I know it's done that and it certainly gets my attention.

140
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wonder, what is that, and so sometimes for me it's I

141
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: literally have to roll over the other way.

142
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If I lay on a particular side. I don't know why. That makes no sense to me. But it does seem to do something.

143
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It puts I don't know the etiology of it, but I know that what I do to try to solve it. I don't stay static. So now we'll take that. What do you do to problem solve. When you notice that change.

144
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:36.750
Jaime Crouchet: I will take a few deep breaths and I feel like when it at so like at night when it keeps happening over and over, like I'll stop and I'll take several deep breaths and I feel like that that for a long bit in between.

145
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That prolongs it

146
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.140
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

147
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.270
Jaime Crouchet: And in between times it happens.

148
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So prologue means that it does reduce

149
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The next time that it happens, it puts a little bit more time in between.

150
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.250
That breathe.

151
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.850
Jaime Crouchet: Just taking some deep breaths. Yeah.

152
00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

153
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just say prolongs the next event. So the next time that weird really hard, mixed with changing rhythm beat skipping

154
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.770
Jaime Crouchet: Skipping

155
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It does help with the breathing. So maybe something about that.

156
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Breath sort of

157
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.260
Reset.

158
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if there was something there, and sort of stretches it out, maybe right. I have no idea.

159
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:31.680
Jaime Crouchet: Right. It makes it, it just makes me think, like, maybe it maybe it is stress, maybe I'm stressing more than I think

160
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:34.920
Jaime Crouchet: I don't know.

161
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Either I don't either.

162
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we did. What if we, again, we looked at it from a team approach. And we, we, problem solved it from all the resources, you're going to go ahead and you're going to get primary care.

163
00:17:48.180 --> 00:18:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Input so you can have that checked. You can have things like you know cholesterol and all that stuff kind of looked at and of course that physician will know you have sort of a genetic history.

164
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's that. And then there's this awareness of a stress response and

165
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's good to know, hey, the breathing does sort of

166
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.440
Jaime Crouchet: I feel like it helps. Yeah.

167
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe investigating more into that. So you're laying. Is it something like this, you're laying in bed and you have, like, hands down, you're looking at TV or is it laying in bed have laptop on stomach like what, what do you actually how you lay

168
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.190
Jaime Crouchet: Around. I mean, I, yeah, I usually have my laptop.

169
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.630
Jaime Crouchet: I have to

170
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I do. I do some work every night before I go to bed.

171
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sitting upright with

172
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:53.070
Jaime Crouchet: Kind of, I mean I'm laying back in bed. I have some tomatoes prop behind me and I have my laptop there.

173
00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe playing with you know how I said, you know, and I'm laying it seems to put weird pressure something just to play with it, just so that you're even more informed when you do meet with the primary care, you could say, well, this is what I went out at just to rule out some things

174
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Setting up putting more open into the chest, putting more right space in there and seeing if you can do that belly breathing.

175
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, creating even more room and yes and convene, you got it set up where you were scrunched down before kind of half up half lane, but maybe sitting up and seeing

176
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, if this is something other than right an actual heart events. This is just some sort of stress response if I do this, breathing and I turn in, and I see how I'm doing

177
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens. Okay, well, how now,

178
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Will it happen again. Is it happening now.

179
00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you turn away and then you get back into your laptop, but just play with a couple of things just to see what happens. We're

180
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Pulling arms out and saying, Okay, right, I got you. I feel you. Okay, um, because the other one was, oh my gosh, that's how my dad passed away. And so what I'm wondering is if we kind of get away from that one.

181
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And more into the actual felt sense of it just for further investigation to see what happens. See if it lightens up a little bit. If it stays

182
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.500
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll start doing that.

183
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I also see

184
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:34.920
What

185
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we need more on on the heart because I'm kind of limited

186
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay. All right.

187
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.470
I don't know.

188
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.190
Jaime Crouchet: We I went out on two dates.

189
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.740
Jaime Crouchet: So I'm trying to do stuff to distract me from Greg Right.

190
00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:10.950
Jaime Crouchet: And so there was one of them's a guest that is always here every weekend and another one.

191
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:33.630
Jaime Crouchet: One of my co workers friends of the family guy right and so both times because everything's closed. We just went to the park. One of the first one he brought his dog with them. We just went to the park, but both times. So one of them's definitely not my type probably not gonna work.

192
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:43.980
Jaime Crouchet: But the other one. I feel like under normal circumstances, I would totally go out on a date. Again, very good looking very sweet.

193
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.690
Jaime Crouchet: But both times that I got home, I just cried myself to sleep.

194
00:21:52.440 --> 00:22:00.720
Jaime Crouchet: Oh, and I have known like am both reached out to me again and I have completely ignored, both of them.

195
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.120
Jaime Crouchet: Like I have no desire for it at all. And I don't like this feeling

196
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no desire for what finish that con

197
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.650
Jaime Crouchet: Low desire to

198
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:29.820
Jaime Crouchet: Date or spend time with anybody, any other man, I guess.

199
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

200
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You actually felt something

201
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.460
Do you know what that was.

202
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What the feeling was

203
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:59.100
Jaime Crouchet: No, I don't even know why I was trying. I just like I even feel emotional better right now. I don't know where it's coming from. I don't know.

204
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This could very well be your sort of this split brain right, your left brain has stored information. It's got sequences got language. It's got all these things the right brain.

205
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's one probably making you cry, but you don't have a description for it. So this like this this disconnect between different sides of the brain. If that might be what's going on.

206
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember like just now. Right. What does it mean to you that

207
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like this guy. I do like these things about this guy, this one, I kind of find interesting. But then once you walk in the door in your home.

208
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice started crying. As soon as you close the door.

209
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.550
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I just

210
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.130
Jaime Crouchet: Don't even I, I really I don't even know how to work. I don't know. I really

211
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.110
Jaime Crouchet: Like, even when I'm on the date I have no desire to be there.

212
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

213
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you could, would you prefer to be texting grey.

214
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.430
Jaime Crouchet: Yes.

215
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.200
Yeah.

216
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You did that for a long time. So, this feels really different.

217
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you. Do you couldn't come in.

218
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And innocence. Nevermind that it's dating another man but you couldn't share the events of your day.

219
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:05.820
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah I know I have noticed that that absolutely bothers me. Like when stuff happens at work or, you know,

220
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:14.190
Jaime Crouchet: Anything good or bad. I normally would talk to Greg about those things. And I noticed that for sure. Now, but he's not there.

221
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet, and even

222
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.060
I

223
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:28.110
Jaime Crouchet: Just, I feel like what's throwing me off here is that I never ever been through this ever

224
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:44.880
Jaime Crouchet: Like I feel like in the past and my whole 38 years of life. Every time I've been through a breakup. I've been able to just accept it and move on and not ever think about it why I can't shake this one is driving me crazy.

225
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So we actually spent quite a bit of work in there. Let me take a look at our notes from before.

226
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember anything from our last session.

227
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.380
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

228
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

229
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.100
Jaime Crouchet: What we talked about how

230
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.100
Jaime Crouchet: You know, it could possibly be some miscommunication there. We talked about

231
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.150
Jaime Crouchet: You know, things that I

232
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.720
Jaime Crouchet: Said that I shouldn't have said that. I wouldn't have said if I would have just heard them out. There's

233
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.030
Jaime Crouchet: We talked about doing things to distract me

234
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the things I see there is a real focus on on a self perception around importance.

235
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:45.930
Yeah.

236
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a negative cognition is right in the middle of the note.

237
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see where we go through this one.

238
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:58.920
Jaime Crouchet: Okay.

239
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be some versus me sitting here skimming it while you're staring at me.

240
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Break up still bothers me.

241
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, even now, I'm feeling, emotional, much like what you just did right

242
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been making it a point to talk to my family every game reaching out to friends here and trying to stay busy.

243
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I have had heartbreaks before, but this is the first time it has gone on for this long and some. It's a lot like what you just said.

244
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Three years ago me. Um, I don't know what I'm thinking the same thing.

245
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just did that I feel like I'm going 100 miles an hour. Nothing makes any sense.

246
00:27:50.670 --> 00:28:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Him. Telling me he was talking to his daughter, it would not have gone that way, would have been 100% fine quote. I'm glad to hear from you and I'm glad you're okay like that was the piece that didn't get done right.

247
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm glad to hear from you. I'm glad you're okay. That would have it would have gone differently you predicted

248
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:12.900
Jaime Crouchet: Right.

249
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Time I was worried sick about him when I jumped on the other app and saw him online. My mind went straight to negative. He had the ability to take the worry away.

250
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And he chose not to.

251
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: self perception. So I probably check did an inquiry into you ready. How you doing, what's your awareness of this I go wrong.

252
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.230
All the time.

253
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't

254
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to have somebody who takes their emotions out on him all the time. It shouldn't be this way, every other breakup makes sense. There is an ending

255
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:57.360
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

256
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: On doesn't make sense, does not feel right. I don't get how we were together, five years.

257
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then nothing

258
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I was just insecure, the negative cognition, I am important

259
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: From outcome I would tell him how I really feel so if you didn't care about what he was going to think what you were exploring was I could tell him how I really feel it makes sense why I am still sitting with it. There are loosens and so much regret.

260
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how to let it go. I don't want to feel this way anymore.

261
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So that what I just said. What did it make you think about

262
00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:03.120
Jaime Crouchet: Well that possibly that's why that I mean, maybe that's why I'm having such a hard time with it is that I have that regret and

263
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.770
Jaime Crouchet: And there were every I feel like there's somebody loose ends to it.

264
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.030
Jaime Crouchet: So maybe that's why. Maybe that's why it's I'm having a hard time with it.

265
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not quite media. Now is it that doesn't quite give the explanation. It sort of

266
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of the the sugar coating of the m&m it doesn't quite get to the chocolate, does it

267
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we already said, we already covered regret in here. We already covered this loosens it's not quite at the chocolate center.

268
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds. It's not enough to just say I have regret and there's loose ends.

269
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, longing to want to know what those loose ends are

270
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.230
Jaime Crouchet: Right. Yes.

271
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we're not quite to the center.

272
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep listening for it, though. Is it weird to hear your own words back at you, here and there.

273
00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:59.310
Yeah.

274
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be interesting to see your response, so hang in there for it. Okay.

275
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, I don't want to feel this way anymore. Worst case scenario. So I probably did the play it all the way through telling Greg He

276
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be if i told Greg He would be silent, and I would be rejected. I would sit. I will encourage or I will sit with rejection and shortly after this

277
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I sent a message to him and he's not responded, I am scared of rejection. I don't want to tell someone how I feel. And it not matter to them.

278
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: not mattering to someone, I would have to wait until it is over, and I won't feel it anymore. It is hard to think past. It has been an ache in my chest for three months now.

279
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopefully I will be over it in seven months. No idea because we were playing it forward. Somehow I no idea what would take its place some ache, as in childhood.

280
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Same ache, as in childhood. I'm not sure how it will go away, even in seven months, maybe I can start dating, but I don't want to

281
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive cognition was, I'm okay.

282
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Other outcome if I would have been honest with him about what I felt. And it still ended, I would have hated that.

283
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When I put the emotion away and use logic. I think he cannot give me the relationship. I deserve.

284
00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It is 100% like him. We have had the conversation. So there's probably something little pieces that you had said my transcriptionist put those pieces together.

285
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not stuff. So I'm the notes would be like

286
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Of I am important

287
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I run a multimillion dollar business, every day I have 30 people in my staff that rely on me, my son relies on me for emotional stability every day.

288
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Sons internal dialogue is terrible gets overly emotional about certain situations and silly things in life has fight with a girlfriend and thinks he's a terrible person and does not deserve to live goes from zero to 100

289
00:33:48.210 --> 00:34:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Importance to self. I don't know. I don't worry about myself very much, especially when it comes to the bad parts invited self value self reflection I need to figure out how to be better to myself.

290
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are you noticing as you're listening.

291
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:27.870
Jaime Crouchet: Like I almost like if you're reading that and you're reading, like if I I was picturing it coming from somebody else, like you're just telling me about somebody felt bad

292
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me the thoughts that go with the feeling of sad.

293
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.690
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, like it was just ridiculous that somebody wouldn't take care of themselves.

294
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that you

295
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.900
Jaime Crouchet: Yes.

296
00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.100
Jaime Crouchet: When you picture from somebody else's perspective, like that was somebody else's words that you sound silly.

297
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: silly and ridiculous.

298
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm not thinking silly and ridiculous.

299
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.120
Jaime Crouchet: What are you thinking

300
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sure

301
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere around

302
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your perception of making a mistake.

303
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to understand your relationship with that.

304
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm certainly not landing on any kind of word like ridiculous or silly.

305
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.980
Jaime Crouchet: Like what it like what my perception is when I make a mistake.

306
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you regret with Greg.

307
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:14.490
Jaime Crouchet: Just taking my emotions out instead of just hearing them out. You know, I just spoke. Everything was spewing out of my mouth wide. My emotions were high. That was

308
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.520
Jaime Crouchet: I shouldn't have done that. I should have done that.

309
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.860
Jaime Crouchet: I should have not even spoke to him until I was calm and I'll just speak to him.

310
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Jamie. Do you know that people

311
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget you like do you know that's forgivable right like that's not, it's not a sin or something. So, but you lost your shit. Who cares, like, That's forgivable. Do you know that or do you just see that you didn't that relationship didn't leave any room for you to lose your shit.

312
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:09.060
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, well I mean like when we, when I specifically. Think about that part i don't i mean i don't think that he quit talking to me and it's over, because I did that.

313
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.630
Jaime Crouchet: I do regret that part. Totally. I feel like

314
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:34.020
Jaime Crouchet: If I did talk to him from A calm place. I feel like even if things still ended. Maybe we could have had a conversation about it. I feel like maybe things would have ended differently so that I had some sort of closure.

315
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.410
Jaime Crouchet: Because I have been I have. I mean, we've been together, five years.

316
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:54.780
Jaime Crouchet: So I have done that I have spoke to him out of emotion and and he has just talked me through that was done and it wasn't. I didn't bother him or anything, but here I feel like

317
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.880
Jaime Crouchet: I just like that. Maybe that's what shut him down.

318
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.940
Jaime Crouchet: And now I don't have any answer.

319
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so is it is it that

320
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Way in the back of your mind, you wonder, what if we get actually still be together because what if this is just a misunderstanding some

321
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what if it was just some little thing and. And now if we were talking, it would get cleared up and we would be together.

322
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.780
Jaime Crouchet: I really don't. I mean, I don't know.

323
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to be with Craig.

324
00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.990
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I want us to fix it. Yes.

325
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to still date him.

326
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to know if he wants to still date you.

327
00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What's keeping you from asking him directly

328
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.880
Jaime Crouchet: I guess the rejection. I don't want to hear them say no.

329
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.650
Jaime Crouchet: Or I don't want the message or the call to go unanswered.

330
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a refusal to accept that already have the answer.

331
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in a double bind you won't

332
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Go get it. And you won't accept

333
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I know, right. If it was flipped or the FR you like you'd be what you were doing when you you will be calling like where the heck are you right

334
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.630
Right.

335
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't want to hear. So you're not interpreting is zero contact as I'm done with you.

336
00:39:50.640 --> 00:40:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also won't find out you don't want to hear it, but you won't interpret these already sending possibly I obviously don't know but we're playing with these two scenarios here.

337
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see what I'm doing, like interpret the behavior. The absence of contact as I'm done.

338
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.820
Nice right

339
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But you won't do the loose end and put it in a bow by saying, Greg, for whatever reason,

340
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not enough. I want to hear it from you.

341
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I can interpret your lack of communication.

342
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe there's been episodes where we've done that before. And you still cared about me. And so I, I, for some reason, I need to hear

343
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to see me anymore. In order for me to move on. This isn't advice. This is to provoke another response from you. So what comes up when I did that just now.

344
00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.220
Jaime Crouchet: Um,

345
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.500
Jaime Crouchet: Well, I keep I don't

346
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:14.640
Jaime Crouchet: I genuinely don't think that that's what he wants. I don't. I think that he's totally disappointed that relationship didn't work.

347
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:29.250
Jaime Crouchet: I know Greg and you know and have a think about the things that we talked about the last time we talked. I, I genuinely full heartedly feel

348
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:46.410
Jaime Crouchet: That he is doing it because he thinks that that is what's best for me that he wants me to. I mean, it's been talked about so much in our relationship that he thinks that I need to have a man right they're going out and doing things at and around every day.

349
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.890
Jaime Crouchet: It's been a big

350
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.800
Jaime Crouchet: Topic in our relationship.

351
00:41:54.570 --> 00:42:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So none of this adds up when I know you, Jamie.

352
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Meeting. We can't conform to what a movie looks like we can't do that.

353
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: you yourself want someone

354
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not here. Maybe there's a party right with covering this you might like that distance with a particular recipe in your life, the kind of relationship with your mother. This works for you.

355
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the paradox is if you decide to go in

356
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Full body splash and say, Greg.

357
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I do not mind. In fact, I like that you're not right next door. It works for my personality. It works for my particular trauma history. It works for me. I will tell you when that changes.

358
00:42:53.070 --> 00:43:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you. I love us when I miss you like crazy and I can't let go because I still love you. I liked us. I know it doesn't look like everybody else's. But guess what were the rare or the one off the distance relationships they work for me and I miss you.

359
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But if that's a half truth. If that's you, settling then that doesn't work. But do you see I don't have some sort of its gonna look like this.

360
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to look like this, holding hands and weekend monthly you know dates and Baba, Baba, Baba, Baba. No, no, it's what works for you to

361
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Honest, I am projecting how happiness should look on you. And then he you're doing over relationships are hard enough. Let's not get up in each other's wish fantasy thing. Let's own what we want for adults now. So if you want this.

362
00:43:49.440 --> 00:44:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, right. Maybe that's why you can't let go. You just told me he wants you and you just told me before you want him so no wonder you can't let go. You want each other, basically. And so you're not a part. And it's not making any DAMN SENSE.

363
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:11.460
Jaime Crouchet: Right. And I always get mad because I feel like he what he's doing is he's making a decision that his mind to make, not yours.

364
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:12.480
Right.

365
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So to me, that's one conversation that's it's none of those other things like I don't want to be rejected if you can get past that because we poked at that one last time. I don't want to be rejected. I want to be important.

366
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well maybe it isn't those things because we noticed around in those last time we've noticed around on a few times. And that's still not hitting the mark, Jamie.

367
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.190
Jaime Crouchet: You

368
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: were telling me.

369
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: For who you are today. This is the relationship you want. You don't need to see the guy, but every month or so.

370
00:44:47.700 --> 00:45:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Then making that clear. And then he cannot project onto you. The fact that he may want more physical contact, but he'll have to own it. He cannot cross over and lay it on you. He'll have to own it, because you're going to have if you want. Right. It's the firm boundary. It's listen

371
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm right now. I haven't done this before. I'm telling you right now. I've had time to think about what do I really, really, really, really want

372
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I like really big pieces of what we had and I miss it.

373
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think what was happening before Greg was you were getting in my head and imagining that I wasn't speaking up about what I really want

374
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this differently, you just tell me for your own sake. What do you want, I will think for myself. I will tell you honestly and candidly

375
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And But Greg, please, please listen at this point, just tell me, do you like what we have, who we are. If we don't compare it to anybody else.

376
00:45:53.490 --> 00:46:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If it says just this way, nothing changes. Are you happy are you satisfied, but please don't don't imagine what I want all do that part for myself.

377
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an honest conversation. Can he do it. Can you do it.

378
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.640
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, everything that you just said I would totally reach out to him without I could do

379
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I didn't say anything really to profound. How come you haven't done it.

380
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.630
Jaime Crouchet: I don't know.

381
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you brave enough to face that for whatever reason he can't do this complex on this raw honesty or he has made up his mind that he wants to save you, even though you didn't ask for the saving

382
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But are you willing to accept the outcome because you need data not imagination on this one.

383
00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.400
Right.

384
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.890
Jaime Crouchet: I feel like at this point. Even if from

385
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.880
Jaime Crouchet: Like if I messaged him was something like that. And even if he came back with

386
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.590
Jaime Crouchet: Something terrible and mean like F off and everyone to talk to you again.

387
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.520
Jaime Crouchet: Like I feel like that would be better than where I'm sitting now.

388
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Our minds like closure. They like the end of the story. They want to have an answer. We're literally set up so that we get a little spray of the domain where we get a solution.

389
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And we do we want it. It's not just a metaphor disclosure this loose end

390
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're wired for that we really like to have it now because you won't. You can't muster the resentment and anger towards him. You can't close it up yourself. So it sounds like. Another option is to provoke a response to get the FUCK YOU FUCK OFF. Right.

391
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.510
Or

392
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, yeah. Let's have a real let's just let's let's talk talk about our truth. Um, and each of us will mind our own

393
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel I think I believe will mind our own side of the fence on that and and let's exit with some grace.

394
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, those are two options, a mini

395
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

396
00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What is what you want. You want to know where that boundary is because right now it's just on assumptions. Sounds like

397
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

398
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Truth be told, Jamie. Can you

399
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:39.540
Tolerate

400
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Rejection, can you do it, is it worth it for you to have closure and clarity, can you tolerate someone saying, I don't want to date. You may not know why.

401
00:48:51.960 --> 00:49:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But what it'll feel like is that I don't want to maybe because I'm saving you I'm trying to rescue you don't get to have that that right because that's that's over here. That's my business to I'm making up a story, but the result is I don't want to day to

402
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Candy do it is the clarity is the I've got to actually see what constraint we have here because it's making me nuts.

403
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The unknown.

404
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:32.880
Jaime Crouchet: I mean the rejection would hurt like hell yeah but I feel like there would be there would be something for me to work on there would be something for me to process, there would be something for me to

405
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:33.690
Grief

406
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:35.580
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

407
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.810
Jaime Crouchet: Hate this relationship stuff.

408
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So hard it's

409
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: All the happiness into life.

410
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Brings stuff, but it also brings all that uncertainty.

411
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:03.030
Yeah.

412
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's see what

413
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Still connective tissue there might still be two notions of that you are important. Do you know that to be true about you. Do you feel very confident about that.

414
00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:27.750
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, yeah. I feel more confident about it now that I have before. Yes.

415
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are important.

416
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:32.370
Jaime Crouchet: Yes.

417
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know that you're going to be okay.

418
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if the worst thing happens.

419
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.840
Jaime Crouchet: How do I know I'm going to be okay.

420
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you've got evidence of it, you can rely on memory to know

421
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Language languages flawed. I can't quite say both know and not know at the same time. But how do you know you're going to be okay. Are you going to be alive tomorrow, Jamie.

422
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.350
Jaime Crouchet: I should be. Yeah.

423
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, then we'll go with that. Let's go with another faith you have for that thought let's go with. Are you going to be okay.

424
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.300
Jaime Crouchet: Yes.

425
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know

426
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.310
Jaime Crouchet: Because I'm going to be alive and breathing.

427
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: heartbreak.

428
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.300
Yeah.

429
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And people. Yeah. And we live.

430
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:36.780
Jaime Crouchet: All the time. Yeah.

431
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're attempting to solve where you're blocked. We tried it some way we let time we did analysis. We've done a lot of different things with it and it's still sitting there and and keep coming to the same dilemma.

432
00:51:53.370 --> 00:52:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound like you want to check out. Are you breaking up with me because you're trying to save me. Are you breaking up with me because you don't want me no mo.

433
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Period on it, please. I can't take the insanity don't come over and thing for me please just tell me what you want and then I will tell you what I want, or vice versa. But please. I need clarity.

434
00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:19.650
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

435
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you want because nevermind one once

436
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just throwing out absolutely

437
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

438
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:35.400
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I think that that's perfect verbiage, I could send them a message like that.

439
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you think you would pick up the phone and have a conversation

440
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.830
Jaime Crouchet: Like if I tried calling him right now I don't, I don't know, he probably wouldn't answer.

441
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

442
00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.450
Jaime Crouchet: I think it'd probably be better to

443
00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.140
Jaime Crouchet: At least talk about something through a text message before he answered.

444
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:04.050
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, knowing him. Yeah.

445
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you know how he operates.

446
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So check in on how you were feeling around relationship. And now when you first started. Now my you're feeling with this plan.

447
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.480
Jaime Crouchet: I feel better.

448
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.450
Jaime Crouchet: I do I feel better about it. I think that

449
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:47.370
Jaime Crouchet: If I sent him a message you know saying exactly what you were saying, I feel like no matter what the responses like is if he gives me some kind of response to that, whether you know even if it's I hate you. Go away. I feel like that's better than where we're at.

450
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Oh, are you willing to be the braver party here.

451
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.110
Jaime Crouchet: And you

452
00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Put yourself out. Okay, well, then the options really increase with that bravery.

453
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Might get a response.

454
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I am a little curious.

455
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder how talking it through with me.

456
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: was useful.

457
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.020
Jaime Crouchet: I'm sorry.

458
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering, I wonder how talking it through with me was useful for you.

459
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

460
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing anything real fancy and I

461
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.530
Jaime Crouchet: Know, but no, but I think it just

462
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:11.610
Jaime Crouchet: It helps me to realize that I'm not being irrational like I like I'm not just going crazy for nothing or hurting for nothing. It's genuinely because

463
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:23.370
Jaime Crouchet: I need that clarity, like you said, and it helps to have you here. You say that it helps you. It helps to know that you see that as well that somebody else sees it. Okay.

464
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that makes sense. So I'm is it accurate to say that you feel validated that

465
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Your reality.

466
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Is seen by someone else's

467
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.240
Jaime Crouchet: Yes. Okay.

468
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:40.020
