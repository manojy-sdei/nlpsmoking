86
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:51.930
Justin’s iPhone X: Okay, but it's kind of a struggle. Just because I have to physically go there and she started just because of this coven 19 thing I've started doing telemedicine with her, which works a lot better, but

87
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:59.640
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, yeah, I just like, I don't know, I, life is pretty good right now for me. Okay, good. Okay.

90
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.190
Justin’s iPhone X: I tend to think that like she provided a good household, but like I don't think she did probably um

91
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.780
Justin’s iPhone X: And they like, I mean just the other night I was talking to her, and she can even talk. So, but she gets up and goes to work every day really

92
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:45.600
Justin’s iPhone X: We tried to have interventions, before I had a problem like her before I told everyone I had a problem. We tried to help her, and she did don't want anything about up about it. Or like any help. Okay, so guys drinking still two

93
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:54.210
Justin’s iPhone X: Dads drinking too. And he's kind of like he's just not consistent. He's like there. Sometimes, but not there, others and

94
00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:04.680
Justin’s iPhone X: He was kind of an asshole have a dad that's where I think I get a lot of my addiction issues from are my issues. I'm not blaming him, but like, that's where I think they stem from

95
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.150
And what about siblings you have any siblings.

96
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:31.950
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, I have a sister. She's or 20 she's 34 she's two years older than me. And she has two kids and a husband and she doesn't only have addiction issues, but she definitely has ish like you know she's but they have a good life. They got going on. They just get a better marriage shoes.

97
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.130
Justin’s iPhone X: Shitty yeah

98
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:46.590
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, they're like, like, like she likes this guy in her office and like they kind of had this not sexual fleeing but like flirting thing and I don't know exactly. All the dynamics, but

99
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:59.700
Justin’s iPhone X: Her husband has like was in Iraq and has a lot of PTSD issues. And so he's controlling and like goes through all of her shit when she wasn't even doing anything which makes you want to do stuff. So it's, yeah. Okay.

100
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.550
Um, any depression experiencing anything any depression.

101
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:17.640
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, like I think my biggest issue right now is like going to work with us. It wasn't your question, but no, no depression. Okay. In the past we had depression.

102
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:27.030
Justin’s iPhone X: I don't think so. You know, like I had loads of like feeling like, oh, I'm an addict and

103
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.360
Justin’s iPhone X: That sucks. When I think about it, just like what the stigma is and what that means.

104
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.460
Justin’s iPhone X: Um,

105
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:37.710
Justin’s iPhone X: But

106
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.680
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, okay.

107
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.160
Shawn Phalen: So you would know if you had depression. So, you know,

108
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:55.200
Justin’s iPhone X: Don't think some any anxiety. It's experiencing anxiety at all. Yeah, a lot of anxiety. Okay, social anxiety or just anxiety in general.

109
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:03.630
Justin’s iPhone X: Social anxiety, more so around like my addiction and like because like at work. I'm not. I don't talk my

110
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:12.690
Justin’s iPhone X: Like when I was even going to like a program like before I started work like they told me never to tell people at work that you're an addict, because then you're labeled as that.

111
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:22.200
Justin’s iPhone X: And so like I went into work and now I've worked in been pretty successful at work, but like no one knows that I've had issues. And so, it causes a lot of

112
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:36.660
Justin’s iPhone X: bad situations or awkward situations when like I can tell, something's not good for me to be around. And then I can't. But then it's like a bunch of guys and like, why don't you want to be here and you know it just like that causes social anxiety for me.

113
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.240
Shawn Phalen: What do you say, What do you tell them

114
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:58.110
Justin’s iPhone X: Um, you know, honestly, I feel like it leads to this mysterious factor about me, like, Oh, well, Justin, you know, you know, like, I mean, I went out with them. And I've drank but like I just can't go out and like a bender like I have to like have limits for myself and

115
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.440
Justin’s iPhone X: I don't know. I think a lot of them have addiction issues themselves, you know. Yeah, uh,

116
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:15.300
Justin’s iPhone X: But yeah, I definitely feel like there is, you know, I haven't been able to connect with anyone really completely authentically because I haven't been able to disclose that

117
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.190
Justin’s iPhone X: And so it makes me think that maybe I'm not looking for friends in the right places.

118
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.610
Shawn Phalen: Okay, are you working with your therapist on that.

119
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.990
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, so it was interesting considering she started talking about, we started talking about that scimitar at lunch today.

120
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:43.440
Justin’s iPhone X: And, you know, she was saying, Maybe I could try a different program like a not a but one of the other ones that are like

121
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:55.980
Justin’s iPhone X: And then I said, Oh, yeah. Well, I thought about going to them, but like right now. I don't really have a lot of time extra time and she's like, well, you don't really have to go there, like we could work a program together and you know

122
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.930
Justin’s iPhone X: I guess that's what she meant I don't. Yeah.

123
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:08.700
Justin’s iPhone X: Because we were talking about more so like there was a situation, whereas the weekend before last, with a couple of my co workers.

124
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:17.370
Justin’s iPhone X: And we were at his house. We were drinking and then they like brought out cocaine and then I did like a bump of cocaine and then I was like, This is too much for me. And they wanted to go out

125
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:24.600
Justin’s iPhone X: And like had go rage and so I ended up going home. And it was kind of weird because it was like in the middle of the day.

126
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:37.620
Justin’s iPhone X: And she was asking me, like why I wanted to go home and I said, because like my body told me like I shouldn't go and I had like flashbacks of, like, what's happened before. If I when I have gone against my own

127
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:47.700
Justin’s iPhone X: I don't know intuition or something or feelings. Um, and she's like, Well, that's good. But, you know, we really want to

128
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.580
Justin’s iPhone X: I guess she was saying that like you can

129
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.310
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, you can.

130
00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:02.460
Justin’s iPhone X: Like that is your own like sponsor, per se, like your own feeling like when your body says your mind tells you know like

131
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:11.040
Justin’s iPhone X: Sometimes your mind. You can talk yourself out of but your body. Most of the time, I don't know. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.230
Shawn Phalen: It's really being in touch with what

133
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:14.850
Shawn Phalen: Like

134
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:25.410
Shawn Phalen: Physically in your body what you're feeling. So typically what happens is that people addiction. What happens is that you're, you're kind of cut off from the neck down

135
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:38.040
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so your mind is always going to tell you go us go us go us. But once you integrate your mind and your body and how you're feeling your body's gonna say, oh,

136
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:48.090
Shawn Phalen: This isn't going to be a good thing. So you might feel it like in your chest, you might get really tight chest your stomach might hurt you might get a headache.

137
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:57.750
Shawn Phalen: You're going to all the alarm bells will go off for you physically. So the fact that that happened for us a really good sign. That means that you're starting to

138
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.060
Shawn Phalen: That you you are able to use your intuition and

139
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.290
Justin’s iPhone X: You're able to feel in your body, what isn't.

140
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:20.430
Justin’s iPhone X: And that's, that's a really good thing. So I told her, that's like my chess I've. She's like, Well, what does it feel like, and it was like, What do you mean it's just like, like in your body. Like, what does it physically feel like, and I was like, well, when likes something

141
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.310
Justin’s iPhone X: Bad or I'm about to make a bad decision. Like I feel like there's a bunch of bricks on my chest. Like, I can't breathe, like I'm being suffocated almost like

142
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:49.590
Justin’s iPhone X: And it's almost like flight or fight and then I have to get out of that situation. I'm so weird, like I'm getting emotional about just thinking about it, but um yeah it's it's crazy. Um, but at the same time that same feeling has not that feeling, but my mental I think has kept like

143
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.260
Justin’s iPhone X: I don't know how long our time is I don't take up your whole night but um yeah

144
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.820
Justin’s iPhone X: When

145
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:08.640
Justin’s iPhone X: When I sometimes when I was first starting to work. I would get. And I was on such like a tight rein of what how I trusted myself.

146
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:24.900
Justin’s iPhone X: I would say no. A lot to a lot of things like, oh, do you want to go have lunch with me some random person. And I'd say no because I wasn't trusting of like what would happen, or what you know who the, I don't know, it's just like skeptical of everything I'm

147
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:36.750
Justin’s iPhone X: And I think it sometimes you could be to, like, Yeah, I had to loosen up a little to in order to meet friends or two. Um so yeah I guess this is just something that I've like

148
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:53.100
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, always trying to figure out, like, should I be, you know, I also date, guys. And so, like, should I be on like grinder on a nap looking for to hook up. Is that a good place for me because I used to do that and used to use drugs, all the time. And like really also not the best place.

149
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.230
Justin’s iPhone X: Right, yeah.

150
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.610
Shawn Phalen: Do you have any server friends. Do you have friends that don't use it all.

151
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.080
Justin’s iPhone X: I do, but they're like, so I had a lot of them.

152
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:11.160
Justin’s iPhone X: And because I've started working. I've lost I it's interesting that we're talking right now because like

153
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:23.790
Justin’s iPhone X: A lot of them re emerged in my life, like my one of my friends, Emily. She just has been texting me a lot lately saying like, how are you, and I don't know how to I've haven't hung out with her like in a month because

154
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:34.110
Justin’s iPhone X: You know i just i and she's not working in program either, so I don't know why I'm like scared hang out with her, but I just like, feel like I'm mixing lives are like

155
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:44.460
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, I don't want to lie to her and act like I'm like haven't drank or at the same time, not, not a big drinker. So it's not, you know, I don't know.

156
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.070
Shawn Phalen: So,

157
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.890
Shawn Phalen: You know, this is sort of what what what's happening here is very normal.

158
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.530
Justin’s iPhone X: Hmm, your, your

159
00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:00.720
Shawn Phalen: Your you're doing the, you know, you're, you're committing to leading a healthy

160
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:08.670
Justin’s iPhone X: Sober clean life. Mm hmm. And with that.

161
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:29.730
Shawn Phalen: Comes a lot of people will leave your belief there at out of your life. Other people will come back in others will re emerge and it's about being able to trust yourself and know which people are the right people for you because where you early sobriety is a very

162
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.980
You have to have a lot of respect for it.

163
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:42.690
Justin’s iPhone X: For your addiction and where it can take you again. So it's this period of being

164
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:54.750
Shawn Phalen: Very, very choosy about who you lead, lead in your life and the people that you surround yourself with. And, you know, you're

165
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.800
Shawn Phalen: Going to be very well served to hang out with

166
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.020
Justin’s iPhone X: Us.

167
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.900
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, cuz I found you know like a lot of people like every emerged from my life before

168
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:15.870
Justin’s iPhone X: And I know that I don't connect with a lot of them now, like a when even went out with a couple of my old best friends that don't necessarily like

169
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:24.450
Justin’s iPhone X: Do tons of drugs but drink a lot and like just things that I used to do like go out to the I live in San Francisco, like, go to the Castro. I've done that a couple times and it's just not

170
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:31.350
Justin’s iPhone X: For me, like that's not my scene. It's not where I want to meet anyone. It's not worried. I, I almost get like anxious being there.

171
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:51.090
Justin’s iPhone X: And it's fun. Once in a while, but like I just not where I want to be. Now in my life. Right. And so sometimes it also happens is that the people that you, you know, we're friends with and partied with, uh huh, you're clean and sober. You have nothing in common with them. Yeah.

172
00:20:51.420 --> 00:21:10.470
Shawn Phalen: reevaluating, a lot of those friendships going okay, is this person. Interesting. Okay, so I'm dead ass, sober and clean, it's, I don't have anything in common with this person, are they. Interesting. Why do I like to be with them. Are they uplifting. What do I admire.

173
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:21.060
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, there's all these quite yeah very asking yourself about, okay, why am I met with this person. And that goes for dating to, you know, it's like

174
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:30.300
Shawn Phalen: You know, being careful about, okay, if I'm just dating today. All right, I got to be careful about who I'm dating, just to date.

175
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.080
Yeah.

176
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:40.710
Shawn Phalen: So it's about really being aware of but situations. You're putting herself in and you know look at San Francisco. That's a party town.

177
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:53.280
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, yeah. And you know in your age group and all of that stuff in me. I think it's, it can be a little bit challenging to find people that are authentic and don't use. I mean, you're in a big city. Right.

178
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.670
Justin’s iPhone X: And you know what's really weird is like when I go

179
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:09.060
Justin’s iPhone X: And like, like when I was meeting people in the rooms. I got really insecure like really insecure. For some reason I first thought. It's funny now that I can think I can like

180
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:24.240
Justin’s iPhone X: Explain this or I'm just not processing it, but at the time I thought it was like, oh, everyone wants to sleep with me. But actually, in hindsight, it was more so I felt really insecure, like I did not feel like I

181
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.360
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, I didn't even know you know my own name. I felt like or yeah

182
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:43.230
Shawn Phalen: And that's also common in early sobriety to and especially when you're in the rooms and you're in a or a na or whatever you're in, you know, it feels very wrong. It feels very exposing

183
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:55.110
And some people just have a very difficult time with that and it's not for everybody, but you have to find something that works for you. So if it's not a meeting.

184
00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:03.030
It's finding something that you're really passionate about that can keep you clean and sober.

185
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:12.480
You know, whether that's higher power that's being out in nature, whether that's meditation, yoga.

186
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:23.460
Justin’s iPhone X: You know there's I need that. Yeah, I'm missing something that I and you just put like you just nailed it, like I'm missing something that I feel very passionate about.

187
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.920
Justin’s iPhone X: And my job, like I used to do this when I always like using all the time. And like I'm

188
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:35.730
Justin’s iPhone X: In the last couple weeks I've been really successful in doing really well, but like, it's not fulfilling to me like a

189
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:50.130
Justin’s iPhone X: I'm like, Yeah, this is great and all this acclaim is great. Like at work. You know, like, because it's sales and like, that's how it is. But like, it's just not I have this void of like something that like I'm passionate about. Right. So because

190
00:23:50.280 --> 00:24:12.630
Shawn Phalen: You know, our work life is just one. It's one component of who we are. So, you know, as humans, you know, there we have work we have family. We have friends. We have hobbies, you know, we have to have our likes you know something that we that we're passionate about.

191
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.710
Justin’s iPhone X: To feel

192
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:22.410
Shawn Phalen: The other you know that to kind of fill the voids that are created just because we're human, you know,

193
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:38.010
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. And so, you know, it's really about trying to discover, like, Okay, what do I want to do. Do I want to learn something, do I want to pick up something like a whatever I don't know, a new sport something

194
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:47.040
Justin’s iPhone X: Do you think like, do you think like throwing your because, I mean, this is really kind of where I'm at, like, I really just like because I live in SF and I feel like I'm a smart guy, and like

195
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.030
Justin’s iPhone X: I kind of want to go create a startup, but like I feel like that might be too risky for someone that's in early recovery to like

196
00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:03.870
Justin’s iPhone X: You know, I'd be throwing the only stable thing I have right now will know I have two things like my job is pretty stable and it has been but it hasn't been a long time. It hasn't been like a year to

197
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:12.150
Justin’s iPhone X: Um, to like go throw that away and then like, do some, like, you know, how do you feel about that I'd be careful about

198
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:18.270
Shawn Phalen: That what I would do is if you want to start do a startup. You do it while you have a full time job.

199
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.730
Justin’s iPhone X: Okay, like you, you

200
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:38.070
Shawn Phalen: Figure out a way to work on it after work on the weekends, you know, do because what happens. And this is just for anybody that's not even in recovery, you know, walking away from a job that you're doing really well.

201
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:45.270
Shawn Phalen: And then just kind of walking away from that to start a startup is a really stressful thing.

202
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:59.280
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, stressful. So I agree, financially, it's just emotionally. But I mean, research, you know, if you want to do something, figure out how to do it.

203
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:06.750
Shawn Phalen: Figure out how to do it with the full time job though until you can kind of segue into doing whatever that is.

204
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.970
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, okay.

205
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.590
Shawn Phalen: So many people do that.

206
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.750
Shawn Phalen: A lot of people have

207
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.810
Justin’s iPhone X: A lot of people have side hustlers or their, you know,

208
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.770
Justin’s iPhone X: Their yeah

209
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:28.620
Shawn Phalen: Artist or their design or something like that, you know, there's all kinds of things you can do to think of it in terms of that.

210
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:40.050
Justin’s iPhone X: And I just want to like give back and help people and like I feel like my job is not that very much like that at all. And it makes good money and I in the in time, it could be really successful and make you know

211
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.160
Justin’s iPhone X: You will like it's just not fulfilling to me. I feel like I need something that is like

212
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:52.350
Justin’s iPhone X: The fills that like void of being yeah just doing something that you love and you're passionate about and yeah

213
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.490
Shawn Phalen: Where do. Where do you work. What company are you working for

214
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:07.530
Justin’s iPhone X: So I worked for a company called try net and we basically sell like health benefits at HR payroll to startups in the Bay Area.

215
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:18.120
Justin’s iPhone X: So I've learned a lot about it and it's really cool but like I really like I see all the situations that I'm in like I'm I'm make good money, but I have shitty credit and I've been evicted.

216
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:36.330
Justin’s iPhone X: And, you know, so like, then there's really no solution for that. Like, I can't get a checking account because I've defrauded banks before to get pills and so like I have all these problems. And I realized that there's no solutions for them. And there's probably could be solutions for them.

217
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:44.490
Justin’s iPhone X: But you know, I also don't want to bite off more than I can chew either and like I have to be realistic about where I'm at, you know, right.

218
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:51.480
Shawn Phalen: So right now, look at it as your sobriety comes first, first and foremost, that is the number one thing

219
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.560
Yeah.

220
00:27:54.570 --> 00:28:04.950
Justin’s iPhone X: And you've been clean for six months, you said about like, well, I mean, from drinking now but yeah like off pills and drugs. Yeah, like, eight months. Okay.

221
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:10.650
Shawn Phalen: So, you know, wanted to re evaluate that around the year mark.

222
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.600
Justin’s iPhone X: Okay, thanks.

223
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:20.160
Shawn Phalen: You know, do your research that you know just but just remember that your sobriety has got to come first.

224
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.710
Justin’s iPhone X: So you think I should like shift from like I like just no drinking, none of that. Do you think that's like

225
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.140
Justin’s iPhone X: The real sobriety.

226
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.480
Justin’s iPhone X: I mean certainly can, like drinking every day or anything like that but like even like once a month it but like in a concert. It's just like a risky. You know, it's a risk.

227
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.040
Shawn Phalen: It's a risk because it can take you back to where you were.

228
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:52.020
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so that's always got to be in the back your mind. Yeah. Alcohol might not have been your meal or your

229
00:28:52.050 --> 00:29:13.920
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, yeah. You know, it's always a possibility that it could be. And then you start creeping back to doing pills and then things start. Yeah, then you know it's kind of like this progressive. Oh, now you're back in the basement. Again, you got it. Yeah. So, for sure. Um, so

230
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.840
Shawn Phalen: Do you have any legal issues from

231
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:37.950
Justin’s iPhone X: Your huh. Okay. And are you dealing with that stuff now yeah like I have. I have. I had a lot like I had a lot of debt. I had a lot. I had someone suing me like an ex of mine. And then I had tons of tax debt as well. So I have like filed bankruptcy and I

232
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:47.370
Justin’s iPhone X: Have my ex suing me about like some fraud stuff, which is kind of a big deal. And because it's like 150 grand

233
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:58.650
Justin’s iPhone X: I'm so I'm looking for an attorney right now. And so I just emailed one. So, like, I'm working on that. And then I'm also submitted an offer and compromise to the IRS.

234
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:09.390
Justin’s iPhone X: And they said they'd get back to me by me so like the ducks are in the row but like I feel like you know like things at work. A really great, but then like I have these things on the back burner that are like

235
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:22.560
Justin’s iPhone X: And I just had to be very conscious of that because that can easily throw me into like excuses for why I could like I deserve to like go party and you know because that's really what my natural thing is, yeah.

236
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:29.610
Justin’s iPhone X: Yeah, you're gonna have to watch that yeah and and so

237
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:43.590
Shawn Phalen: Whatever you're just doing is you're just kind of work your way out of this situation. So if you keep working. If you keep doing what you're supposed to be doing. Honestly, like if you can stay clean and sober all of this stuff has a way of working itself out.

238
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:50.640
Justin’s iPhone X: Okay work and you have to stay clean so much work it is

239
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.100
Justin’s iPhone X: But there's so much work.

240
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.320
Justin’s iPhone X: So long. I feel like I've been doing this forever.

241
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:01.380
Shawn Phalen: But think about, think about how much work you put into using
