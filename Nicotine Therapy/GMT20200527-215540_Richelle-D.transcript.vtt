WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.950
Richelle Direny: I wonder for a second. I said that Eric kind of firm and then he's gonna stand me up.

2
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.820
Erik Long: Yeah, I was in, I was with the care navigator for a bit because last night I missed group with you guys because I just completely mind blowing.

3
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.220
Erik Long: Because I forgot that it was Tuesday.

4
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.460
Erik Long: You know, like with this coronavirus you just lose track of what day of the week. It is

5
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.930
Richelle Direny: Yeah, when you're locked in.

6
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.510
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. I mean, so you could have come to group today.

7
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.170
Richelle Direny: Because I'm reading this and has a group on Wednesdays at 12

8
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.610
Erik Long: Crap. Do you know any other days that does she have any more groups this week.

9
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.030
Richelle Direny: On. Not that I know.

10
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.790
Richelle Direny: She has groups on Tuesdays throughout the day.

11
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.980
Erik Long: Yeah, normally go door Tuesday at 8pm

12
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.680
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but she has said earlier in the day as well.

13
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.200
Erik Long: But the problem is, you know, if she has one on Mondays.

14
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.130
Richelle Direny: I don't believe so. I think she sees if I think she does for individuals on Mondays.

15
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:41.430
Erik Long: Because what I was talking to the care navigators is like I have enough of my Suboxone to get me to Monday, but like my first dose on Monday morning, and then I'm out.

16
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.190
Richelle Direny: So what I could do is

17
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.150
Richelle Direny: I can send her a message to let her know that we've met. And so to see you shaking

18
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.130
Erik Long: Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

19
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.370
Erik Long: Not moment.

20
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.050
Erik Long: Yeah, since I'm like a newer like this is I've only been with you guys like a month I'm selling like a week to week basis with getting prescriptions, I guess.

21
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.890
Richelle Direny: I just sent it to her. So let's just see

22
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.040
Richelle Direny: So, um,

23
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:39.000
Richelle Direny: What we can do it was so today's session is just arm on just the intake which is me just getting to know you. She Oh she's

24
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.300
Richelle Direny: Is responding so I see what

25
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.230
Richelle Direny: She says she'll send a bridge.

26
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.470
Richelle Direny: To send

27
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.980
Me.

28
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.020
Erik Long: What's a bridge.

29
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.560
Richelle Direny: I guess enough to hold you till next week.

30
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.120
Erik Long: Okay, perfect.

31
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.240
Erik Long: Thank you.

32
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.580
Richelle Direny: So, um, yeah. Yeah, that's what that means. So you don't have enough to group next

33
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.930
Richelle Direny: You'll have enough to group next Tuesday.

34
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.430
Erik Long: Perfect.

35
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.220
Richelle Direny: So I'm see what communication does just let me know. We try to make it happen.

36
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.690
Richelle Direny: So,

37
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:08.550
Richelle Direny: Like I said, we're just doing kind of getting to know you know not really necessarily going over the program rules because you're well aware of that you've been coming to the group that means, and we've been going over that.

38
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.650
Richelle Direny: So today, it's just really just a lot of it is just going over you know how you got started, you know, on this journey.

39
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.110
Richelle Direny: So, and after that we will determine I know bright heart.

40
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.980
Richelle Direny: The program rules are that you

41
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.290
Richelle Direny: Can then the program rules are that you attend group twice a month that banker.

42
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.590
Richelle Direny: Individuals twice a month.

43
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:48.600
Richelle Direny: But of course that the discretion of the therapist, especially if you're seeing a therapist, the community, um, then it can be altered a little bit

44
00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.480
Richelle Direny: For the end we'll talk about that and what my recommendation or but um so my question is, and how did you hear about her.

45
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.080
Erik Long: Um, I was actually just

46
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.020
Erik Long: I just looked up online.

47
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:20.190
Erik Long: Like, because I had been on Suboxone in the past. And that was how I got my longest period of clean time from opiates in the past.

48
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:28.380
Erik Long: So I looked up because I was down in Florida for a while and going to like impatient treatments and stuff.

49
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:42.060
Erik Long: But then at one point I was on Suboxone in Florida for a year, I was sober. Then they took me off of it all of a sudden, and then I relapsed but then I moved back up to Ohio with my family. So I looked up.

50
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:55.170
Erik Long: Places, or like online the visa was right when the coronavirus so starting and I looked up like online medical institutions that can provide Suboxone therapy.

51
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.600
Erik Long: And then you guys popped up.

52
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:08.490
Richelle Direny: I think this must be popular, I have to say because I hear a lot of people say it's just they just look up online Suboxone programs and we

53
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.850
Erik Long: Can get you guys just pop up the first one.

54
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.220
Erik Long: Campaigns that you guys are popular or the company's

55
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.120
Erik Long: Paying Google

56
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.230
Richelle Direny: That's a good way to look at it. And that means that they will be shown not all a lot of money to pay Google

57
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.910
Richelle Direny: Earth.

58
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:37.530
Richelle Direny: Um, but yeah, I think I you know when I don't even know if this is maybe one of the only ones, but I mean to call across the state. I think

59
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.100
Richelle Direny: One of the only company that goes across the state with this.

60
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.020
Erik Long: I thought that was

61
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:55.500
Erik Long: Surprising that like it was like we can prescribe Suboxone from California, and you live in, like, like it's in, like, what is it like seven states or eight states.

62
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.780
Richelle Direny: No Gary in a whole lot more states.

63
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:08.760
Richelle Direny: I think the goal is to for the whole United, I want to say that's the goal is to be across the whole United States. But no, there isn't a whole lot more than seven state.

64
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.080
Erik Long: Which state are you in

65
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.090
Richelle Direny: I'm in Florida.

66
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.260
Richelle Direny: Oh, they're going

67
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.180
Erik Long: To Jameson.

68
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:24.060
Richelle Direny: She's in Florida as well. The thing is, we're in Florida, but we are so we get licensed in another state.

69
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:32.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah program itself. It's coming to Florida. I don't think it's fully in Florida is yet so you can be in you know another state.

70
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:42.570
Richelle Direny: So let's say if you move to your an Ohio. But if you decide to move to Tennessee, you can still be a part of the program and I could still be your therapist and Dr. Davis and it's going to be your doctor.

71
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.070
Erik Long: Oh, sweet.

72
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.410
Richelle Direny: Because I were in. We're licensed in that state if you decided to go to

73
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:56.550
Richelle Direny: Michigan like I'm in Michigan, but, um, he would get another doctor so

74
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:14.970
Richelle Direny: It's just one career, you understand. I'm saying so. And I think Dr. Davis and isn't a whole lot of states so you, you just but if you came to Florida. You may not be able to be a part of the program. Even though I'm like I'm licensed in Florida, because I'm in Florida.

75
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.540
Richelle Direny: But the program is mine in Florida.

76
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.010
Erik Long: And they don't

77
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.300
Richelle Direny: Know, and I even though so like I'm in Florida. Dr. James is in Florida. But then the question is, is bright heart in Florida.

78
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:41.100
Richelle Direny: Or they approved to be able to provide the service in Florida. So you may not necessarily be able to continue to be a part of our heart in Florida. I think that's how it works. So until they're in Florida. So they're they're in a number of states.

79
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:53.730
Richelle Direny: That you have to because everything has to be based on the state laws, especially with medicine or Tele health, you know, if you have to be your government under each state law. So once

80
00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:00.240
Richelle Direny: It's your granted. Then you come into that state. And so if you're in the state, then you can continue with the program.

81
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.620
Richelle Direny: And that's

82
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.530
Richelle Direny: A nice thing since accessibility. Yeah, I mean,

83
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.820
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and and and that you're not necessarily um

84
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.560
Richelle Direny: You know,

85
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:23.310
Richelle Direny: So if you, you know that concept if you slip you slide. Like, it's not like that. If you slip. It's just like, All right, come on. Let's talk about it. Like what happened. It's not like you know some programs where you slip. You're out, you're done.

86
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.450
Erik Long: It's not

87
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:30.150
Richelle Direny: You know, we definitely work with you because if you slip, there must be something going on and let's talk about it.

88
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:41.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's how the program is. So, but, you know, glad you're here for your sake. And of course, you know, you know, for the health but so let's talk about

89
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.990
Richelle Direny: When. How old were you when you got started. Like, what is your drug of choice. And what was the circumstances around it.

90
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.590
Erik Long: All right. Um, so

91
00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:04.350
Erik Long: The first time I ever really the first time I ever like got high or felt like a euphoria was kind of I got

92
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:19.080
Erik Long: I really, really bad separation anxiety and it was like making me not be able to like go to like summer camps with my friends and stuff because I couldn't spend the night away from my parents. So some genius doctor

93
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.660
Erik Long: Prescribed with family history of

94
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.540
Erik Long: Substance dependency, knowing that prescribed me Xanax

95
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:45.450
Erik Long: And at 14 years old. And the first time I think Xanax, I was like, Wow, this is amazing. I don't have any anxiety anymore. And I feel like I'm floating on a cloud and then

96
00:11:46.710 --> 00:12:06.630
Erik Long: I had one friend that he had moved out of state, but he came back and that was when I was like 16 years old. And when he came back to the state like when he abandoned the other state he started smoking a lot of weed and drinking a lot. So he came back and just got me on this.

97
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.450
Erik Long: Smoking weed and drinking and then

98
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:19.050
Erik Long: So I'd say like 16 is when I first started using like illegal substances.

99
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.060
Erik Long: Um,

100
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.330
Erik Long: My, my drug of choice.

101
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.080
Erik Long: Would be, it's like tied between

102
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.900
Erik Long: Like opiates and Benz's

103
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:37.890
Erik Long: So,

104
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.440
Richelle Direny: Just downers. Okay. Oh, hi. And so I'm at

105
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.750
Richelle Direny: 14 when you got that first. Hi.

106
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:56.700
Richelle Direny: I'm for anxiety now was. Did your parents consent to this. Don't they have to consent to it.

107
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:12.210
Erik Long: Yeah, my. Yeah. My dad was kind of against it, but my mom. My mom has a whole slew of mental health issues arm. She's had to go to rehab.

108
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:34.680
Erik Long: Twice within the past three years she's attempted suicide twice within the past three years, like she at that point. She was prescribed like three milligrams of Xanax and day. So it was like, if he's if it was more. It was prescribed to me, not as like

109
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.380
Erik Long: I don't know what the term for it. Is it wasn't prescribed to me like to be taken like

110
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.190
Erik Long: Once a day or anything like that. It was prescribed like

111
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.390
Richelle Direny: Every meeting.

112
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:53.280
Erik Long: Yeah, but, but, like, like rarely as needed. Like I just got like a really small prescription and then like when I went to summer camp.

113
00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:07.410
Erik Long: I gave the people who worked at the summer camp my prescription and they gave me like point five milligrams each night before I went to bed. So I could go to sleep without like freaking out about being with my parents.

114
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.030
Richelle Direny: But that wasn't as needed. That was like every day you were getting every day.

115
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.020
Erik Long: No, I wasn't getting it every day.

116
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.980
Richelle Direny: No, you're saying when you went for cam. They started giving it to you every night.

117
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:41.010
Erik Long: Yeah, but just a little bit, but nobody was as me like I was like, I'd start freaking out every night and then they'd give me my saying next dose and then I've calmed down. So, I mean, that kind of helped build up this like thing in my head. Like if you're freaking out about something.

118
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.160
Erik Long: You could take take a substance and you'll be fine.

119
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:56.610
Richelle Direny: Um, and, but back then it wasn't you mean well, I would wonder, did you conceptualize it as a substance or you just kind of looked at it, it became a trainer behavior.

120
00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:12.630
Richelle Direny: That if I started slipping out they'll give me something I'll calm down. Then if I flipped on again. They'll give me something. And I'll calm down. But did you know what as it did you conceptualize it as I take a substance or it was like, I even given a pill and I'll come down.

121
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.030
Erik Long: Yeah, I think it was my second is just like

122
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:37.110
Erik Long: Yeah, at that time, it was that, but then after summer camp and stuff that I didn't continue the Xanax prescription at some point when I was like, so at 16 when the weed and alcohol you started

123
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:48.810
Erik Long: I started my mom had just pills like she went to two different doctors and was getting Xanax prescriptions for both from both of them.

124
00:15:49.410 --> 00:16:04.980
Erik Long: And there were just pills filled with Xanax all like all over her room in the house and I would just do as many frickin Xanax, as I wanted and take them like every night, a bunch of them.

125
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.760
Erik Long: For a long, long time.

126
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:10.320
Richelle Direny: Because they're

127
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.770
Richelle Direny: Used to get used to. And kind of like the feeling that you got with the kind of relaxed.

128
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.660
Richelle Direny: That you got in, you kind of wanted to get experienced that all the time.

129
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:28.590
Erik Long: Yeah, but also I was in third or fourth grade, I was put on

130
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.760
Erik Long: Like stimulants, because for ADHD.

131
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.840
Directory.

132
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.830
Erik Long: Yeah. Vive it's

133
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:45.300
Erik Long: My fan and I took Ritalin for a while. I took my vans. For a while I to

134
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.360
Erik Long: What's the really popular one.

135
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.170
Erik Long: That people will be used.

136
00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:09.960
Erik Long: I forget what it's called, whatever, just a bunch of different stimulants and those had like a really harsh side effect on me of like anxiety and like feeling pent up. So then, like the end of the day, I would do that Xanax and it was like calm me down.

137
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.080
Richelle Direny: Isn't Klonopin and one of them are no

138
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.510
Erik Long: No Klonopin to benzodiazepine

139
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:23.820
Richelle Direny: Okay, but, um, but I know that that can be that can be an addictive because people have used that as well.

140
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.470
Erik Long: Yeah yeah lenses i one of my drugs of choice. Yeah.

141
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.060
Richelle Direny: But so

142
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:41.400
Richelle Direny: So as a teenager being introduced to this by a doctor for anxiety and your, your, your parents approve of it, they kind of okayed it

143
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.340
Richelle Direny: And it sound like given that your mom had her

144
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:57.450
Richelle Direny: You know history of mental illness and was on medication and she wasn't completely opposed to you taking any kind of medic medication for anything. She wasn't opposed to that.

145
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:08.640
Erik Long: No, she she still thinks that I mean she is sober nowadays, as in she like

146
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.240
Erik Long: She's not on any

147
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:27.180
Erik Long: Like she she was a really bad alcoholic for a while. So she's sober from that. But she's still on like 60 different prescriptions from doctors that include several controlled substances.

148
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.370
Erik Long: So like my, my mom kind of put the ideology into my head of like

149
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.260
Erik Long: If you're not feeling some way. Just take a pill and it will fix it.

150
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.130
Richelle Direny: Okay.

151
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.060
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so it comes down to.

152
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.390
Richelle Direny: Because it's a

153
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.370
Richelle Direny: I want to say learned, but pretty much it. Because she's used to it, she's been doing this for a while because of her diagnosis and her

154
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:21.570
Richelle Direny: addictive behaviors for you. It wasn't far fetched that if it was that you are now experiencing certain things or you had any kind of underlying mental illnesses or the doctors were diagnosed with any of it. It wasn't anything for her to be okay with you, taking it so

155
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.870
Richelle Direny: You it. So when eat. So when you tipped over into the addiction part was it that

156
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:35.190
Richelle Direny: She became she opposed it or did she someone become enabling of it after a while.

157
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:50.580
Erik Long: Um, when I tipped over into like the full blown addiction part of it like so she's diagnosed borderline personality disorder and she's very codependent

158
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.270
Erik Long: She

159
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.410
Erik Long: Kinda like

160
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:18.480
Erik Long: Like felons like the super bad depression but ramped up her like even doubled her Xanax usage. At that point, and then was like berating me to my other fam about me to my other family members, even though she was like

161
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:32.250
Erik Long: On like a super high amount and Xanax and just laying in bed all day for two years. That was before I went to rehab was a really bad time my life and for my family.

162
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.910
Richelle Direny: And so now it says the age of 14 up until present day.

163
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.370
Richelle Direny: Or I shouldn't say present day prior to you. Come, becoming a part of bright heart. Have you ever been in any

164
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:50.880
Richelle Direny: treatment programs.

165
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.110
Erik Long: Impatient yeah I'd gone to rehab four times.

166
00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.360
Richelle Direny: Four times now where they like just detox programs or 30 day programs.

167
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.610
Erik Long: I've been to

168
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.710
Erik Long: Three detoxes

169
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.320
Erik Long: For 30 day programs.

170
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.840
Erik Long: For

171
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:24.630
Erik Long: I O P 30 day programs that were connected to the 30 day inpatient programs.

172
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:29.460
Richelle Direny: So after you came into it. So you went from impatient to

173
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.350
Richelle Direny: I. O. P.

174
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.510
Richelle Direny: Yeah, okay. Um, now

175
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:44.460
Richelle Direny: When was your most recent admission or your last I should say admission to the 30 day

176
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.190
Erik Long: Anything.

177
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.070
Erik Long: Probably a year and a half ago. So that would be

178
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.350
Richelle Direny: 2018 so

179
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.740
Erik Long: Yeah yeah like August 2018

180
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.450
Erik Long: Okay, that's what it was.

181
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:22.680
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um, and what about your last detox. So it was the inpatient like the last 30 days in

182
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.190
Richelle Direny: treatment program for like your detox program.

183
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:41.790
Erik Long: That was a 30 day in patient and I didn't have to go to detox and for that one because I wasn't abusing anything that they said it was medically required to detox from

184
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.270
Richelle Direny: Ok and now

185
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:54.540
Richelle Direny: And I know impatient, you get the doctor psychiatrists counselor and you're seeing them for the most part, every day or every three

186
00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:01.830
Richelle Direny: Days or two days or what have you, outside of the program. Have you were you did you follow up like going to therapy.

187
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:18.240
Erik Long: In what sense like once I wanted di O P or after I left, I op and was yeah I'm one of the times I did and I actually

188
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:43.260
Erik Long: But I was on Suboxone from this one place and I was going to a meetings twice a week, I was at a halfway house and I made it a little bit over a year sober or in a they consider if you're on Suboxone you're not sober. But if it's

189
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:54.510
Erik Long: If it's the FDA says it's okay. Then I'll call it sober. So happier than I am, when I'm using opiates and Benz's and stuff.

190
00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.450
Richelle Direny: You say you're a lot happier.

191
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.830
Erik Long: Yeah, we got to feel. I will. I just feel a lot more stable.

192
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:02.970
Mm hmm.

193
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:11.820
Richelle Direny: Not but with the Suboxone your isn't a combination of the bendel's not good.

194
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.730
Erik Long: Yeah, no, you can't. You're not supposed to take them. I don't take vengeance.

195
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.910
Erik Long: Okay, okay. Yeah, I can.

196
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:29.790
Erik Long: Like, that's one of my drugs of choice like yeah but yeah if you if you take Suboxone with

197
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.950
Erik Long: Ben's owes

198
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.240
Erik Long: A can

199
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.320
Erik Long: I don't know, it can slow down your heart rate and like

200
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.600
Erik Long: Oh, you can overdose.

201
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:43.530
Uh huh.

202
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.930
Richelle Direny: Um, now so

203
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.560
Richelle Direny: You went into a year and a half ago you went into the treatment program now um

204
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:07.950
Richelle Direny: But you, you were you are answering the question to ask to outside of after you weren't completely discharged from the program on your own. You said you were not seeing continuously a therapist or psychiatrist, you were not

205
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:08.820
Erik Long: No, I was

206
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:18.990
Erik Long: I was once a week, I was seeing a therapist and doing everything I needed to do and then

207
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:41.130
Erik Long: About a year into it. I kind of like mentally like just after getting a year sober, I kind of like, like, as they say in like a, like I mentally relapsed before I physically relapsed but I just stopped getting out of bed and making my bed every morning I stopped praying every night. I stopped.

208
00:25:42.480 --> 00:26:00.900
Erik Long: You know, doing all the things that helped me keep my sobriety and that eventually led to me using and then the first time I used. I actually overdosed. And that's the first time I've ever overdosed and

209
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.710
Erik Long: When like went to the hospital. They had to give me like four shots and arcane

210
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:17.910
Erik Long: And then after that that was a big wake up call. I moved back up here with my parents and I haven't used anything set or like started using

211
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.980
Erik Long: Percocet.

212
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:28.080
Erik Long: That was super afraid of doing heroin ever then because that's what made me overdose. So it was easy.

213
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.520
You did heroin.

214
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.320
Erik Long: Yeah.

215
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:39.480
Richelle Direny: Okay, and with the now. How long were you clean and sober before you had relapsed

216
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:55.590
Erik Long: Okay, so I did that the final night the final 30 day impatient, then a 30 day I op. Then I stay, including that I stayed sober for a whole year.

217
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:03.900
Erik Long: And then like a couple weeks after I got my one year chip from a I

218
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.950
Erik Long: Did heroin. Does that answer your question.

219
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:15.180
Richelle Direny: So, so one year sober, then you said that you started kind of like what the mental relax.

220
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:27.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, actual relapse and what was going on at that time when you like when you that mental relaxed started happening for you to kind of fall behind on the things that maintained your sobriety.

221
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.970
Erik Long: I still

222
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:43.830
Erik Long: I don't know, I just kind of I stopped. I, for some reason, I just stopped putting like the effort or like

223
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.950
Erik Long: I just got

224
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.940
Erik Long: For you. There's a word they use a lot for it, but I got like lazy.

225
00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:12.990
Erik Long: complacent. Complacent yes i got complacent and basically was like, oh, I have this. I don't need to pray to God. I can make my own schedule. I can do whatever I want. And I'll stay sober and know that did not work out.

226
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.950
Richelle Direny: You know, so you so I guess at that point life said

227
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.620
Richelle Direny: You're not as strong as your mind is telling you you are

228
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.500
Erik Long: Yeah, my, my

229
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:39.060
Erik Long: Yeah, it's kind of like my disease, as I like to say, kind of, it's like delusional. Like, it tells me that I can

230
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.450
Erik Long: Be sober without doing anything to be sober.

231
00:28:46.680 --> 00:29:00.120
Erik Long: And then I use or. It says, oh, like the classic, you can just use once and you'll be fine. Those kinds of things I tell myself and then never ends up being true.

232
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:03.930
Richelle Direny: Um,

233
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:16.980
Richelle Direny: A lot of it is a decent predisposition because you grew up kind of being around an exposed to it. So it's a lot more sort of a predisposition. This kind of like

234
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.480
Richelle Direny: If I

235
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:30.510
Richelle Direny: What's normal in my house may not be normal in your house, not to say that you will look at it says that's not normal, but it's normal for me because that's all I know. I know nothing else.

236
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:39.150
Richelle Direny: I'm missing something else. So my normal your definition of normal your definition of normal are two different things. It's all because of the exposure.

237
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:49.410
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like I grew up in a certain country. So I have an accent you grew up in a different country. So you have a different accent. But hey, if I grew up in your country.

238
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:57.570
Richelle Direny: Though my parents speak a different have a different accent, it's because that's not where I grew up. That's not what I was exposed to. That's not what I saw all day every day.

239
00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:58.800
So,

240
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:14.250
Erik Long: I had a very eye opening experience this kind of related to that. When I was in my final rehab, which was the best rehab that I went to, which is down in Florida that I highly recommend. It's called immersion.

241
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.000
Erik Long: They

242
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:41.340
Erik Long: They had this song family weekend where like my family members came down and we did like intensive group therapy, but in a group with other families with their addict kid there as well. And like for for only for my family. He had us do like a role playing thing or he had me like

243
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:57.960
Erik Long: Take the whole ROOM AND MAKE IT INTO LIKE MY HOUSE AND PUT MY DAD, WHERE HE WOULD BE MY MOM OR SHE WOULD BE IN what she would be doing and thinking and all what my sisters will be doing and thinking and like, as I was saying that I realized like,

244
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.480
Erik Long: How messed up.

245
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:14.580
Erik Long: Like a lot of the shift in my household was as I grew up and in my entire life. I like been blaming myself or how messed up my family was but

246
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:25.200
Erik Long: Really there was a lot riding on the. So my parents have have finally decided to get a divorce, but it was like grinding down for like

247
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:40.110
Erik Long: The entire time I've been alive, like slowly and my mom struggles with mental health and my dad just doesn't talk about emotion at all. So there was no way for me to vent or to do anything.

248
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.600
Erik Long: So I don't know.

249
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:56.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So basically, that was so you're in your house that was your normal, but the only way you are able to recognize it, because you were removed from it. Now I'm able to look at my life through this looking glass and

250
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:07.440
Richelle Direny: That this is just very different. You recognize I hold on. That's not cool, like all of this that's going on that's not that's not normal.

251
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:18.810
Richelle Direny: And so, like you said, by doing the role play it wasn't like you said, it becomes an eye opener because um

252
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:31.800
Richelle Direny: Because now you're seeing life very different. You're now standing on the outside and watching a movie over your life and comparing it to other things that you've seen now that you're removed from it and you're like,

253
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.350
Erik Long: No.

254
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:40.470
Richelle Direny: You know and like you said the dynamic between your parents, it is I'm

255
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:59.430
Richelle Direny: I'm it's that your, your idea of, um, well, my parents like they're together. And so growing up. That's like it's cool, because my parents are together. So I'm normal. But then that's somewhat of a very dysfunctional relationship.

256
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.680
Richelle Direny: But you don't like when you're in it.

257
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:06.420
Richelle Direny: You feel it. What you really truly recognize it after you come

258
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:12.300
Richelle Direny: Out of it completely. So I'm definitely an eye opener. But, um,

259
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:21.390
Richelle Direny: The other thing that now with all of this with your, you know, addiction. I'm just kind of this journey that you've been on

260
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.290
Richelle Direny: Have you developed or had any kind of underlining medical issues.

261
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.970
Erik Long: As in, what, like physical medical issues.

262
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:37.470
Erik Long: No.

263
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:38.820
Erik Long: No.

264
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.450
Richelle Direny: Okay you finished your completed high school

265
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.810
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And did you go to college.

266
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:54.660
Erik Long: Um, tried twice, but both of those times were during active addiction. So that didn't work out.

267
00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:01.260
Richelle Direny: No one, no plan to work out there. So, um, what about um

268
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.690
Richelle Direny: Do you have any

269
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.640
Richelle Direny: Legal pending legal issues. Have you ever been.

270
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:23.160
Erik Long: I have. I actually just fun my lawyers office was closed for code for a little bit, but it just opened a couple days ago and I got in my seal record form because I have

271
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.930
Erik Long: One.

272
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:41.340
Erik Long: Misdemeanor that keeps showing up whenever I apply for jobs and screwing me over. It's from five years ago when I stole beer from a convenience store because I was high on Xanax

273
00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.640
Richelle Direny: Okay. And how long has over

274
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.710
Erik Long: Five years ago.

275
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.120
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

276
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.680
Erik Long: And it's still haunting me

277
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.730
Richelle Direny: What. Well, isn't that what is that a misdemeanor or felony.

278
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.320
Erik Long: It's a misdemeanor.

279
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.780
Erik Long: Well, don't try to give me the felony.

280
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.510
Erik Long: Because I've done it a bunch of times. And they only caught me that one time is like when I

281
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.420
Erik Long: It's common with like Xanax and makes people makes people like arsonists.

282
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:18.300
Erik Long: Like they want to commit larceny. They want to steal stuff so that happens to me when I'm on Xanax, it just makes me make really bad decisions.

283
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.380
Mm hmm.

284
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:32.430
Richelle Direny: Um, and that's very interesting that when you're on Xanax, you want to, I guess it's the high. It's the high that you're you're undergoing you feel like is it that you have this

285
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.210
Erik Long: Well, it's very similar to alcohol and

286
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.940
Erik Long: It just like releases all inhibition

287
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:54.060
Erik Long: Gotcha gets it's just like being blackout drunk but like you are blacked out but your motor skills are quite aren't as effective.

288
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.810
Erik Long: As offense.

289
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:03.060
Erik Long: And you can act a little bit more normal but like your decision making faculties are just gone.

290
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.390
Richelle Direny: Like you said, it's it's somewhat

291
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:20.820
Richelle Direny: I guess, like you said, a form like a host nation where you're thinking that you can do something or this is your new reality, but it's not because your, your cognitive functions are kind of alternating or not, you know,

292
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.800
Richelle Direny: It happens to be on. Um, now

293
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:41.910
Richelle Direny: I know you. I know you shared about like your mom's mental health. Now for you. The only thing that you that I guess you were diagnosed with even at the onset was anxiety, but outside of that were you diagnosed with anything else.

294
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.150
Richelle Direny: depression. Depression so

295
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.160
Richelle Direny: Basically you're you're seeing

296
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:51.690
Richelle Direny: A psychiatrist for the ongoing treatment of anxiety and depression.

297
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.560
Erik Long: Yes, and I have a psychiatrist right now to

298
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.060
Richelle Direny: Okay.

299
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.160
Richelle Direny: We

300
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:15.270
Erik Long: All I'm taking is I need to talk to Dr. Davidson about this, but I haven't had a one on one with her to talk about with but from that psychiatrist all that she prescribes me as Wellbutrin. And she said, there's no negative

301
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.650
Erik Long: Interactions between Suboxone will be a

302
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:29.820
Richelle Direny: Doctor. Okay, yeah, you could definitely talk to her, but it just seems funny that you were being treated for anxiety when you clearly said

303
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:52.920
Richelle Direny: That arm. It was your anxiety, which naturally will feel because you're in a new environment in comparison to are you really an anxious person or was it that you didn't adapt to new environments or a new situation as readily as someone else does.

304
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.410
Erik Long: Yeah, and that's actually a

305
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:20.340
Erik Long: Like a symptom of ADHD, which I think I've got like some people grow out of their ADHD. I think I have. I don't have the hyperactivity anymore and I don't have a lot of the other symptoms but like change like an aversion to change. That's a symptom of ADHD, like you don't like.

306
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.290
Richelle Direny: I felt that the jury.

307
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.370
Environments.

308
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.260
Erik Long: Style that

309
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:41.730
Richelle Direny: Because when you really think about it, what can a really that hyper what can really does focus. And then when you even think about like this. So, like, as you were talking like I know one of the things with my my my oldest son. He doesn't adapt to um

310
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:50.490
Richelle Direny: He doesn't take changes really well, but I know that, like, we know that we know that putting him in a new environment.

311
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:57.150
Richelle Direny: Is that by himself is just on cool when he was younger. It was worse but

312
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:07.470
Richelle Direny: You know, as he got older, as long as someone familiar was with him. He was okay he's okay with it. Um, but

313
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:16.770
Richelle Direny: You knew that you had to slowly introducing to you have to have that conversation with him. You got to prepare him for it. So it's a slow introduction

314
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.780
Erik Long: I never got any of that.

315
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.510
Erik Long: Yeah, I got thrown in there every

316
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.810
Richelle Direny: Day.

317
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:29.910
Richelle Direny: But then it's a really anxiety or you just, you don't just throw somebody into a new situation, but it's being able to identify that. So like I i tend to find

318
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:41.280
Richelle Direny: That for him. I can't just throw him in a new situation. So then I never put him in for allowed him to go with people who doesn't recognize that. So you we slowly introduce them.

319
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:48.570
Richelle Direny: Or one of us will be there with him and then we will slowly back away and we will ask him. Is it okay if we walk away now.

320
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:58.680
Richelle Direny: And he'll say, okay, but then it was that reassurance that I'm right here. If you need me or you can call me if you need me. But it's kind of like that slow introduction. So then

321
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:06.660
Richelle Direny: Is it, do you, how do you help someone with that. It's like you slowly do it, then there is the

322
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:16.350
Richelle Direny: Like you would say the attention. The but then my theory is your focus on what you want to focus on because like I see that with him. It's like

323
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:27.030
Richelle Direny: He focuses on the things he wants to focus on. Um, but then the things that he's not really focused on the things that are really not very interesting to him. So do you put that diagnosis of

324
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:36.060
Richelle Direny: Attention deficit or even the hyperactivity as a boy they're typically they make your heart skip a beat all day long.

325
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:45.000
Richelle Direny: All day long, you're like, I'm about to go to the hospital. They want to break something. They're about to kill themselves.

326
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:54.780
Richelle Direny: Simply because their fear factor is just completely different where they're not as cautious or aware of the dangers around them. But that's just the

327
00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:07.980
Richelle Direny: Boys and girls as they get older, they become a little calmer, but just overall they're different. So that's why I say that the jury's out when it comes down to this term of a DD or ADHD. Now granted, there are people who legitimately

328
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:23.700
Richelle Direny: Have this diagnosis that no matter what they are literally very hyper and throughout their lives. They're like that but unfair. You know, sometimes you have to stop and you have to kind of take into consideration what the situation is. But again, I think in your situation.

329
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.320
Richelle Direny: Your, your predisposition. It was almost like

330
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.100
Richelle Direny: Like you said, with your mom with her own mental health.

331
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:49.260
Richelle Direny: Diagnosis and her struggles with mental health and your father and not really having that conversation or what have you, or being in tuned or aware that maybe you shouldn't just take him and throw them out into the deep blue sea and then tell him learn how to swim anybody going to

332
00:41:50.850 --> 00:42:04.800
Richelle Direny: Change it. So that's just kind of the concept so that that's just my spiel on when I say the jury's out when it comes to that. But, um, but then because of not taking that interest to kind of see

333
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.940
Richelle Direny: What your stressors are to some degree. Now,

334
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:21.930
Richelle Direny: The added thing was that you became addicted to this medication that was given to you because what was taught to you is that if I get anxious I can take this and this is how I'm going to feel

335
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:30.540
Erik Long: Yeah, like with what you're saying I'm a big believer in like therapy or like a therapeutic approach versus

336
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.640
Erik Long: Drugs.

337
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:41.580
Erik Long: Especially for kids because they're still like learning the way the world works like they're much more they take

338
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.310
Erik Long: Even if they don't directly admit it. They take advice that you give them a lot more readily

339
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.470
Erik Long: Than older people.

340
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:56.850
Richelle Direny: Exactly how many times are you going to tell the kids sit out. So now, don't move. Don't do this. But that's just kids there. But that's all they're going to do all day.

341
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:10.890
Richelle Direny: Monday. I'll have patience. I'm gonna deal with it. So how about you just go drink this pill. Now, you won't. Calm down. So then eventually become addicted to this, but again not to dismiss that there are people who have legitimate issues and they need a system.

342
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:20.670
Richelle Direny: You know, medication assisted type of therapy to help them while teaching home. But again, everybody is different, but based on what I heard you say

343
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.450
Richelle Direny: It seemed like well as you were saying it. I thought of my son.

344
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:40.050
Richelle Direny: Like you cannot like the boy would flip out if you put them in a new situation like legit flip out like something wrong with you, buddy. You kind of need. Calm down. But then I learned over time. It was just a new situation. He just did not adapt very well. So as we

345
00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:48.600
Richelle Direny: Work and like you said, taking that therapeutic approach, and working with him for him to be comfortable. And so now he's perfectly fine now.

346
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:52.890
Richelle Direny: Take on new situations. Okay. Um, but

347
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.520
Richelle Direny: For now, with you said that your sisters. Do you have one sister two sisters. How many sisters, you have

348
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.330
Erik Long: Three.

349
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.860
Richelle Direny: You're the only boy.

350
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.220
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you guys stand a chance. Eric

351
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:13.260
Erik Long: And I'm the black sheep. They're all straight A students never done a drug in there. My

352
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.360
Richelle Direny: Uh, but either way you're how much, how much are you the youngest the

353
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.980
Erik Long: second oldest

354
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.720
Richelle Direny: So older sister, who is the boss.

355
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.000
Erik Long: Because she feel like, yes.

356
00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:30.210
Erik Long: Then you have three older sisters pretty timid

357
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:54.630
Erik Long: But she has a master's degree in social work, specializing in substance abuse because of me and my pants. She that inspired her to get that. So I go to her. A lot of times for advice on stuff. And we used to really not get along, but nowadays we get along really well.

358
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:04.710
Erik Long: And then I have my one younger sister who's in college. She's halfway through her freshman year.

359
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:06.750
Erik Long: And

360
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.750
Erik Long: We're very similar like both of us are pretty intelligent and

361
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:27.120
Erik Long: We can argue a lot but like we are you a lot because like it's something similar in us that for some weird reason we like like to argue like the the heat of the debate, just like straight

362
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:38.520
Erik Long: Up. Yeah. And we just go and but sometimes she just like I don't take it too personal levels and sometimes she just takes it to personal levels and just starts like

363
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:49.470
Erik Long: shooting down my personal characteristics. But sometimes we don't get along. But like recently we've been getting along very well.

364
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.250
Erik Long: I've been just trying to talk very openly with her about things.

365
00:45:53.970 --> 00:46:03.390
Erik Long: And then my youngest sister is 17 years old and that is a whole nother deal

366
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:04.890
Erik Long: I mean she

367
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.930
Erik Long: She, she just like

368
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:35.670
Erik Long: Her like for me. My like default way of escape is using drugs right to get out. She it's like they call it like regression. She is 17 years old and will cry hysterically like a five year old about five times a day and she talks in not her real boys, but in a little girls voice.

369
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:38.940
Richelle Direny: She's the baby of the family.

370
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.160
Erik Long: She is the baby of the family.

371
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.420
Richelle Direny: Does everybody baby.

372
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.540
Erik Long: My mom babies or

373
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:47.100
Erik Long: Any my dad.

374
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.770
Erik Long: caters to whatever when she wants.

375
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.790
Richelle Direny: Codes because of our behavior. If I act like this and

376
00:46:54.030 --> 00:47:04.950
Erik Long: Yeah, and she and it's weird, cuz she saw my mom finally moved out. But my little sister.

377
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:16.170
Erik Long: Why do you used to always my dad would sleep on the couch and my little sister would sleep in bed with my mom, up until she was 16

378
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:28.950
Erik Long: And then my dad once his bed and my little sister will go to bed in her room. She 17 years old and then an hour later, go and sleep in the same bed as my father.

379
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:34.380
Richelle Direny: Because she's because it's usually used to it and she get in. They allow it.

380
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.390
Erik Long: Yeah, and

381
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.880
Erik Long: And I'm told to not comment on anything.

382
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.100
Erik Long: My father

383
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.710
Richelle Direny: Why

384
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.570
Erik Long: Because he's he's horribly scared of conflict.

385
00:47:52.950 --> 00:48:09.690
Erik Long: Is like a massive fear of conflict and but like throughout my two years of all my treatment and everything I've been through, you know, like calling people out. A lot of times is needed because people aren't going to change their behavior. No one's telling them what they're doing wrong.

386
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.780
Richelle Direny: True. That is very true.

387
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:14.070
Erik Long: But and

388
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:31.170
Erik Long: But I like when I do call her out. I tried to be doing as respectful of the manner as possible. Like, I'm very nice. I use nice language but like she she throws a tantrum. If you question any of our actions.

389
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.970
Erik Long: BIANCA. This isn't about her. It's about me so

390
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.090
Erik Long: We can this not talk about that.

391
00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.120
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I'm

392
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.150
Richelle Direny: For your

393
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:55.620
Richelle Direny: Now you gave, kind of, you told me a little bit about all three of your siblings. Now, does any of them have, um,

394
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.890
Richelle Direny: Any history of mental on are diagnosed with any type of mental illness.

395
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:15.690
Erik Long: My older one has like really, really, really severe anxiety and panic attacks by like severe anxiety.

396
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.560
Richelle Direny: This is your

397
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.050
Richelle Direny: Master's degree in social work.

398
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.410
Erik Long: Yeah, yeah. She has severe anxiety.

399
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:36.390
Erik Long: But like she goes to therapy and she gets help with it and it seems to be getting better like as a cage. She, she was like the most anxious

400
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:41.100
Erik Long: person I've ever seen my whole life, and then

401
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:48.540
Erik Long: My younger sister has the regression thing which I don't know if you'd call that mental health illness or just

402
00:49:49.650 --> 00:50:00.090
Erik Long: You badly learned behavior. And then my middle sister has like manic depressive disorder like bipolar.

Richelle Direny: So they were diagnosed with these

404
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.670
Richelle Direny: Yeah, don't. But you just say your sister just regressed with a lot, but you're not

405
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.400

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:22.560
Richelle Direny: Because really solid regression because regression. Yeah. That doesn't really sound like that false based on how you're describing, it sounds like it's a word. It's kind of if I act like this mom and dad will get into it.

Richelle Direny: Okay, and so your parents are recently divorced

486
00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:04.740
Erik Long: Well they recently. Finally, like got all the paperwork figured out that it's not been done in Korea.

487
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:06.360
Richelle Direny: Oh, and

488
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:12.150
Erik Long: Dad's finally gotten her do agree to it. She's been paying for it for like three years.

489
00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:14.580
Richelle Direny: And you're you're

490
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.120
Richelle Direny: You're doing your dad have a closer relationship, or is he more supportive your mom.

491
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:27.750
Erik Long: Yeah, yeah. I tell my that everything is very supportive and he's given me more chances than most.

492
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.300
Erik Long: Parents would give their kids so

493
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.280
Erik Long: Very good.

494
00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:37.260
Erik Long: Very great my relationship with my mom is

495
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:42.030
Erik Long: I can only take her in small doses for my own mental health.

496
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:49.740
Erik Long: Because being surrounded by her all the time. It just, I don't know it.

497
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.280
Erik Long: It just makes me sad and like that's not what I need right now so

498
00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:08.790
Erik Long: I do, I do whatever I can to help her. I go over to her house and I take out our trash and clean and do stuff like that for her several times a week.

499
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:24.720
Richelle Direny: Been through a lot kind of pre disposed to a lot. You and your sisters from both sides of your family. So it's kind of like coming from. It's on.

500
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:35.730
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like if I was supposed to do a genome Graham i think that's that's the one I want a Chino frappuccino gram, kind of, it starts off with your grandparents.

501
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:45.930
Richelle Direny: And it goes down to your parents in kind of like, What's the dynamic with your grandparents that that came down to your parents that comes down to you and you

502
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:56.940
Richelle Direny: Will see how the trickling of like what I'm asking the mental illness, the substance abuse all kind of the predisposition, that kind of went from generation to generation. So it will be curious.

503
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:08.790
Richelle Direny: If to hear how your parents are very similar to your grandparents, it will be curious to know what your great grandparents would have been like, so it's going down. So at some point.

504
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:18.990
Richelle Direny: It's kind of with you and your siblings that says, I'm going to stop the cycle here and you know now. Does your sister and I say your sister is married if she have children.

505
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.610
Erik Long: Or not yet.

506
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:29.400
Richelle Direny: So it's kind of like when you know if any of you decide to have children, one day is kind of like how do we stop the cycle here.

507
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:38.790
Richelle Direny: We're work through our issues address them learn how better ways to cope with them being that more therapeutic

508
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:50.940
Richelle Direny: Or from a holistic standpoint. And so when you decide to have get married and have children. It's just being more mindful of, you know,

509
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.250
Richelle Direny: What you bring your children into if you, you know, you understand what I'm saying that

510
00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.720
Richelle Direny: Even be mindful of the partner you choose in life, not to say

511
01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:10.650
Richelle Direny: That, oh, if you have a history of addiction that, but then we are they if they have a history of addiction, where are they, in their sobriety. Are they on the same journey as you

512
01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:17.970
Richelle Direny: Were you're trying to say, hey, let's learn and work through the issues that the issues that we have, have not learned

513
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.350
Erik Long: To help

514
01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:29.010
Richelle Direny: Or to deal with, or to work through before we decide to come together and bring forth children because now I'm continuing the cycle. And I don't want to continue the cycle.

515
01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:36.660
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that will be very interesting. And a lot of it is education. I personally believe in

516
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:42.240
Richelle Direny: Yes, there is the substances, you can learn about

517
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.510
Richelle Direny: Just kind of how

518
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:55.890
Richelle Direny: These chemical dependencies is which whether, whether it's alcohol heroin, cocaine, whatever it is that you took having these chemical dependency.

519
01:00:56.310 --> 01:01:08.940
Richelle Direny: That yes became an issue because you use it and you learn to become addicted to the effects that it gave you suppressed it stopped in major not feel it made you not deal with reality as it is.

520
01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:12.600
Richelle Direny: More I kind of take that approach like

521
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:19.620
Richelle Direny: Let's work through where all of this started because even though we're all of it started.

522
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:30.690
Richelle Direny: You're still faced with situation and circumstances in current day in present day. And that's added to what you're still coping and dealing with in the past. And it sounds like for you just dealing with it within

523
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:42.690
Richelle Direny: The inside of your home, having grandparents and parents struggling with their own things probably even but not knowing necessarily how to deal with these emotions and feelings and

524
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:53.490
Richelle Direny: Which sometimes can be a taboo topic, like, especially as a guy, which to me you hurt and what you mean you're crying. What you mean well, hold up, but God gave me emotions to he gave me a tear ducts. Like I use them.

525
01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:05.130
Richelle Direny: So, you know, but it's it's a learning how to work through a lot of that understanding what that means and understanding that I can't

526
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:23.850
Richelle Direny: I'm not feel I have to feel I have to guess through this. I have to learn how to get through this. I have to learn how to let these emotions, but overwhelming. I have to learn how to get through them and let them pass in a healthier way. Um, so, I think, you know,

527
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:29.460
Richelle Direny: Kind of the approach I like to take is let's talk about some of those issues.

528
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:42.870
Richelle Direny: Have even though mom and dad were in the home that feeling of abandonment a mom, not being nurturing loving, kind of what we created in our mind and what I look at as to what a mom should be

529
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:49.020
Richelle Direny: And her having her struggles with mental illness where that came from an understanding

530
01:02:49.590 --> 01:03:00.600
Richelle Direny: From a holistic standpoint, maybe what she was struggling with and how she used alcohol and other things that she depended on to cope with her own her in her own pain in her own past

531
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:11.340
Richelle Direny: And not being in that place to be able to care for you and your siblings in the way that she needed to and show you that love and support the way she needed to. Same with your dad.

532
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:27.180
Richelle Direny: And and and and this is true because like you said your grandfather is 18 still drinking, smoking, so it goes to show you your grandfather never really learned how to cope and to deal with his issues. So then if your grandfather's your father's father right

533
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so then look at your grandfather, how was that your

534
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.030
Richelle Direny: Father was going to learn from it and you know

535
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:43.830
Richelle Direny: You know, just out of curiosity, one day, just, just to entertain yourself if you want to. There's this movie called

536
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:46.920
Richelle Direny: I can only imagine.

537
01:03:49.170 --> 01:04:03.510
Richelle Direny: Just entertainment is maybe watch it and you kind of see exactly what I'm talking about, of how I mean, even though in that movie. There was a little bit more abuse and everything but the gist of it was what he went through one being like you

538
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:11.790
Richelle Direny: And living with a father. See how his father was like he went through this journey and eventually at one point, kind of

539
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:21.900
Richelle Direny: was granted the ability to see and understood what his father went through and why his father was the way he was

540
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:22.860
Erik Long: And it will

541
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:37.290
Richelle Direny: Learn how to forgive his father, because he then saw how what his father did to him was exactly what happened to his father, so he didn't know how to do anything different, but what he was taught

542
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.300
Richelle Direny: And so bear began the somewhat the forgiving and learning how to

543
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:56.370
Richelle Direny: Do things in a healthier way. I mean, in the movie. He didn't have an addiction issue. I don't remember him having an addiction issue, but it was just like the concept of how generational how we become what we were taught growing up.

544
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:57.600
Erik Long: And what our normal

545
01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.910
Richelle Direny: Looks like so.

546
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.670
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but that would be interesting.

547
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.040
Erik Long: Bringing up the cycle thing like my mom.

548
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:13.230
Erik Long: Growing up would always tell us that like she had broken the cycle and she was important. She was diagnosed by doctors like

549
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:20.250
Erik Long: After her first suicide and she was diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder be head.

550
01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:27.630
Erik Long: And they like pink slip there and Chanda spend a few days in the like psych ward and everything, but

551
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.150
Erik Long: She like as a kid. She said she had broken the cycle.

552
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:49.800
Erik Long: But like I just think it's sad that like like her mom was like her worst nightmare because her mom and I could use turn stuff and then she kind of became the thing that she feared the most

553
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.430
Erik Long: Was becoming just like your mother.

554
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:58.920
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. But then it's if we if you don't get for help and you're not open

555
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:09.990
Richelle Direny: To get the help and not be honest about what your struggle, your own struggles are you can't really truly break that cycle because then you end up falling in this track without recognizing

556
01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:18.630
Richelle Direny: That you fall in the trap and you're repeating because it's like, how does an abuser. How does be abused become an abuser.

557
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:20.580
Richelle Direny: How was that

558
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:35.190
Erik Long: My mom never like physically abused any of us as kids, but she would and she never really abused me at all, but my younger sister, like the one that's four years younger than me.

559
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:45.540
Erik Long: She would threaten killing herself. My mom would killing herself to motivate my sister to do things.

560
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.980
Erik Long: Like

561
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.810
Richelle Direny: There's different types of abuse. I think a lot of abuse, we think of either it be sexual or physical

562
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.510
Erik Long: And yeah, it was definitely psychological

563
01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:06.930
Richelle Direny: psychological abuse. There's a psychological and maybe your mom didn't recognize that it was psychological abuse. There's the psychological theories, the emotional there is the

564
01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:13.800
Richelle Direny: There's just so many different types of abuse and those are the ones that are silent killers, because then the question is,

565
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:18.900
Richelle Direny: You're not it. I don't see the physical evidence, but the child is acting out

566
01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:23.430
Richelle Direny: Maybe there's more than the physical aspect of it. The

567
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.380
Richelle Direny: How the child x

568
01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:32.700
Richelle Direny: Tells me something is wrong. It's for me to sit there and dig deep. Where is this coming from, then you can identify the psychological

569
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.410
What exactly

570
01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.530
Richelle Direny: So, um,
