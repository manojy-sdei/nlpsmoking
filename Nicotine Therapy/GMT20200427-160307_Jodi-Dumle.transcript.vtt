00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.230
Jodi Dumler: You must have found a spot.

2
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.150
Holly Roddenbery: Do what

3
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.070
Jodi Dumler: I said, You must have found a better spot. They said your connection wasn't good. But you find now.

4
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.500
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, hang on just a second, I realized that I didn't charge my phone and I don't have my headset on

5
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.840
Holly Roddenbery: Now, I do.

6
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.730
Holly Roddenbery: That's fine.

7
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.060
Holly Roddenbery: All right, I think I'm all set.

8
00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.850
Jodi Dumler: Last week. Oh.

9
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.880
Jodi Dumler: Interesting. Okay.

10
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.710
Holly Roddenbery: It was

11
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.760
Holly Roddenbery: Drama and

12
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.800
Holly Roddenbery: What is the word for

13
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.690
Holly Roddenbery: Good things happening.

14
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.420
Holly Roddenbery: Let's see.

15
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.260
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah eventful and

16
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.320
Holly Roddenbery: In the end, positive

17
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.270
Holly Roddenbery: Obviously, I have a lot of different issues going on. One being the processing of my dad's estate.

18
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.750
Holly Roddenbery: And I don't think I've gone into too much detail with you on that.

19
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.270
Holly Roddenbery: But that was a big

20
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.130
Is a

21
00:03:48.630 --> 00:04:07.380
Holly Roddenbery: big topic on the emotional agenda this week and and obviously the relationship that I have with john and I really focused on those goals that we've set of making intentional time and

22
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.280
Holly Roddenbery: I was conscious that I wanted to make conscious choices with my time.

23
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.750
Holly Roddenbery: Right, how I spent them.

24
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.930
Holly Roddenbery: Taking intentional time away and intentional time together.

25
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.860
Holly Roddenbery: Well, sometimes I can be conscious of what I need to do, but not conscious about doing it.

26
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:36.990
Holly Roddenbery: Um, and then obviously the time of part one can be challenging to do. And at first I didn't

27
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:49.470
Holly Roddenbery: I allowed myself to say okay TOMORROW NIGHT OR okay later. And we just kind of continued with our schedule of

28
00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:09.870
Holly Roddenbery: normalcy, and it was very obvious that neither of us were okay with going back to normal. And that's because we are both people that do not like

29
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.920
Holly Roddenbery: being stuck in the mire.

30
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:25.380
Holly Roddenbery: And like our habits and our patterns in our relationship of not being respectful towards one another and dealing with this problem.

31
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.860
Holly Roddenbery: Was really stinking up our hearts.

32
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.540
Holly Roddenbery: And

33
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:42.120
Holly Roddenbery: We just we we know that we want to address that in a way that is beneficial to our relationship and to

34
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.950
Holly Roddenbery: Each other. I guess ourselves and

35
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.340
Holly Roddenbery: We did have some ironing out of problems.

36
00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:02.280
Holly Roddenbery: To talk about and we're not usually people who will make, I guess.

37
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:17.220
Holly Roddenbery: Will be straightforward about like having these sit down conversation. So they kind of arouse themselves through certain situations we were facing so it was emotional

38
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:30.360
Holly Roddenbery: Meaning that there was like some shrapnel from his week of drinking. And my mom like trying to be there for me.

39
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.090
Holly Roddenbery: And

40
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:42.600
Holly Roddenbery: supporting me and she wasn't too keen on us getting back together so quickly. And whenever

41
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:58.350
Holly Roddenbery: The conversations are phone. I had a phone conversation with my mom and I wasn't positive and it was upsetting to both JOHN AND MY MOM AND JOHN can really dealt with some emotions after that.

42
00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.460
And

43
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.260
Holly Roddenbery: He tried to take some time to process that is very quiet and just reading

44
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:28.650
Holly Roddenbery: Just taking time to try to work through it, rather than ignore it can tell. And I thought that that was good. But I am someone who bothered the shadow, not to know what was in his mind and what he was thinking and how he was feeling so I go into automatic like, blah, blah.

45
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:40.710
Holly Roddenbery: Trying to talk about every angle that emotionally and I think it was good because it helped me to work through some of my emotions around everything

46
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.960
Holly Roddenbery: And also to let him know how much I care about her that whenever I talked to my mom about a

47
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.570
Holly Roddenbery: Relationship that it wasn't something that was gossipy or

48
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:04.680
Holly Roddenbery: Negative. It was very real and heartfelt and that I was very scared that this was the end of our relationship. And then I was in a pickle.

49
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.930
Holly Roddenbery: So,

50
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:16.290
Holly Roddenbery: I think that kind of helped him that helped both of us because I was able to let him know some of the hurt, rather than keeping it bottled up

51
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.980
Holly Roddenbery: And he was able to express how he's still hurt.

52
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.680
Holly Roddenbery: So we've been trying to work through things

53
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:40.110
Holly Roddenbery: But we, in the process. It was hard to stay away from that we wanted to comfort each other. We wanted to know each other to feel comforted that we

54
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.090
Holly Roddenbery: love each other.

55
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.270
Holly Roddenbery: So I think we had a habit of trying to

56
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.840
Holly Roddenbery: love each other. There's wins. After we gash them.

57
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.760
Holly Roddenbery: So being the hurt and the healer. Bye.

58
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.810
Holly Roddenbery: That or it seems to be

59
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.590
Holly Roddenbery: That that's that we need some space.

60
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.870
Holly Roddenbery: To heal.

61
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.790
Holly Roddenbery: And

62
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.450
Holly Roddenbery: Hey, so, and all the all

63
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.690
Holly Roddenbery: I'm not. I'm on my meeting with Jody

64
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.060
Holly Roddenbery: That is john we're both working

65
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.720
Holly Roddenbery: Right now.

66
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:47.490
Holly Roddenbery: Trying to get to do this morning, rather than wanting to be better about that intentional around

67
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.180
Holly Roddenbery: A lot this week, or this

68
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.340
Holly Roddenbery: Week with

69
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.680
Holly Roddenbery: Not being

70
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:24.360
Holly Roddenbery: In conscious about what I'm doing and john called me out on that got really annoyed by that because I was supposed to be taking them with him, and there was to do and kept texting my sister about family drama and trying to do post up on Blackboard for my

71
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:32.550
Holly Roddenbery: As my computer was being slow and I told him like, okay, I'll get this done in five minutes and we'll go for a walk.

72
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:50.790
Holly Roddenbery: It is about being over an hour and he shared his emotion without being annoyed by that and that it's a constant problem in our relationship that he gets that he's annoyed by

73
00:10:51.810 --> 00:11:09.120
Holly Roddenbery: So in that and I did respond very defensively, because I have a route. I guess about working too hard and being driven, but also not taking time to prioritize and

74
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.290
Holly Roddenbery: Let our relationship.

75
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:39.540
Holly Roddenbery: Take some hard hits because of that. So I think the positive thing that cannot have that was being able to fight through that in a way that wasn't negative. I mean, it was very emotion code but letting my guard down and approaching it with less anger.

76
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.210
Holly Roddenbery: And just sharing the heart with each other.

77
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.900
Holly Roddenbery: Or at least on my part.

78
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.670
Holly Roddenbery: Was beneficial for us.

79
00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:05.550
Holly Roddenbery: So if anything, it was an example how to not just get angry and be destructive when things arise, but to

80
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:20.490
Holly Roddenbery: See where the anger is coming from where the heart is and see how, if there is a way to address that heart. And if there's not an answer to be okay with

81
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.440
Holly Roddenbery: Always all

82
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:23.610
Right.

83
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.230
And

84
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.400
Holly Roddenbery: With I guess what I'm saying.

85
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:40.050
Holly Roddenbery: So yeah, just some of the things that happened and I last night I did finally stay downstairs.

86
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:56.070
Holly Roddenbery: And spend like a night for myself and do things that I wanted to do and get some thoughts and feelings and I don't know. John's ready for 100% sobriety.

87
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:58.530
Holly Roddenbery: Depends you

88
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:10.620
Holly Roddenbery: Were grilling out yesterday. Go and get some like seltzer alcoholic Seltzer. And it was sort of like

89
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:26.610
Holly Roddenbery: Not like hard liquor, but it was had liquor in it, but it was like also mixed with bubbly water or something like that and cans and they only they only sold by 12 pack. But before he went and got it. He kind of

90
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:37.650
Holly Roddenbery: Let me know that he'd made the old get up. It was going to make me upset and I

91
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:44.430
Holly Roddenbery: Let him know that I didn't want to be the stop sign that

92
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.520
Holly Roddenbery: I that was not something that's been good in our relationship. And he knows that.

93
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.670
Holly Roddenbery: But instead, our

94
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.350
Holly Roddenbery: Able to offer him some wisdom.

95
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.740
Holly Roddenbery: About cycles and

96
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:22.290
Holly Roddenbery: Just knowing that there is a lack of control that he's admitted over it, asking him to question what's making him desire to do that. What is it in him that makes that now thinks that that's a good idea when it's been so destructive in the past and

97
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.360
Holly Roddenbery: Then

98
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:39.960
Holly Roddenbery: To just mind that even if this time rust and again and then that trust that you have with thinking of control over it ultimately leads to another downfall.

99
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.800
Holly Roddenbery: So I've been able to see some cycles.

100
00:14:45.690 --> 00:15:00.720
Holly Roddenbery: And pointed out in a non judgmental way which that was what he addressed with me while you're expressing our feelings ever. That's right. He felt judged in the past.

101
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:21.330
Holly Roddenbery: By my desire not to be announced in a few drinks and I said, understand that and it has been instrumental in the past, and it did nothing for me but making me happy on cravings and I do have myself to look out for. And all of this and it will not just our relationship.

102
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.510
Holly Roddenbery: I'll be honest, that is concerned.

103
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.180
Holly Roddenbery: By the whole idea behind, not wanting to be around you. It's more

104
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:43.170
Holly Roddenbery: Out of protection. I think this kind of operates it but kinda I should have let him know that

105
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.810
Holly Roddenbery: It was it was protection for a relationship or us more myself.

106
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.270
Holly Roddenbery: That I just said it was

107
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.510
Holly Roddenbery: Good how that could make him feel though that's not what I'm trying to do.

108
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.760
And

109
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.300
Holly Roddenbery: Where we

110
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:18.690
Holly Roddenbery: spent the night apart know what he did, he kind of jumped on me this morning and things have been going and going.

111
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.890
Holly Roddenbery: And it made me really nervous because of all of PTSD. I have learned everything

112
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.020
Holly Roddenbery: But I, I know that I manage myself better

113
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.610
Jodi Dumler: So it sounds like you felt like you had a lot of

114
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.300
Jodi Dumler: Processing done this week. It sounds like

115
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:59.670
Holly Roddenbery: Yes, I haven't even gotten through all of it, but I know I'm just rambling about everything right now. Right. Yeah, there was definitely a lot of processing to be done there and

116
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.870
Jodi Dumler: So doing into this week.

117
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.760
Jodi Dumler: You know, you notice that you wanted to be intentional, but you weren't

118
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.620
Jodi Dumler: fully able to maybe accomplish it as much as you wanted

119
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:26.610
Jodi Dumler: And so what are you, you know, looking at last week and going into this week. What are some changes, you're hoping to to make

120
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.720
Holly Roddenbery: Being

121
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:39.030
Holly Roddenbery: Like scheduling times that we want to commit to doing something with each other like painting.

122
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:48.180
Holly Roddenbery: Or doing art projects or some of these things that we wanted to do together but

123
00:17:50.190 --> 00:18:05.340
Holly Roddenbery: It seems like when he's ready to do them. I'm not when I'm ready to do them. He's not and just being sensitive to that and we're going to do something, let's plan it or let's give more of a general

124
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:16.710
Holly Roddenbery: Or specific time and less generality more specifics. Whenever it comes to being intentional wait time

125
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.090
Holly Roddenbery: Being together and apart and

126
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.870
Holly Roddenbery: Then there's a lot of things in other areas that

127
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.630
Holly Roddenbery: Be intentional to

128
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.530
Holly Roddenbery: Mainly comp plan essentially

129
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.650
Jodi Dumler: Okay, so it sounds good.

130
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.140
Jodi Dumler: I'm very practical. So how do you make that happen.

131
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.280
Holly Roddenbery: Well, right now I have

132
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.220
Holly Roddenbery: This to do list.

133
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.400
Holly Roddenbery: That I'm working on, because whenever I found myself.

134
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:12.420
Holly Roddenbery: Doing something that I probably shouldn't have been doing first thing on Monday morning.

135
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:24.750
Holly Roddenbery: I realized that I need to make another to do list. I mean, I have this long one here that I've just attach note card after note card that I'm writing a new one. You know, go back over that.

136
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:35.280
Jodi Dumler: Do you have, I mean, I'm assuming, with all your schooling and everything that you do that you have like a plan or something where you have when you have to do certain things, or what you know.

137
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:36.540
Holly Roddenbery: I have

138
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.390
Holly Roddenbery: an addendum to the syllabus now.

139
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:56.280
Holly Roddenbery: That I'm working off of. That's kind of the larger picture. But we're obviously moving in the finals week so right now I need to make a class prep to the West as well and and block out some time to accomplish that.

140
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:14.880
Holly Roddenbery: I'm not great with using planners, I'll get one. I'll start to use it. But if it doesn't fit with the program, then it gets booted out like I have a program. I have a a just use it as a calendar. Now in the other room.

141
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:36.090
Holly Roddenbery: my to do list systems to do pretty well for me because I get the satisfaction of being able to check them off whenever I'm like, what am I supposed to be doing right now I go to it and see what is like the most

142
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.940
Holly Roddenbery: Or what I need to be working on.

143
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.980
Jodi Dumler: And and

144
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:53.910
Holly Roddenbery: Then I will usually save them because some things get pushed back or change or just never get around to not enough time and then I'll just keep rewriting them.

145
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.240
Holly Roddenbery: So it's been a good system for me.

146
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:02.760
Jodi Dumler: So his time with john on your to do list. Yeah.

147
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:10.440
Holly Roddenbery: It mentioned it's such a beautiful day out that he wants to go for a bike ride so I

148
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.260
Holly Roddenbery: Said that is the one intentional thing I want to make sure happens

149
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.990
Jodi Dumler: Okay. Are you planning on staying downstairs for a little longer, or you think you're going to do what you did last week.

150
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.610
Holly Roddenbery: I want to at least stay down here, one or two notes.

151
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.930
Jodi Dumler: Okay.

152
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.000
Holly Roddenbery: Because it was nice.

153
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.600
Holly Roddenbery: I hope that he agrees for that.

154
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:38.370
Yeah.

155
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.920
Holly Roddenbery: Yes, about

156
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.070
Holly Roddenbery: Not making each other feel hurt and taking that time to

157
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.890
Holly Roddenbery: Are using it as like a Dart to throw

158
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:59.190
Holly Roddenbery: By really doing it for the right reason for hope the benefits

159
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.520
Jodi Dumler: Right, and that's one of those things that if

160
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.500
Jodi Dumler: You set the days that you're going to not sleep there. It's more intentional versus

161
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.890
Jodi Dumler: Refreshing. You know, like it. It's not it doesn't

162
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.210
Holly Roddenbery: I'm picking tonight's

163
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.250
Jodi Dumler: The night. Right.

164
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.350
Jodi Dumler: You don't have ya accept because, I mean, even if you

165
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:37.590
Jodi Dumler: If you planned it but then it's got to stick with it, you know, because I think the trick is you can schedule it so like say think Wednesday night Thursday night or whatever.

166
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:50.970
Jodi Dumler: But then if you knew consistently decide you're going to change your mind, then the night that you decide you're not going to change nine. It's like, because you know you decided to keep it because you were in, they were you know he was in trouble or

167
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.110
Holly Roddenbery: Something. Yeah, right.

168
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.250
Holly Roddenbery: That didn't feel good to me. You know, it was sort of

169
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.510
Holly Roddenbery: Like yeah I'm

170
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:11.970
Holly Roddenbery: Taking this intention, but now it's not a choice. It's because of something and it felt. I guess like

171
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.070
Holly Roddenbery: There was

172
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.150
Holly Roddenbery: A decision to push me away and

173
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.650
Holly Roddenbery: That is partially both of our decisions.

174
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:35.340
Holly Roddenbery: Invited something that I've made clear to him that I don't want to be around so

175
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:47.310
Holly Roddenbery: You know, I've made I've made the choice to not be near that. But he made the choice to so sort of like we both made that choice.

176
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:55.770
Holly Roddenbery: So yeah, taking the time whenever it's not forced. Yeah.

177
00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.390
Jodi Dumler: But like I think it. I think it's still for safety sake, if

178
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:17.790
Jodi Dumler: He drinks to just have an agreement that it's, I mean, I think it's fair. I know you said you wanted to say, you know, it was for safety of your relationship but i think it's it's really fair to say I don't trust myself and how I how I am. When you drink. Yeah.

179
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.100
Holly Roddenbery: That's what I've told him.

180
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.300
Jodi Dumler: Like if you drink. I can't stay there that night. Like, that's just a

181
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.600
Holly Roddenbery: hard and fast. Yeah, we can't. I mean, is it

182
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:35.520
Holly Roddenbery: This is so repetitive and are now almost two years relationship that

183
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.100
Holly Roddenbery: He knows that I don't handle myself well around it.

184
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.620
Holly Roddenbery: Trust that

185
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:51.030
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, now this is, I mean, you guys are doing something very tricky because you're

186
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.820
Jodi Dumler: Not separating but you're trying to work through things

187
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.320
Jodi Dumler: And so it's a very difficult

188
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:10.200
Jodi Dumler: Challenging process for you guys this way. So I mean it's good that you're continuing to like revisit to say, okay, let's

189
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.210
Jodi Dumler: Let's make this week and last week.

190
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.730
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah yeah yeah

191
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.160
Holly Roddenbery: There's

192
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.580
Holly Roddenbery: There's definitely some good a lot of good. There's definitely a lot of bad

193
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.990
Holly Roddenbery: And at some point you have to just say,

194
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.970
Holly Roddenbery: We are imperfect people and

195
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:50.640
Holly Roddenbery: Realize that the intentions to want to be better people and better to each other. Is there. And I think that that is the most positive thing that we manage to have a relationship.

196
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.110
Jodi Dumler: Do you feel like at some point.

197
00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.740
Jodi Dumler: And I think he, I think he knows it, but at the same time. Do you feel like at some point.

198
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:12.060
Jodi Dumler: You're going to have to have the discussion that you do realize if you continue to drink out always have to leave like you know i mean

199
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.530
Holly Roddenbery: Eventually, I think that will have to

200
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:22.680
Holly Roddenbery: I think that that will begin to smell. After a while, and that

201
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.920
Holly Roddenbery: My hopes are

202
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.470
Holly Roddenbery: He can

203
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.600
Holly Roddenbery: Find an appealing with themselves and

204
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.970
Holly Roddenbery: To want to have that, because I know that doesn't want to have this issue.

205
00:26:45.030 --> 00:27:00.210
Holly Roddenbery: I know from talking with him about it that this is there something deeper and darker and then I knew about previously and seeing the depths of where he's come from.

206
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.380
Holly Roddenbery: I have to look on it and see that he has made

207
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.360
Holly Roddenbery: A lot of improvement and I can respect that knowing where I've come from.

208
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:19.590
Holly Roddenbery: And that my trip through getting sober.

209
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:28.500
Holly Roddenbery: There was a point in time where I'd get high every day marijuana and I

210
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:38.700
Holly Roddenbery: Use other things in place of oxy cotton to to fill the void.

211
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.980
Holly Roddenbery: Right and

212
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.610
Holly Roddenbery: I thought that I was doing so good.

213
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:53.880
Holly Roddenbery: Because I wasn't doing that. One thing that had really messed me up. And so, I realized that

214
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.470
Holly Roddenbery: Our stages and getting well sometimes

215
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.920
Holly Roddenbery: I mean, I see that there's there's grabbed yeah

216
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.130
Yeah.

217
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:18.480
Holly Roddenbery: I have seen times doing the best bad that you I guess best is good in the bad that you can do is progress.

218
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.450
Jodi Dumler: Right, I'm saying, yeah.

219
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:30.390
Jodi Dumler: He's got he's got to reach to where he knows what to do instead to manage that and I think that takes a while.

220
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.090
Jodi Dumler: Yes, hopefully. Hopefully my patience and love for him that last

221
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.160
Jodi Dumler: One, if it gets hard because I always think with

222
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.350
Jodi Dumler: I mean, it just

223
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:55.380
Jodi Dumler: Your brain can only heal. If you're not doing other things. And so until you aren't it's it just can't heal so you're kind of just prolong it and that's kind of what

224
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.550
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah yeah

225
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:06.900
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, I've kind of we've had those conversations to about how we carve paths paths.

226
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.700
Holly Roddenbery: With our mind.

227
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:29.370
Holly Roddenbery: And what our thought patterns and had to talk openly with him about Suboxone being something that yes, my body is has an addiction to it, but in the mind. I've carved different paths to deal with my addictive behaviors and

228
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:40.710
Holly Roddenbery: It took me a long time to carve this paths and to find out. Know what was the right path.

229
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:50.370
Holly Roddenbery: Because I want to start carving another and then see that okay, this isn't the right way, I'm honest. Yeah, so

230
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.180
Holly Roddenbery: It does take

231
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.450
Holly Roddenbery: Intention rather than

232
00:29:59.010 --> 00:29:59.670
Holly Roddenbery: Replacing

233
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:14.310
Jodi Dumler: Yeah. Well, and that's that's that's the hard thing, too, is you're going to have. Okay, thanks for a while and it May or June medicine that makes you sick, but it just depends on how your health is if you can even use those. So

234
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.310
Jodi Dumler: We haven't really decided what you want to do.

235
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:20.250
Holly Roddenbery: I'm

236
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.950
Holly Roddenbery: Just be brought up to them. Yeah, I def definitely discussed

237
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.310
Holly Roddenbery: Medication for

238
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.720
Holly Roddenbery: The drinking and stuff. I don't know face.

239
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.560
Holly Roddenbery: Ready for that ready for that as an option.

240
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.600
Holly Roddenbery: Sometimes it's when we realize that

241
00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.500
Holly Roddenbery: You need that.

242
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.160
Holly Roddenbery: It becomes desirable.

243
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.460
Holly Roddenbery: And something that you're willing to try

244
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.540
Right.

245
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:08.820
Jodi Dumler: When he. It sounds like even though he's he's he's making a gradual trend, you know, trajectory would kind of up and that's good and

246
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:18.090
Jodi Dumler: It's still a long way coming way getting really where he's fully ready and I think was, yeah.

247
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:26.340
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah I Something just hit me. I guess I really felt his words he spoke.

248
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:32.070
Holly Roddenbery: A couple of months ago texted me and said, I might not always

249
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:40.650
Holly Roddenbery: make the right decision. But I am trying to figure this thing out.

250
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.340
Holly Roddenbery: And

251
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:46.770
Paste.

252
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.240
Holly Roddenbery: And I have been stubborn to

253
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.130
Holly Roddenbery: Probably some nights continue to struggle with on occasion.

254
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:04.920
Holly Roddenbery: Well,

255
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.560
Jodi Dumler: You can use that for your good sometimes. So, that's okay.

256
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:24.750
Jodi Dumler: I think my biggest thing for it. And I think just what I'm going to continue to check in on and reiterate every time when we talk. It's just the making sure that you are

257
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.100
Jodi Dumler: Being protective of yourself and that you keep that

258
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.140
Jodi Dumler: As you do love him. And so it makes it difficult

259
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:48.450
Jodi Dumler: And I don't. I think boundaries are just so important for you guys to figure everything out. So that's kind of why I keep checking on it because I'm hoping. Like we talked last week that

260
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:58.140
Jodi Dumler: You guys can see some progress a little quicker than like six months from now, just depending on how slow you do do this. Yeah.

261
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:05.550
Jodi Dumler: So it really is. I mean, really, I guess it just depends on how long you want this whole thing to go but yeah

262
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.820
Jodi Dumler: But I also want you to fill

263
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:17.160
Jodi Dumler: I think it's, I mean, I think you have a blessing in that you guys who are both struggling with something that you can understand each other.

264
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.910
Jodi Dumler: And I think it also makes it a challenge.

265
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:34.500
Jodi Dumler: Because you don't want to hurt him. And you understand how that feels. But you also stuff to protect yourself. So it makes it very difficult to put you in

266
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.200
Holly Roddenbery: This they can be very

267
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:46.200
Holly Roddenbery: Beautiful, though. And the way that it used for good and then like the way that I see see

268
00:33:47.310 --> 00:34:00.150
Holly Roddenbery: Reasoning behind why and why people suggest that to people who have addiction should not have a relationship and like I see the truths and the wisdom in that

269
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:07.680
Holly Roddenbery: But I also see that there's something beautiful in that when you're able to

270
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.500
Holly Roddenbery: Help one another.

271
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.300
Holly Roddenbery: Through it

272
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.010
Holly Roddenbery: So,

273
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:20.490
Holly Roddenbery: I know it's often times that this is happening for a reason.

274
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:31.350
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you do have a benefit in that you're not addicted to the same thing.

275
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.380
Jodi Dumler: Yes, so that makes me that would make it

276
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.420
Holly Roddenbery: One of our more

277
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:47.730
Holly Roddenbery: Interesting fact one of our first conversations that we had when we first met each other at this pen lines for craft craft camp or art camp for adults.

278
00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.920
Holly Roddenbery: Was as we were working how we got into these

279
00:34:54.090 --> 00:35:00.720
Holly Roddenbery: On this intense level of understanding with each other that we did must be familiar spirit or something.

280
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.220
Holly Roddenbery: But

281
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:11.820
Holly Roddenbery: I just remember him saying, I always take things to the extreme. I always take them too far. I don't know.

282
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:23.130
Holly Roddenbery: There's no such thing as too far with me and I was like, there is such thing as too far. Trust me, I've been there. I hadn't turned back

283
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.500
Holly Roddenbery: And

284
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:40.770
Holly Roddenbery: It was just like he picked that up instantly and knew what I was talking about. And I knew exactly what he was talking about that he's stubborn and bullheaded and will plow through things

285
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.300
Holly Roddenbery: And make thing.

286
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:53.220
Jodi Dumler: Yeah. And like I said personality traits are good.

287
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.050
Jodi Dumler: Me bad

288
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.220
Jodi Dumler: There's always two sides to things.

289
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:09.150
Jodi Dumler: OK, so the biggest goals. That sounds like is two to three nights away intentionally picked

290
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.010
Jodi Dumler: So in the near future, you should pick those because you're running your on Monday.

291
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.080
Jodi Dumler: And the other thing is just sounds like using your to do list and really

292
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.770
Jodi Dumler: Having him on there and do your work on there and

293
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:48.030
Jodi Dumler: Get both get both in so that's good. And you had mentioned and you know you told me in the past about your of the state is you would you would talk to me about the division and how that didn't work. You know how that have not ended well and how it had been worded and all of that.

294
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.320
Jodi Dumler: But that's, yes.

295
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.280
Holly Roddenbery: So there was that struggle there shrapnel from

296
00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:01.200
Holly Roddenbery: I realized that was shrapnel some my negative choices in life and that's why that hurt so bad.

297
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:16.380
Holly Roddenbery: That I I'm fairly or I guess with negative feelings lashed out at my sister ever it, but we're we're OK, we have a past that we need each other and

298
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.650
Holly Roddenbery: That has been helpful because

299
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:24.810
Holly Roddenbery: My parents were divorced, but man, a long time ago.

300
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.050
Holly Roddenbery: Things didn't go well. And they're divorced and they were just constantly fighting

301
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.180
Holly Roddenbery: Each other to court and my mom taking him to court.

302
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.670
Holly Roddenbery: And and then when I got her stroke went on became

303
00:37:44.190 --> 00:38:00.270
Holly Roddenbery: She had compassion for the fact that my sister was pregnant. I was in grad school, my brother, nobody trusts them to be a caretaker. And then I realized that was a burden that have been placed on us and

304
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:19.530
Holly Roddenbery: She has been a caretaker before for her parents and wanted to help. So with humility and compassion. She took my dad and and I think there was also love there too.

305
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.400
Yeah.

306
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.530
Holly Roddenbery: And

307
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:42.900
Holly Roddenbery: Sometimes she didn't like herself, because it was very big thing to step up to do. And so there was a lot of emotions involved for her. And when she was upset and getting like what she volunteered herself to go

308
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:51.180
Holly Roddenbery: She would say that we need to be paying her and she would switch to this professional role of

309
00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:06.330
Holly Roddenbery: You guys need to be paying more. This is what it should cost. And at that point, there was issues with my sister getting his assets in order to where he could afford that high level of care.

310
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.520
Holly Roddenbery: And he passed away before that problem was ever resolved.

311
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.360
Holly Roddenbery: And there wasn't ever a

312
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:26.310
Holly Roddenbery: Agreeable number that we could come up with. And now she has a claim against the State.

313
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:35.160
Holly Roddenbery: Or quite a, quite a some there would be luxury at home health care for two plus years.

314
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:43.200
Holly Roddenbery: So that's obviously upsetting to us, our children and

315
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.790
Holly Roddenbery: And

316
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:51.180
Holly Roddenbery: To her. Yeah, because it's a lot of residual anger and

317
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.150
Holly Roddenbery: That is

318
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.600
Holly Roddenbery: Involved in this

319
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.840
Holly Roddenbery: tricky situation. I've been talking with my

320
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.380
Holly Roddenbery: Family pastor about it weekly

321
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.650
Holly Roddenbery: She's keeping my dog.

322
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.250
Holly Roddenbery: She's on oxygen now because she's

323
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.660
Holly Roddenbery: No longer smoking, which is a good thing.

324
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.150
Holly Roddenbery: Like, it's not a pretty situation.

325
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.280
Holly Roddenbery: And I know that she probably doesn't need to be keeping my dog.

326
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.060
Holly Roddenbery: And it's the same thing with that tried to pay her, but she turns that away.

327
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:51.840
Holly Roddenbery: Doesn't want to take money from her. She wants to be the mother roles but yet he needs the money and gets angry at times she really had had some emotional problems.

328
00:40:52.830 --> 00:41:03.180
Holly Roddenbery: Brought on by damage in her brain from the stroke cyclic thinking and not being able to rationalize. So this is another headache.

329
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.840
Holly Roddenbery: And got a plan.

330
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.010
Holly Roddenbery: See how that goes. Okay.

331
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:19.620
Jodi Dumler: So it so it sounds like you said you're talking weekly with your pastor and you're able to just that sounds like that time is really devoted to family.

332
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:22.470
Jodi Dumler: Processing and

333
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.870
Jodi Dumler: All of that is that

334
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.090
Jodi Dumler: Right. Okay, good.

335
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.550
Holly Roddenbery: Also, he's aware of our situation.

336
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:34.260
Holly Roddenbery: And

337
00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:36.390
Holly Roddenbery: filled him.

338
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.170
Holly Roddenbery: In he just continues to do so.

339
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:47.610
Holly Roddenbery: But mainly. This is what we talked about situation.

340
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.410
Jodi Dumler: Perfect. Well, that helps me because then I know he's

341
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.350
Jodi Dumler: Bringing up stuff about the family and you want to talk about, you can, you know, to throw it in chat. So I have no the mix.

342
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.310
Holly Roddenbery: But if I know my God I have so much on me that I happen to have

343
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:03.480
Holly Roddenbery: Several therapist.

344
00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.000
Jodi Dumler: That's actually wonderful because that way we know who's doing what.

345
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.740
Yes.

346
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:18.240
Jodi Dumler: Because otherwise. Yeah, it's hard to get it all in. And you know the one meeting week so if we can split it on her that's better, that's good.

347
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.090
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, I do Sunday's with them or him in this way, Mondays.

348
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:40.320
Jodi Dumler: Good. That's awesome though. Okay. Yeah, I haven't heard any we had talked about it and you know I asked you to go and do that, and you said you had it, but I hadn't heard I know if it was continuing and how often so that's good to know.

349
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.580
Holly Roddenbery: This

350
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.100
Holly Roddenbery: I definitely reach out for

351
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.140

352
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.780
Holly Roddenbery: Are you back with me.

353
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:10.560
Yep.

354
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.890
Holly Roddenbery: Okay, sorry, whenever it seems to be one.

355
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.200
Holly Roddenbery: Walk in a certain part of it doesn't do so well.

356
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:20.190
Jodi Dumler: That's okay.

357
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.780
Jodi Dumler: Okay.

358
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:23.610
Holly Roddenbery: So, thank you.

359
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:29.100
Holly Roddenbery: for talking with me and just be in here. A lot of times I need a sounding board.

360
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.240
Jodi Dumler: Time we all could use that

361
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.280

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.300
Holly Roddenbery: Wise points to talk about

363
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.720
Holly Roddenbery: Appreciate it. This is helping

364
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.860
Guide

365
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.390
Jodi Dumler: Now, please let me know. For for missing something. But it sounds like

366
00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.540
Jodi Dumler: Right now we know what the focus is so

367
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:09.240
Jodi Dumler: Good. And you're fine. Okay. We kind of touched on the relationship with family, just in general, self care wise holding up. How are you doing,

368
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.560
Holly Roddenbery: I can't believe that I'm standing

369
00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:15.600
Holly Roddenbery: Am

370
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.360
Jodi Dumler: Hey man, you must be doing something right. Okay.

371
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.960
Yeah.

372
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:26.820
Holly Roddenbery: I guess, whenever you really have the crisis going on. You really want to

373
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.630
Holly Roddenbery: Do things right and

374
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:38.100
Holly Roddenbery: This is the way I know and I'm walking, not so

375
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.750
Holly Roddenbery: Good go better than I did last week during the stores.

376
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.950
Jodi Dumler: Okay, so you're feeling like hopefully

377
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.090
Jodi Dumler: They're continuing but maybe they're not quite as big of waves.

378
00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:57.990
Jodi Dumler: At least not right now.

379
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.930
Holly Roddenbery: If I at least watch my own way. I'll be doing something good.

380
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:05.850
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, I

381
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.150
Jodi Dumler: Think I lost your sound.

382
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.760
Holly Roddenbery: Here. Can you hear me.

383
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.440
Jodi Dumler: Now again, like

384
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:37.800
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, yeah. I think that was a wise statement, you said about the wave. That's what I caught before you went away. I'm about, you know, managing your own way, because then you can feel good about the component, you have the most control over. So that's

385
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.480
Jodi Dumler: Essential

386
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.610
Jodi Dumler: Okay, so we've got the plan, you're going to dive into it.

387
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.450
Jodi Dumler: And we're going to see how the week goes yeah

388
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.450

Jodi Dumler: Sounds good to me. Let me

390
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:08.520
Jodi Dumler: I'm pretty sure I don't have anything that's the one nice thing about this whole coronavirus thing is that my life got. I mean, I'm so busy, but I'm home. So I'm like you, I think I'm here.

391
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.710
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, it's sort of like

392
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:20.940
Holly Roddenbery: You have this extreme workspace like people who work at a desk with the computer is all around them like 360 workspace.

393
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:24.780
Holly Roddenbery: Helpful for me.

394
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:34.800
Jodi Dumler: It's good amenities are usually pretty good for meeting so that actually works really well to do them and continue the Monday, so it will actually be in Maine. Next week, right. The fourth

395
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.940
Holly Roddenbery: Yep, I'm checking my calendar really quick.

396
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:39.480
Okay.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.160
Holly Roddenbery: That looks good to me.

398
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.050
Jodi Dumler: Okay, I'll just plan on the same time next week.

399
00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:03.270
Jodi Dumler: Sounds good. All right, reach out if you need something now, I guess. Now, you have my number saved in your phone. So, yes.

400
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.190
Holly Roddenbery: Alright. Have a good week.

408
00:47:48.630 --> 00:48:01.290
Jodi Dumler: Feel very at peace with the decisions that she makes and comforted when she's struggling and I just asked for wisdom and discernment, as she continues forth in your son Jesus name we pray amen

409
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:09.540
Holly Roddenbery: Wisdom was the thing that I really noticed has been answered the most

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.250
Holly Roddenbery: So you. I'll see you next week.
