Everything.

191
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.900
Jennifer C.: Just everything that's happened the past year.

192
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.430
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Oh.

193
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.670
Jennifer C.: She definitely agrees with the depression.

194
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.140
Natalie Austin: Good, yeah.

195
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.520
Natalie Austin: Okay.

196
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.030
Jennifer C.: Well, I think.

197
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.350
Natalie Austin: She pretty much was it as

198
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.260
Jennifer C.: Yeah. She pretty much sees it as well. You've been through so much hit this past year. How are you not depressed.

199
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.060
Jennifer C.: Yeah, exactly, you know,

200
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.540
Jennifer C.: So we're gonna stick with that.

201
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.080
Jennifer C.: And then I see her again on the fourth

202
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.090
Natalie Austin: Okay, perfect.

203
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.470
Natalie Austin: Oh, that's nice. I mean, talking, talking, stuff out.

204
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.600
Natalie Austin: You know, really help. Yeah, you know,

205
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.650
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

206
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.180
Natalie Austin: It gets it out of your system.

207
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.090
Jennifer C.: Right, because you can't just always talk to kids, you know,

208
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.870
Natalie Austin: Or your friends. Your friends don't always want to listen to everything you say you know

209
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.620
Right.

210
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.680
Jennifer C.: My circle is very small, anyway.

211
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.910
Yeah.

212
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.620
Jennifer C.: I think there's the older you get, the less you want to do.

213
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.940
Natalie Austin: Exactly, yeah. Less people you want to deal with right that your immediate friends or or people are actually close to you.

214
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:12.030
Jennifer C.: Right. Like there's just things like it's just I don't know where I live. It's just so small that

215
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.850
Jennifer C.: You don't even want to go to like fairs in the summertime, because you don't want to run into people from high school.

216
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.140
Natalie Austin: Right, yeah.

217
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.570
Jennifer C.: So it's like we don't even go to that crowd because it's always fighting and just dumb shit.

218
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.590
Oh,

219
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.430
Natalie Austin: So you went to school used to live in the same town you went to school in

220
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.840
Natalie Austin: Yeah yeah

221
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.620
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

222
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.080
Natalie Austin: Yeah, I missed, I missed one town over. I don't see them like you do. That's funny.

223
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.710
Jennifer C.: Yeah, it's like date is is it's a big city, but there's like all these little suburbs.

224
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.630
Jennifer C.: Suburbs you go to the all around, there's somebody there that you know

225
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:49.920
Uh,

226
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.010
Natalie Austin: Huh.

227
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.920
Jennifer C.: Sucks about it but

228
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.560
Natalie Austin: Or your daughter's going to the same school you went to

229
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.920
Jennifer C.: Yeah, they're in the same school district. I was in

230
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.300
Natalie Austin: Yeah, okay.

231
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:12.570
Jennifer C.: Two different schools, but they're the same, like one student was older than the other one. But they're going to the same schools that I went to. Yeah.

232
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.380
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

233
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.120
Natalie Austin: What are they the same teachers you had

234
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.080
Jennifer C.: Some of them, but most of them are probably retired by now.

235
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.250
Natalie Austin: That's true, yeah.

236
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.200
Natalie Austin: Hmm.

237
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.260
Jennifer C.: Because my husband, he'll be almost 40 years his teachers are retired. I know that.

238
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.250
Natalie Austin: Oh, wow.

239
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.500
Jennifer C.: But he wants to the same schools, too.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.880
Okay.

241
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.020
Jennifer C.: Which that's cool, though.

242
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.570
Jennifer C.: The principles are the same.

243
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:40.950
Natalie Austin: Oh, there you go.

244
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.600
Natalie Austin: That's a good job. It's. That's one of the probably want to keep on to it for years and years.

245
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.700
Jennifer C.: Yeah, they're the same. And then I think my teacher

246
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.160
Jennifer C.: That was my math teacher. He was the principal for a while and now he's like the superintendent.

247
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.330
Okay.

248
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.360
Jennifer C.: So it's pretty cool, though. Like, it works out for my kids because I was a good student.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:24:04.260
Roxanne Arnold: Um, yeah, I don't know, I might have to use CVS and climb road because i and i don't think my husband needs to get prescriptions from bright heart and Kroger would not fill them for him because the doctor in the same city. It wasn't a doctor in the same city.

316
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:10.680
Natalie Austin: I get at least fixed I fixed that my prescriptions. Now say Dayton, Ohio. We do have an office in Dayton.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.580
Roxanne Arnold: Well, they, they do you think they'll fill it here in Columbus,

320
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:28.200
Natalie Austin: They should still feel it. Yeah. But as long as, as long as it has an Ohio address that was the main problems that we have with CBS

321
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.050
Natalie Austin: Is because it said California on it.

322
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.870
Natalie Austin: Is your husband still getting treatment from bright heart.

323
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:47.010
Roxanne Arnold: I know he doesn't anymore. He wants to watch. But he that's a question I was going to ask you, because he's allergic to the locks on and they prescribed him sub effects.

324
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:56.610
Roxanne Arnold: Right, so he was wanting to get another doctor but he had he can't take the Suboxone. Can you guys prescribed the subby text for him.
