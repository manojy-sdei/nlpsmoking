20
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.240
Nadine Quintana: Let's see. Friday. Friday, I would just sleep like around almost five o'clock in the morning.

21
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice it has kind of changed.

22
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: In the sort of that sleep hygiene.

23
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not wanting to be doing maybe still sleeping in later like what do you think's changing and

24
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.690
Nadine Quintana: I wake up.

25
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.840
Nadine Quintana: Around the same time I all I always do. Even when I go to sleep early, that means

26
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.270
Nadine Quintana: I'm

27
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.530

28
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days. Have you been doing it like that. We're staying up till

29
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.150
Nadine Quintana: The day before yesterday so

30
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.430
Nadine Quintana: Like three days.

31
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And

32
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you noticing that your cognitive. That means you know your brain isn't a sharp and you're not able to to think kind as clearly as you'd like.

33
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.480
Nadine Quintana: I noticed

34
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.090
Nadine Quintana: When I go to like see something right. I forget what I'm seeing.

35
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.380
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

36
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that would be sharpness right from

37
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.770
London.

38
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When they're looking for a word is this. It's almost like they can't they can't find the word and you're saying, and start talking about something and you forget what you were talking about.

39
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah, yeah. So we really do need rest. That's one of the reasons why I asked people sometimes as I did this morning is the first thing I might ask.

40
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And noticing your body's also feeling in distress to there's something going on with that left left here this morning.

41
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So other any additional like dynamics that are going on. Maybe between your son or watching your son and daughter or mom and son or you had husband or any dynamics going on that might even be way in sort of the background and your mind.

42
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.280
Nadine Quintana: Whoa.

43
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.270
Nadine Quintana: My mom's been driving me a little crazy.

44
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's living with you are not living with you.

45
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.730
Nadine Quintana: Know, she doesn't

46
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what's been going on.

47
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.970
Nadine Quintana: Okay, she

48
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:57.180
Nadine Quintana: Okay, so I just got a new car. Okay. And before I got this car she she she like all of a sudden like one day was like, here's my vehicle use that. Like, I don't need it. No more so she gave me her vehicle.

49
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:09.450
Nadine Quintana: Because she's like, I don't go nowhere. So just have it because she retired from work and stuff. So she's like you need it for work and the kids or whatever. So I was like, Okay, cool.

50
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:21.330
Nadine Quintana: Well, one time I heard her talking tonight. And this was a while back. This was, I wish you first gave me the vehicle and she was had my out yeah I gave an ad in the truck, because

51
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.890
Nadine Quintana: You know, I don't really like to drive any place so she just takes me where I need to go. So I was like, all right, that's the reason, whatever.

52
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.730
You know,

53
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720
Nadine Quintana: And then, okay, so it was like

54
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:44.970
Nadine Quintana: It started when I was working out work, she would call me out. I need to go here, I need to go there and then it got to the point where I was overworking myself to

55
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:53.820
Nadine Quintana: Getting out of work and then going straight to do whatever she needed to do and then I need to do what I need to do and

56
00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.120
Nadine Quintana: Okay, so that been going on for a while. Okay, so I got my new car. And I was like, okay, you know, I told her.

57
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.560
Nadine Quintana: I'm going to clean your, your truck up I'm going to wash it for you and stuff. And I'll give it back to you. You know that way if you

58
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.650
Nadine Quintana: ever need to go someplace you have your own view whole

59
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.080
Nadine Quintana: She goes, and calls my tells my son.

60
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.320
Nadine Quintana: Go ahead and take the trick for work.

61
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.830
Nadine Quintana: So I'm stuck, taking her where she needs to go.

62
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.010
Nadine Quintana: And it's driving me crazy.

63
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, when, when did that.

64
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Get realized right what you just said.

65
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.050
Nadine Quintana: There may be like

66
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.750
Nadine Quintana: Two weeks ago.

67
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to reflect something back listen to something you said the last time we met.

68
00:06:49.980 --> 00:07:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I taught myself when I don't agree with someone like my mom sister kids. I don't attack them right away, less defensive. Mom, it's never going to change.

69
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: She has her when she has little remark I bite my tongue to let my until myself. Let her get it off her chest. If she said something about me. I defend myself in a way, I'm not arguing with her.

70
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: She has it in her mind that me and my sister are better off alone found out I was talking to my husband again. Why are you talking to him, you have been doing so good. That is the father of my child. I am not cutting him out of my life, whatever happens between us.

71
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: He used to treat me bad I have learned to forgive him. This is my business. And then we looks like self trust. I know what is good for me.

72
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how to communicate with him. Now, if something bothers me. I communicate right then and there, without yelling and cussing. I have learned to open up with him.

73
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And he noticed it. I tell him that when he asked for things. I couldn't do it did not have the resources it got to me. Got me mad and stressed out, he was sorry he was like that.

74
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that he is changing to we needed the two years. We were apart.

75
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's not the whole thing, but I'm gonna go down here a little bit. Um, I'm glad I gave him the two years. I'm proud of him.

76
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: They see the change in me. They tell me I'm proud of you. I think you're talking about your kids, you have a good head on your shoulders.

77
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure who's telling you that I have a good mom. Yeah, okay, you have a good head on your shoulders. I have a good life. I will be okay by myself. But having people around is a bonus, I see the way I was before questioned everything and cautious.

78
00:08:52.620 --> 00:09:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that last group thinking just do it when said just said it did not overthink before we questioned myself, Is this the right answer. Now it's better. No pressure. Say what comes up first. It is always the real answer.

79
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If no one likes what I say shoulder shrug.

80
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That is just how I feel. I want to apologize for what I feel I need to quit being scared and work on this.

81
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to make sure it stays like that.

82
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's this making you think about

83
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.800
Nadine Quintana: Or maybe think about like

84
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.020
Nadine Quintana: I just

85
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.460
Nadine Quintana: I just need to tell her.

86
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.160
Nadine Quintana: Like I'm getting stressed out, she's really stressing me out well.

87
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some. I agree. And we don't have to go anywhere. Beyond that today.

88
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's do some

89
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some role play with it so you can tease out words you like I can play out worst case scenarios we can get all the way through it so that you can know everything's going to be okay.

90
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: She's still gonna love you. She's not going to nothing. It's not going to be catastrophic. Okay, you're going to be okay. But I mean, what did you notice how you were thinking in that session.

91
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.310
Nadine Quintana: I was just thinking like

92
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.520
Nadine Quintana: Well what came to mind was

93
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.860
Nadine Quintana: Like she doesn't

94
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.410
Nadine Quintana: She doesn't like

95
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.950
Nadine Quintana: Listen to what I have to see. It's like what I have to say is like

96
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Nadine Quintana: She'll say or opinion about whatever chef to say

97
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.690
Nadine Quintana: And it's like, I just stay quiet.

98
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When she has a little remark I bite my tongue and tell myself letter, get it off your chest. What if needing she's doing the same thing to you.

99
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you guys aren't showing each other. And this is you've made progress needy. Why don't we move to the next level.

100
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: There's more to this communication. This than just shutting up and speaking, there's more to it and it's showing up right now. It's because of the stress situation with her.

101
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:47.670
Nadine Quintana: Um, I get scared, is what it is. And I could write a column, like I want to tell her. And I wonder, like, just tell her, like how it really is how I really, really feel and but then Michael part of me that tells me, like, oh, she's just gonna say what she always says, and like

102
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.610
Nadine Quintana: For instance, like if I tell her like

103
00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:02.550
Nadine Quintana: This is just an example. Like I told her, like, I don't have nothing on my record like I don't have anything on my driving record it's clean.

104
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:13.770
Nadine Quintana: It into the myth of, say, Oh, they're lying to you. They never tell you they never tell you the truth, you probably have you probably do have stuff on your record and I make or

105
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there, that's too perfect. We can pass it by

106
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: A slow time down. This is really, really good because you gave me content.

107
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

108
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're lying to you right there. Tell me the emotion you feel right there. They're lying to you.

109
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.980
Nadine Quintana: I get angry, I get really angry, but I

110
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait. Stay there. We got the emotion. This is really slowing time down. It's just, we're just gonna stay right there. Probably the whole time.

111
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because the way you've been doing it is everything gets skipped over this is so habituated and normal for you grew up with this.

112
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And

113
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're so let's just see if this is this is the spot. So here we go. We got you're angry. Now, how

114
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Readily available are all the things that maybe you've learned in group of you've heard in group or maybe we've played with some different ways of communicating when you're angry.

115
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have access to access to those phrases to those communication skills in your head, or do you really just want to shout out or

116
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.020
Nadine Quintana: Well, I do like a brief thing is, I'll just say

117
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.030
Nadine Quintana: Take a deep breath.

118
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.780
Nadine Quintana: And I notice I do that a lot when I'm around her.

119
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then that helps that's going to help you remember, then what to do, then what happens after that. So she does this and you're quiet and you're breathing.

120
00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But she has said a piece of content. It sits there and that's the kind of thing that you're giving me an example of something that happens probably fairly regularly.

121
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may represent that she's not listening to you and she didn't hear you. Another so we're going to stay right there.

122
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna just going to go over to maybe another option for your mother could have been. She's not in the room, but I'm just letting you know that you're not insane.

123
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, isn't that wonderful, my goodness, that's, that's really good. That means you know if you ever want to do this or this with your career, you ever do a background check. That's so awesome. That's really good. You know,

124
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another she could have responded like that.

125
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.260
Mm hmm.

126
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: With that I've made you angry.

127
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.330
Nadine Quintana: No.

128
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:49.860
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

129
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you want. We're just going to go there for a second and we're gonna go back to this little task, we're doing, what did you want to hear. So

130
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.990
Nadine Quintana: You know,

131
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:09.450
Nadine Quintana: Wonder say oh well you know that's good that you don't have anything on your record, you know,

132
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.390
Nadine Quintana: But suppose that

133
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, and that that role of

134
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing, the one that was your cheerleader, and your champion and a Christian was in your father's I recall

135
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all right. Don't

136
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.690
Nadine Quintana: Say that again.

137
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that encouraged you, was your father.

138
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

139
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go back.

140
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to the sequence of, well, they're just lying to you they don't really give you the real information and and you're angry and you breathe. What happens next.

141
00:15:52.980 --> 00:16:04.410
Nadine Quintana: I tell you what they'd like to says the MVP. They're not gonna lie to me if I have a messed up record. That's the last thing they're going to do.

142
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you you inquired into your mother's logic.

143
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Why would they lie to me.

144
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what were you hoping to get

145
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: From that

146
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:37.380
Nadine Quintana: I was hoping chief they quit agree with me, but to be honest with you, I think that she does it. Just get on my nerves. I really believe I really believe she says things just to get to

147
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: To get you angry.

148
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.420
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I am really excited to think that because she doing this too much to

149
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.720
Nadine Quintana: Like the point where, like, I'm really like on your verge of a nervous breakdown.

150
00:16:55.050 --> 00:17:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so we're really getting into it. So, this I think that's the sign. What we're picking up on on this sleep. That's, that's when you know something's up. Okay. So thank you, we're really getting to it. So, look how important this is. So let's just find out

151
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When you weigh out the impact the risk factors of a nervous breakdown. What's at stake, what could happen if you actually have one

152
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.740
Nadine Quintana: Everything.

153
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.500
Nadine Quintana: Everything that I have worked

154
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.100
For

155
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The specific that's fake. Tell me, what do you mean

156
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.940
Nadine Quintana: Like I

157
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:58.410
Nadine Quintana: Have a good job. I have a nice house. I have a nice vehicle right my family's finally like my, my family.

158
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.150
Nadine Quintana: Is finally doing

159
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.840
Nadine Quintana: Good. You know, we're getting the long word

160
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

161
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.310
Nadine Quintana: I got my family back together and

162
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So put those two things in a sentence together on your own. Okay, if this thing happens.

163
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This other outcome might happen if this happens, this might happen.

164
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right now, they're kind of separate and I know it's emotional. That means we're onto something.

165
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.280
Important for you.

166
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because you're Kevin slept honey that this this emotion stuff is the combination of having capture bit your tongue for so long.

167
00:18:50.790 --> 00:19:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And so much is at stake. All good things. Okay. But this, but there's you're going to feel empowered at the end of this. Okay, that's the destiny. It's not just going to be to have you feel

168
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Helpless or uncertain okay but but the intensity. That's the no sleep. We all get like that our emotions are right on the edge because we have to have rest. Okay.

169
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so this this this will pass this feeling will pass and you're going to get some sleep. It's going to be okay.

170
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the truth is your family is good. You do have a vehicle you have this job and you, you guys are fine. You're fine. This thing that the dynamic switch in your in your mom it been happening for years, but you're changing

171
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your willingness to

172
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sacrifice

173
00:19:46.650 --> 00:20:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Your soul, your integrity. The piece about you that that's what psychotherapy, does it makes folks kind of more and more honest with themselves and with people. It just keeps getting more and more real like HONEST. HONEST, back to back.

174
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And here we just found a relationship that's missing a piece of real genuine contact

175
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Scary really scary.

176
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get it, I get it. So, will will be real gentle and no way am I going to tell you go do this or go do that all we're going to do is just, we're just going to see what's there. You get to hear another person's perspective on it.

177
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Like some of the stuff we're doing. We could play with it again, but mostly an urgently.

178
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep and how you get to sleep is having made a decision. And so let's see if you can get a decision decisions aren't even just up in your head like this is how I'm going to be this is how I'm going to be, that's a decision.

179
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's come back.

180
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they're lying to you.

181
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you can register angry use that amazing skill of breath, which means you got back in your body, which means your brains thinking

182
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: All these cool things you have access to stuff and you were able to, you didn't pop off on her and you asked her for some logic, but do you realize that you're asking logic from someone you said why typically means let me hear your rationale

183
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But then, do you know the next thing you said was, I think she says these things to bug me to get under my skin to bother me. What did you say, oh, get it says it to get to me. I'm assuming enough to piss you off.

184
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So, so, look what look what you're you're doing. I mean this this is just an opinion, but it looks like you're looking for logic from someone that all they want to do is piss you off.

185
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't work.

186
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because look what the intention is behind it. So if he her intention is to what

187
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To piss you off. So if she can if she didn't want to show that to you she going to want to own it.

188
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. So what's happening is you're angry and you want her to understand and this is this is these are the levels that we're going to get to how you're feeling

189
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But her intentions are to have you feel that way.

190
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's and it doesn't make her wicked, evil, any of those words what it does, is there something this I don't know your guys's dynamic very well because you kind of pushing it with younger fine. We're getting along better

191
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now we're getting some nitty gritty stuff. And now we can get into it because I can try to understand the the ongoing pattern that might have been existing with your mom. It could be who knows is it

192
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Has she been doing this and she she elevates herself.

193
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: She needs you to need her. She needs you to feel small. So that she can take advantage of you to have your driver places. I mean, you do know that it's an endless possibility of scenarios. I have no idea. But the reason why we do it sometimes is because we want power.

194
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mom may not be aware that she's doing that.

195
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you're small and unsettled she wins and she has power.

196
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Not great intentions but I but remember what I say about people, I say, you know, we don't do things for nothing. We do it because we have learned to adapt in some way and then we're doing the best we can. So there's something about what she learned the way she's feeling

197
00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think she knows any other way to be that's my guess.

198
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: There. Do you know what I'm trying to say.

199
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you're coming at her with, why not so much. I don't think you're going to be able to get to what you want.

200
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If what you're saying because I believe you that her intentions are to

201
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If it were me

202
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I would feel minimized, as if like

203
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't exist. I would be like,

204
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Unimportant in that moment in that particular kind of conversation like what I'm experienced. I literally went from an excited and proud.

205
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Angry

206
00:24:50.490 --> 00:25:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And confused because you asked her why question right but you're not confused. You do know you've been living with this for a long time you know exactly what she's doing. She's trying to unsettle you

207
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Like confusing, but you don't like it, what you haven't learned is really accepting what your mom is. I mean, really, really accepting it.

208
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then you don't ask why I believe you.

209
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say, I think it's to get to me.

210
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of a mom that does that to her daughter.

211
00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.540
Nadine Quintana: To be honest with you, I, I really think

212
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.020
Nadine Quintana: She's going through her own sister.

213
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.960
Nadine Quintana: She

214
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.080
Nadine Quintana: She just tried today.

215
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:48.030
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, she she kind of made because just to make comments, you know, like

216
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:57.750
Nadine Quintana: Like, oh well you should do this. And, oh, you should do that or, oh, you shouldn't do this or you know she does stuff like that and

217
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:09.000
Nadine Quintana: And I think in some kind of like little way she kind of like once me and not only me but my sister, too, because she does the same thing to my sister.

218
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:19.080
Nadine Quintana: To like cab. The life she wanted because she'll start making comments like, Oh, I wish I didn't get married, I wish I had

219
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:34.470
Nadine Quintana: A lots of money. I wish I would have had a better life, and she'll start saying like, Oh, I wish I didn't have the kids that I had and like all of a sudden, she started saying like weird stuff, stuff like that. I think that's really how she feels and she's starting to

220
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:37.650
Nadine Quintana: Like that at all.

221
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well,

222
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.120
Nadine Quintana: It kind of sounds

223
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.770
Nadine Quintana: Like regret and she like, that's why. Maybe she treats.

224
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:58.890
Nadine Quintana: Like us the way that she does. And she says, the stuff that she wants is because maybe I think like a big part of her like regrets having us, you know,

225
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you do realize that isn't about your value.

226
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, but it's hard for us as children to still sit with that we can know it logically. I know that's her issues. You just told me that

227
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But at the same time, we can't. As humans, we can't leap over this is our parent, if they exist like at the same time. It's like, yeah, I get why you would do that. But how dare you, like, it's like not even. It's like a both

228
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay very adult thing to be able to sit with those with those two thoughts. So this is where you come in. Where this piece where you notice you're going to notice the anger, but that anger is protecting

229
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, a tender spot.

230
00:27:51.960 --> 00:28:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Because look, look how you were feeling before you were feeling excited. The you guys have it MVD ours. It's DMV. So I have to like write this word down. It's so different, different states.

231
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.460
Nadine Quintana: Yeah mbd

232
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This Department of Motor Vehicles over here.

233
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Um, so

234
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a moment right there that you're doing all these really great things look how insightful, you are, you wouldn't have had this stuff when we first met, you wouldn't have seen all that

235
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're, you're doing fantastic. So in a way, it's a compliment to how much you've grown because that means your mom is starting to ready to shift and change.

236
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And she and you can handle it. Right. Maybe there's this sort of once you change the whole system starts to like adjust when someone makes a change. And that might be, what, there's a new settling in your mom might be starting to leak, a little bit of her own.

237
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Choices in her own life. But those are her choices.

238
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So if she knew that you were bold enough brave enough proud enough confident enough to hear it directly.

239
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there would be some honest genuine conversation. So how do we do that, how do we do that when we see what is this sort of hostile thing which is oh well you know what they're just a bunch of liars and they don't tell you the truth anyway.

240
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it puts her in a position of victim right there. Like, I have no control and and will visit. So all this to say, notice that you asked, why would the DMV do that.

241
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you want to talk with your mom about this assumption you have and you and I do both you and your sister talk about like maybe Mom's going through a crisis.

242
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.100
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, we say she's crazy

243
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.420
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, okay.

244
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you're both probably on to it. And so what if we do this so we can say that to mom because. She'll. She'll get offended. So do what we can do is

245
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is we use the skill of empathy. It's literally you go, Wait a second. And you can do it through lots of different ones like choosing curiosity over being right. You are right.

246
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not going to get your connection so you turn that one on. You go, Pam hungry. I'm breathing. Why would she do that. Oh wait, she's trying to get under my skin. Why is she getting under my skin is getting under my skin because she's feeling helpless and regret.

247
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: He's got there. Now I did those steps just now, but I think over days at least. I know you get there. I don't know how long. Maybe I'll a few minutes, you might get there right away. The sooner you can get there. Guess what, now I'm sitting here with this woman, and all of a sudden, wait a minute.

248
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Disappointment regret I know those

249
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I can turn to my mom.

250
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what does that light to be to believe that the the MVD isn't like even telling you the truth, like there's a government organization. How does that make you feel

251
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa. That is not what she's expecting to hear

252
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you care about her underlying feelings. She's so used to meeting all y'all by getting a sense of importance, a sense of

253
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Power, as I mentioned, power comes from a lot of funny I angles I getting you upset.

254
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: She knows she's still got y'all like getting you unraveled and upset.

255
00:31:50.700 --> 00:32:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's the old recipe. If you do remember how you've noticed the system is changing when you do something different, your husband's changing your kids are noticing you have all these wonderful things happening, you're proud of all this work you've done

256
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You do this thing which there are multiple steps, right. But even though I break them down and they're taking minutes they can be in within 10 seconds or a microsecond in go like that, right, like

257
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Chicago's just being passive aggressive, you know, just being cray cray. Okay, well, what is really going on. She's afraid.

258
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: She's sad. I know I in ears were empathy goes right it's like I have felt sadness disappointment and regret, forget about it, man. I know my grad dang, I do. Let me turn to my mom because the other ways not working.

259
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Where right where you

260
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And it builds up and builds up because, look, look what's happening nervous breakdown and all these things are at stake.

261
00:32:52.620 --> 00:33:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you. Right. Are we really willing to let go a job vehicle family, husband, he sobriety. It's all right there, because that's what nervous breakdowns. Listen, can we don't want to break down.

262
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we say I will do anything to not break down and then we start a lot of people start using again so

263
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Or slower self medicating pretending this way and that way it just starts we stopped being honest and genuine

264
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we can't afford to break down. And so then that's the excuse to program. I can't break down. I can't break down. Well, wait. So here's a moment for you.

265
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say, Is it worth it for me to have all lose all these things all this pride, all these things that it's got this nice flow. It just works just fine. We show up. We work hard. We get money.

266
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We communicate with our children. We set of contingencies. They get things done. They show respect. It's working.

267
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But with mom. This is not a dynamic that you've addressed.

268
00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

269
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.350
Nadine Quintana: I am

270
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:12.810
Nadine Quintana: Like, I really like want to tell her. Sometimes a cow. I feel and tell her like cow.

271
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.720
Nadine Quintana: How she's getting me, you know, like I wish I could talk to her like that, but

272
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:29.100
Nadine Quintana: Like a part of me likes like a voice in my head is saying I

273
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:36.180
Nadine Quintana: Don't because she's just gonna cry and she's going to make you feel bad and she's going to try to

274
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:50.820
Nadine Quintana: Do all these things. So she's gonna be mad at me and then she's gonna she's been doing this little thing and then something new. She's never done this before, where she's going and she's like making up stories.

275
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.580
Nadine Quintana: Initial go and tell my sister, like, Oh, I did this chair and I do that. Sure, and

276
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.380
Nadine Quintana: It's a lie. It's like a real light and

277
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.830
Nadine Quintana: Then I have my sister telling me off and I that

278
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.880
Nadine Quintana: That really like

279
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.310
Nadine Quintana: That makes me want to just say, okay,

280
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.840
Nadine Quintana: I'm not even talked to her.

281
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. And this is really an I get that what you are, you are seeing is the effect of her her behavior and I get that. But the kind of things that I'm inviting right now are

282
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Like up there with like the really self examined person. This is like up there in like Buddha land. Okay, so when I'm talking about. It's not an easy thing to do.

283
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how I went to, we're going to investigate how long is feeling and notice where you went to which is you focus on your feelings.

284
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: For now I want to tell her how I feel. I'm going to tell you right now, needing she can't hear you.

285
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not because she doesn't love you. She can't

286
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you keep right if we don't have radical acceptance into that your mother can't hear your vulnerability how she's hurt you. She can't hear it right now, right now.

287
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So if. First, it means

288
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: getting her to feel safe getting her to be able to own her own feelings.

289
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Then maybe she'll be able to hear you but people that don't feel safe and she doesn't, she's having to lie in order to justify and built herself up. Now that's a problem. This is not someone I would recommend that you open all your guts and feelings to I wouldn't recommend it.

290
00:36:51.150 --> 00:37:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to manipulate you, right, like, just like you said cry dominant dominate would play the martyr, and the victim even more to get you to stop. She's going to put you in the position you know that triangle. I've shown you guys a position of the

291
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: persecutor she's gonna put you in that role, even though that's not what you're doing. You're just sharing. She's gonna say how could you tell me this, everything I've done, I've sacrificed.

292
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh boy.

293
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

294
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You could probably predict that pretty well you just did. You said she's going to start crying. And then what we can't keep telling someone how we feel when they're sitting there crying because they're making it about them.

295
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or her so you know it's going to happen. So why don't we start there.

296
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, this means swallowing your pride aging.

297
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It does, but who's the stronger woman, the one that can say I know my truth.

298
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is some crazy behavior.

299
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's doing it because she's probably really scared to

300
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:00.780
Nadine Quintana: We're

301
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: nasty things when we're scared.

302
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Or mean and vindictive and

303
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks like she's afraid she's going to lose. I don't know what this bit of why don't know what it is with you guys, something's really going on with your mom.

304
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Lying just to stir the pot.

305
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a problem. And then you and your sister, and it will, it does a lot of good things for her. It keeps all the attention off for her. You guys look like the problem, she can come in there and rescue. I mean, it does, it can do all kinds of great things for her.

306
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

307
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:41.880
Uh huh.

308
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's power in that wisdom and that knowing

309
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey sis look something's going on with mom. If you ever hear anything that just sounds kind of wacky do

310
00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Just check it out. There's something something going on with her. I love. He says, like I just wonder if she's just trying to get negative attention somehow just assume it's not true and just come talk to me because I'm not talking smack about you. I'm just doing my thing. Yeah.

311
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:18.300
Nadine Quintana: Well, at first I did try time my sister that and she didn't believe me.

312
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:25.170
Nadine Quintana: And then now. My mom is up there with her. So I have a good little break. But now my sisters by

313
00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:27.840
Nadine Quintana: Seeing what I'm going through

314
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well there you're gonna have an ally.

315
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK. So now we've done all of that work.

316
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to experience what it feels like.

317
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To do the skill of choose curiosity over being right. And of course, what's happening is empathy.

318
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're first going to get pissed because that is going to happen. You've been doing that for years to protect the

319
00:39:54.210 --> 00:40:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How could you you're hurting your own daughter like knock it off. You know, like that's going to happen and in good reason right to protect the underbelly the squishy hurt sad afraid self.

320
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you breathe.

321
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember Mom's going through crisis.

322
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: She's doing lots of manipulative things with the whole car thing. I mean, that's what just say it. I don't want to drive anymore drive me around shows me love me. You girls are shows me that you love me, she's nowhere near being ready to say that stuff.

323
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But it might still be true. And I'm sorry the burdens on you for being the smartest person in the family, but there it is.

324
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's like that. And it's a burden.

325
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.420
Nadine Quintana: Mm hmm.

326
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are still deserving of clear communication. So here we go. So right you got yes will be angry.

327
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Birds breeze. And you remember, wait a minute. I know what I know what I know, I know what I know. I know what's going on here. I'm not, I'm not crazy.

328
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I know my mom is gaslighting me

329
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm assuming. I've given you the whole spiel on that right you know all about what gaslighting is okay so

330
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I do curiosity.

331
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, so I'm going to make a recommendation, you're probably going to want to say why.

332
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing makes someone more defensive than a why question. So do your best to try not to. If it pops out anyway we'll go with that. And then we'll rewind it will do it another way, but let's just give it a shot.

333
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to

334
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and the whole your effort is going to be to investigate.

335
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like for you, mom to have that belief, get it.

336
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that feel kind of thinking that the

337
00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: MVD that has you know all your driving records. I'm sort of conspires like what's it like to believe, to not believe in such a large organization you but you got to actually want to know. That's the hard part. You got to find even if it's

338
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You just have to want to know and care about her and love her enough to bypass your pride, just because we're going to try and get me to feel safe.

339
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you're going to care about me for a second.

340
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so do you want to stick with this same story, or is there another one if you give me a line and it can be really spontaneous with it. What's something else that she said that was just like you got to be kidding me or soap best

341
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:51.990
Nadine Quintana: Oh my god, there's so many

342
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.450
Nadine Quintana: There was one where we

343
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:16.950
Nadine Quintana: She was like mad, and she called me up pissed off because she just told off my niece for getting a ticket in my car as she kind of made it her problem, like, oh, now I'm gonna have to stress about it and now I'm gonna have to

344
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.350
Nadine Quintana: Take care of it and

345
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well give me

346
00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a nice name. I won't get the story just

347
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Chill, you'll get a chance

348
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:26.940
Nadine Quintana: Maddie.

349
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Maddie, I mean,

350
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.380
Nadine Quintana: Let's be sorry. It was a nice Leslie

351
00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So Leslie and Leslie's how all

352
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: 15 Leslie 50 she was driving, she was driving the car.

353
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.940
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, she was driving, just to go up the street and I let her and she went around the block.

354
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:46.260
And

355
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.280
Nadine Quintana: Then she got sick or for running the steps.

356
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, not only that but she wasn't with anyone in the car, right.

357
00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: My daughter is your daughter 25 or how old is she,

358
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So she got in trouble because she didn't have a license either. She has a permit. But so there's more than just running stop sign.

359
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. OK. OK, I got it, I got it.

360
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

361
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I call you up and I say,

362
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have any does your mom call you something.

363
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

364
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see how you could let this happen. These are just girls and now I have to deal with this ticket. I gotta go to this MTG these people. I can't believe you're putting me through this. This is unacceptable. What kind of mom would do that.

365
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.300
Nadine Quintana: First of all,

366
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.940
Nadine Quintana: You don't have to worry about it because I'm the one that's taking care of it. It's my card.

367
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So catch yourself right there. You don't have to worry, I noticed that you went to content right you're defending yourself.

368
00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I right.

369
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. Okay. So that's where

370
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's harder than you think. Notice that you didn't go to curiosity, what did you just do you defended your position. So you are right.

371
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is why it's so hard to do this, everything in you is going to want to argue the content of what I'm saying, hold on to the desk.

372
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And be like, I am going to let my mom know that I understand or care about how she's

373
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.380
Nadine Quintana: Okay, I think I got it.

374
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no.

375
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.300
Nadine Quintana: No, no.

376
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, here we go. We're gonna do it again.

377
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I told you this is hard. This is this man, this ain't easy. Okay, here we go. Um,

378
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Needing Leslie driving with your daughter and running that stop sign. They're not old enough to be in there and it's in the car and now I have to deal with this. Why do I have to deal with this.

379
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:10.260
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

380
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:17.250
Nadine Quintana: Yes, you're right. I should uncover her right because she is under age and I should have been more responsible

381
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you did was you owned your grain of truth. You remember that that that technique you did that. Okay, which which is lovely. That is a good step, but does it investigate how I'm feeling. That was, that was really good.

382
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It probably will disarm her a little bit will calm down, she'll say, and then her next thing will be. Yeah.

383
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Built but

384
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so, yeah, great grain of truth. Now, how do you investigate how I'm feeling. Go for it.

385
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:56.670
Okay.

386
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.130
Nadine Quintana: Um,

387
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.870
Nadine Quintana: I know this puts stress on you.

388
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Okay.

389
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:12.930
Nadine Quintana: And they should income.

390
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What, no don't go there again. You already did that part.

391
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:15.840
Nadine Quintana: Oh, yeah.

392
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I know in fact we can play with that a little bit. A little bit softer is I imagine that this has put even more stress on you. I imagine that have no because you don't do you

393
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got to soften up that phrase a little bit because that's almost like projecting

394
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to play with words. A little and I've got these fancy ones which are I'm imagining

395
00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the meaning I'm I'm making out of this is maybe, maybe you're feeling even more stress because of this, and she is going to be like, well, no kidding of course it does. But we want the yes that's a yes. And then you just keep staying with the emotion and the distress, so

396
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep going around that. I know this. This is making me stress. What else, see if you can ask. See if you could try and get me to talk about how I'm feeling.

397
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.110
Nadine Quintana: Okay, I'm

398
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry hard

399
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, look at me. Watch it. Look at me, actually. Look at me.

400
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine

401
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's needed, did that and see if you can care.

402
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like you turn the switch and I care.

403
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're another human being in distress rational irrational. We're not deciding that that's in the zone of right, wrong.

404
00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I just assume you're right, and then you just move on. So because you're already on your green issue. So it's nothing to be defensive about now. Do you do not turn the care lever on, you're going to show your care about how I'm feeling.

405
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:27.270
Nadine Quintana: Hard

406
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine extra stress on you. Maybe start with that one.

407
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.010
Okay.

408
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.010
Nadine Quintana: Okay, I imagine, this has

409
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:41.760
Nadine Quintana: extra stress on you and I could just

410
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:47.100
Nadine Quintana: Imagine what you're going through right now and how you're feeling

411
00:49:50.220 --> 00:50:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Put went out there, see what you think it might be. You said stress, but you might be one more piece I am I'm imagining what you might be going through IS A LOT OF WHY AM I RIGHT, MOM. Something like that. What's the other emotion side stress.

412
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:14.400
Nadine Quintana: Angry

413
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Angry

414
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, one more time, all the way through. You've got some really cool phrases ready to do it again. It'll feel different. When that pressures on. Don't forget to breathe. Remember, I'm okay.

415
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need to be right. I'm already. I already know my part, I don't mean to defend it, but I'm going to show my mom I care. That's what is going to change this dynamic okay ready

416
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:40.440
Okay.

417
00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Needy seriously you let Leslie and your daughter drive that car. It's a brand new car, and I'm gonna have to deal with the MVD

418
00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.680
Nadine Quintana: Okay, yes.

419
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.680
Nadine Quintana: I was around by letting them drive the car that was irresponsible me

420
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:13.800
Nadine Quintana: And I should have not met them Jeremy car. I should have been more responsible and they should have Joel them to where they go.

421
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:16.440
Nadine Quintana: And

422
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.270
Nadine Quintana: I

423
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.890
Nadine Quintana: Imagine that you're feeling stressed and angry.

424
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask the question about, yeah.

425
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:29.820
Nadine Quintana: Is there.

426
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:32.250
Nadine Quintana: Is there.

427
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:35.340
Nadine Quintana: Anything as

428
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A MOM.

429
00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.110
Nadine Quintana: Is that how you're feeling

430
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, wasn't that weird just now. It never even occurred you to ask

431
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that how you feeling is it

432
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:48.780
Um,

433
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, looks on you like

434
00:51:53.400 --> 00:52:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But what a little because right we did the first. You did all the I already on the content that gets that offer mind you did that up front grain of truth. Done.

435
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you did the I imagine you're feeling kind of stressed and angry and maybe a little overwhelmed. Is that how you're feeling and the voice comes down and it's sweet. And it's this is the containment of someone's tender feeling

436
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is the thing you need this is the thing we all need

437
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To see past our snarky or nasty art scratchy, by the way we act out and see I'm lonely. I feel rejected I'm unimportant like we have all this tender stuff underneath all that anger.

438
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

439
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: One more time. Ready.

440
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a deep breath. I'm just, just going to say needing that was just ridiculous. I can't believe you did that. Okay.

441
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.200
Okay.

442
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.730
Nadine Quintana: Yes, you're right. I should have been merged responsible and I should not let them drive my vehicle.

443
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:05.670
Nadine Quintana: I should have brought up, and I should have to come to the star. That was really irresponsible of me.

444
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.120
Nadine Quintana: I'm sorry that you feel like that.

445
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:13.050
Nadine Quintana: I could just imagine that you're stressed out.

446
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.030
Nadine Quintana: And you're angry really

447
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard one asked me if

448
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're gonna have to write this down. Not kidding.

449
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:26.040
Yeah.

450
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Something if you're imagining something. What do you, what's the next thing you need to do.

451
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Check it out, see if it's true. Imagine you're feeling stressed and angry, Mom.

452
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what

453
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.240
Nadine Quintana: Just really

454
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is sad feeling mom.

455
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.510
Nadine Quintana: Okay, yeah.

456
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just how you're feeling okay

457
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.970
Nadine Quintana: Okay, here's how you're feeling

458
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Go a little sweeter, as if you were talking almost to a baby. Let me hear how it sounds feeling. Let me hear how that sounds on you.

459
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:09.720
OK.

460
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:20.700
Nadine Quintana: I can imagine that you're feeling angry and and stressed.

461
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:24.060
Nadine Quintana: And is that how you're feeling

462
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That feels weird.

463
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:38.520
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, what

464
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.450
Nadine Quintana: They were talking to my mom like that.

465
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But wouldn't that be nice if she talked to you like that.

466
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:49.440
Nadine Quintana: Oh, yeah.

467
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we need to do it first. You're the one in

468
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy. She doesn't know shit about it.

469
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

470
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't keep the argument going, I hope.

471
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:04.440
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

472
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice how it doesn't come naturally. When you if you ever decide to do it, you're going to want to have grain of truth. I tell my side.

473
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's going to be going to get angry. I'm going to breathe. I'm going to remember I'm okay on my grain of truth. I'm going to guess how she's feeling. And then I'm going to check it out. You're going to need to write that stuff down, look how hard it was I was here to coach, but I will

474
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going to be you and your notes for like

475
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm imagining, you know, you're kind of pissed and frustrated and maybe overwhelm them. Is that how you're feeling I do this all the time so I can do this like

476
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

477
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But this this is different.

478
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember I said, all we're going to do today, it literally took us the whole time. And all I did.

479
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Was talk about that one little phrase.

480
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.600
Nadine Quintana: Mm hmm.

481
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your family's does is they bite their tongue and we sister. You know, we got to deal with this crowd moms and saying why she doing

482
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do know more. You do know something's changing and she is having her on turmoil.

483
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're, you're not all in your drama. Now you can see your mommy can see she's going through something and she's scratching at you guys and making you heard over it.

484
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And because you're nearby and that's what family. Unfortunately, we end up hurting the people we love. And it's like, oh, well, you're the one getting professional help.

485
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is, this is how you want to be treated. This is that, like, and so we somebody's got to bring it in the family. It's not going to be her

486
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.000
Nadine Quintana: Very

487
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can do it with your kids to write you recognize all this stuff. Now I'm not bringing anything new, but to do it in the moment when everything in you is like

488
00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know how she feels. You know, I, you know, we already have assigned intention and the worst intention and instead of

489
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Opening our heart to the very person that's attacking us, it's just counterintuitive, but it can change the way our communication flows.

490
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she might end up saying, yeah.

491
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the next, we don't have time for the next step. And the next step. And the next step, but it's basically just mirror it

492
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that yeah and also overwhelmed. I that that makes sense. I'm I would I would feel the same way.

493
00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you do, you don't add more content. Well, you know what I've been a good mom and I bought by you know what you did. And what about all now you're lost, you're lost in content and it's an argument.

494
00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, but if you stick with just narrowing her feelings.

495
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She's got no play, she's going to get bored with that conversation and go find somebody else to start some drama.

496
00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are you thinking

497
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.640
Nadine Quintana: Well, I was thinking like I

498
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.160
Nadine Quintana: I know what

499
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:23.850
Nadine Quintana: I know the steps. You know what I mean, like, but for some reason, I was just getting like

500
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.430
Nadine Quintana: Like stuck. I guess you could say.

501
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's, that's because you're a human. You're not a robot, because we actually feel scared. We actually feel you feel it in your body. You can feel it in your head like there's so much at stake here.

502
00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So it might be easier on the phone.

503
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean with a little bit more distance and you do it a few times you've been able to just like you've been able to do it with your husband, a lot more assertiveness.

504
00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's this distance, but I gotta tell you, he gets out and you guys are still together, you're gonna be like

505
00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:06.270
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

506
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That'd be intense, you know, and so, so you do it sort of progressively and you get there. My next client just got here.

507
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's schedule another appointment.
