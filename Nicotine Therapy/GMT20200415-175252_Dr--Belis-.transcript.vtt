Jason: influenced me

42
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:57.390
Jason: I first encountered Viking when I was probably 13 I stole a few of my dad's

43
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.470
Jason: And I someone told me they make you feel good and they did. And I kept taking them and

44
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:20.760
Jason: It went up the ladder of prescribed opioids finding ways to get doctors prescribe them by him on the street, yada, yada. Okay, uh, it did progress to heroin for a little while.

45
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.780
Jason: Too bad. I don't have any crazy track marks or anything like that. I didn't get too bad into it.

46
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:40.200
Jason: I, I was yes. Okay. Um, I was a licensed pharmacy technician. So I was always clean. I always had my own clean

47
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:54.210
Jason: Okay. Um, what else is there. I was in methadone treatment. I tried the detox program that did not work well at all.

48
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.180
Jason: That maybe one day thing where you taper off.

49
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's what you did.

50
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.340
Jason: Yeah, I think it was 28 days. Yeah, and

51
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.090
Jason: They are Stewart 40 milligrams and then they slowly go down over those 28 days.

52
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

53
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.710
Jason: I wanted to die at the end I ended up just using more

54
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.790
Jason: Yeah.

55
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: It was box is usually not maintenance if they had you on maintenance, that's a different story, but detox usually doesn't work.

56
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.360
Jason: Well, I ended up going to the maintenance program helped me later.

57
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.990
Jason: Okay and I, it worked, it kept me off of everything else.

58
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.100
Jason: It just kept me zonked out all the time I was constantly. Hi.

59
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see.

60
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.570
Jason: So that's why I like the Suboxone I feel like I function. I don't feel impaired.

61
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.320
Jason: I don't feel sick. I feel normal. I feel

62
00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:08.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Me. Yeah. As you should. Okay. Yes, exactly. You should be feeling completely normal just not without cravings and no straw and so you're saying, yeah, the Methadone just felt too strong, like you felt. Hi. Yeah.

63
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.600
Jason: Well, they had me at 120 milligrams every morning.

64
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a pretty hefty dose. Yeah.

65
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:23.040
Jason: Yeah, and I also gained a bunch of weight. I ended up paying like 275 pounds at the end of the program.

66
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.590
Jason: I was there for a year.

67

Dr. Belis Aladag: One year you did that.

68
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.190
Jason: Okay, yeah, it was bad.

69
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: How did you did what happened that you figured out how to convert to Suboxone

70
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:53.460
Jason: Um, so I had tried Suboxone once before through pizer years ago and I took it too soon. Well, I still had opiates in my system and it made me violently ill and it scared me away from it.

71
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.670
Jason: Yeah, so I continued my usual drug use and live my life.

72
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:14.010

Dr. Belis Aladag: Hopefully she gets helped to

96
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:22.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so any other substances. Do you, do you still smoke pot or do you drink alcohol is there other things you're doing

97
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: A

98
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:40.290
Jason: No doctor saw want me to stop smoking weed, which was really difficult because I have an anxiety disorder which I don't know if you have that record and I was on a daily dose of clonazepam

99
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.190
Jason: And I stopped that when I went on Suboxone

100
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.010
Jason: Okay. Go marijuana really helped me once, I wasn't able to take the

101
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.080
Jason: End Zone.

102
00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:03.030
Jason: But doctor saw really wanting me to stop. So I did it for him right before I lost my insurance.

103
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:12.690
Jason: Once I lost my insurance. I have to admit I have been smoking a little bit. Again, just because I have been so stressed out and anxious

104
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see.

105
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.750
Jason: But yeah, I have no qualms stopping

106
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. I mean, I think. I mean, I would agree with Dr. Saul, that it's best for you to not be doing that because

107
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:37.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any mind altering substance, you know, we just worry, it's going to lead you down the wrong path. You're not going to have your defenses up and make good choices. You know, that kind of thing.

108
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, but

109
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:46.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know it's you know you work on that. I think, I think it's a goal to have

110
00:10:48.210 --> 00:11:06.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: In terms of anxiety. I'm actually really glad you're off the clonazepam because you know that's not a good long term solution long term drug people get tolerance and they get addicted to that and stuff like that so

111
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:13.950
Jason: No, I know all about the risks. I've been dealing with the anxiety and panic attacks since 2010

112
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.420
Jason: Okay, I'm I've heard all about it.

113
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.330
Jason: In pharmacy tech, so I know all about it too.

114
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, you

115
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.000
Jason: Know it goes yeah

116
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:30.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I'm just going to put down. Should I put down generalized anxiety disorder.

117
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.610
Jason: So I was officially diagnosed with GA D.

118
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.090
Jason: Panic disorder.

119
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.950
Jason: And

120
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.310
Jason: Oh, I forgot the other one.

121
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.260
Jason: Social anxiety. Yes. Okay, okay, okay.

122
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:59.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you feel pretty okay now in terms of panic and social anxiety and all that.

123
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.510
Jason: Not at all. I haven't left my bedroom since I've started the Suboxone just because I'm so anxious

124
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really

125
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah we since you started Suboxone in July.

126
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:21.150
Jason: Well yeah cuz I don't have my anxiety meds anymore. So I'm See now I'm about to cry because I'm having a bad day.

127
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't mean to

128
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.370
Jason: Is not your fault. It's my stupid brain.

129
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:38.910
Jason: It, it kind of sucks because Sophie's Choice G my anxiety or treat my pitching.

130
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:48.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what, I have an idea. We have a psychiatrist nurse practitioner in bright heart health.

131
00:12:49.830 --> 00:13:05.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Could do is hook you up with her. So you can have a visit with her and see about medications and you know maybe very low dose clonazepam short term. I don't know. It could be something she could talk to you about some other meds. What do you think

132
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.560
Jason: Um, yeah. Since I lost my Kaiser I lost my sight guy just too. So that'd be great.

133
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:25.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think you need that, you know, just to kind of toss ideas and like have somebody that can prescribe things for you and manage your help you manage your anxiety because this is pretty severe the way you're describing it.

134
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.320

143
00:13:47.520 --> 00:14:02.490

144
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:13.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Suboxone is a partial opioid we really try not to have you on Benz's at the same time for the risk, you know, the respiratory depression but

145
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:24.600

Jason: So I did apply for unemployment, it just came through, which is good.

179
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:36.810
Jason: Thank God I KNOW. AND THEN, APPARENTLY THE NEXT payment, the government is adding an additional $600 per week on top of what you already get

180
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.070
Jason: Which means

181
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.850

182
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:52.230
Jason: And they extended it from three months to six and a half. So I was like, I'm going to milk it as long as I can.

183
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: That I see. Okay. Well, I guess I don't blame you.

184
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, why not you know until you find something appropriate

185
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: You don't need to hurry. That's good. This is great news for you.

187
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:27.390

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:52.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: So in terms of your medications and how we do our refills and everything here, we like to do group visits, where it's like you and a bunch of other people, maybe four or five six other people who are also mainly I think

190
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Depending on the group, but like most of them are on Suboxone of some form

191

209
00:20:48.390 --> 00:21:01.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: 838 45 because there might be aligned sometimes to check in. So it's like a check in point you go in with them and you check in. They usually have you do a survey about the diction.

210
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:10.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: The survey I hear the first time around might be a little lengthy, but after that it gets smoother and less. Okay, so don't worry so much about it.

211
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:22.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: You do the survey and then they give you the room number the zoom ID changes each week because we create a new one. Right. So then once you check in, they give you the number and then you ready to join us at nine.

212
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:28.290
Jason: Okay. So, real quickly. How do I check in. I really knew the zoom

213
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:41.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you would go to this virtual clinic, which is the number, the zoo number is 408-486-4762

214
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.980

Dr. Belis Aladag: Yep, so

216
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:57.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's like your zoom. Number two, always to check in with us at bright heart that's the virtual clinic. That's like the front desk.

217
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:11.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: If you ever have any questions about anything you need to make appointments. You like what I'm going to ask you to do is once we hang up. Call that number and say, Look, I spoke to the doctor. She gave me my medication.

218
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:23.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm going to join the groups on Mondays, but she said I should make an appointment individual point with your psychiatry, just because I'm having anxiety and I want to talk about medication options.

219
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.080
Jason: Okay.

220
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, so, so you'll call them and do that. Okay.

221
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. And then the other piece is we you get assigned a therapist.

222
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.910
So,

223
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:50.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: You can also when you call you can say, I also want to do a one on one session with my assigned therapists and then they can assign it they can kind of connect you there too, because that might be something to work on.

224
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Somebody you can talk to regularly. You guys can decide if it's weekly every two weeks, whatever.

225
00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:58.740
Jason: Okay.

226
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.910

227
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:08.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: But if you want. Individual therapy as well, that might be something to think about.

228
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.800
Jason: Okay.

229
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.200

Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Cool. Any question. Any other questions.

232
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:33.450
Jason: Um, no, not really. It seems very similar to Kaiser, it's just virtual not in person, which is great. I save gas.

233
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:41.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: You say, Yes, right. It's cool. All right. That's good. So you're familiar with this concept, um,

234
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:47.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, and then in terms of your pharmacy. I see a CVS on blossom Hill Road.

235
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:54.270
Jason: Yeah that's right down the street that works for me as long as they take in here.

236
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay.

237
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:07.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we'll try it. If you go to the pharmacy and there's a problem. Call us call the virtual clinic right then while you're there and

238
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:21.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: We have a person who has authority to be a liaison and talk to the pharmacist about the prescription and getting approved so like that. Her name is Danielle. She you can access her through that virtual clinic to

239
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:22.860

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:26.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: So today's Wednesday, you're well you're okay on meds. Right. Do you, do we need to prescribe it. Do you want me to prescribe it now or do you want to wait until you're running low. What do you want to do with that.

245
00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:27.750
I'm

246
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.760
Jason: Either or. I still have probably, what, two and a half, three weeks left

247
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:39.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

248
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.260

251
00:25:50.430 --> 00:26:05.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think what I'll do is I'll put it in your med list and then we'll actually prescribe it in a couple weeks. So like this week, when you come on Monday we'll just chat, you'll get to know the group whatever get into the system. The following week

252

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.380
Jason: One thing I think

254
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.400
Jason: Is

255
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:18.060
Jason: It's a kind of an unusual medication, especially since I get the two milligram tablets.

256
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mm hmm.

257
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.530
Jason: Uh, are we show they're going to have it in stock.

258
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:29.250
Jason: Because I don't want to have to, like, like say with we wait. And then they're like, Oh, we have to order it.

259
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.740
Jason: Yeah, so why

260
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Should

261
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:42.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, why don't we do this. Wait until Monday. Come on Monday, and then I will order then

262
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:57.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. That way, you start the week with a week, you know, I'll say, Okay, here's I'll give you a week's prescription, you'll go to the pharmacy or you call them and you say, Okay, I have this thing and then they can order it if they don't have it.

263
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:01.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so yeah, you'll be you'll have like a week cushion of your own.

264
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Pace, they need to order, whatever.

265
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.540
Okay.

266
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.670
Jason: Good.

267
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll do it that way. Let me

268
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just add it to your men list instead

269
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll do it that way. And you're not on any other medication at this time.

270
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:35.610
Jason: I'm well through Kaiser, I was on imitrex and on danza drawn for nausea. Occasionally, but other than that, no nothing serious.

271
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:36.840
Okay.

272
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:45.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and the imitrex. Are you going to be okay I'm gonna you're gonna find a primary care doc or do you think you need more

273
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:56.610
Jason: Uh, I do plan to find a primary care, Doc. But like I said, I haven't even received my card yet. So if I could get some that would be cool.

274
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:08.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, maybe I'll try ordering that for you. Just so you have a little bit. I don't want you to get a bad situation as to what, how much do you use the 2550 or 100

275
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.530
Jason: Ah, I get the hundred

276
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.750
