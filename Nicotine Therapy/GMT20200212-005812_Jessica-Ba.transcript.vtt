Adrian Chavez: They put a warrant for me that way.

162
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:42.510
Adrian Chavez: But I had already went to court, six times and they hadn't even given me my charges. They were just wasting my time. I have to call it must be noted to Durango, that's pretty far it was six times for nothing.

163
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.100
Adrian Chavez: And one time I didn't go a problem for me.

164
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:58.080
Adrian Chavez: I don't know, I think, more or less, they already found me there. It found me guilty in town and little towns pretty too late and

165
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.870
Adrian Chavez: So everybody knows everybody there.

166
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.270
Adrian Chavez: So I'm pretty much already found guilty.

167
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.310
Adrian Chavez: I don't know. I don't know how much time I have already have a

168
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.030
Adrian Chavez: Prior, but in New Mexico for this.

169
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.930
Adrian Chavez: I don't know. I don't need to give me a habitual time

170
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.450
Adrian Chavez: If they do that.

171
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are you hoping to gain in this program.

172
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In this experience. It's a lot that you're dealing with.

173
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:48.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: E blast walking. The last time we did the bio psychosocial was thinking maybe residential will be good for you.

174
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To treatment, you know, your incarceration, anyone remember what what is this on.

175
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is this legal case in regards to what is this tried to do

176
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.380
Adrian Chavez: It. So, Rob. They got me for every to

177
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.690
Adrian Chavez: Which you should have just been like a shoplifting because

178
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.360
Adrian Chavez: I see shop if you need to not be charged me for an operating they overcharged me on it to

179
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:23.520
Adrian Chavez: School

180
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With this extensive criminal history of, like, once you're in

181
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A whole bunch of other things like

182
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.240
Adrian Chavez: Yeah.

183
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.650
Adrian Chavez: Because they arrested me on a

184
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:48.060
Adrian Chavez: Felony shoplifting. And then when I went to bond out my charge was robbery.

185
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.180
Adrian Chavez: On my bond and we'll

186
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You may find more evidence that why or

187
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.630
Adrian Chavez: No, I don't know if they looked at my history or a lot but

188
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:14.820
Adrian Chavez: And I've, like I said, I went to court, six times in didn't even read me the right the charges that I was getting charged for it, they kept saying just come back on this day.

189
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:16.470
Adrian Chavez: This day

190
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.720
Adrian Chavez: So far, drive three or four hours from us.

191
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.580
Adrian Chavez: To drink on

192
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your son, he's addicted to heroin as well.

193
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You both us together.

194
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.760
Adrian Chavez: Yes.

195
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are your thoughts on

196
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.370
Adrian Chavez: This pretty. I never thought I would

197
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:53.370
Adrian Chavez: Do that because I used to see other people doing in life, say I'd never do that. My son.

198
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.870
Adrian Chavez: When they asked me and

199
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.440
Adrian Chavez: He was sick. So I gave him some

200
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.670
Adrian Chavez: He was sick. He was like withdrawing from it.

201
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.970
Adrian Chavez: And so I gave him some

202
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.830
Adrian Chavez: And you don't do it together a lot but

203
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:26.100
Adrian Chavez: I'll give it to him and he'll go in the room or something. I'm doing the same shit. Same number one scenario again.

204
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm sure I'm sure you're aware of the impacts that both of you can eat them into the addiction together.

205
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the damage and the risk factors associated with that.

206
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But in in being sober.

207
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On the left, the all or nothing.

208
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That it be in or you're out. And so it takes a lot of commitment to

209
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Stay diligent and working that route.

210
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But when you're using with your son.

211
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:09.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It makes sense why you continue to relax because you use addiction as a way to bond with your son.

212
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:11.460
Adrian Chavez: Yeah.

213
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.040
Adrian Chavez: He's Farley for me now to I'm well you're using isn't SPR

214
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.570
Adrian Chavez: So,

215
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.520
And

216
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:27.990
Adrian Chavez: He's actually doing pretty good. Now he's with his He's with his with his son and his

217
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.880
Adrian Chavez: Sons mom.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.580
Adrian Chavez: So he's good now.

219
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.050
So looking here at the plane.

220
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:55.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And see if there's anything else you want to add you already know kind of the spiel here. We want you to be sober. He wants you to work on this divide and be committed. So that means community group.

223
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:28.320

261
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:28.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The addiction, that's, you know, present in your family relationships dresses with your girlfriend.

262
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:37.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then some relationships are good. You said you don't really have a lot of support, you go, but, um, it seems as though batch change.

263
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.080
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, it seems that she's actually been

264
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.300
Adrian Chavez: We've been helping each other.

265
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.660
