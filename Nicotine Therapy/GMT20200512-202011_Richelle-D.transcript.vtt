00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.550
Richelle Direny: Hi, Angela.

2
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.190
Angela Fields: Hi, Rochelle to Jamie tell you what happened.

3
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.000
Richelle Direny: Yes, and I just said, so that's on them because I

4
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:47.610
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they said, You've been in the weight room so I told her, I said, Well, okay, but I didn't get an alert from you guys saying that she's on her way. And so they just said, I'm sorry. They've been really busy so they couldn't send the alert, because I know

5
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.140
Richelle Direny: For the individual sessions. Sometimes people come straight to me. And then they they tell me you know people are not checking in through virtual clinic first

6
00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.850
Angela Fields: Hmm.

7
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.090
Richelle Direny: Okay. So, yes, yes.

8
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.950
Richelle Direny: Cuz I'm watching the time and I'm like,

9
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.940
I know

10
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.730
Richelle Direny: I know she confirmed with me. So what's going on now.

11
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.890
Angela Fields: It was he will have a nice time

12
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.200
Richelle Direny: Yes. No, I, I'm fine, because I'm sitting here waiting. I'm there watching the time I'm like this is this is weird. Okay, so

13
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, so let me bring into how is everything going

14
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.190
Angela Fields: It's going good.

15
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.120
Angela Fields: Feels good for public to be open back up again.

16
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.000
Richelle Direny: Oh, where you are. They're opening up

17
00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:06.540
Angela Fields: Yes, yes, actually places are open past eight o'clock at night. Now, and most of the stores are open. Now, most of the restaurants are open to their normal hours dining in still at 50% capacity. If the restaurants choosing to allow people inside

18
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:18.990
Richelle Direny: Oh, okay. I know here they're doing the restaurants. Well, I would say that the restaurants has been open, but they're doing. Um, what did they call curbside pickup.

19
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.690
Angela Fields: We did that all through it.

20
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:34.710
Richelle Direny: Yeah they do curbside pickup, which is a little weird if you asked me, but I'm like you're, I don't know, like, some places are not allowed to open where others are depending on what

21
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.500
Richelle Direny: And my thing is with the restaurants like with with the whole quarantine thing. Are there certain things I questioned certain things is

22
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:56.250
Richelle Direny: Completely makes sense. Like you have your restaurants. I don't know if you're a bad they're doing cemetery stuff cooking with food and giving it to me. I don't know what you're really bad there don't

23
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.560
Angela Fields: Like the whole Walmart thing closing at 830 are they really doing that much cleaning at night.

24
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.630
Angela Fields: No.

25
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.980
Angela Fields: But they say that's why they're closing 830 so they can sanitize I don't believe it.

26
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.670
Richelle Direny: I don't believe that for Walmart. I know for sure is not sanitizing that please. Because when you go in there is still looking like a hot mess like the way you left it the day before.

27
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.450
Richelle Direny: And I'm gonna don't know Walmart is just like they're up on a whole nother level of everything.

28
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:37.710
Richelle Direny: But, um, and then like they like I know here they open up like one side of the store and they have like a line and they let so many people through but as big as I don't know if where you are. They have super Walmart's

29
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.020
Richelle Direny: The Walmart or huge

30
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.390
Richelle Direny: How are you controlling the amount of people in there. And how do you know people in there.

31
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.720
Richelle Direny: Or not, they have liked.

32
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.310
Angela Fields: To pay attention to you.

33
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.640
Richelle Direny: They don't pay attention to you and they're like, well, you have to have on a mass, but when you're in there. You see, the thing off and nobody is stopping you.

34
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:07.800
Richelle Direny: Then they have two sides of the Walmart one, they have a line and one doesn't have a line. What do you think I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go to the one that like over the weekend was a little drizzle it was drizzling outside

35
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.020
Richelle Direny: standing in line in the rain. So I just went to the other side. I went in got what I needed to do and came right back out and

36
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:30.810
Richelle Direny: And, you know, there's just so much the question there really is so much question, but you know, I guess you got to pick sense out of nonsense and you got to make it. Um, I guess. Figure it out. When it's all said and done,

37
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.700
Richelle Direny: Hold on. Yeah. So, you know, you just have to figure it out. When it's all said and done, but overall, you've been working from home. Right.

38
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.510
Angela Fields: Yes.

39
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.940
Richelle Direny: And how has that been for you or are they talking about returning back to work.

40
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.310
Angela Fields: I mean, we are working

41
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.870
Angela Fields: I never

42
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.140
Richelle Direny: I never sign up

43
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.310
Richelle Direny: But I'm saying, Where are you in a building and then they transition

44
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.230
Angela Fields: I've always been a home.

45
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.160
Richelle Direny: Oh ok ok ok so this is not really doesn't affect you either way.

46
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:21.060
Richelle Direny: Now, okay, okay. So, um, but even so, because now, even with even though you're working from home, you were able to go out and about afterward. What you got was limited. So how's that been for you.

47
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.790
Angela Fields: That was the part that I get with bother. Someone has been being at home all the time. You know, I always wanted to go somewhere in the evenings.

48
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:40.770
Angela Fields: And 830 with the latest anything with open here and by time. I was ready to be able to go somewhere, whatever it might be, even just through the grocery store ice cream or something like that. I wasn't able to do it.

49
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.150
Richelle Direny: Um, and that is true. That is true. And depending on

50
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.220
Richelle Direny: What your home doing, you have to kind of do a mad dash to the store.

51
00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:01.470
Richelle Direny: Or do it during the day, sometimes like I know here they've had like a lot of like the farmers and stuff like that. They're not really at work. And so a lot of the crops.

52
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:14.250
Richelle Direny: They're having together to pretty much give away a lot of the crops which I, you know, it's the nice thing because produce is very expensive. So when you're getting like a whole box of mixed vegetables.

53
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.060
Richelle Direny: Us an assortment of vegetables for only $10 like literally only $10 with all of the when

54
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.590
Angela Fields: They're doing that there

55
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah

56
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.790
Angela Fields: Nothing like that's going on here. Nothing.

57
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.290
Richelle Direny: You're in Ohio. Right.

58
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.760
Angela Fields: Now I can see

59
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:39.090
Richelle Direny: Okay. I mean, I don't know how it is in Tennessee, but like here and for they even had it on the news like you know you have a lot of farmland here and I'm in Florida.

60
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:52.380
Richelle Direny: So they like. They show on the news. Like, like, like if whether they're growing like whether it's eggplant zucchini like whatever it is and you see them like they get everything and gathering it up.

61
00:06:52.710 --> 00:07:02.040
Richelle Direny: And it's just making it just go bad, and go back in the earth and whatever it is but you know whatever they are literally just giving it away. At this point, like there.

62
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:03.030
Angela Fields: Are you

63
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.750
Richelle Direny: I'm in South Florida. Hold on. It's really dark here. Hold on one second.

64
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.470
Richelle Direny: I'm in South Florida.

65
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.100
Richelle Direny: Okay.

66
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.840
Richelle Direny: So I'm in South Florida. I'm like in West Palm in the county that I mean it's called Power each county

67
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:46.590
Richelle Direny: But like either a lot of Florida. They're in their different sites that you go to that it's um what they give like the different arrangements in terms of the vegetables.

68
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.650
Richelle Direny: It's different. So, like, the other day I went and I look I buy a fruit. It's both fruit and vegetables.

69
00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:07.440
Richelle Direny: Like you can get watermelon. It's funny because at the time. I'm like, I'm not buying any watermelon. It's not necessary to order metal and for 10 bucks. And I could have beat up myself because like I left there and went to Walmart and what Walmart.

70
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:20.340
Richelle Direny: It was I went to be jays and BJ had one for $7 watermelon that I went to Walmart and they had one for LA. You know, I really should have just bought the watermelon to for $10 but

71
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:31.230
Richelle Direny: But they have like watermelon cantaloupe pineapples pineapple, like all the different assortments, but like everything $10. It doesn't matter what you buy $10

72
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:39.720
Richelle Direny: And corn, you can get you could get if like you just want corn alone. You want a whole box of corn $10 and and that, yeah.

73
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.770
Richelle Direny: They're just they're just giving it away. They said that they're just giving it away because

74
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.750
Richelle Direny: Like what are they going to do with it. It's just going to go bad, they don't have workers out there to do whatever so they

75
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.220
Richelle Direny: They're just like literally giving it away. I remember one time I went out and I'm like,

76
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.100
Richelle Direny: What are they doing, is that like a testing site like are they testing people, what are they giving away the line is so long.

77
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.650
Richelle Direny: And they had cops like Manning because of the traffic. So I pulled up to one cop. And I'm like,

78
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:17.160
Richelle Direny: What's going on here. And they said they're giving away baskets and that's what it was. They, they were just pretty much as giving it away. So that was kind of the nice thing. But until you, Angela. They need to start opening up something

79
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.550
Angela Fields: I mean,

80
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:37.530
Angela Fields: The county. I live in. I think they said 85% of the business here were considered essential so not very many things close here hair salons, things like that were closed, of course, but everything was open to some degree.

81
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.710
Angela Fields: Back. It was just scaled back

82
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.850
Angela Fields: A

83
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.150
Richelle Direny: Different man would have said the barber was the barbershop was essentially

84
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.010
Angela Fields: You would think for a lot of people, it needs to be, but

85
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.860
Angela Fields: They opened back up this week for that.

86
00:09:53.910 --> 00:10:04.140
Richelle Direny: Oh wow yeah I they're slowly opening back up. And I think, and it makes me wonder, because you have a lot of people are now here like I was looking at something here. A lot of people are not protesting.

87
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.580
Richelle Direny: Because you know they need to get back out and the people who I think are more protesting are the ones that which

88
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.980
Richelle Direny: I understand. And I think we were talking about the same group on Wednesday. It's like, I understand one side of it.

89
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:24.180
Richelle Direny: And I understand the other. I understand the one side of it that says that they're not working.

90
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.240
Richelle Direny: They've lost their job, like I was just talking to someone who said that he had lost his job since February, like he works in a restaurant.

91
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.470
Richelle Direny: So he's lost his job since February and, you know, it's very hard to get a job. Now, you know, at the end of the day.

92
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.490
Richelle Direny: You know, you got to pay your bills and even though they will be forgiven right now, but they're not going to say, don't worry about it. You don't have to give it back to me they're going to

93
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:53.520
Richelle Direny: Wait, so you know, and also all it does is just pile up everything that you will. Oh, and so, you know, it's kind of one of those things where

94
00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.240
Richelle Direny: You're really looking at it like I understand where they're coming from. They, they need to work. They need to get back out there and they need to

95
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.650
Richelle Direny: feed their families, you know, unemployment, a lot of people haven't gotten unemployment.

96
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:16.140
Richelle Direny: Or maybe not qualify for unemployment, a lot of people didn't get the stimulus check if they didn't get it yet. Or maybe they don't qualify to get that stimulus check for whatever the criteria is they fall under so those

97
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.310
Angela Fields: We do qualify. So, yeah.

98
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:32.310
Richelle Direny: So, so can you imagine who you who are still working qualified but haven't gotten it. So you're among that percentage who so you know you get it like I get where those people are coming from.

99
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:42.990
Richelle Direny: And then I get where these people are coming from, where, you know, and so the other thing is, like, what's the media. It's a little tainted in my opinion. My personal appearance of it is really, it's been

100
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.440
Angela Fields: I think very much so.

101
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:53.820
Richelle Direny: It's very thing to Oh don't worry don't fear, it's getting better. Oh yes, the numbers are much higher than the CDC is

102
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.740
Richelle Direny: Seriously.

103
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:08.670
Angela Fields: Here's my question. All right. They're saying that you know X amount of people are dying of the coronavirus my argument is, are they actually dying to the corona virus or the underlying health condition that complicated issue to begin with.

104
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.190
Richelle Direny: YOU KNOW, ANGELA You don't really need to know that it's

105
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.880
Pretty much.

106
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.980
Angela Fields: Know that

107
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:26.220
Richelle Direny: That's the simple question or, you know, you hear so much. There's so many different conspiracy theories. I mean granted me personally, you know, you can't really trust what the government tells you root camp but um

108
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.810
Angela Fields: What they want to know.

109
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.070
Richelle Direny: They tell you what they want you to know. And if someone starts to tell you something.

110
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.180
Richelle Direny: So, you know, but but again there. There are people who have legitimate fears.

111
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:49.770
Richelle Direny: There have legitimate concerns because you know when it first came out, it's a lot of, you know, for older people or people have underlying medical conditions or whatever. So they they're a little bit nervous. Oh, by the way, you notice. Nobody died of the flu. This year, at least not

112
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.540
Angela Fields: Right, right, right.

113
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.290
Richelle Direny: No, I did not have the flu this there but

114
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.810
Angela Fields: You don't hear any complications of it right

115
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.090
Richelle Direny: Everything is Corona, if you had the flu or it's not that serious. You'll be all right.

116
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.080
Richelle Direny: But, you know,

117
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.250
Angela Fields: Now I know you guys can just air, you got it for routing congestive heart failure.

118
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:17.760
Richelle Direny: No, no, we're talking about. So you know this. So you like I get this side. How do we come in the middle. And what was beautiful. Last weekend, one of my groups.

119
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:26.940
Richelle Direny: What was beautiful. It was that like someone had lost it. They just gotten the job she lost her job and another person was just saying, hey, you know what, my job is hiring.

120
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:35.040
Richelle Direny: You know, just let me apply, let me know and then I'll put in a work. Now granted, though they said they knew each other.

121
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:42.720
Richelle Direny: It's, it's, to me it wasn't it didn't speak about whether or not you knew the person or not, it's about people helping people in this hard time

122
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.750
Richelle Direny: It's about how do we come to the center. How do we find a way to help each other.

123
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:59.160
Richelle Direny: You know, like there are some groups where someone will put out there. Oh, you know, Instacart is hiring or Amazon is hiring or this is this is what you have to do. This is the process I took

124
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:07.500
Richelle Direny: And some people jumped on it and are now working. How do you find that common ground granted if you choose to go back. How'd it work.

125
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:14.190
Richelle Direny: Standard precaution, like do what it needs to do to protect yourself and other people around you because at the end of the day.

126
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:24.030
Richelle Direny: Green is what were the common factor that we're both talking about, we need the greens. So how do we come together and still you're able to come

127
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:39.420
Richelle Direny: Up where I'm not, you know, getting sick, you're not getting sick or you're not supporting it, whatever the situation is and I think like, that's kind of where we need to come in the middle. Um, and let's see what happens. But, um, I think it's nice that they're opening up

128
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.470
Richelle Direny: I know summer is coming along and I do not want to be in this House, the whole star.

129
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.840
Richelle Direny: Being on a quarantine because it's not going to be nice. It's not

130
00:14:53.040 --> 00:15:04.980
Richelle Direny: It's not gonna be nice, but, um, but, you know, I wanted to talk to you today about just kind of looking at your goals and everything that you know because it's been a while since we've worked together.

131
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.200
Richelle Direny: And I know for all the times that we were supposed to meet. I KNOW YOUR HUSBAND WAS SUPPOSED TO JOIN US.

132
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.480
Richelle Direny: So I'm guessing he's not going to join. Maybe we could do another session where he will be a part of it.

133
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.960
Angela Fields: I would love to yesterday, just was not in the cards for him.

134
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.220
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's, that's fine. We can just schedule the time that it would be

135
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.510
Richelle Direny: Suitable for him to join. But how is everything going with you guys with just everything that's going on.

136
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.760
Angela Fields: Actually is going great.

137
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:34.500
Angela Fields: It's

138
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:41.130
Angela Fields: A great week. We are doing very well, very well and very well individually as well.

139
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:50.760
Richelle Direny: That's good. And do you think I'm in luck because and this is the other thing, like I joke around. Sometimes I call her Miss Corona, I hear people call her Rona, so I said, hey,

140
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.550
Richelle Direny: You said you know

141
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.340
Richelle Direny: Corona has brought around

142
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:04.590
Richelle Direny: Some Bad, bad things for some people and a lot of good for others. So kind of one way. The good and the bad, like I'm hearing a lot of good

143
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:13.920
Richelle Direny: Do you think like in light of all of this going on. You both having to really depend on each other. And because you're in the house together all the time.

144
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.910
Angela Fields: We always been in the house together all the time.

145
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.290
Richelle Direny: Um,

146
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.880
Richelle Direny: But then he you know he made for a while.

147
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.030
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry, but remember, he went away for a while.

148
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:31.770
Angela Fields: Went away for a while, and I don't think you know what happened while he was gone. And we had a crisis here at the house we

149
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:47.460
Angela Fields: It was, it was pretty bad. I had a friend of mine, stay with me while he was gone, because I didn't want to be in a house by myself because I hadn't been here about myself. My dad passed and someone who I knew and trusted for years and years ended up robbing us

150
00:16:48.510 --> 00:17:00.900
Angela Fields: And it was me. It wasn't just a little bit. It was very significant and it affected him worse than it did me as far as possessions. I got gone and he came home from being gone for a month.

151
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.840
Angela Fields: To that and it was it was hard.

152
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.090
Richelle Direny: And this is a friend that you were you allowed to stay stay with you.

153
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.640
Richelle Direny: Yes, and was his friend.

154
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.730
Angela Fields: Yes, most of our yes friends with both of us.

155
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.840
Richelle Direny: Um, so you will you were not in the house when this happened.

156
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.550
Angela Fields: I was in the house.

157
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:31.860
Angela Fields: Downstairs downstairs level is not if the garage and basement combined. It's a workshop and she smoked and she would go downstairs to smoke is no smoking in the house.

158
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:47.370
Angela Fields: While she was down there. I mean, they're all my dad's tools were talking, it was over $2,000 and tools and about $400 cash, plus all kinds of miscellaneous items and after he didn't back. We have about a week.

159
00:17:48.690 --> 00:18:01.260
Angela Fields: He discovered he just come right away, things were gone. And he, I couldn't explain where he was because I didn't even know what was dealing begin with where you put things when we got here and cleaned up from where my dad. My dad was a hoarder.

160
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:10.680
Angela Fields: So I didn't know half the things in it, worried, put them to even know what was missing. To begin with, so there was no way for me to know while he was gone, that something was gone.

161
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:19.740
Angela Fields: But my spidey senses were up something wasn't right, and about week after he gotten back she went to stay with her son for a couple of days and

162
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:29.100
Angela Fields: While she was empty the trash and she was staying and I found a piece of paper where she had written something and indicated. Basically what she had done.

163
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.610
Angela Fields: And it caused me to search her possessions, and I found all kinds of keys to the toolbox is key. So the cabinets downstairs. Everything has been locked to begin with and

164
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:56.100
Angela Fields: She had no reason whatsoever. We have the keys in her personal possession and little things like my mom's handkerchief with her embroidered initials on it in her panties in her suitcase. It's odd thing. Yeah, I was just odd things and

165
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.600
Angela Fields: Was looking

166
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:04.710
Richelle Direny: In active addiction. Do you think like that was part of stealing the stuff to be able to continue to feed the addiction.

167
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.560
Angela Fields: And she was, she I thought she was clean. When she got here. She wasn't

168
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.310
Angela Fields: A cause a problem for me as a matter of fact and doctrine. And I've talked about that but

169
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:32.820
Angela Fields: I don't think she remembers doing it, to be honest with you. Um, yeah, she was what she did. And I think I don't know if you've heard people talk, they get on Xanax and O's do all kinds of crazy things and don't remember it.

170
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.460
Angela Fields: Sticky Fingers Xanax people have sticky fingers.

171
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.590
Richelle Direny: And so what ended up happening right now. Was she gone by the time he had return and that's when it was all

172
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.850
Angela Fields: Still here.

173
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.260
Angela Fields: She's still here, the viruses just pretty much heated up and

174
00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:06.390
Angela Fields: We said, well, she could say through the virus, because it was kind of a matter of we didn't know the travel restrictions were starting and she like two counties way in which we can stay through the virus. We didn't know how long was going to

175
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:15.750
Angela Fields: continue as long as it did. But after I found that she, you know, selling those things we didn't let her come back into the house after future funds that we can

176
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:22.170
Richelle Direny: Um, and so, um, so you don't have any connection to a contact with her anymore.

177
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.190
Angela Fields: No, no.

178
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:31.320
Richelle Direny: So, like, how did it overall impacts your husband like because you said like he comes back. And all of this is going on.

179
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.990
Richelle Direny: Like it was it was

180
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.520
Angela Fields: Really hard on it. If I mean we were fighting left and right because he

181
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.480
Angela Fields: He was thinking I taken the item to put him somewhere, you know, cleaned up after him and

182
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:54.510
Angela Fields: Here, I'm saying no, I really don't know. I don't know. I don't know where it is. I don't know where I didn't know yet. It was stolen. And he thought had

183
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.600
Angela Fields: Just respected his privacy in this space.

184
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.970
Richelle Direny: Wow, and

185
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.490
Angela Fields: You want to argue for about a week.

186
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.270
Angela Fields: About all this

187
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.910
Richelle Direny: You said he will give you

188
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:07.050
Angela Fields: Huh.

189
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.300
Richelle Direny: You said he was arguing with you about a week.

190
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.090
Angela Fields: Yeah, we were arguing for about a week he was

191
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:19.500
Angela Fields: He was convinced I had done something with his things and rearranged the basement to my liking to where he can find anything.

192
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.050
Richelle Direny: And so at what point did he discovered like this. I really don't have anything to do with this.

193
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.280
Angela Fields: When I found the things in her in her possessions in that bedroom.

194
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.440
Angela Fields: That she shouldn't have had

195
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.390
Richelle Direny: Um,

196
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.840
Angela Fields: And so I found a note that basically implicated or guilt.

197
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.990
Richelle Direny: Though, so she wrote a note in the process.

198
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.770
Angela Fields: No to somebody like a journal entry and thrown in the trash.

199
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.970
Angela Fields: In London next week. That's what

200
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:54.900
Angela Fields: That was a tip of the iceberg right there. Had I not known that the dress. I would have never searched for things

201
00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.610
Richelle Direny: What was it for him like having to once you made it. You made him aware of what was going on.

202
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.860
Angela Fields: His anger shifted and

203
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.850
Angela Fields: The wall. He had built between me him.

204
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.400
Angela Fields: Completely came down

205
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.500
Richelle Direny: And so he but then he came back and like apologize for not

206
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.190
Yeah.

207
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.930
Richelle Direny: And and and so that speaks a lot to the communication.

208
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.670
Richelle Direny: That speaks a lot to the mode of communication or your

209
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.260
Angela Fields: Truck. Truck

210
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.730
Richelle Direny: Yes, definitely.

211
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:47.070
Richelle Direny: Shows how much trust because prior to that. Did you ever feel like there was not a whole lot of trust, or he felt that

212
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.170
Angela Fields: It goes a lot further with him, it's impacted him and his dad.

213
00:22:54.570 --> 00:23:04.320
Angela Fields: I know where the root of it is, and I've, I've learned that he can be very brash towards me and it's the I understand where it's actually coming from

214
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.320
Angela Fields: That makes any sense.

215
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:18.900
Richelle Direny: And then it's good to understand it, it's good to understand the root of his the way he comes across on whether it's limited communication, whether it's the lack of trust of your for anyone.

216
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.660
Richelle Direny: Just his irrational thinking not being willing to do a little research, whatever it is.

217
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.280
Angela Fields: Because I'm making a play.

218
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.150
Angela Fields: But it doesn't make

219
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.270
Richelle Direny: It doesn't make it okay and so

220
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:41.520
Richelle Direny: While your understanding of it which means that you're a little bit more tolerant to some degree of the outreach.

221
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:55.020
Richelle Direny: It still hurts. But then it's coming into that communication and just saying, hey, listen, I understand that you're hurt and you felt like your privacy was violated and in this case, both your privacy's were finally it because

222
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.230
Richelle Direny: It was not just you alone. It is that

223
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.620
Richelle Direny: We both trusted this individual to we

224
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.530
Richelle Direny: opened our doors we both trusted this individual.

225
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:22.890
Richelle Direny: And we both are privacy's were violated our trust was taking advantage of. And so in that moment that Self centeredness which is pretty much what it became like him just thinking about himself, not the time to see how it has affected you

226
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:31.950
Richelle Direny: Because you're away. Come to find out all of this was going on. I was here the whole time.

227
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.550
Richelle Direny: I was here the whole time. And all of this was going on underneath me and no idea

228
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:50.430
Richelle Direny: Right expects to that level of trust you gave this person that was violated because in that moment, a whole lot more could have happened to you.

229
00:24:51.300 --> 00:25:11.340
Richelle Direny: Grind it didn't. But, and so you know it's having that mode of communication. Like I it's like I understand where you're coming from. I understand where the root of it all is. But why, like understand, let's have this conversation because the way you treated me for a whole week.

230
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:21.030
Richelle Direny: You know, it bothers me and and so and that's where that effective communication comes in is saying is bothering me like we have to be able to work on.

231
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.450
Richelle Direny: You know, our level of trust for each other.

232
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:32.640
Angela Fields: And I can say this in times past where there had been something that happened and

233
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:43.980
Angela Fields: Taken out on me for lack of better words and it's nothing of this magnitude. But I can say he handled himself.

234
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:56.820
Angela Fields: He is threshold for trying to not let him, let it get to them and not taking me as hard as what he's taking things out on me in the past, you've gotten better with it.

235
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.200
Richelle Direny: Huh, what do you think created that change remember him.

236
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.020
Richelle Direny: Talking I'm

237
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:09.150
Angela Fields: Past. Yeah, just like you said, and you know just each time it's gotten better.

238
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.570
Angela Fields: Hmm, there's been something to happen.

239
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.530
Richelle Direny: And I think what's important with it all is.

240
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.150
Richelle Direny: Like to set the increase in that communication level.

241
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.190
Richelle Direny: Because

242
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:43.380
Richelle Direny: When it's all said and done with a relationship, let alone a marriage. It's a highlighting when all the emotions are down. Everyone is kind of level headed. We're not in the height of the upset or whatever. The term is once we're kind of all when the seas are calm.

243
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:58.560
Richelle Direny: Now let's have a conversation. It's not allowing it to. Okay well we're calm. He's calm, he's back to his normal let's not talk about it. It's going back and talking about because like you said, over time, things will get better, especially if you feel like

244
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.580
Richelle Direny: It ultimately I think we all do that.

245
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:04.770
Richelle Direny: To each other.

246
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.800
Richelle Direny: The other person becomes the punching bag.

247
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:16.860
Angela Fields: Right, and even more so for us, because he doesn't have any friends outside of our household. You really doesn't. And that was one person.

248
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:25.920
Angela Fields: We don't associate with many people because of things like that happening and having lived a lifestyle. We've lived, you know, with drugs.

249
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.540
Angela Fields: The people, don't you know what comes along with lifestyles, not good people, you know,

250
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:40.710
Angela Fields: We still have yet to find that network of people were bad things don't always you know come with people and

251
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.340
Angela Fields: It's hard. It's hard for me and him and the one time that we, you know, good.

252
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.270
Angela Fields: Okay, we need to let somebody into our home and you know

253
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.910
Angela Fields: This happened. It's hard.

254
00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:12.540
Richelle Direny: It definitely is heart expectation to is always a key player in everything that you do your expectation of people becomes the key player and you always have to question what is my expectation of this person did I raise the bar, way too high.

255
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.740
Richelle Direny: And so because sometimes because when you think about it.

256
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:23.700
Richelle Direny: If we're friends. Think about it. From this standpoint, we're friends. We've been kicking it for the last 15 years

257
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.080
Richelle Direny: Guess what.

258
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:37.350
Richelle Direny: You and I have been while we were kicking it we were using together or I have a history of you know where you are on your journey. You think you know where I am on my journey.

259
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.510
Angela Fields: That's exactly how it was to

260
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:53.370
Richelle Direny: You link you know where I am on my journey and what because your loyalty to our friendship, because we've been kicking it for the last for 15 years because of your loyalty to our friendship.

261
00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:09.660
Richelle Direny: You put aside what you think you meant, because remember, there's that internal messaging boy and too loud about Rochelle I mean I know y'all been friends for a minute, but I really know what your loyalty to our friendship.

262
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.940
Richelle Direny: Is what you allow to dictate what happens next.

263
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:25.230
Richelle Direny: And because I understand that loyalty. I also am going to work on you and be like Angela Rena you just gonna leave me out here. I mean, come on now.

264
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:25.800
And

265
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:36.570
Richelle Direny: The manipulation now start coming in. But remember, this is not a journey which is unfamiliar to you the mitten. The population and everything that comes

266
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:50.490
Richelle Direny: With being an active addiction is not unfamiliar to you. So while your mind and your heart was saying, Angela, don't go down that street don't go down that route the call a spade a spade, you know that it's manipulation, your loyalty

267
00:29:51.690 --> 00:30:03.240
Richelle Direny: Spoke the loudest and you allow her to come in to your space and you started convincing yourself that they won't do any of it.

268
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:09.120
Richelle Direny: Two things played a key factor in this whole situation and i think it's it's a concept to learn

269
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:25.470
Richelle Direny: That you apply to anything, any one that you decide to bring into your personal space is unruly standing there background. Two things played apart your loyalty to the friendship, as well as your fear of being alone.

270
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:26.820
Yes.

271
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.540
Richelle Direny: Remember when we're

272
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.340
Angela Fields: Being alone, and there was

273
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.610
Angela Fields: Loyalty to the friendship, because the friendship an identity troubled waters.

274
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:48.660
Richelle Direny: It would been through troubled waters. But listen, this is this. This is a reason why it's still a loyalty, because if it had been through troubled waters enough, you wouldn't even allow me to come in your house.

275
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.100
Angela Fields: Right.

276
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:59.880
Richelle Direny: Because we've already had experiences. It comes down to the loyalty or two because you think about, there's some friends that y'all have been literally to hell and back.

277
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.220
Richelle Direny: Right, he'll go back there and you help them even though. Everybody's looking at you like,

278
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.320
Angela Fields: Why you keep playing. So who

279
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:08.940
Angela Fields: Does

280
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.070
Angela Fields: This was one of those people

281
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.250
Richelle Direny: And everybody's looking at you like Angela. Why would you allow this person to come around and look what they've done to you in the past. It's still

282
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:34.620
Richelle Direny: To the loyalty to the friendship, because you've been through so much but then again you have to weigh, like you said this, the two things that play. Which one is higher than the other. The fear of being alone or the loyalty to the friendship.

283
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:35.700
Angela Fields: Um,

284
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:43.110
Richelle Direny: And so while you have to understand the two key players, because remember when we're heading down a road of

285
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:52.860
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like like this more visual in our minds, we think the devil is this guy with a with a pitchfork and he looks really ugly in this than any other

286
00:31:53.160 --> 00:32:07.950
Richelle Direny: First of all, if I see somebody like that. I'm not gonna friend, nobody like that because it's distasteful to the eye right because I'm not going all around you. But hey, if the devil is someone that is cool. You look at real good. He come away.

287
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.530
Angela Fields: And smile and lead me down to

288
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:20.160
Richelle Direny: Try to tell you. Come on now. Come with me when I come with you. What you don't know is that I am going to cause a lot of disruption in your life.

289
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:30.000
Richelle Direny: And that's how we are deceived, simply because all of it is pleasing to the eyes pleasing to the ear. Somehow, it makes her heart flutter.

290
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:36.060
Richelle Direny: Well, while your heart is fluttering its kind of hold up, hold up, hold up. No, no, no. The same fluttering real good.

291
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:48.000
Richelle Direny: But because of what we see and everything that is said to us, it feels like okay. I'm okay and then now you start questioning you start saying, and convincing yourself that it's okay.

292
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:55.590
Richelle Direny: So here it is your tool weakness in this sense, because we do a lot of things out of our weakness, not out of our strength.

293
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:56.610
Angela Fields: Right.

294
00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:05.550
Richelle Direny: Our strength is an actual like you don't need to because it's my strength. I know how to deal with this. It's my strength. I got this on lock.

295
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:17.670
Richelle Direny: My weakness is always on steady ground. So I always have to be aware of my weakness. I'm week to this particular friend. I'm always going to be there. I am on my journey of

296
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:27.570
Richelle Direny: Recovery. I would love my friend to come on it with me. I would love my friend to see what it is like we've been through a whole lot. I would love them to be there with me.

297
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:43.830
Richelle Direny: My, my dad just died. This is my first time being in this home alone. You know what, now I'm here every Creek. I'm here every sound that I never heard before, but now because I'm in this House by myself. I'm in here at all.

298
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:52.410
Richelle Direny: I'm your mind blew it up to that. And so now you became fearful. So then you're saying I can't be here by myself.

299
00:33:53.970 --> 00:34:02.010
Richelle Direny: So you brought her in here is your two weakness fear and loyalty. The two came together and what happened.

300
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.240
Richelle Direny: Now it makes you that much more distrustful of people

301
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:23.160
Richelle Direny: Simply because we allow the smooth talker to come in we allow this person who is the with the pitchfork to come in our house, but he didn't look like the devil with the pitchfork. And so I say all of that to point out the fact that, like you said,

302
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:34.140
Richelle Direny: Because of our life before because of what we know. We try not to allow people to come into our homes. We try not to allow certain things to happen and

303
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:40.770
Richelle Direny: In doing so, you both came to that place where you're like, Okay, maybe we can

304
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:48.510
Richelle Direny: And this is which will allow because in everything that I just said to you. Remember, it's your mind that blew it up way more than it needed to

305
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.370
Angela Fields: It's always our minds.

306
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.580
Richelle Direny: Always your mind blew it up way more

307
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.340
Angela Fields: Than everything's a matter of perception, everything

308
00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:08.430
Richelle Direny: Everything but you have to be like I said, it's all about your weakness, and that's why your mind can do that because it's feeding to and speaking to the things that we struggle with.

309
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.980
Richelle Direny: That's what it is. Once you've gotten to it. What if it's a strength of yours.

310
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:26.880
Richelle Direny: You. It comes naturally. It's your strength. You know what to do. You know how to get through it. It's your strength, you know how to call a spade a spade when it's your strength, but when it's your weakness.

311
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:44.070
Richelle Direny: We don't keep it in our full awareness at all times. So that's how things always get us. And then in the end, you're like, man, what did I do in that identify what was your weakness in the whole thing your weaknesses, your fear.

312
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.040
Richelle Direny: Think about Kofi

313
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.740
Richelle Direny: What is the one resounding thing that's happening with everyone with this whole Kofi 19

314
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.570
Angela Fields: You're scared of it.

315
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.250
Richelle Direny: You're fearful.

316
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.620
Richelle Direny: And when you're fearful, what do you do

317
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.100
Angela Fields: After emotions, rather than watching

318
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.140
Richelle Direny: Amen.

319
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:17.250
Richelle Direny: Your emotions is taking you all over the place. All day long, instead of stopping and thinking that don't even make any sense. That's right. Even logical what you're saying to me, make no sense.

320
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:25.320
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like what I love is the people who put on the gloves and they touching everything they touch and everything they touch in the mass. They touching the food.

321
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:33.660
Richelle Direny: Then they take off the gloves. They go back to touch the contaminated things with their bare hands that they haven't even watched logic.

322
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.330
Angela Fields: Mm hmm. You're not

323
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.320
Richelle Direny: Using logic.

324
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.400
Angela Fields: Right.

325
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.780
Richelle Direny: Because of fear.

326
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.870
Richelle Direny: Your base thing that's at play here it's fear.

327
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:55.860
Richelle Direny: And we find everything to justify and rationalize it simply because we haven't identified

328
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:57.840
Richelle Direny: My fear.

329
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.930
Richelle Direny: Are you home alone all day, for the most part, if your husband is out.

330
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.110
Angela Fields: No usually here. He works.

331
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:16.890
Richelle Direny: Okay, so he's downstairs. So your mindset thing is okay because you know he

332
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.560
Richelle Direny: So you're not fearful.

333
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.270
Richelle Direny: Right. What is it that you're so fearful about being in the house alone.

334
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:34.230
Angela Fields: I don't know. There's something about the dark to at once nighttime comes on. I don't know what it is. I feel like a little kid when it comes down to that when it turns dark I get here. I'm going to go downstairs on myself at night.

335
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.370
Richelle Direny: What do you think that you're fearful of the dark. Is it something

336
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:39.780
Angela Fields: I have no idea.

337
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.990
Richelle Direny: Think about it for a moment. Have you always been feared

338
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.240
Angela Fields: Always

339
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:45.930
Richelle Direny: A child.

340
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.830
Yes.

341
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.220
Richelle Direny: Is it that did you use to watch scary movies.

342
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.620
Angela Fields: Now, never hate him.

343
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.540
Richelle Direny: Do you have siblings.

344
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:55.290
Now,

345
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.790
Richelle Direny: If there's if there's something has to be associated with the dark that makes you so afraid that you refuse to be alone.

346
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.130
Richelle Direny: Something have something

347
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.790
Angela Fields: That is it, is it possible or something. I don't remember.

348
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.650
Richelle Direny: It could be

349
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:12.540
Richelle Direny: It could be

350
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.280
Angela Fields: Because I cannot life of me, think back on me anything.

351
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.830
Angela Fields: That I know as it relates to the dark logically makes sense.

352
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.680
Richelle Direny: It could be a do you have, do you have any past trauma.

353
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:31.470
Angela Fields: Like what

354
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:39.540
Richelle Direny: Any kind of trauma, anything that happened to you when you were younger, no.

355
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.900
Richelle Direny: No, no, not that you can remember

356
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:54.750
Richelle Direny: And maybe that is something maybe that's something that you can think about because, like, for instance, like I personally. Why do we need to watch. Number one, a scary movie in the pitch black, dark black turn on the lights.

357
00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:00.990
Richelle Direny: Why are you, you are like, why do I need to watch a movie and and the whole time I'm jerking like why

358
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.580
Angela Fields: And stupid.

359
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:03.930
Richelle Direny: Haha

360
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.160
Angela Fields: I think it's stupid.

361
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:12.840
Richelle Direny: It is stupid, but you think about when a child sees that what ends up happening right after they watch a scary movie in the dark, what happens

362
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.460
Angela Fields: And nightmares.

363
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.960
Richelle Direny: They don't even want to go to their room on your own, because it's too dark. They need you to be there with them.

364
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.400
Richelle Direny: Oh, no, no. Leave the item.

365
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:31.440
Richelle Direny: It's because so then that is something that's suppressed in our subconscious and like you said something is driving your fear of the dark

366
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.380
Angela Fields: Nations. I don't know what it is. I really don't.

367
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:49.140
Richelle Direny: Something is controlling that because, and this is how you know it's having an impact on you because it's one thing to be scared of the dark. I mean, we're all somewhat scared of something, because then you think of the spooky man or whatever, that's coming out of the dark but

368
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.460
Richelle Direny: It's not, it seems like it has some degree of control over you.

369
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.140
Angela Fields: Mean like i mean

370
00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:06.120
Angela Fields: I parked downstairs in the garage. And if I get something on my car and it's dark outside that you know it's dark out dark downstairs I literally run and run back. I mean, that's how much of control, it has on me.

371
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:14.340
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. So there's some things that maybe, maybe, maybe at a certain age of something happened that was in the dark.

372
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:25.140
Richelle Direny: Something has to be associate or I would think something has to be associated with that for you to for it to have such an impact on you while you're still terrified of the dark

373
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:40.380
Richelle Direny: It has to be, you know, like you said, it's a memory or something that you put so far back that you've suppressed so deep that is very hard for you to bring it forth into awareness to understand why am I so afraid of the dark because

374
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:56.730
Richelle Direny: If your husband ever have to go away for whatever reason. It's going to put you in a bad spot where you're going to have to bring somebody back to be with you, simply because and it's not that you need to see the person there with you all the time. You just need to

375
00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.180
Richelle Direny: Know, somebody's house and

376
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.500
Richelle Direny: Having our fear, like you said, will act on emotions and not on logics

377
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.310
Angela Fields: Right.

378
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.670
Richelle Direny: You're so afraid of the dark, you will stay more focused on the

379
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:23.940
Richelle Direny: emotion of it, the emotional impact which will create a physical impact on you, which is what you're saying you're running all the time. Anytime you have to deal with the dark that you're not really thinking logically. It's like if

380
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:35.100
Richelle Direny: If you have animals and you're in the dark and one comes running across you'll probably go screaming and kicking and carrying on, and the poor dog will come on the dark looking like or cat will say, What's wrong, what was on that for

381
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.630
Richelle Direny: Simply because of your fear of the dark

382
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.390
Angela Fields: I mean, heck, I'll put one of the cats on my shoulders and run downstairs with the cat with me. I mean, that's how

383
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.340
Richelle Direny: Because you know you have something there.

384
00:41:47.460 --> 00:42:02.250
Richelle Direny: You have a light there, whatever that life is you don't care. It's another life, something has to be associated with the dark and until you come into aware of what that something is. That's when you will be able to work through that fear.

385
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.600
Richelle Direny: Some and it could be something dramatic. I don't know.

386
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:17.370
Richelle Direny: You know, that's why I asked you that something happened in the past where maybe in the dark, something happened, whether it was in school or something bad, whatever it is.

387
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.080
Angela Fields: Now you know i know i mean nothing that I can remember or know of

388
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.290
Richelle Direny: When you were in active addiction.

389
00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:26.520
Angela Fields: Huh.

390
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.950
Richelle Direny: Do you remember. Can you remember anything happening when you were in active addiction.

391
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:32.910
Angela Fields: Oh, yeah.

392
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.300
Richelle Direny: Worth bad things that happened to you.

393
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.010
Angela Fields: Know,

394
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.710
Richelle Direny: Not that you can remember

395
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.500
Angela Fields: Now, okay.

396
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:51.480
Richelle Direny: Maybe this is our journey is being able to talk through it and as you talk through it. Something maybe will pop up and

397
00:42:52.140 --> 00:43:05.100
Richelle Direny: Be like this big bad thing or what have you, but maybe something will pop up like I had someone who is a fear of loud noise but that are they had PTSD from a bad accident, but then it ended up turning out into that.

398
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:23.550
Richelle Direny: triggers the trauma, but it's through it that allows you to bring it into awareness that maybe this is what it is. And when you bring it up, you will start maybe having some memories, whether it's vivid, or what have you to bring it into awareness, what is really causing that.

399
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:28.560
Richelle Direny: Okay, um, let us reschedule.

400
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.260
Richelle Direny: You said evenings are always best for you this time.

401
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.540
Angela Fields: This time or later. Yes.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.690

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:27.780
Angela Fields: It's not your fault.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.190
Melonie Powers: Good.

432
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:34.530
Melonie Powers: You were what

433
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.650
Richelle Direny: You were going on a job. The last time we met.

434
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.610
Melonie Powers: Yeah. Um, so I went through the system.

435
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:57.900
Melonie Powers: Because I was working full time hours I'm self employed and you know I do good work merchandising, we were doing for reporting on

436
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:03.330
Melonie Powers: It just so happened, they were going to end anyway.

437
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.590
Melonie Powers: But it just so happened to the end at all.

438
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.220
Richelle Direny: I think you froze. If you can hear me.

439
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.330
Melonie Powers: So anyway, um,

440
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.980
Melonie Powers: Yeah, so, so I worked at last time. And then I worked

441
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:33.420
Melonie Powers: Yesterday Monday.

442
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.500
Melonie Powers: For another job but um I qualify for the unemployment.

443
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:48.420
Melonie Powers: Because they relax the rules were bad, even though the one job I got fired all of all

444
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:55.980
Melonie Powers: I get 120 A WEEK FROM THAT LAST THREE three jobs, whatever.

445
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.290
Melonie Powers: You know, because they go 18 months back, you know, I mean, and then because I've been a good employee and I happen to be working

446
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.360
Melonie Powers: Full time our

447
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.940
Melonie Powers: Warranty stock that will

448
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:19.740
Melonie Powers: fare. Then after that all of our jobs right up. So I qualify for

449
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.790
Melonie Powers: The 602

450
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:43.800
Melonie Powers: But I'm having problems because I'm sure you've heard a lot of this stuff. And, you know, get in and out there. Everything's been approved. And I was able to get one week of certifications and so like my certifications include like the work I do.

451
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:51.060
Melonie Powers: So certain like on a week of for 15 you know I made like $37

452
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:52.620
Melonie Powers: Right.

453
00:48:54.330 --> 00:49:00.120
Melonie Powers: Under the 50 that you're allowed to earn I may have or more. This week I'm not sure.

454
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:09.450
Melonie Powers: But then the next but so I put that first weekend. Right. And then I don't know what happened to this customer email.

455
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:19.260
Melonie Powers: It said it. Let me do that first week. And it actually gave me a 600 and some dollars payments day

456
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:22.170
Melonie Powers: For that one week. Right.

457
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:30.270
Melonie Powers: When I went into put in my second week and then I have I have several weeks to put in obviously going back for 15 you know

458
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.510
Richelle Direny: It's good, right.

459
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.780
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry for the unemployment.

460
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:50.220
Melonie Powers: Yeah, so it gives me this. Um, it gives me an error. And it says, You stated that you were separated recently from an employer, you have to file a claim.

461
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.430
Melonie Powers: Well, I can't. I'll admit.

462
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.350
Melonie Powers: I have one. I even try because I got to the point where I tried that route.

463
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:09.510
Melonie Powers: Those like that's all wrong. Nice and self employed. So I downloaded it I downloaded or search, you know, and the work that I've been doing

464
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:20.130
Melonie Powers: I found it took me so long to figure out how to get it in their system would accept it because I kept trying and trying. It wasn't working. So now what I'm doing is I'm putting in self employed.

465
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:33.810
Melonie Powers: What the job where the job is that I'm doing what the company name is that I got the job from and how much I made, which is under $7 and 50 cents a job or eight

466
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:43.410
Melonie Powers: On the weekends, when they throw them to those level. Um, you know what I mean to go to the store and do this little job. You try to get routes. You know what I mean.

467
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:54.630
Melonie Powers: But, um, but since he gave me that error. I haven't been able to put any more week. And so since last week when I started putting this stuff in finally

468
00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:07.560
Melonie Powers: I've been emailing and emailing them going. I need somebody to set this correct because like I haven't recently been separated from an employer I'm my own employer.

469
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:14.970
Melonie Powers: And I am working and I'm planning my money and I have all the search logs put in, you know,

470
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:28.170
Melonie Powers: I got one week. It literally went in today but you know I gotta get the rest in and

471
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:49.080
Melonie Powers: I got emails back and things and then. So the first thing they do is they send you an article. Oh, well, this article tell you which tells you, like if your Social Security ends in the last four numbers. This is your day you know to go in and certify and then like when he is Wednesday through

472
00:51:50.430 --> 00:52:06.930
Melonie Powers: Thursday or Friday, Wednesday, Friday. He was is all anybody people in no matter what the number is. That's not a problem. The problem is it's got a glitch thing that I said somewhere, apparently.

473
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:18.600
Melonie Powers: Don't see how that could possibly happen that I separated for me because I didn't work resolved, but I wasn't sure it was gonna work.

474
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:29.820
Melonie Powers: But everything the timing, all of it because I want literally from full time nothing, pretty much.

475
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:40.140
Melonie Powers: Everybody shut down. There's no, there's nothing. And then I'm still considered an essential worker, we will do merchandising stuff in stores.

476
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:53.490
Melonie Powers: But still, there was nothing and things are starting to come back now and I'm pressing on but in this meantime and for all the past, we got, I've got over 2000

477
00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:05.310
Melonie Powers: Don't stay there more than that now of money that's mine where I was only able to get one weekend you don't certify we don't pay effort.

478
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:07.080
Richelle Direny: But I

479
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:15.120
Melonie Powers: Gotta fix it. You can't get through them trying to email saying I've downloaded it to my email that my documents.

480
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:24.180
Melonie Powers: You know, took a picture of it and like if I can't put it in here. Here's a copy. You can see, you know,

481
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.210
Richelle Direny: I mean, I was on unemployment, they're there, they're very meticulous with everything you have to

482
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.870
Richelle Direny: Ensure that you enter the correct information.

483
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.550
Richelle Direny: Because they will hold you to it or you would have to go back

484
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:47.190
Richelle Direny: But, but when it comes down to self employment, how are you able to enter that into a system because there's no real way for you to prove it.

485
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:52.080
Melonie Powers: Whether it's because I get my direct deposit

486
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.020
Melonie Powers: And then I have

487
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.450
Melonie Powers: Like I bought my app.

488
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.870
Melonie Powers: From the company that I get jobs from

489
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:09.450
Melonie Powers: And it has all of my past projects where I worked when I was paid that design and it gives the dates and locations and everything.

490
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:28.710
Melonie Powers: So I, I take screenshots of them, but like, so like if I'm doing like you see like, you know, the you know the actual worksheet. What I do is I put the date of a contest, because you have to make three work searches or be working, you know, so I'm on both basically

491
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:36.120
Melonie Powers: So I'm able to go in and put the date like that I work where I work.

492
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:37.860
Melonie Powers: Even

493
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:47.760
Melonie Powers: Even though I don't work for that company so self employed, but this is where I work that day. And what did I do that day. I'm working on is

494
00:54:48.120 --> 00:55:04.830
Melonie Powers: I'm self employed for that specific job I need, whatever, you know, and then usually I'll have like 323 or four, but they, they're just not out there right now to get like for make a whole huge drop and

495
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:12.600
Melonie Powers: You know if they pay a lot higher when you do it that way. Right now, I'm just picking and choosing the and there's not a lot out there, but

496
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:27.780
Melonie Powers: And so it says, you know, because I'm self employed. I'm a 1099 contractor and since we lost all those stories that I was doing where I was full time fake and I gave them all that stuff all

497
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.090
Melonie Powers: All hours.

498
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:40.950
Melonie Powers: To two different 1099 companies to get that work, and I was telling about my work. You remember that when I worked all day straight was and I got

499
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.730
Melonie Powers: Sick, too.

500
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:44.100
Melonie Powers: So,

501
00:55:46.650 --> 00:56:05.670
Melonie Powers: Because I was working full time because I did have to quarantine for 14 days because I didn't have to provide the doctors excuse to come back after that I lost that money and then after that none of those jobs are available and the reality is, those jobs.

502
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:13.200
Melonie Powers: Are not going to be available. We did them all basically except for the last two, which led to do

503
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:22.230
Melonie Powers: There's other ones that occasion that come up that if they're in my area, you know, within like an hour, hour and a half of me.

504
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.570
Melonie Powers: They're not there. No, and

505
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:29.070
Melonie Powers: So I just, I actually qualify under the Federal

506
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:45.450
Melonie Powers: And I actually qualify because they relax the rules where it doesn't even matter that I got fired from. Well, I should say my last two jobs one before that, you know, I was doing merchandising for print partners were

507
00:56:46.710 --> 00:57:00.690
Melonie Powers: You know, lifting you know these things just tons of plants when I fell down in my basement stairs, and I couldn't work. I couldn't do it anymore because I hurt my back. And then I went, it's already hurt. I really heard it when I did that.

508
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:06.180
Melonie Powers: And then I ended up going in for all that stuff. So I had to resign next position, but so

509
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:19.290
Melonie Powers: They've got me as a standalone 120 plus 600 that the federal government in me, so I'm just looking for as long as they can because

510
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:25.380
Melonie Powers: You know weren't for the type of on my to you meet that

511
00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.030
Melonie Powers: Sequence.

512
00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:45.360
Melonie Powers: Month August or somewhere with it and meantime I'm having to go away it all, you know, start working on all these teeth. He filling all this stuff done to him.

513
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:50.130
Melonie Powers: Well, I have an appointment starting that stuff.

514
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.340
Richelle Direny: Didn't you have a dentist appointment.

515
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.390
Richelle Direny: After we met, we have you had a dentist appointment.

516
00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.160
Richelle Direny: How was that

517
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:22.230
Melonie Powers: In healing. Pretty good. I just, you know, I kept hitting it with my toothbrush was little aggravated but I mean they pulled it out and he will hit pull it out. He had to cut it, you know, had stuff. But, um, well then I went back for my recheck and then now he wants to check back with me.

518
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.310
Melonie Powers: We can all live in here yet or

519
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:32.730
Melonie Powers: Is it, like, six weeks, roughly, you know,

520
00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:39.390
Melonie Powers: Or maybe even two months. Make sure it heals because he knows that I want to get an implant there.

521
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.070
Melonie Powers: I'm so close to the farm my mouth, you know,

522
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:56.040
Melonie Powers: So it needs time to heal. And so while we're waiting for that next checkups and make sure everything's good deal correctly. And then they can see that in the meantime.

523
00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:03.780
Melonie Powers: I have, you know, get all the other. Well, I don't have to compete at all. You don't mean that I have to get started on it.

524
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:05.910
Melonie Powers: So,

525
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.630
Melonie Powers: Kind of the last thing that you know

526
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:22.860
Melonie Powers: Well, I just qualify for the influence the way that they finish things up. I qualify for for it. So I'm not going to say I'm working system or anything because reality is, I'm not

527
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:27.000
Melonie Powers: And I'm still going and doing my job when I do

528
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:36.840
Richelle Direny: An employment is with the federal government and and I've learned years ago when it comes on to the federal government. There is no working the system because they're gonna they're gonna

529
00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:37.590
Melonie Powers: If

530
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:39.420
Richelle Direny: That you falsify

531
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.220
Melonie Powers: The government here.

532
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.830
Richelle Direny: You'll see everything you have. And they don't

533
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:44.820
Melonie Powers: Care. Yeah.

534
00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.580
Richelle Direny: Take it back. Yeah.

535
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:57.390
Melonie Powers: It's not worth your life right now. So, but no, I do. But I qualify under all of the stuff I think was. They didn't say it. You know, it's all the states they all had to catch up.

536
00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:11.010
Melonie Powers: Now had to get their systems ready for it. And I think I had a glitch in the system. So it will be like I said one weekend and then it just flashed up on me and it won't let me file in my weeks.

537
01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:22.590
Melonie Powers: And then it says I have to follow any plane and then it goes, You can't fall asleep that one open. He's already been so I've been sending off to their help desk.

538
01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:30.330
Melonie Powers: Through my account. You know, so they know who who it is the documents. I'm attaching

539
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:34.860
Melonie Powers: You know explanation of everything. Try to get

540
01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.150
Richelle Direny: Unemployment, don't you have to, um,

541
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:46.620
Richelle Direny: I think you have to submit weekly that you have been looking for a job or you've been applying for a job, you have to do there.

542
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:54.630
Melonie Powers: Well, exactly. And so they asked, you know, are you available for or did you turn down work. So yes, I'm available for

543
01:00:55.260 --> 01:01:04.050
Melonie Powers: Yes, I've been accepting work. And that's really what's been saving me because even before I knew all this stuff. I was grabbing what I could

544
01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:21.630
Melonie Powers: So we're going back to April 15 the following week goes from the main key to the 25th and then from the 25th is the beginning of May, you know how to survive that week but

545
01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:29.400
Melonie Powers: And I just happen. You know, because that's what I do. There are in my area and I get him. I'll take them because even

546
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:43.470
Melonie Powers: In my world, if I if I make a you know $50 a day on a route before stores you know I'm in there for 20 minutes 15 minutes. It's really bad sometimes 30 minutes the store.

547
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:59.070
Melonie Powers: Is the travel that really gets you. But I've been doing those. So not so I have the work sessions, because I've been to three different companies technically working and claiming my wages.

548
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.470
Richelle Direny: And

549
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:12.420
Melonie Powers: Playing with but it falls, because it is such a little amount of money and there's so little amount of work out there right now where this wasn't the case before

550
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.270
Melonie Powers: I fall under that $50 a week that you can make

551
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:26.910
Melonie Powers: Before they go into that $120 benefit from my job from last year. And once I got fired from

552
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:35.070
Melonie Powers: I didn't expect anything to happen after like you know I got fired. I got fired and I resigned.

553
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:44.700
Melonie Powers: Um, it's an ethical standard. Is it, you know, it was legit. You know, I did the wrong thing. Whatever.

554
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:52.890
Melonie Powers: So I didn't hear, but they didn't know where I felt that

555
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:58.020
Melonie Powers: And then I put specifically on there. So the truth.

556
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:13.680
Richelle Direny: So let's say if you work this week. Um, and you work $100 for the week and you put in your claim and you put that you made 100 the unemployment, why don't they just subtract $100 from what

557
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:13.860
They

558
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:25.440
Melonie Powers: Yeah, they read well actually 53 I can $50 without accepting anything or changing anything. So then that next $50 would be

559
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.540
Melonie Powers: 120

560
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:45.840
Melonie Powers: And they pulled out of that. What's left and then I still am eligible with a federal 600 and then they fall like $70 taxes out of that. So today for that one week.

561
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.770
Melonie Powers: I got like $680

562
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.940
Melonie Powers: In earnings for one week.

563
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.910
Richelle Direny: You said for you how much you got 108 hours or

564
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:07.740
Melonie Powers: 600 608 because it's given that 600 a week.

565
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:09.210
Melonie Powers: So,

566
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.320
Melonie Powers: In a way it's in my best interest.

567
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.700
Melonie Powers: To say self employed because I have working

568
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:27.840
Melonie Powers: On going out and searching for the job. I'm bed. I'm getting them. They don't pay crap. But that's my work. That's what I do.

569
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.280
Richelle Direny: Because the one

570
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:36.390
Richelle Direny: The one when we, when we met last week and then she said you were only going to get like 20 something dollars for whatever it is that you were doing right

571
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:39.450
Melonie Powers: Yeah, like so, like that we're

572
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:48.900
Melonie Powers: 419 to 25 I only need eight hours that week because Jenna jobs I bid on I got wait listed and I didn't get them.

573
01:04:50.220 --> 01:05:02.040
Melonie Powers: But it doesn't mean that I didn't apply for them I apply for those jobs as a contractor, go get them. Like I was weightlifting somebody got there before me is

574
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:07.980
Richelle Direny: Like is it like a like a job pool type of thing that you you apply to

575
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:14.130
Melonie Powers: designing apps and I work for cute. I have a couple of different apps that I work off of

576
01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:25.680
Melonie Powers: So like if you go into a supermarket or okay I've been at Lowes, and they have like a son has the sons are all these different things.

577
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:32.940
Melonie Powers: And, you know, there's a little thing, you know, the cardboard thing they put their merchandising

578
01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:42.960
Melonie Powers: And really right now I'm doing its own in there, making sure that if there were supposed to be that it has enough facing that the prices are right and showing

579
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:54.210
Melonie Powers: And then I read merchandise to make it look good but I go through each item on that shelf and pretty fast pricing is it in stock or not all off.

580
01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:06.390
Melonie Powers: And run through it, get it done download that and then I'll usually run right to my next job minister, but I'll try to get like three or four of those at a time. So like I'm

581
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.930
Melonie Powers: Telling that too, but because it was mother's

582
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:12.330
Melonie Powers: Day like 30

583
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:15.540
Melonie Powers: That one you know mean

584
01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:19.500
Melonie Powers: Weekend and they didn't have anybody to do it.

585
01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:20.430
Richelle Direny: How

586
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.450
Melonie Powers: It pans out how

587
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.300
Richelle Direny: How long does each of those jobs, take

588
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:35.370
Melonie Powers: Like I say, like, because once you get familiar with the product it sometimes it's like 15 minutes

589
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.680
Melonie Powers: Java was the one I did yesterday.

590
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:54.060
Melonie Powers: Was about plants and things. So I was having to look to the exact number of you on a whole rack of all different plants and that would be longer.

591
01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:16.950
Melonie Powers: But it paid a much more so it was two stores and you know we spend about a half in on this is this, I spent about a half an hour to 40 minutes on the first one and then the second one was quicker because I knew what I you know I knew what was going on because I just did it.

592
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.210
Melonie Powers: In me

593
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.930
Melonie Powers: And then so and I have a lot of us.

594
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:24.210
Melonie Powers: Have jobs like the different products.

595
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.360
Melonie Powers: I go to the same stores a lot

596
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:28.950
Melonie Powers: But

597
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:38.100
Melonie Powers: The big money jobs aren't there anymore. And that qualifies me so and I and I hate to say it, because I, you know, I'm looking at

598
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:45.840
Melonie Powers: Well, I'm not sure I'm on my third year in third tier level of insurance.

599
01:07:46.680 --> 01:08:01.350
Melonie Powers: So hopefully the prices my teeth and stuff will come down, we'll go over that I made you agreement. In fact, I need to talk to you about that too because they their first opening is may 26 that was off and that is our next appointment isn't

600
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:10.110
Melonie Powers: It that spot. What does it look like three I have three are my five look like trees, I think.

601
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.740
Melonie Powers: We're on the 25th of five right

602
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.050
Richelle Direny: At five. Yeah, yeah.

603
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.000
Melonie Powers: Okay, no worries. I'll be back by then.

604
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:21.000
Melonie Powers: But on that 26 like that.

605
01:08:21.570 --> 01:08:22.170
Science

606
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:25.500
Richelle Direny: This is for your health insurance.

607
01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.120
Melonie Powers: My dental

608
01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:28.200
Okay.

609
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:44.790
Melonie Powers: So they're not going to cover you know they cover so much but I'm on my third year of paying into them. So they pay more. The longer obviously you're with them. That's how it works, but they still don't cover.

610
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:52.980
Melonie Powers: Now hovercraft really what I need my kids are so screwed up. It's just it runs in the family.

611
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.170
Melonie Powers: What

612
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.430
Melonie Powers: You're gonna do

613
01:08:57.090 --> 01:09:01.080
Richelle Direny: With dentist appoint with dental with you talking about with the dental insurance.

614
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.030
Melonie Powers: Mm hmm.

615
01:09:03.570 --> 01:09:10.530
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you have to agree. I think it's the insurance is a quite a bit of ripoff because they don't really cover anything

616
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.290
Melonie Powers: It really is horrible.

617
01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.030
Richelle Direny: True ripoff.

618
01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.740
Melonie Powers: Hey, yeah.

619
01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.220
Richelle Direny: Optical pay for your dental work.

620
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:23.280
Melonie Powers: This is why I was working like I had

621
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:31.110
Melonie Powers: Put my bag. Remember I was doing all that full time status and that was basically I was working for my P. Okay.

622
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:43.350
Melonie Powers: So when those jobs right away. And when I, myself, fantastic. And I wasn't sure there were they didn't have tests that are even if you showed up into into emergency. They didn't have them yet.

623
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:57.060
Melonie Powers: Um, but I still had to quarantine. We knew that, you know, and then come back 14 days later, people love I miss to work or two weeks, excuse me, you know, doing that. So yeah, but I was like, you know,

624
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:11.400
Melonie Powers: That's all bed for my teeth and I had saved over 1200 dollars during that, you know, and I don't mean the 1200s of government Senate, and I don't mean our income tax returns, I save that.

625
01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:26.880
Melonie Powers: And then wanted to add, and then all my money job all the jobs job. So in a way, I want to go. I'm going to melt this system for as long as I can because the federal government giving an extra $600

626
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:34.260
Melonie Powers: The is never in my lifetime is going to happen again and I can certainly do three stores a week.

627
01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:46.440
Melonie Powers: And a half an hour, you know, even I spent longer variety of states. I didn't my stores, trying to get one was on the western one on that you sent

628
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:55.470
Melonie Powers: But I have to do it. And I said, you know, talking to my husband, and he's like, what are you stupid. I'm like, it's not stupid because I could drive miles.

629
01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:09.270
Melonie Powers: You know, spend the time in the store and come home and there I have this to my work searches on for the week done you know because Sunday, sir, sweet, you know,

630
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:19.530
Melonie Powers: Today, and I'm like, and I have to do that. It's either that or as a lot and I applied for an actual job and I don't want a fuckin actual job because

631
01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:34.560
Melonie Powers: You know, I'll just tell somebody right now, I'm just not looking good. I hate to say it that way because my heart flutter in the world that actually me. That's my problem. Maybe because I kind of have that choice.

632
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.400
Richelle Direny: Maybe that's your problem because you've had that choice.

633
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:53.370
Melonie Powers: I kind of do i mean i do you know we'll haul everything we really do need me to be making about $1,000 a month. And that's for all extras.

634
01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:02.190
Melonie Powers: So that means the more I get all the bills are paid depart David ensure everything paid your has

635
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.960
Melonie Powers: That that extra money I bring in

636
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:23.100
Melonie Powers: That goes the grocery bullshit animal. And when I say animals. They go, you know, the cleantech should have $27 a fish, you know, and they're $55 55 pound bag of food and

637
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:34.290
Melonie Powers: You know all the meanings of the house and you know redoing the bathrooms and all that kind of stuff, and all the things that I've done, you know, here.

638
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:46.320
Melonie Powers: On everything you know that's the extra money that makes it easy or I should say for us to live. Otherwise, we're just bare bone in it, you know.

639
01:12:47.220 --> 01:13:03.630
Melonie Powers: So I was making that money and then I'm still making enough on top of it to do those things, you know, I still put money back from Nike and then I also put I put the $400 retainer down to be truly healthy

640
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:07.950
Melonie Powers: I don't

641
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:08.700
Melonie Powers: Have it

642
01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:19.950
Richelle Direny: Were able to save money because I remember in the past, you did talk about needing to get money to file the bankruptcy because of you know what the debt and you having to work with all of these that you have

643
01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:24.600
Richelle Direny: So you were able to save for the bankruptcy and for to get your dental work done.

644
01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.330
Melonie Powers: Well, it was just the

645
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:36.390
Melonie Powers: $400 down for the attorney, but part of that came out of my tax returns. So that wasn't my work for me.

646
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:50.580
Melonie Powers: And then I spent like called hundred dollars my own. But if you remember back in early March and all the February I was working all the story says so.

647
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:55.290
Melonie Powers: You know those are like $120 a day four.

648
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:56.280
Melonie Powers: Days a week.

649
01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:56.730
And

650
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:15.540
Melonie Powers: So yeah, I was saving that money and now all of it. You know, like I said someone to grocery on one obviously to get ahead. I've been rapes and murders on the car that email out of the income taxes and

651
01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:19.650
Melonie Powers: They feel like I'm we're

652
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:26.940
Melonie Powers: All I'm saying is, but, you know, things like that. But what I'm trying to say. Yeah, I mean, I was able to save 1200 out of everything.

653
01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:30.480
Melonie Powers: At the end of the day, you know,

654
01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:41.340
Melonie Powers: Like no, I want the unemployment insurance to keep kicking in. I cannot lose week and I cannot sit back and not have a file.

655
01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:43.680
Melonie Powers: Because I'm legit.

656
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:55.320
Melonie Powers: And I'm done a milk it for everything I can. Because I need as much money as I can right now to put towards my teeth when I go in

657
01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.840
Melonie Powers: On the 26 they're wanting

658
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.060
Melonie Powers: $368

659
01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:09.600
Melonie Powers: That's

660
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:14.790
Richelle Direny: What you know so we do

661
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.560
Melonie Powers: Oh no, I'm sorry, that's bad, my bad. I'm sorry 500

662
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:30.060
Melonie Powers: It's 368 for one and then 203 for all the other periodontal it's all

663
01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:46.110
Melonie Powers: I you know I asked them, I'm fed up with a shift because I'm like, you know, I used to go to the dentist. If I had a cavity. It was fill it. Now I'm running up against the ship, because we've done something close. So I've called dentists that are now, just know really

664
01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:53.610
Melonie Powers: Well, to be a new patient and get into them is months down the road. Now because they're reschedule and all their original location.

665
01:15:54.180 --> 01:16:04.530
Melonie Powers: data flows down. They have no TV and stuff that they need it. So now I'm back with is asked and mental and but now there's her to tell me you know I have to do.

666
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:20.760
Melonie Powers: The periodontal scaly roots, maybe give up or loss lower law digital irrigation for quadrant up a lot lower, left and then the same for the next for the right side.

667
01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:32.100
Melonie Powers: And then, you know, I've got to do all this stuff first because I'm like, you know, I want you to start filling my cavities. I want to say he, you know, I felt like one here.

668
01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:39.330
Melonie Powers: You know you can't see it, you see that black down there, you know, and it needs to be safe.

669
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:51.240
Melonie Powers: And you know, that's what happens when you go 20 years about for the dental insurance Ashley more young, but when he, when I was young.

670
01:16:53.910 --> 01:17:10.950
Melonie Powers: Or even when I was going to the next, you know, the free clinics to base it off your wages. When I lived in the keys and they need some done. It didn't make me go through all this crap. They just did what we needed you know it at all.

671
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:17.910
Melonie Powers: So I feel like I'm being ripped off and I and not having to say about it.

672
01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:31.560
Richelle Direny: I have a question. So like, what's the dentist. I'm like, I don't, I don't know if they haven't. They're in Tennessee, and I know where you live. Maybe it may be far from you or what have you, because you live in, like, a rural area but

673
01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:45.540
Richelle Direny: Like I know here in Florida. They have because like I said, the dentist. Their, their complete ripoff. They charge unnecessary amount of money for the silliest things. And every time you go you need more work than you want it before.

674
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.220
Richelle Direny: So like here they have

675
01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.720
Richelle Direny: Like the one of the universities. It has a School of Dentistry

676
01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.400
Melonie Powers: And most people

677
01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:02.250
Melonie Powers: Have I've already looked into it, but because of my husband's income.

678
01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.530
Richelle Direny: Oh, you don't

679
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:06.960
Melonie Powers: Qualify for

680
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.560
Anything.

681
01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.920
Melonie Powers: It doesn't matter.

682
01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:16.410
Melonie Powers: It doesn't matter all this money goes into his account. I have no access to that money.

683
01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:20.280
Melonie Powers: Just because your mentor, because I'm married.

684
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.340
Richelle Direny: Says, don't you tired, you don't you filed separately.

685
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:32.250
Melonie Powers: We did not file separately because when I taught what I thought we had to initially from

686
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:43.860
Melonie Powers: The women that I had with one girl. The one day before I actually had my put down on an attorney, you know, like the free consultation.

687
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:45.420
Melonie Powers: Um,

688
01:18:46.620 --> 01:19:02.310
Melonie Powers: But then I sat down and talked to this new attorney here in Rochester hills, and he said, it does not matter. You have got to put all of your husband's income, but that's the only 50 about that is, he's got pension.

689
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:05.610
Melonie Powers: Is me because he's retired electrician.

690
01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.990
Melonie Powers: From state of New Jersey. So he's got a pension from there.

691
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:15.000
Melonie Powers: That counts as income his social security money.

692
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:19.110
Melonie Powers: Doesn't count as income they can't include that.

693
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:38.610
Melonie Powers: So that I can put this down where I could file of bankruptcy, but the other party is looking at it going as I'm working for myself why it's going to end up dealing with $2,000 to file bankruptcy. And it's not like I can just charge my student debt.

694
01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.380
Melonie Powers: I've been on for years now a payment plan.

695
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.770
Melonie Powers: But because of my low wages.

696
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.130
Melonie Powers: It ends up being a zero dollar a month payment.

697
01:19:51.360 --> 01:20:07.350
Melonie Powers: So mishit in order to be, but it still counts toward that 20 of these 2020 years, whatever it counts towards it, because I don't miss any, you know, have to recertified or whatnot. I do. Amen.

698
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:11.790
Melonie Powers: So I'm several years into that. But, uh,

699
01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:22.050
Melonie Powers: I don't know. I lost track. I got off track somewhere but you know anybody. And so what he is in some has to become it. That was the bankruptcy.

700
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:40.200
Melonie Powers: So we file jointly because it gave us we were looking at if we filed it separately married separately. We were going to get like 100 some odd dollars for the both of us. We ended up with 23 four, I want to say $100

701
01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.310
Melonie Powers: For our income taxes filing jointly.

702
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:54.870
Melonie Powers: And since I have to claim is my anyway. I'm like, Screw it. What they can't not a community property state again. Laughter For my debt.

703
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:57.210
Melonie Powers: But I have to

704
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:16.020
Melonie Powers: Qualify for bankers and my other thing is I'm wondering if I didn't want to do that because what do they have to garnish, unless they get a lead on my bank account or something like that was for know about it. There was never be anything that I work for myself.

705
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.630
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

706
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:32.490
Melonie Powers: So, do I really want to file bankruptcy or badges for a whole lot for seven years, let it fall off. Well, not so much. We're pretty much starting out and things just started charging off what last year. You know what I mean.

707
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.720
Richelle Direny: By

708
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:34.500
Melonie Powers: Our

709
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.330
Richelle Direny: How long does it say on your credit

710
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:44.400
Melonie Powers: It'll stay on there for seven years. If it's part of it will basically he is on for 10 years

711
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.220
Melonie Powers: So then when

712
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.390
Richelle Direny: You're charged often

713
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.830
Melonie Powers: Huh.

714
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.030
Richelle Direny: Why not just make it to a charge off words on your credit for less than

715
01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:03.540
Melonie Powers: Well, that's what I'm saying. Why should I spend two grand on an attorney to pay for it when I don't have assets for them.

716
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:06.420
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

717
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.990
Melonie Powers: I'm not on home you know that I'm not on

718
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.520
Melonie Powers: TV, you don't have anything

719
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:18.240
Like

720
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:20.370
It.

721
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:26.940
Richelle Direny: But I'm your husband pays for your medical insurance.

722
01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:31.830
Melonie Powers: Line.

723
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.530
Melonie Powers: You know,

724
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:36.600
Melonie Powers: Say,

725
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:52.110
Melonie Powers: We don't have festivals me none so when we started this year. It wasn't like I had to pay $400, you know, or 1000 or 2000 4000. Some people have been

726
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.470
Melonie Powers: Picking. We don't need any of that. I don't have insurance, even if you specialist

727
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.240
Melonie Powers: So,

728
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:05.220
Richelle Direny: I thought that was one of the things that when you first started that you had to you. Had you had a copay

729
01:23:06.570 --> 01:23:17.430
Melonie Powers: Ashanti Kobe. And that's what's been killing me because I will see. I see in my regular physician. I want you all now seeing my back.

730
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:32.460
Melonie Powers: And now seeing the dentist and I was trying to I was doing everything, plus all my medication. So there's always a copay and $50 copay for everything. And then if my medication bash pay for

731
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:38.490
Melonie Powers: It ends up being $30 when you do through that $60 a month.

732
01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:44.280
Melonie Powers: And then $30 a month when I see dinner.

733
01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.340
Melonie Powers: And then now.

734
01:23:47.370 --> 01:24:02.070
Melonie Powers: So you start adding in, you know, the back doctor and then my regular physician. He's like, Oh, and I had to go and that was all because and I was had to get my my breast, you know, breast exam.

735
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:23.070
Melonie Powers: And then you know my mammogram and I had to go for my yearly pass here because I kind of pre cancer cells me. So if I have a yearly and I had to go see a dermatologist in problem is in. So it was just, it was adding up to

736
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:24.960
Melonie Powers: A lot

737
01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:32.250
Melonie Powers: You know 15 1530 there, you know, and I will see I had so many appointments

738
01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.410
Melonie Powers: Loosening

739
01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.610
Melonie Powers: Why we decided, and I asked.

740
01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:49.740
Melonie Powers: Dr. Jamison, you don't thank you for one week. See you. The next because right now and just call me. Joe, yes, you go back to the pastor

741
01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:54.120
Melonie Powers: And then I'll go, you know,

742
01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:03.630
Melonie Powers: But you know, it's just like, I start adding all these and then I see doctors have my regular physician.

743
01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.620
Melonie Powers: In her every three months now.

744
01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:21.450
Melonie Powers: And then, but with all these dentist appointments between I'm trying to, you know, I'm sorry, entire hours in love with my nightmare. Oh.

745
01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.120
Melonie Powers: Medical crap.

746
01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:33.810
Richelle Direny: That's fine, that's fine. That is fine because, I mean, if it's a current investment if it's a current stressor. It's kind of something that you're going through

747
01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:38.430
Richelle Direny: It's very important to talk about and that's why I'm here. It's very important to talk about it.

748
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:45.750
Richelle Direny: Because it helps you once you sort it out because it's one thing to keep things in your head and try to sort it out in your head when you're talking to someone

749
01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:57.090
Richelle Direny: And you're trying to sort it out while you're figuring things out. Because one of the things, earlier you said was that the fact that because you have a choice because you're a contractor. You have a choice.

750
01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:11.700
Richelle Direny: The question is, I want, do I want to stay a contract or do I want to go back to a regular job. I don't want to go back to a regular job. Maybe that's my problem because I have a choice. I don't have to go back to my right, I could choose what I want to do. And I understand it.

751
01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:13.110
Melonie Powers: I will see if this

752
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:22.860
Melonie Powers: If they weren't given that I'm sorry if the federal government weren't giving that extra money. That wouldn't be an option if I don't make enough. You know what I mean.

753
01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:31.440
Melonie Powers: Mm hmm. But since I qualify for so long, I kind of want to milk that this has been for my teeth.

754
01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:33.420
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

755
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:51.510
Melonie Powers: It's gonna pay for my teeth and allow me the time every, every job that I look at it, you know, all these jobs out there if I wanna but you have to be available for whatever schedule whenever they want. They have like a part time. It's really full time, you know,

756
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:54.450
Melonie Powers: Yes.

757
01:26:54.930 --> 01:27:02.010
Melonie Powers: You're working on, you know, and you don't be. It's not like I can say, look, you know, I have an appointment and this is a recurring

758
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.120
Melonie Powers: You know, like, not just you, but you know group. And so I need to make sure those specific hours are off.

759
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:24.870
Melonie Powers: Now I have my dentist. Listen, I'm sorry, between the dentist dental surgeon, they are going to be working together and my regular doctor, which has to see me and I have all these places all in my, you know, my, my calendar.

760
01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.440
Richelle Direny: I think this is this is the thing which is real.

761
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:43.980
Richelle Direny: It's that listen, I completely understand in having the flexibility of dictating your what you do with your time. It's really important. I completely get that

762
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:46.290
Melonie Powers: And it never comes about. That way, those

763
01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:47.100
Melonie Powers: Who so

764
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:55.440
Melonie Powers: Oh, and it never happens that way. So I feel very fortunate. If I do get it fixed. You know what I mean.

765
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:57.150
Richelle Direny: You

766
01:27:58.170 --> 01:27:58.560
Melonie Powers: Can

767
01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:05.910
Richelle Direny: Count your blessings, because the reality. Some people and depending on your skill or your trade or whatever it is. And you're capable of doing that.

768
01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:15.270
Richelle Direny: And that's a stressor within itself. Listen, stress comes in many different forms and it affects our overall health when you're having to get up every day.

769
01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:28.800
Richelle Direny: You have to go to a job at a certain time. And like you said you have to give up your time and if whether you're working full time or part time if your salary or hourly, you know, you still are governed

770
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:30.330
Melonie Powers: Under whatever song.

771
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:37.860
Richelle Direny: You're under there. If they say, I want you to work three to 11 well three to 11 is not going to work because hey, I have animals.

772
01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:49.950
Richelle Direny: And I can't be well we don't care you need to figure it out if you have, if they work nine to five and you're like, Monday through Friday, but I have all these appointments. That means that you're not the man for the job.

773
01:28:50.400 --> 01:29:00.450
Richelle Direny: So, so you have to but bringing that into awareness and I like what you said. And you have to own it. You really truly have to own it, Melanie because I love it, what you said.

774
01:29:00.930 --> 01:29:05.520
Richelle Direny: Maybe that's my problem because I have a choice, but I don't want to work for someone full time.

775
01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:13.170
Richelle Direny: On it, because it's not just, I don't want to work for someone full time because I don't feel like it but you're saying

776
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:24.690
Richelle Direny: These are the reasons why I don't want to work for someone full time because it's going to get in the way of all of these different things that I have going on and being being I'm

777
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:28.530
Melonie Powers: On our side RC. Yeah, I'll be

Melonie Powers: All the ball here.

781
01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:47.040
Richelle Direny: Go. Okay, go back to what our group topic was last week when we talked about the four things. Life is short jobs are temporary health is wealth.

782
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:56.370
Richelle Direny: And we need to survive for you. And I think you did say that health is wealth last what that what's important for me is my health.

783
01:29:56.850 --> 01:30:07.650
Richelle Direny: Being under someone's regime. I'm going to say it like that, where they're telling you, you got to get up, you got to do this. You got to do that. You got to and if you're not meeting their criteria they put this added stress on you, you

784
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.880
Melonie Powers: Get fired again.

785
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.560
Richelle Direny: You get fired again.

786
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:11.340
Richelle Direny: So you have

787
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.240
Richelle Direny: Because

788
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:15.600
Richelle Direny: That kind of stress is my i can handle.

789
01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:25.140
Richelle Direny: I can't handle someone telling me to do A, B, and C where I know mentally, physically, I'm not able to do that, you have back pain.

790
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:38.040
Richelle Direny: You're working at a job. It's requiring you to be physical and you know that's going to aggravate your back pain. So then, therefore, I can do it. So if for right until you have to make that conscious decision to say

791
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:50.190
Richelle Direny: If being my own contractor me picking and choosing the jobs that I can based on my physical structure based on my health based on my mental capacity based on everything that's going on with me.

792
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:59.280
Richelle Direny: If I can if I can pick and choose the job to do and this is how much I'm going to make in a day. I have to be okay with it if it means that

793
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.030
Melonie Powers: choosy and

794
01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:03.960
Melonie Powers: I'm not okay with it. I mean, I'm not okay with why me now.

Melonie Powers: For as long as on and one will go

797
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:16.410
Richelle Direny: And so, if so, like you said, in this time. But when I say be okay with it be okay with it for right now.

798
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:18.750
Melonie Powers: Be okay my entire life.

799
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:30.570
Melonie Powers: I'm going to be 47 a month and I will get things like I've been paying into your system into unemployment and so all of this stuff like so for me right now. I have your results.

800
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:39.960
Melonie Powers: Because, am I going to work the system a little bit. Yeah, but I qualify under the law.

801
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:41.850

Richelle Direny: But don't don't feel

804
01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.180
Melonie Powers: Like you feel guilty.

805
01:31:49.230 --> 01:32:05.160
Melonie Powers: Obviously I do I, because I know. So being people are hurting and and it's not like I'm not out of it. Because if I don't get this money or get a job or however it works out. I don't want my teeth, and I won't live that way I want. I'm not

806
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:22.740
Melonie Powers: I think you know enough to be right about now you see me like I feel about it. No, it takes two seconds for me to go boom, I hate. I like it. I'm done. And it's not even a joke because I just go down hard and

807
01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:35.970
Melonie Powers: When I feel ugly, especially, and it's not just getting older, or if you mean it's just the values my teeth. That's a fundamental structure of my say hey,

808
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.660
Richelle Direny: I hear you.

809
01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:47.400
Melonie Powers: I hear you know, things like that. And, you know, to have to do my groups and things, those are those are requirements that are put on now. I never had to do any of that.

810
01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.980
Melonie Powers: Or and no

811
01:32:51.030 --> 01:33:00.180
Melonie Powers: I mean, I always as the counseling for myself, because I've been through so much, but I never had these requirements and no you know I have to follow them.

812
01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:12.300
Melonie Powers: In order to keep myself able to function you. It's just so but I still feel bad because people out there. It can't be. It can't eat it.

813
01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.100
Melonie Powers: But this is my

814
01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:24.240
Richelle Direny: Question to you. Wow, it's so it's just saying to you, Melanie that despite everything you've gone through despite how you feel about yourself and your circumstances.

815
01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:34.020
Richelle Direny: It's just showing that I'm human, and I still feel for other people. But right now, what's important is me. What's important is where I am today.

816
01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.950
Melonie Powers: What's enough for me, which I think is kind of a cool thing.

817
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:42.090
Melonie Powers: Because I've never, I've never really been I'm not, you know,

818
01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:56.910
Melonie Powers: You don't kill yourself when you feel bored intervene, like so, for me to be taking care of myself making the appointments growing to be on top of it. You know, everybody can make them.

819
01:33:58.290 --> 01:33:58.770
Richelle Direny: Because I've got

820
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:59.430

Richelle Direny: We just had

823
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:10.650

827
01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:24.990
Richelle Direny: And and and so basking that in even if you get emotional.

828
01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:33.390
Richelle Direny: Make it be joyful because it is a new step for you. You've come along, you've come a long way since we've been together.

829
01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:39.810
Richelle Direny: And just us meeting right now I've ever seen you smile so much or chuckled so much at different things as you speak.

830
01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:57.030
Richelle Direny: So it's a new step for you and it's wonderful. Just stay focused on it. I do. Okay, I get there's people out there that suffering. But we know this is you, you were one of those people and you are, where you are right now and things are working for you and that's good. Just stay in that

Richelle Direny: You're having an itemized plan. I'm going to do A, B, C, D, E, F, G in this timeframe. You're following that structure stay on that path. It's okay.

833
01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:33.090
Richelle Direny: People are always going to be Rona or no Corona, people are always going to be suffering. People are always a world without suffering. I don't really know that about that we're all going to be

834
01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:44.160
Melonie Powers: There's this and I can say, I mean, you know, even when I was a domestic violence victim advocate. I guess I had a kind of a hard time in that job just

835
01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.190
Melonie Powers: People don't always want to hear. And it's not my job to always say he

836
01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:51.990
Melonie Powers: Is

837
01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:59.580
Melonie Powers: A lot, you know, it's very hard not to go oh hey I've got a new shoes, guess what you can get out of it.

838
01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.190
Melonie Powers: And then look where I'm at now.

839
01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:08.400
Melonie Powers: You know that's what kills me too, but I wasn't there for a while.

Richelle Direny: You know, and I

841
01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:19.680
Richelle Direny: And you weren't there for lunch. This is the third there's this thing I'm going to say it's an island saying because that's where everybody always heard it growing up.

842
01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.360
Richelle Direny: The same is

843
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:33.930
Richelle Direny: Today from me tomorrow for you, means that whatever sorrow that I'm good. What that you're going through today. That's your sorrow tomorrow. It may be mine.

844
01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:46.020
Richelle Direny: Your success today, tomorrow, it may be mine. You have your own thing going. You can't work because you know what other people, they have their day their day is coming

845
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:55.530
Richelle Direny: what that would look like and what the, what the depth of it or whatever their day is coming. Just today. Hey, I might be successful today.

846
01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:07.800
Richelle Direny: Tomorrow, you may access. So your joy, my joy today your sadness today might be my sadness tomorrow, your joy, tomorrow you understand what's that it's always going to flip

847
01:37:08.010 --> 01:37:18.510
Melonie Powers: I did. And I'm not guaranteed either anything. You know, like they could say, you know, whatever is going on in that system or, you know, I don't know, they could come back and throw me out. I'm not getting another dollar

848
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.700
Richelle Direny: Why

849
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.840
Melonie Powers: I think they're gonna

850
01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:22.890
Richelle Direny: Take it.

851
01:37:24.210 --> 01:37:24.450
Melonie Powers: But

852
01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:37.320
Richelle Direny: Either way, and that's kind of like, and this is what we've talked about over time. It's kind of like your, your way of taking something in like turning it negative. Right now you're on a positive path. I want you to stay on that path.

853
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:39.660
Melonie Powers: Oh, yes. Thank you. I'm just like,

854
01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:44.520
Melonie Powers: Anything that's not there, but I know

855
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:45.390
Richelle Direny: You always

856
01:37:47.130 --> 01:37:48.360
Melonie Powers: Want to pay for

857
01:37:49.890 --> 01:38:04.710
Richelle Direny: It. I do have this unique way of just jumping right into the negative pool, but just kind of stay right where you are in general if today if you hundred dollars today and today is the only day, you're going to get $600 listen, be happy about it.

858
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.380
Melonie Powers: Because you have more than I had

859
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:09.900
Richelle Direny: It's more than you had yesterday.

860
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.570
Melonie Powers: Etc. And it all.

861
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.090
Melonie Powers: Looks good, and

862
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:16.770
Melonie Powers: You have to pay it.

863
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:18.510
Richelle Direny: Exactly.

864
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:19.800
Melonie Powers: And then right away.

865
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:31.650
Richelle Direny: There you go. You were saving up for your 1200 dollars to go get a tooth removed. They helped you out. They jumpstart you 600. Now, you could go get your tooth remote. He said, I'm saying you can you get your smile back

866
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:41.520
Richelle Direny: It's just being happy in the moment. Staying focus not thinking that it's selfish to just think about yourself because you know what we all need to think about ourselves.

867
01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:51.120
Richelle Direny: Because we all need to take care of ourselves. That's what tears us down because we're so focused on other people. And what they're doing. They're thinking about themselves while you helping them think about them.

868
01:38:51.570 --> 01:39:01.800
Richelle Direny: It's saying, no, I need to think about myself. And that's what you're doing. So in everything that you're doing. Remember, maybe that's your, your model for right now.

869
01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:13.920
Richelle Direny: health is wealth. Your health is your wealth. What does that look like and that's what you follow. So if it's, you know, thinking about making all your appointments, your medical appointments, whatever it is that you're doing.

870
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:24.990
Richelle Direny: Even if it means you say hey we're show, you know what, with everything that I'm doing. Maybe we have to cut back and see each other once a month. That's your health is wealth, you're doing it all your health.

871
01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:27.210
Melonie Powers: I mean, I'm able to

872
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:32.880
Melonie Powers: That's that's the beauty of it. I can pick and choose, you know,

873
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:38.610
Melonie Powers: You have your choice. That's why I like it though. But I can't do it forever.

874
01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:40.440
Melonie Powers: Right now I can

875
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:52.380
Richelle Direny: That's what you hold on to. You do it until you can't do it anymore. You keep submitting those information to the government. They keep giving you $600 on until they say Melanie, you won't get it no more.

876
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.920
Richelle Direny: And that's all you can do work with what you have right now work what you have today. Okay.

877
01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.050
