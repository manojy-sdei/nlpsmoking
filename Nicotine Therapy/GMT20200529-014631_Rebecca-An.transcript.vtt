00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:39.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, was what happened, what's been happening and you're not the first person that it's happened to I think there was an update in zoom or something because

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll come in my waiting room, and then I'll click on for you to join and then you'll show up two and three times in my waiting room but it won't let you join

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.550
Moyocoyotzin: Well,

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's kind of what was going on and can. Okay.

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cool. All right. Yeah, he just responded to me and told me that he told you to fix the zoom

16
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.030
Moyocoyotzin: Right, yeah. We just talked to me about a minute ago or so.

17
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.290
Perfect.

18
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, how's your week has been your week

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.770
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.050
Moyocoyotzin: But I'm good, how are you doing

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.640
Moyocoyotzin: The problems we got

29
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want to ask you, do you have a pair of headphones and can you go in a room where you're by yourself.

30
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.820
Moyocoyotzin: I got headphones in the car and they're in the car.

31
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're just supposed to be doing this.

32
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.280
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

33
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you're tired, you probably had a really long day.

34
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.740
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, we have a lot of funerals today.

35
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh gosh, really.

36
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.350
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, yeah, we have funerals every day.

37
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.260
Moyocoyotzin: Read like 60 day

38
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

39
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.180
Moyocoyotzin: Can you hear me. No, I'm not hearing the amount of here by myself. No.

40
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

41
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me how things are going. I don't want you to the reason why. First off, this is a therapy session. And if if we were person to person, you would be in my office with the door shut. Just you and I, right, and a half to kind of be the same way with Tele therapy to

42
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.690
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, I was in the bedroom, I just got out of the shower.

43
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

44
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me,

45
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.080
How your week has been over

46
00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.140
Moyocoyotzin: We're good. I went in and talked to her about that that day last week when we had that she got all mad.

47
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.290
Moyocoyotzin: We ended up fighting, but

48
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.610
Moyocoyotzin: But she's like that. I don't know. I mean,

49
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How did you approach it. Did you use the tools that I gave you to try to

50
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Present it in a manner that huh

51
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.880
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, I tried you know i mean i did all that I

52
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:34.440
Moyocoyotzin: Still getting mad. You know, I mean, but she gets gets mad right away. So, you know, she got what she got in her head and whatever I tell. I think it'll never get it out of her head. You know, I mean,

53
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I

54
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember those remember Joe that you know if it's if you admit to what you did do.

55
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But not to what you didn't do.

56
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It don't do it, don't do it in an aggressive manner.

57
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do it in a very it from a very complex because you have nothing to defend

58
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.470
Right.

59
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:05.940
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, you know, I end up getting mad because she just keeps on on the same thing and I end up getting frustrated. I get mad and then she started, I got some to hide and

60
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:15.510
Moyocoyotzin: No, because like I told I tell her all the time. I ain't gonna tell you something. I met enough to tell you, I had a pair with her and fucked or whatever, I would tell her. Yeah, I mean, but

61
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.900
Moyocoyotzin: For happened and I ain't gonna cop to something I didn't do

62
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I mean, right, right. And that's why I'm saying a part of what makes her continually feel that there's something wrong.

63
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right is the defense.

64
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So if you get rid of the defense.

65
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.170
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

66
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get rid of the defense.

67
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just get rid of the defense and say,

68
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you're right. I, you know, this is what I did do.

69
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This isn't what I did. I didn't do this, I'm really, really sorry that you're struggling with that right now and let her own it, but validate her feelings.

70
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And don't get upset.

71
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Don't get upset because you didn't do what she thinks that you did, but

72
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anybody in that same position, any, any woman would go to that same place.

73
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It must have happened. It had to have happen and we convince ourselves outside the truth and so that always is us. It's like being stuck on something that you can't get off of

74
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.940
Moyocoyotzin: Right, and that's

75
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:33.930
Moyocoyotzin: And that's where she's at a bakery. I mean, I can get her because we will, you know, she wants to talk, she tells me she you know she wants to talk. We want to talk

76
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:43.140
Moyocoyotzin: And, uh, but we'll talk up to that point. And then we just stay stuck there. We won't get past it. And I tried talent or yeah I mean we got to get passes or

77
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:56.430
Moyocoyotzin: Or, you know, it's never going to work. I mean, you gotta you know I get it, I heard her and everything, but you know if she's going to keep on on that it's going to ruin our relationship even more. Yeah, I mean, and we want to get away aware

78
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.480
Moyocoyotzin: And that's, that's where I feel

79
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.810
Moyocoyotzin: You know it's going, I don't know. Yeah, I mean,

80
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.560
Moyocoyotzin: I love Joanna and everything, but

81
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.870
Moyocoyotzin: You could only take so much. I mean I he always accuses me of stuff like that. And I don't know where in the hell. She gets it from you. I'm saying

82
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.830
Yeah.

83
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, again, if you didn't do it, then you have nothing to defend

84
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:29.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So don't allow don't allow your anger to be a part of your response.

85
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.080
Moyocoyotzin: Right.

86
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can always you know what I mean, you can always say, I think that we need to stop talking about this right now and take a break.

87
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I feel myself getting irritated and

88
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want to fight with you. I love you.

89
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.130
Moyocoyotzin: All I do that all the time and backup. But then we just she just keeps on

90
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.260
Moyocoyotzin: Getting

91
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.990
Moyocoyotzin: You know, we've been doing this for almost a year now I say

92
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.790
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, so

93
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you guys thought about going into therapy together.

94
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.150
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, we did that. We went to marriage counseling for a little bit and

95
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:23.880
Moyocoyotzin: You know, we, when we first women went in there. We talked to the guy together. I forget his name, but, and then I had maybe five, six meetings with him alone. And she did to me.

96
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:37.830
Moyocoyotzin: That's all he wanted it. We're doing it like that. But, you know, nothing, nothing changed. I mean it didn't, you know, she just went on the same thing all the time. Yeah. I mean, so

97
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stuck on that.

98
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.930
Moyocoyotzin: Yeah, she stuck on the

99
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.950
Moyocoyotzin: I don't know. You know what he said to her, or how he helped her

100
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Obviously he didn't help her process through it, or she would be

101
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know healed from it. So,

102
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's another. Go ahead.

103
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:16.590
Moyocoyotzin: And join us. She's. She's a, she's diagnosed with bipolar and you know I mean she's, she's been through a lot in her life. I get it. You know, I mean, you know, we all got a pass. I don't judge her for passing she'd been married. I'm or Todd's been, you know, I mean,

104
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.260
Moyocoyotzin: It is what it is.

105
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry.

106
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what, I can, you know, teach you is how to keep your side of the street clean and how to keep your anger in check so that you know what I mean, you don't lash out and break your phone again and can't come to therapy.

107
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.530
Moyocoyotzin: I'm gonna see if I give me more.

108
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I can't you know do anything about what she's going through

109
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, there's a piece of that, too, that, you know, maybe that's a piece that you should ask her.

110
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, why don't you think about going back into seeing a counselor for a little while and processing through it you know if your behaviors and what you're doing. Are you know completely opposite of

111
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:24.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything you know that would keep her in that state of mind like no matter what you say if your behaviors don't back up what you're telling her, then your words are useless. You know what I mean, that's

112
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:34.410
Moyocoyotzin: That's all I feel Rebecca you like I told you. We've been going through this for a while and we stuck at the same place, and

113
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:48.930
Moyocoyotzin: Then she tells me I can't even talk to you and you know it stays area. I mean, I try and try and tell her I love her. I mean, she would be good for a couple of days and then I don't know, something will trigger

114
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.680
Moyocoyotzin: You know, I mean, she goes on that.

115
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.310
Moyocoyotzin: Crazy.

116
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's an endless. See what happens when somebody is is experienced that experience that

117
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in their past.

118
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:15.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not once, not twice, but several times. And I'm assuming that she probably has experienced it throughout her FIVE MARRIAGES you know more than once. It's like

119
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our brain is like on it. Do you remember those eight reels that are that are like this.

120
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so it's broke

121
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's not connecting to the healing part. And so her being able to

122
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get into get into see somebody that

123
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can actually she can connect with

124
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To help her connect that piece and process through it.

125
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:56.490
Moyocoyotzin: Right, because she's a stubborn woman. I mean, uh, you know, I get it over an area, but I never did that. The but you know you know i i knew her purse has been here and he was locked up. I've known him for

126
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:11.340
Moyocoyotzin: More than 34 years I met him there in prison. Yeah. I mean, when I was already there. When he got there. And you know, I didn't know he was married her. I found out after this that that was her husband I when I met her. Yeah, I mean,

127
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.720
Moyocoyotzin: And he used to beat her up and all that, you know, I mean, and

128
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.150
Moyocoyotzin: She went through all that with him. They were married for like 11 years

129
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember that there's a lot of a lot of history underneath.

130
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What she's saying to you.

131
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not that she's just stuck there because of what you did. She stuck there because of a lot of experiences that she's experienced in the past to

132
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:44.550
Moyocoyotzin: Exactly. I get it. I mean, you know, and that's what I try to tell her. Yeah, I mean we I know many of the same you know there's some

133
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440
Moyocoyotzin: Women all that

134
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.260
Moyocoyotzin: I you know I knew him.

135
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:59.910
Moyocoyotzin: And you know he think he was bad in there and all this bullshit and I come to find out he was out here, beating her up and all these boots, you know. It's crazy.

136
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.050
Yeah.

137
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.330
Moyocoyotzin: So,

138
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's all about how you you on your side of things about what you want the outcome to be, you know what I mean when you guys get into this conversation, you can't control her response or what she does, but you can control yours.

139
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.
