Richelle Direny: In terms of where you

Christine Campbell: Know it happens, rather than love

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.560
Richelle Direny: Then you never work a day in your life.

54
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.340
Right.

55
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.020

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.390

64
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.900
Yeah.

65
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.580
Richelle Direny: And when was the last time you went to, you didn't

66
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.780
Christine Campbell: Just a

67
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.000
Christine Campbell: Few days ago last week Friday.

68
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.060
Richelle Direny: And how was that in terms of

69
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.270
Christine Campbell: Dr. South. I don't even talk to

70
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.780
Christine Campbell: Like he's the one that you talk to me more. I think there's a lot of prescribed stuff, you know,

71
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.780
Christine Campbell: Matt, talk to the counselor every week, which he just changed out to two weeks, cuz I got what you guys go way too much.

72
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.670
Richelle Direny: Yes, me too. I

73
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.940
Christine Campbell: Do too much. I have that much to say.

74
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.400
Christine Campbell: But I saw her yesterday.

75
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.990
Christine Campbell: Well, every week who just change it to two weeks I'll probably go to month after that.

76
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.720
Richelle Direny: But do you did you tell them like exactly like if the medication is working for you.

77
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.530
Yeah.

78
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.970
Christine Campbell: Their medication for depression and ADHD.

79
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.340
Christine Campbell: That no

80
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.440
Christine Campbell: More depressed. These last few days ever. I never. I mean, I always was never really bothered me that much.

81
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.810
Christine Campbell: This bother me.

82
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.830
Christine Campbell: Like, really, is that you got to get out of this House.

83
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.590
Richelle Direny: And

84
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.180
Christine Campbell: That's what it is.

85
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.570
Richelle Direny: Listen, we

86
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:43.980
Richelle Direny: All need some type of outside activities like let me tell you, Christine. I don't want to be a lot because I figure

87
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:52.650
Richelle Direny: I really have a lot of melanin in my skin and I don't really need that much more. So, which means that I don't need to go to the beach and get

88
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.180
Richelle Direny: Burnt

89
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.200
Right.

90
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.700
Richelle Direny: And I started envisioning myself at the beach.

91
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.640
Richelle Direny: I need to do something.

92
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:15.480
Richelle Direny: My house and so they talked about their opening of the beaches, like, you know, allowing but then figuring out, like, how can you should wear a mask. First of all, if I go to the beach. I'm not wearing a mask, like that's like

93
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.650
Christine Campbell: A big old white

94
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.540
Richelle Direny: Like I'm pulling into the water and I have this over my nose like

95
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.600
Richelle Direny: Like I'm just asking for certification at that point.

96
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.710
Yeah.

97
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.410
Richelle Direny: It's just like you know your kids. I don't know if you know, Ohio, but I know

98
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.000
Christine Campbell: I would really be go, oh, I'd be in metal

99
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.800
Christine Campbell: Thank God I don't know how other people doing it. Oh my god.

100
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:50.340
Richelle Direny: I'm of course it doesn't, you know, it's not about saying that, of course, there's not a little screaming going on at some point throughout the day.

101
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.790
Richelle Direny: What do you to where you apply powerful

102
00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:05.490
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but it's, it's, um, it's just one of those things where now they're going to be in Florida. The kids are home for the rest of the school year.

103
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.800
Christine Campbell: Or two minor grown so I don't have to worry they just they cut it out for a year.

104
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:22.020
Richelle Direny: So they're they're homeschool for the rest of the year, but so now it's almost like you're really having to get creative of how you entertain them.

105
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:30.180
Richelle Direny: And so I thought it would be a great idea to go to the beach. But then, you know, there's some people who are a little bit nervous about the idea of going out.

106
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:31.590
Yeah.

107
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:32.790
Richelle Direny: You

108
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.530
Christine Campbell: Have like panic attacks like that writer will leave the house.

109
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.570
Christine Campbell: Stranger yeah oh yeah I will happen.

110
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:53.190
Richelle Direny: In the house. Like, what should they be doing, but um you know it is. No, it's kind of like a catch 22

111
00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:09.030
Richelle Direny: You like you said, you want to get out of house. You want to get work. You want to get money. You want to be able to, you know, yes. You want to do all of that, um, but then there's the other person who's saying like, no, why are we leaving the house because it's still this

112
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.810
And so that's

113
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.700
Christine Campbell: Okay.

114
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.800
Christine Campbell: All right, I'm sorry. Good.

115
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:14.610
Christine Campbell: Yeah.

116
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.520
Richelle Direny: So it's like a catch 22 it's like seeing it.

117
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.050
Richelle Direny: On both sides of a coin.

118
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:27.150
Richelle Direny: You know, some people they need to get out because they need to work. They need to be able, like I can, I can say

119
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:41.850
Richelle Direny: In all honesty, I can say, well, I mean, I don't know why they're letting people out. I don't know why they're allowing people to do this because I still work. So I could say whatever I want to say because even though I'm locked in my home. I'm still being able to generate some type of income.

120
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.920
Christine Campbell: So I don't think they should do it yet, but

121
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.420
Richelle Direny: But then this is the thing, it's for everybody. It's different.

122
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.260
Richelle Direny: It's like

123
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.300
Richelle Direny: The longer you stay home.

124
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.910
Christine Campbell: What do or I think brother get sick. If we don't

125
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.270
Richelle Direny: Want you don't know, then it's not in then. How long do you stay

126
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.640
Christine Campbell: home all the time.

127
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.720
Richelle Direny: But that's what I'm saying. You're, you're already home.

128
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.220
Christine Campbell: was worried about their money. That's what they're worried about

129
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.220
Christine Campbell: Dead.

130
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.290
Christine Campbell: You know,

131
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.160
Richelle Direny: But everybody everybody's cases very different, like I had

132
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.060
Christine Campbell: already added I did. I think we added

133
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.990
Richelle Direny: I mean, we probably all was exposed in some way, somehow, like

134
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.960
Christine Campbell: Right. Yes. German sub at all.

135
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.070
Richelle Direny: Do we have the strength or the we have the strain of the virus that they're talking

136
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.950
Christine Campbell: About I think we did, but

137
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.120
Richelle Direny: Like I was

138
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:45.060
Richelle Direny: talking to this guy earlier where, you know, I had to ask him some questions. And he said,

139
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:52.020
Richelle Direny: You know what, what would you do in the event like you end up in the hospital. Like, what is your plans like in terms of. Have you thought about

140
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:59.100
Richelle Direny: So you want to life sustaining treatments like what do you want to do. And so, you know, the first thing he said was

141
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:06.630
Richelle Direny: You know, they, you would want them to at least try to do something. But no, you know, take that back. He said,

142
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:22.770
Richelle Direny: You know, well they tell you about all these people dying, but then what about all these people who they said that they were knocking knocking at the door, but then they kind of pretty much they came out of it. They're out of the hospital and they're fine. So, so then so

143
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.650
Christine Campbell: They don't know if everybody

144
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.220
Christine Campbell: Okay.

145
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:37.680
Richelle Direny: But then the spouse turned around and says, BUT THEN YOU THE PEOPLE WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT your age group with COPD. So you have to take that into consideration.

146
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.310
Christine Campbell: We are

147
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.860
Christine Campbell: Have asthma or both 54

148
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.330
Richelle Direny: No, no. But I'm talking about this guy. What was his wife was saying to him.

149
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.610
Richelle Direny: The wife was saying to him.

150
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:59.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, looking at these people who are getting up and walking out of the hospital. But keep in mind, they may not be your agent. He was in his 80s.

151
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.450
Christine Campbell: Buddy differently. Anyway, always will know

152
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.650
Richelle Direny: It all and that's like that's the point you have to take your individual

153
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:15.060
Richelle Direny: Situations, and in look at your individual because you can be your age and walk away. Fine. And I can

154
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.370
Richelle Direny: I can perish.

155
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:24.090
Richelle Direny: Right situation is very different. So you have to look at your own unique situation and make a

156
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:40.980
Richelle Direny: Very informed decision. Um, you know, just kind of know where you are, where everything is concerned. But in the meantime, trying to maintain your own mental health, and that's what you have to do. Just stay focused on your own mental health.

157
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.730
Richelle Direny: You're in a bit, your ability to get through it at some point and not

158
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.310
Richelle Direny: allow fear to

159
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.150
Richelle Direny: Be your you know what what is what the next thing that you do.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.610
Richelle Direny: So here it is, I have

162
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.620
Richelle Direny: For you able to set an alarm.

163
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.280
Richelle Direny: To complete at least one task per day.

164
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.180
Oh,

165
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.180
Christine Campbell: No, because I forgot.

166
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.600
Richelle Direny: You were on the phone. You set the alarm.

167
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:25.020
Christine Campbell: Yeah, I talk a good game. I hate you up with you and I forget all every day.

168
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.670
Richelle Direny: You were talking about. And so do you understand why we were, um, why we have that as a goal.

169
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.520
Christine Campbell: To get depressed. No, I don't know why.

170
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.770
Richelle Direny: Of course you know why you just said it.

171
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.250
Christine Campbell: Yeah, okay. Yeah. And I'm depressed.

172
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.060
Richelle Direny: Depressed because you want to get out the house.

173
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.590
Richelle Direny: So what is it that

174
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.050
Richelle Direny: You would arm.

175
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.370
Richelle Direny: What stops you from being able to complete this task.

176
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.990
Christine Campbell: Just don't want to do nothing.

177
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.270
Christine Campbell: Done.

178
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.910
Richelle Direny: Completely agree with that.

179
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.520
Christine Campbell: I don't want to do something. I'm just not doing it, that's all. There's to it.

180
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.570
Christine Campbell: I mean I'm watching my head, but my body's like you know

181
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.800
Christine Campbell: In all reality and I know you're not going to do it.

182
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.220
Richelle Direny: Well what stops you from putting in the alarm, because it's one thing to one and get out

183
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.320
Right, yeah.

184
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.200
Richelle Direny: So, okay, what would have been

185
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.220
Christine Campbell: I forgot I just reminded me of it.

186
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:46.890
Richelle Direny: Okay, so if we put in there. Why are you on the phone with me now. You put in that task. What is the one task that you can see yourself completing a day.

187
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.150
Richelle Direny: What about did you did you get up and make a meal with your husband and have it with him.

Christine Campbell: Couple times a week.

190
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.090
Richelle Direny: Let me ask you this. If

191
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:25.170
Richelle Direny: Said it from getting. But just having the motivation and the willingness to get up and get things done or get something done. Um, what would be your motivator to get up to go to work every day.

192
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.150
Christine Campbell: Money.

193
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:35.310
Richelle Direny: Would you be really motivated to get up to go to work every because remember when a person has no energy. They're really depressed.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.720
Christine Campbell: Yeah, I know.

195

Christine Campbell: Money, money, I guess oil.

197
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.610
Richelle Direny: Money will be your motivator to get up every day.

198
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.080
Christine Campbell: Always a motivator.

199
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.340
Richelle Direny: Yeah. How long was the last time you worked

200
00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.340
Christine Campbell: Uber for months.

201
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.170
Richelle Direny: That's right. You had started a little job and then it didn't work out.

202
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.450
Christine Campbell: Yeah, I liked it too. And five, a job. I like just by loving. Oh.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.620
Christine Campbell: Out of this funk. I'm not gonna do anything.

211
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.310
Christine Campbell: The sun coming up makes a big difference.

212
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.860
Richelle Direny: Okay, so that's the weather.

213
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.260

214
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.560
Richelle Direny: Do you think the weather aids to you.

215
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.840

Christine Campbell: Yeah, not like it.

230
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.880

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.270
Christine Campbell: Yeah, that's fine.

249
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:27.750
Richelle Direny: Are you motivated to go out. I mean, do you live where you live. Is there like a yard or something like that, where you can go

250
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.370

Christine Campbell: Your last doors. I grew up outdoors. I love it. But I just, you know,

255
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.060
Richelle Direny: They have the motivation.

256
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.960
Right.

257
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.870
Richelle Direny: Now I know you said you want to be able to come out of the

258
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.060
Richelle Direny: This mode of depression.

259
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.070
Christine Campbell: But

260
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:13.110
Richelle Direny: What's key. What, what makes you feel depressed outside, outside of you've identified one thing. What is something else.

261
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:20.040
Richelle Direny: That's making you feel depressed today outside the weather. But now you said it's really sunny outside
