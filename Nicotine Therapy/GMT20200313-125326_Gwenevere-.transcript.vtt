Gwenevere Abriel: Take that email that you sent and forward it to me with

149
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.800
Jay: His new

150
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, his email, you can even include him in it. You can see see him, and you can sort of see this conversation started this morning. You know what I mean.

151
00:17:46.770 --> 00:18:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can kind of see that you you've been working on that. Okay. And you can always say, Listen, you know, bright heart needed to get released for information and then, you know, the reality is, Jay. I wanted to see if you would continue to attend services before I wrote the letter.

152
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Access

153
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, come on. I want to be able to say something positive that you're showing up for him. You doing what you need to do. And, you know, you really are even showed up when you're sec

154
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's recorded to

155
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Real I'm seeing chunks. Okay, there goes this breakfast, you must be losing a lot of weight.

156
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.220
Jay: Bad yeah this was a lot of lost about 20 pounds.

157
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, not not healthy. We need you guys Healthy. Healthy. Healthy

158
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Way hoping figure out what's going on with that. Okay, what am I doing again I've checked that have written a letter. I'm just going to track down my signature and you're the end there. I'm just gonna write a signature.

159
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.810
Now let's get into

160
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.640
Freezing

161
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.460
Jay: Cold

162
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I turned up the air.

163
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I need it too cold.

164
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me get into note for you.

165
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I actually want to see the card.

166
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Western ration. Oh, it's probation, parole officer. Okay. Yeah.

167
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.150
Alright, so

168
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.220
Too far away.

169
00:19:51.960 --> 00:20:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: nosing around. Have you had a chance. Let's say someone irritated you in the family. Someone irritated. You work, I think, are one in the same thing.

170
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had an opportunity to remember

171
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, let me use this bottom up emotional regulation technique of belly breathing. Have you remembered it.

172
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it

173
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's usually the first is of them being able to use it. We've got to be able to remember it first. So it is going to be

174
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: An important regulation piece for you. So we'll just go

175
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: For a minute and talk about kind of what this last week was like, I mean, let me into your world a little bit. I don't even know if your life is a roller coaster. If it's just this even keel. Everything's very predictable, or is there just chaos and

176
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what it's like being yo

177
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.700
Jay: Oh well right now, everything's pretty slow.

178
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.600
Jay: It's the first time I've gotten sober in a long time.

179
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.490
Jay: And

180
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:20.730
Jay: I don't know. I got physical therapy twice a week, my livers not doing too good. I kind of feel like, you know, I stopped doing drugs, but now my hell's going on.

181
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, well it right

182
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You stop doing drugs and health is going down, stop doing drugs isn't the cause of health going down the starting of the drugs is the health going down the problem. You see it live. You gotta be careful what we're saying to ourselves.

183
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is what you're telling me you're starting to have some feelings about the implications of that history of substance use you starting to think about it and it's

184
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What do you think about. Let me hear how your thought process.

185
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:07.170
Jay: Sometimes I try to justify to myself that I could use again and I'll get caught, and I'm just really proud of myself for not listening to my show.

186
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and

187
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you're saying that listening to myself, you've been, I think, you tell me, have you been hearing me talk about the distinction

188
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In group and an individual therapy. I don't know what I've taught you yet. What I haven't around, there's sort of two selves. The voice of the addict, the bullshit or the liar, the con artists.

189
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right DRUG DEALER, THE WHOLE DEAL. Right. The one that will lie, cheat, steal, to get that

190
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's you

191
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's you. The, the authentic self as you is Jay. So if you can

192
00:22:52.350 --> 00:23:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're catching the thoughts of justification. Hey, listen, we can do it once. Come on, we're good at this with it once ain't gonna hurt anyone. That's the addict. That's the voice of the addict. That's not your true self. That's not the one that that cares about

193
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That those drugs have made you no doesn't care about you only cares about hijacking whenever you're feeling miserable. It's like he's miserable. This is great. This is how I get in. This is how I get to him if he's feeling ashamed. That's how I get to him.

194
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: He just doesn't want to be himself.

195
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got leverage to get him to go use. That's all I care about.

196
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not a voice that I want you to hear and over time. I'm hoping you'll hear it less and less and that your argument back because you said I didn't listen, I heard you say that just now. I didn't listen

197
00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So it says to you, you can go yes you'll feel better. How does it sound. Tell me, how does the voice sound in your head.

198
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.890
Jay: Yeah, I mean, you know, whenever I go get high on my pain goes away.

199
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:25.740
Jay: But that's, I mean, that's just the quick fix for what's going on right now. The long run issue destroyed my life.

200
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

201
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, I'm going to circle back to this inner dialogue, you have because, first I want to just do a little fact check

202
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The attic says

203
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be sick.

204
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about that because that part. I don't understand how is it that a heroin or percocet will help you not be sick like

205
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what I'm trying to get out.

206
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.640
Jay: Yeah.

207
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.530
Because the Suboxone

208
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't even stickier opiate receptor, you know, we've got these little receptors. HERE ARE SHORT ACTING opiate stays on there. What I mean how often you have to get another fix every few hours or what

209
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: POP RIGHT OFF.

210
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But these the buprenorphine. That's why it can last right it's a long acting treatment for cancer patients right it's taken once a day, so it sits on these opiate receptors in it, it hangs on all day doesn't want to come off sticky stays on there.

211
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's long acting that's

212
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Great because you don't have to be out hustling and for me as your behavioral therapist right I'm thrilled because it means that three or four times a day when you were having to go chase after that call off from work, lot of people make excuses be scheming on how you're going to score.

213
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be doing that you'll take it once a day, you'll take it and then you'll be left with you dealing with you.

214
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That habit of

215
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, going and chasing that won't be there. That's what I like about it. There are doctors and I think Dr. Solomon is one of them that still has his, his clients taking doses three times a day, twice a day.

216
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's something I'm going to want to continue to explore with you. I work with Dr. Aubrey Ellen. She doesn't do that.

217
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And this way we get to really find out what the true doses. So the full dose gets in your bloodstream. And I'm wondering if that's part of why you're throwing up is you're not getting the full dose in your bloodstream. Anyway, very complicated. I can't overstep

218
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're being treated by Dr. Solomon so

219
00:26:51.030 --> 00:27:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But I have been working with Dr Arielle for over it'll be three years in June and her way. I don't hear this stuff here describing

220
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.280
Do you know

221
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm zeroing in on this sick thing. I'm just wondering if you're getting enough of the buprenorphine. I'm wondering if you have some so you take you take your Santos, or whatever the that is a doctor ready or whatever. And you've still got

222
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Even a couple receptors going, Hey, I'm going to make you sick. If you don't dumb a right, gimme, gimme. So what I don't know is what's kind of that chemical chemistry that's going on.

223
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's between you and your doctor.

224
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just wanted to throw that out there that there is a real difference in the way I'm watching these, these two doctors dispense the medicine.

225
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you want to explore that with your doctor and say, Hey, I'm wondering, what if I took the full dose in the beginning of the day, what would happen.

226
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's something you've ever try

227
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or do you already know.

228
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't done it. Okay, how many milligrams, you're spreading out throughout the day.

229
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.200
Jay: I take an eight in the morning and anything that

230
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You do realize you're not getting the 16, which is what you need in your bloodstream. Right. You're never you're never filling these receptors.

231
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.380
Jay: I thought that that would be too much.

232
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so watch how exciting. Would it be that it is probably way too much.

233
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. That's what happens. So then, so that's that's a great point you just made. So what ends up happening is

234
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You take the

235
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are like

236
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, zombie right you're so fatigued, then you say your doctor 16 is too much.

237
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you find out it really isn't 16

238
00:28:53.220 --> 00:29:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't 16 that's not the amount that needs to be in your bloodstream and so guess what later on when you and I kind of work it out. We say, okay, you've got enough coping skills you're really able to sort of

239
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Address negative emotions on your own, you're reaching out to healthy support you have emotional regulation skills you've got some healthy

240
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Healthy cognitive reframes and then we say, Okay, let's go for it. Let's, let's come down maybe half a milligram

241
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: For the next two weeks, meaning. Let's do every day for two weeks and see how you feel, let's say,

242
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an a predictable way things kind of go but but that's a great point you just made that would be too much yeah 16 would be too much so.

243
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not a go do it thing. This is a you gotta work this out with your doctor if this is something you want to do, but I'm going to tell you as your therapist, the fact that you are still taking a substance twice a day reinforces the addict behavior.

244
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It continues to habituate this thing where we're taking something

245
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want is few of those as possible. And the nice thing about the morning is we do a lot of water ritual in the morning. I mean, like, of all the things we do. Right, good grief so many things to do in the morning list List, list. And that's just another one of them.

246
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's something about in the evening that it's a bit more like self medication.

247
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. So I just, I just want to kind of share my thoughts around that, that it's that much more difficult for us working on the treatment goals that have to do with eventually having a life that substance free

248
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict loves it, that you're, you're still having that behavior that routine of reaching for something outside yourself it loves it. I don't

249
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm I'm on Jay side I'm on the side that you can do this that we can build up the skills will work through trauma history if you decided to do that and

250
00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Get your life back or maybe figure out who you are, maybe for the first time, and I think that'd be pretty neat because a lot of people when you've had this kind of you've had so much

251
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: disruption in your development. It's called kind of complex trauma developmental trauma that you may when I say who is Jay, you might be like Fuck a vinyl

252
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway, I just thought I'd share have a strong opinion about things, but I'm also at the same time, I have to accept it, you know, everybody's treating approaches. It's a little different.

253
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's say, first thing we notice is Jay didn't remember

254
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you also didn't remember that you are hurling chunks that morning, either. So what I'm wondering is if there's a negative association that's now linked with that belly breathing because you were throwing up. So that's an unfortunate organic

255
00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Offering conditioning. This just happens that's inconvenient. I want you to have a positive experience so that it's not, you know, so that you can actually remember it.

256
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that. I'll go over that again today. I'm afraid to start throwing up again on me.

257
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll find another time.

258
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, um, that's what I call an all do a lot of repetition and be like a broken record, but you'll start to get familiar with some of the terminology that's a bottom up intervention means we're working with the viscera your organs.

259
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The Vegas nerve to send a signal up to the brain that you're in a calm, relaxed body that was a bottom up intervention, maybe this morning, we can work on a top down.

260
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's like your thoughts. We can go in here. So let's circle back to this you know that inner voice that you had the addict. The one that said

261
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be sick.

262
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear some information just now that maybe there's more information that you maybe need around feeling sick.

263
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:01.860
Jay: Yeah.

264
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:10.590
Jay: I don't know. I wish I could find out what it was. It started before I got on this program.

265
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it sounds like its associated maybe with some of the other conditions that you've developed

266
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:18.930
But

267
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you throwing up like that when you were taking heroin, you were, you were taking heroin or doing heroin. At one point, right, yeah.

268
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll just say the short acting opiate

269
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you throwing up into and not dope sick.

270
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you were not

271
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

272
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But she did say just now. I was, I had this before I was on buprenorphine. You said that right before so

273
00:33:52.980 --> 00:34:08.370
Jay: Yes, I went in, I got an ultrasound of my liver and they did a blood test because they were concerned. They're scoring on my liver and they're thinking that that's what's making me sick. I got to see a gastroenterologist and the head speech specialist

274
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.810
Jay: In May may well be.

275
00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, if I, if

276
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if you're having a conversation with the addict. What do you say back to him when he says, You weren't sick when you were on heroin.

277
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.870
Jay: What did I, or what do I now but

278
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you say one

279
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.630
Jay: Medical i don't know i don't know i don't know myself.

280
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So cute. Oh, you're going to do some really good things in here and I can see

281
00:34:49.410 --> 00:35:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That and I can see that you doing it anyway. You still talking to yourself. There's. Think of it as a thought. It's just a thought you have opposite thoughts go use don't use all I do is make it

282
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I give it label, I give it a label SOMEONE ELSE COULD SAY, I'M negative thought and unloving side doesn't matter what we label things

283
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Call this a pretzel. I'm still going to write with it and it's gonna be the same color.

284
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Call this the salt you call it what you want. I'm going to write with it. Am I going to eat it.

285
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a label. We don't want to get too hung up on that. It's just, it gives you an eye, a language to flow and communicate so I can see my note that I actually introduced this to you last week. But again, it makes me think that maybe you were in so much distress and maybe some other

286
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Possible.

287
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just kind of. Yes, ma'am. And me. Yes, ma'am, yes ma'am, I just can't get through this.

288
00:35:48.840 --> 00:36:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: First time. Okay. So yeah, I do some pop quizzes, just see if people are actually listening. All right. Um, but I do really strongly believe in this, it's, it's a pretty neat thing because and you'll recognize it and group to when when people will say, yeah, they my attic voice was like

289
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Was coming up and I countered it with, you know, you gave me this disease. You gave me Pepsi you sob like you. You can't be polite to the attic.

290
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

291
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And

292
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes you'll even see me do a role play where a whole half of the group will be arguing one side and and the other group of people will be, you know, the authentic loving

293
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of ourselves and there'll be this whole argument, back and forth. And you'll hear people be so nice and polite to be added. Oh, I'm just timing isn't good right now. Come back later.

294
00:36:48.510 --> 00:37:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back later. No, we need to be nasty firm and clear with that voice. Get out of here. Now y'all want to be all nice. You know what you do when you're nice to that voice again you leave the door open.

295
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no. I know this is new to you. But the more I talk about it, the more you will think it's quite so silly. Maybe they'll feel more like fun, and it's more, you know, it doesn't have to be this heavy

296
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Drama thing it can be kind of light hearted, you know, people tend to absorb information more readily over not disgusted by something when we're not repulsed by it. So I like to include some playfulness. Okay.

297
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me. Um, let's see, we've got no pain. Alright, so what you were saying. Also, one of the points that the addict inside of you. You're out of voice was making was you won't feel pain and you won't be sick. Those were it's too powerful, wait, come on, come over here the dark side and

298
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about. There's no pain.

299
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:15.780
Jay: Um, I was in a motorcycle accident when I was younger and I twisted my spine and I've been having problems with it all my life in 2013 I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that's when it really started hitting my back.

300
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.220
Okay.

301
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So, is this how much pain are you in today. Let's say from zero to 10

302
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.420
Jay: I'm usually between six and an eight day

303
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you were

304
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: using heroin and this is the tricky bit

305
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you are functional or laid out in bed using where you have real functioning where you actually go into work. Okay.

306
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And what was your pain then

307
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.810
Jay: I mean, we go down to three, four.

308
00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:05.850
Jay: Was so bad. Sometimes, it wouldn't be a hero what that was for maybe an hour mode.

309
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can see why this is seductive. I can see why this voice is seductive, and it's got your attention.

310
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But did you notice that conversation I had earlier that you might not be getting enough of the analgesia in your bloodstream.

311
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.330
Jay: With me

312
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: analgesia is a term. It's a pain reliever. I'll pull it up to you and see you don't think I'm making it up.

313
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if I spell it. But I just say

314
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheese sick, she's sick.

315
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Friend North mean

316
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.020
Okay.

317
00:39:53.940 --> 00:40:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So buprenorphine was introduced in the early 1980s as an opioid analgesics in Europe and subsequently for the treatment of opioid addiction in France in 1980s fixes will us

318
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For the trivia know opioid addiction maintenance program you're kind of in your you're in one of those

319
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And for the treatment of chronic pain.

320
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just the word analgesic

321
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Good for us to know what we're doing right

322
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.280
Definition

323
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: analgesic. Let's see what they got definition by Webster Merriam Webster an agent introducing diminish sensation to pain without loss of consciousness, like drug that is used to relieve pain and produce analgesia opioid analgesics so

324
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Aspirin acetaminophen opioids.

325
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Well for you. It is an amazing

326
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Invention. I mean, right. It's been around for a long time, but

327
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a powerful pain relief.

328
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have a wicked combination

329
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you see that it isn't just when I hack away at the underlying emotional distress and coping skills. We're also going to be having to add pain management techniques.

330
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And

331
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to think you might not be getting enough buprenorphine in your system.

332
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Because an eight really high in pain. Now there's another just to add even more complexity to this.

333
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This was really going to blow your mind.

334
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if I can spell hyper analgesia. But I'm going to try

335
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is just all about education. I guess one

336
00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Other great words to know

337
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi for allergies.

338
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:04.710
Jay: Good.

339
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.620
Jay: I am a junior

340
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This is another word here. I don't know if this is the best spot for them to see what they got here.

341
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, look at this. This is going to blow your mind. Look at this.

342
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hyper algae's. Yes. So you already know that Jesus is like the ability to relieve pain right we just covered analgesic. That's an opioid that's a Tylenol acetaminophen Piper LG Xia hyper Jesus because a conditional our person development increase sensitivity to pain.

343
00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean come on what may hurt most people can cause significant in individual hyperplasia.

344
00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: See what this one says, can be very difficult for a doctor to diagnose different types of it exists. Doctors have a variety of theories regarding white people experience it. Researchers are also studying and potential genetic link closely resembles both drug tolerance and drug withdrawals.

345
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this one doesn't, then I just see, there are several nerve or pain pathways in the body where signals can start to miss communicate with each other as I, resulting in this condition.

346
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Some scientists think that this occurs when chemicals known through this pain. Hello opioid are disrupted and there are others.

347
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this is like as if you don't have it bad enough, the short version of this, and you can look it up. But the short version. The one that I teach anyway. Is this

348
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry to say to those of you who have been taking opioids for a long time.

349
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It can literally make the pain worse.

350
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.870
Jay: And I know

351
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's mind boggling. I know. And so I don't know if you'll see and you'll read you'll read on your own. If you get curious about it.

352
00:43:55.650 --> 00:44:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of unknowns about it, but the theory that Dr. Ariel talks about anyway. Is this

353
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: My original pain was here I broken wrist. I'm making it up. But you can see this part of my body. I want to show my foot is too hard and not that flexible so

354
00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If my pains here when I originally broke my wrist. It got the signal. Yeah. You know, you got a signal to the brain, there's pain here. Now the injury I I kept taking opiates and I took it too long. I like for me. I use it for the wrong reason. What of what of what of

355
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And now there's no new injury. There's no new injuries healed. It's, it's two years later.

356
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no more signaling.

357
00:44:44.460 --> 00:45:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But the loop in my brain. I don't know where it is. I don't have that slide up right but it's believed that the loop stays that there's a signal closed loop, it's just in the brain anymore. It's not coming from the rest.

358
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's circling back and forth closed loop saying there's pain, there's pain, there's pain. There's actually no tissue pain. There's no pain.

359
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about the people I have some clients that are missing limbs.

360
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.510
Have pain.

361
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's not an example of this. I don't know what else to tell you. We have a closed loop that happens that this pain is still there. And not only that regular pain like

362
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I stub my toe will stubbed toe, that hurts everybody but you know what I mean. Oh, paper cut. Well, those hurt to something else that's benign, really, it's not a big deal, but you're going to experience an eight or I'm going to experience.

363
00:45:47.070 --> 00:46:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be like, oh, this sucks. I'm it. Think about it. Think about the pain. How about assessment, you look at your sensitivity hyper notice the word hyper means more hyper pain responsive. Lucky you.

364
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So seriously when that attics, like, Come on, baby. Everything's going to be good. There's nothing good.

365
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing good about going back to heroin. There's nothing good about it. The only thing wants to do is kill the host to understand it doesn't think if I keep doing this.

366
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This body that I'm living in this Jay might die doesn't care. It's like those you know those worms that feed on us, or whatever.

367
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna kill the post. Do you know what a host is like, yeah, it's on us the organism doesn't have a consciousness that it's it's killing the very thing it needs to survive. It only cares that you continue to use does not have a moral compass only has seduction.

368
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And its fuel is your fear and shame.

369
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I have strong opinions about the matter.

370
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to hear me sometimes say, Okay, what's coming up for you and you might identify shame you might say there's a part of me that I don't want to tell you about, there's a part of me. There's a part of my history. I don't want to tell anyone, or I feel not good enough.

371
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get a really want to work with that because it's what's feeling the continuation and existence.

372
00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It loves it when you're ashamed because in order for shame to survive, you have to

373
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay secret. You can't share with people, the wrongs that you've done, let's say, or the harm that you've done, or the things that you the mistakes you perceive you've made.

374
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It loves it that you keep a secret.

375
00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will be inviting you to risk with yourself owning some things that you think we're kind of crummy because guess what, now you're not in shame. What you are is in regular healthy guilt, you and I, we have to have responsibility. Right.

376
00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to be able to say I stole I lied. I manipulated icon. Do I sold you drugs when you were pregnant. I've got to be able to own that. And guess what I'm free. I'm free because now in my attic talks to me, you know, and I say,

377
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you can't leverage shame against me mofo because I already owned it. I named it I shared it, I am accepting it slowly each day and I am slowly forgiving myself.

378
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm doing a lot of talking and I see some head nod, but I do not know what's going in. Tell me more about

379
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.140
Jay: I'm just thinking about where I was just last year at this time.

380
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:10.890
Jay: There's a lot of a lot of things that I've changed in my life to make the changes that I have, but I'm still not where I want to be.

381
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you like about who you are today.

382
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.260
Jay: I mean I'm trustworthy.

383
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:25.200
Jay: And that's it, really. I mean, I lost a lot of trust with my family and that's

384
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.590
Jay: Really what I was trying to work on. When I got out.

385
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:32.790
That

386
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're trustworthy. So in other words,

387
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: you value your word you say. I'm going to be somewhere, God willing, you know, barring an earthquake kind of thing. Yeah, I'll be there. I'm gonna be there and I saw you demonstrate that. So your credibility, right, that you are sick and you showed up anyway I means a lot.

388
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: In here.

389
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You showed up.

390
00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You say you're going to do something.

391
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to make every effort to do it does. Sometimes it's unavoidable. We really can't. And we're humans and we genuinely do miss schedule forget

392
00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We can be just we have such good intentions and we're so excited about it and it can still happen because we're human, but every intention was to follow through that you value your word and it matters.

393
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a big deal. Tell me how you were untrustworthy. You mean a story of how you were untrustworthy.

394
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:44.130
Jay: chick fil a chick for my brother in law. My sister to buy a floor jack

395
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:54.150
Jay: My intentions were to pay it back. But I got locked up before I was able to pay it back. Well, I didn't tell them about it. So they thought somebody stole their checkbook.

396
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

397
00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:03.600
Jay: They called it, they called the cops and that's what I'm going to court. Yeah, when they found the I use my own ID. I use my own name.

398
00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:12.360
Jay: I was just borrow. I was borrowing the basically they were visiting Florida and I couldn't get ahold of them I was living with them at the time.

399
00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:18.870
Jay: But that, you know, I should have that wasn't trustworthy and need to go through this shit.

400
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I stole their check it's not borrow. If we don't ask right

401
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, took it. Now, right now, as you say it to me. We're almost close to strangers. I mean we barely know each other. Are you noticing your body get

402
00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Tension anywhere as you're telling this truth.

403
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.170
Jay: Yeah.

404
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.080
Jay: Where my back.

405
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Mm hmm. It's right there's a connection your backs connected right to your brain.

406
00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The body is going to respond very quickly. Right.

407
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Has work to be done around that that part of your body. Okay, excellent.

408
00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

409
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you come to speak with sister and brother and all of them and say,

410
00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I own I should have asked you. And in fact, I didn't ask you because I figured you say now.

411
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you sent us. Oh.

412
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:33.210
Jay: No, I wouldn't apologize. I know what I did was wrong and I apologize for it. Yeah.

413
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But did you say that though, did you get into their like that that's empathy. When we go I imagine you feel betrayed and that I'm untrustworthy.

414
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so that your sister can say, Yeah, that's right.

415
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's different than I'm sorry. You know how many times and add access or sorry, and they're full of shit.

416
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me, I don't want to hear another sorry I go the rest of my life without one.

417
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, sorry. Okay, well,

418
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you show because you've lost some credibility so sorry. These are empty.

419
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And not because you don't mean them, but because your word doesn't have the value, it did before that betrayal, maybe. So what do you do

420
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Each time you have an opportunity to be trustworthy with your sister to repair that ruptured relationship. What do you do to keep your word to be trustworthy to show her

421
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can be trusted. What's a couple things you've done

422
00:53:47.070 --> 00:54:01.710
Jay: Well, first of all, it's something you got to think about all the time because in order to act on it all the time. You got to think about it all the time. Well, I just pretty much basically tried to live by what I wanted, I go to work every day I wake up every morning.

423
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.950
Jay: You know, whenever my mom needs help. I help. That's what I work for you know what I mean.

424
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.570
Jay: To the customers.

425
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:16.020
Jay: I make I make it a point to go and see my niece's at least three or four times a week.

426
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:22.440
Jay: I mean, I'm getting help.

427
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:30.570
Jay: taking classes I'm doing everything I need to the tried to say so. That's all I want for me is to stay sober.

428
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't be little things I want you to keep your eye out for like you said, I've got to be thinking about them. There's, there's probably incidents where you had a choice. You were, you were probably met with opportunity.

429
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To take to exploit and you didn't, you probably had moments where you could have fifth

430
00:54:55.260 --> 00:55:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Had a mystery truth and only you know where that is. It could have been with me. I really could have made it didn't want to. I accept all it up.

431
00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be okay we'll get through it you register those things. That's where your growth is if I'm vigilant about this every day, then each time I have a chance

432
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To just tell the truth on going to whatever comes because I don't want to feed the shame that gets activated.

433
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: When I lie. I don't want to feed the addict gives him more ammunition to use against me later. See, you're just the alliance of shit, put it to me. You can't tell the truth. You're no good. Now, tell the truth anyway.

434
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: must remember people are going to believe you. You're going to show humility and your. I'm sorry. These will be believed, because of the person that knows that they've made a mistake or are they on a regular basis or continuously sort of saying, My bad. I literally

435
00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I decided to sleep in an extra 15 minutes and I blew off the person that says that is free.

436
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may, you may not know that now.

437
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think you will. And those are the moments right they build on each other and it reinforces self efficacy, which is like. Think of it like self confidence.

438
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That says the message to the brain and the body, the soul, the spirit. I'm good enough. I'm lovable, I can make a mistake, just like everybody else.

439
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It reinforces that each time you're okay with kind of owning that she made a mistake.

440
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you don't share it when you don't say I screwed up a tropical island, but what I mean, are the little ones like

441
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt lazy. Last night I feel like emptying the trash.

442
00:56:53.040 --> 00:57:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When you own it. You see, I'm talking about, like, if they're little, they're not I you know I sold your life savings. It's the little ones they build in a really positive way. So as you're thinking about it all day long. Yep. Do it all day long owning the truth on

443
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Who and what you are

444
00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:17.280
Okay.

But

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:23.880
Jay: Let me check real quick.

457
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:24.810

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And

463
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to wait to hear through email. What Weston's email is all track down a signature drop it on that document and I'll send it to them.

464
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:12.630
Jay: Okay, thank you.

465
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That one more thing when you are. What's a common emotion that you feel during the day that you really don't like you ever fully anxious or angry or impatient.

466
00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.150
Jay: A variety and depression are both my two biggest

467
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.300
Jay: I feel sad a lot

468
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. All right. That's okay. And

469
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that associated with regret or this is a sad. That's really old like it's tied to really, really old stuff.

470
00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.250
Jay: Long

471
00:59:50.670 --> 01:00:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Alright, so we get. We need to get you hanging with some people that you enjoy and that are holding you up to the light, and in a positive influence in group when you are seeing. I don't know whether I did that. That group on

472
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting back in the community. Are there any opportunities for you to

473
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if you're not a religious dude like donating your time.

474
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: To an organization and non for profit organization can feel

475
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:25.680
Jay: We did a barrel race last weekend.

476
01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:33.600
Jay: I don't do stuff I do volunteer and stuff. It's just, it's still hard for me to get my self worth. So

477
01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That will build it when you were doing it. Didn't you feel good about that you were doing good, and not taking from them. That's what's that's what feels sweet is

478
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to be really careful how much resource we have to give but we only give what we have to give open and honest, we don't overdo it. So we're exhausted.

479
01:00:55.830 --> 01:01:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I have three hours. I'm going to give it expecting nothing in return. But no matter what you do, you do get self esteem and appreciation in return.

480
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So I really invite you to make that a priority for yourself to find it in the community. I know some of you are in sort of isolated remote areas and it is a challenge, but there's other people

481
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That want to connect with you as well. We all get that we all get that lonely stuff. And we're wired. We're literally our face is structured just the way it is.

482
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We connect. There's a reason. Okay, you have a whole group of people that you've disconnected from probably that we're hustling and they're not they're not on your, your side, they're on the attic side. So it's going to be

483
01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: A temporary situation this loneliness. It will change, but it will take some effort, can you spend some time seeing, seeing what you can do, maybe again over this weekend that would feel like you could do that with people at least the around them.

484
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We look into it.

485
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.640
Yeah. Okay. All right.

486
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:13.380
Jay: Everything's been shut down for 29 days because of that coronavirus I forgot.

487
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. That's right.

488
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.560
Jay: We're supposed to go to a better race today after that.

489
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude, this is

490
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Crazy. This is Chris, I don't even know what to say. It is very unsettling. There's lots of drama over here, too. I just remembered that. And you all schools. I've got some of these my clients. Their, their kids are now at home because the schools are closed. I mean it is

491
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.720
Jay: Doing that.

492
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Which makes me think about you too, and really needing you to be watching those pause all the time because

493
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.630
I don't want you to get sick.

494
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.180
Right.

495
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so maybe it's online for you, reading a book.

496
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And when you do feel lonely just counter it with this is temporary.

497
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just temporary. Okay.

498
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a time to get your strength up, get your self confidence up, get your self worth up when you can start to draw into your life positive people. We kind of match your self worth. Right.

499
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you're sharing with them instead of needing each other to compensate. Oh, you need me. And now let's let's share. So you're working on yourself, where it's just say, Hey, this is this is a short term situation will change forever. But do keep me posted about that.

500
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know if it is improving.

501
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see, I will see you in group. Now is there medication attached to today, or you've got it all the way

502
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Down enough for your next group.

503
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:54.270
Jay: No, I need some

504
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.230

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if she's up. Who knows.

508
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:12.540

Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm gonna go turn my and freezing and change my air while you're suddenly in

528
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It'd be hard not to talk about the coronavirus

529
01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.500
Magan: I am so

530
01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You freaked out.

531
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:46.560
Magan: I'm not freaked out. I'm I what I'm worried about

532
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:51.090
Magan: Is not so much of catching the virus.

533
01:06:52.590 --> 01:07:06.030
Magan: I'm more worried about people hurting one another and getting crazy and scared when people are scared people panic and they make very poor decisions.

534
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:07.620
Magan: And

535
01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.870
Magan: I'm already seeing a lot of that with my job and

536
01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.060
Magan: Stores

537
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:16.860
Magan: And

538
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.130
Magan: So Andrew

539
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:31.860
Magan: Andrew came into contact with someone who was direct who is in direct contact with the positive recipients of the virus.

540
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:42.690
Magan: At his job. So they removed that person. The person that told that person and then they shut down the entire branch.

541
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:53.670
Magan: And he came home and he let me know he let his ex wife. No, but I let Joel know and he won't let the children come home.

542
01:07:58.830 --> 01:07:59.820
Magan: So,

543
01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:03.720
Magan: That sucks. Yeah.

544
01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.830
Magan: But I understand where you're coming from. I get it.

545
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this is so inconvenient i mean it's it's affecting is going to affect everyone and

546
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like it's affecting you right away and I can hear it.

547
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:34.290
Magan: Yeah, I just don't want to be separated from my kids because I will totally go in there and I will like guns blazing I will get my children because no I mean right now.

548
01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:46.710
Magan: It's safest just in case, just in case, just in case something comes back with it and he was exposed that

549
01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:50.430
Magan: They stay with their dad.

550
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:52.320
Magan: I'm just

551
01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.060
Magan: Nervous.

552
01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone. Megan. We all are.

553
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:04.140
Magan: And Kenna sick. She has a cold so worried about that too.

554
01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.910
Magan: So is everybody freaking out on your end,

555
01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I use the word freaking out kind of loosely

556
01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I have one child that

557
01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: His college was cancelled, which means he's not flying back up to New York. And so he's still here has huge implication on graduation date is there's a lot of his life. That's really contingent down to the day so it has

558
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: He's having to work through that.

559
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:44.550
Magan: What about your mom and she can come to you.

560
01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:50.730
Magan: Know you guys aren't gonna like get together. Yeah.

561
01:09:52.260 --> 01:10:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, because we do our exposure is pretty limited. If you think about it, we're not, we don't have to go out in the community much I'm sitting here in my own home. So

562
01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:05.010
Magan: Are you stockpiled like you have

563
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.790
No.

564
01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

565
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I like I'm not a good role model for the

566
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.730
Magan: Sort of copper kind of thing.

567
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't watch the news, I

568
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Live in my own little

569
01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantasy

570
01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.980
Magan: I have no choice. Everybody at work watches it and we're

571
01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:41.430
Magan: We're central personnel, so I have to go and

572
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.500
Magan: There's no Lysol lights all the Clorox wipes are gone.

573
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.730
Magan: Everything is just gone and like, so I got as much as I can but

574
01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:55.770
Magan: And

575
01:10:56.430 --> 01:11:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We teach our little kids, the second day, hit it walk in the door. Wash the hands touch a bunch of things. Wash your hands. I'm telling you that handwashing

576
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:12.090
Magan: Oh yeah, I agree. I'm good one, but I

577
01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:17.160
Magan: I really don't. I actually would like to stop talking about it because that's

578
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: All I was about to say that. Me too.

579
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:27.120
Magan: I would like a break from it, actually. And I think that would benefit me so just breathe.

580
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Together that. Me too. I figured, let me bring it up and now we're moving on. Nice. All right, let's have a nice belly breath.

581
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:37.020
And then

582
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:47.430
Let's do that again. Nice. Inhale to the belly.

583
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.140
Let's

584
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.050
Let it all go

585
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's set an intention this morning.

586
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You with yours, something you want to experience today, or maybe something you want to let go of

587
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just set it for yourself like quiet space.

588
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can make that happen.

589
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To see what you want.

590
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.160
Magan: There.

591
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so you let me in. How can I help today.

592
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.650
Magan: I don't know, do you want to do, em, Dr.

593
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Singh. Sure. Do I love that.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.560
Magan: All right, let's do it.

595
01:12:53.580 --> 01:13:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So want to check in a little bit on it. I did a little texting and with my clients that I'm doing that with I do a little bit more. Hey, how you doing, just checking in on ya. Um, and there was some increased irritability.

596
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.730
Magan: irritable. Yeah.

597
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.440
Magan: I was very irritable.

598
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.360
Magan: I took it out on Andrew okay um

599
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do a little differently this time around. Do you want to

600
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:23.100
Magan: I don't want to do anything different. I think it was absolutely what needs to happen.

601
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.300
Magan: Okay, I

602
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.830
Magan: Tomorrow. My mom has been dead for two years and it's her birthday.

603
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.400
Magan: Anniversary. Okay, so that one's the one that's sticking in my head right now.

604
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you think about that. It's in your head sticking in your head. There's an anniversary coming up.

605
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your body respond to without anniversary. How does that respond when you said

606
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:57.150
Magan: My jaws lock my

607
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:08.970
Magan: Like hurts.

608
01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:12.930
Magan: Hurts I hurt.

609
01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:26.430
Magan: I would

610
01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.270
Magan: I would like to see here

611
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:36.120
Magan: So it just hurts like My heart hurts.

612
01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:39.300
Magan: My tummy hurts.

613
01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:50.850
Magan: It just feels like an empty like that empty spot that's there. Now I'm more aware of it at this moment. Yeah.

614
01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When your mom was alive.

615
01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: He was alive and in your life.

616
01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how she filled that void for you.

617
01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:09.720
Magan: She was just

618
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:12.780
Magan: She was a lot of things.

619
01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:19.770
Magan: She was a pain in the ass, to be honest, and she wasn't the best mom in the world but

620
01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:25.170
Magan: I have to give her her do. She was always there.

621
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:33.720
Magan: And that's something that my father wasn't that's something that a lot of people in my life were not

622
01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:40.680
Magan: That I have, you know, but even one she was mad at me, even when I was mad at her.

623
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:42.840
Magan: Even

624
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:57.540
Magan: If there was family drama. Even when I went to jail. She was still there and she showed up for things she wasn't able to say things she wasn't good with words.

625
01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:11.970
Magan: But, but she was actually physically there, even if it was to fight, even if it was to argue even if it was to yell and scream and put me down. She was still there.

626
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:21.930
Magan: And that's what I'm noticing for most is that she's not there for anything and it hurts.

627
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.320
Magan: It's not her fault.

628
01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's still pretty early. Two years that's that's

629
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:38.580
Magan: Not

630
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Not very long ago.

631
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.950
Magan: Two years. Is it feels like yesterday to be on

632
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And it makes me think for this anniversary. So it's, you said it's tomorrow.

633
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:56.880
Magan: Yeah, and tomorrow's a birthday as well. She died on my birthday.

634
01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

635
01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You did a ceremony of some kind and really made us

636
01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:20.010
Magan: Well, let's me and my sister, we were going to go spread her ashes come, but we can't because all the national parks are closed.

637
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:23.460
Magan: All the plans that we have

638
01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.150
Magan: Our country kind of placed on hold.

639
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: When are you gonna

640
01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you gonna read something where you're going to write something

641
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.550
Magan: Where you're just gonna light a candle and just

642
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:44.910
Magan: Don't like pulling out her ashes, because it

643
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.090
Magan: It sucks.

644
01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:53.010
Magan: But

645
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.810
Magan: I don't really know because last year I

646
01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.220
Magan: To be quite honest. I just kind of acted like nothing

647
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah. Okay. Well, you're a different phase of the grief process. Okay, it might be moving towards more integration.

648
01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Yeah. So let's keep brainstorming I you know me, I have no ego attached to. I might say something and you just depart from it was not yet. Nope, that's not it. Let's just see what happens if I say

649
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sister, and you get together and you literally make a candle, and it has her ashes in it and like that candle you share a story or you read something meaningful.

650
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:51.960
Magan: Okay, so what's what comes up for you when I do that little brainstorm. I mean, it sounds a beautiful thing but Alicia does want me near her right now because the baby.

651
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.240
Magan: Okay, got it.

652
01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, how, how important is it to you that

653
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.030
Magan: Alicia has included

654
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, that it be on

655
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The day because we can

656
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, celebrate it.

657
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:19.410
Magan: It doesn't have to be on the day. And that actually you know that, honestly. Sounds like a wonderful idea. I could bring it up with to Alicia.

658
01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:30.300
Magan: One thing she has mentioned, though, is that she doesn't want to separate mom's ashes or Nana's because they also have Nana's ashes in the closet right next to my mom and I'm

659
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:40.440
Magan: I think before comes time to spread her. I'm just going to take a little bit of my own, and not let her know because

660
01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.210
Magan: I mean, they're in my closet. So did

661
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:49.650
Magan: But she she just doesn't want

662
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:53.460
Magan: Separation of it and I don't see

663
01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:58.320
Magan: How that can just be only her choice. Okay.

664
01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a moment to do something a little differently.

665
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think you would like it. And I think you really don't like it when people go on and make executive decisions without your input. So you'll be doing something that you don't like done to you. So let's just keep talking about it.

666
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right or wrong, whether you agree with your sister's belief system and there are a lot of departures about how you view things how you approach things your self awareness denial that whole thing is just, you guys are approaching this very differently. We different person.

667
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The more and more I see people that

668
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Can just sit with someone else's

669
01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Experience and not judge it blame it criticize it. Try and talk about it.

670
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The easier it is for this other person sister to say yes to you, but first

671
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She needs probably to feel heard, understood, and I don't think you understand Dan her perspective, I think it's really confusing to you about how to see it this way, why she hung up on the integrity of the actual staying together. I could make some sense.

672
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:34.470
Magan: It's not so much. I can see her perspective because she has explained it to me.

673
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:46.560
Magan: Okay, but she kind of lay down the law and says, No. And that's what's frustrating to me is that she's my mom kale know

674
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The only differences is you here know

675
01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your yes is still there. This is, this is a familiar swing that you make.

676
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone doesn't say yes to you.

677
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You go to, I don't have a right anymore. They just took all my rights away. They're saying, no, it's definitive that's not actually the truth. You're yes it's still there, your preferences still right here.

678
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't quite see that they're just it's just sitting there differences of opinion.

679
01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's still more communication that's needed. There's still more

680
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's somewhere to go with this.

681
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You

682
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:36.000
Magan: I'm open to it.

683
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:44.190
Magan: I am me grab. I have to grab another water bottle for the

684
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:46.920
Magan: Sorry.

685
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:50.280
Magan: We're

686
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Starting to take a look at the notes from previous session here just to see what

687
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:14.190
Magan: Okay.

688
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So let's see.

689
01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Last one. Not feeling anger at present, not as it was, I want to

690
01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.050
Win and

691
01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You

692
01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to I want to believe when I hear you and my children say I'm enough but it's difficult.

693
01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:43.320
Magan: I want. Yeah.

694
01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask my mother. Why am I not enough for you children can't answer it don't understand. Gandalf and the dog looks pitiful they feel bad for me.

695
01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Going disagrees, and turns to mother and ask the direct, direct question. Do you really believe Megan's not enough.

696
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would make him feel. She's not enough from you.

697
01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Gwen's pretty firm with mom. She doesn't like to see the little girl hurting

698
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Gwen right the imagery of client grabs the little girl's hand and says to mom.

699
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You should be ashamed of yourself to remember that.

700
01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.260
Mm hmm.

701
01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did a lot of really hard work. Megan.

702
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You hear that,

703
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:47.610
Magan: Yeah, kind of.

704
01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:51.360
Magan: It was pretty intense in the moment.

705
01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:53.250
It right

706
01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But our mind has a way of self preservation. It has a way of right we put it in the container. We put it right at the end.

707
01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: On the distancing leaf and it kind of moved away and then we don't have to have all of that right on the surface and slowly it can get metabolized and integrated and processed in our mind.

708
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

709
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:19.620
My ears really bad right now.

710
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.030
Magan: I always wonder like, what does it mean I did they not pressurized or something or

711
01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:28.410
I'm

712
01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:31.380
Magan: Just equalize

713
01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. So right now, they're clear right at the second they're clear, everything's normal, it's fine. In a few seconds, they'll

714
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what's going on. I don't know if it's the eardrum that

715
01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:51.240
Magan: It's not something that happens all the time.

716
01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:53.550
Magan: Your whole life.

717
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I have a life. I think in college.

718
01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.060
Magan: Oh my goodness. That's a long time.

719
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Really long time. I'm so used to it. Now I actually sometimes forget to tell my clients about this behavior. And they're like, what are you doing

720
01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.690
Magan: Yeah, they don't fix it.

721
01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I I have tried on there is the belief presently that it is my grinding of teeth so I try this. I hate those mouth guard things, but I'm doing it. I hate it.

722
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean that much I i've tried any kind of allergy, I, I've tried. I stopped eating sugar stopped drinking creamer with

723
01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Chemicals I've tried, no dairy. I've tried and just eating. I've tried to rule out

724
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.140
Magan: Whatever the physiological issue.

725
01:26:53.640 --> 01:27:02.790
Magan: Yeah, it's not like like it's not like it seems like almost anatomy or something, something inside of the ear canal.

726
01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:04.170
Magan: Right.

727
01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I said I thought it was water. I thought maybe water was caught in there. So it's been a lot of times trying to dry my ear, because it feels like if you're going on an airplane right or going underwater. It's pressure but if

728
01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I can then there's other it's so unpredictable. I don't know if it's barometric pressure or something, I don't know. I could go, I could sometimes I haven't recently gone days without it.

729
01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it makes no sense to me.

730
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.320
Magan: Um, what would drive me insane.

731
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I could go insane. It is really annoying but right now. Like right now, I'm fine.

732
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:50.370
Magan: What if you keep like a you know those earphone things that you push inside of your ears to keep the sound out. What if you kept those in there.

733
01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't be able to do my job, but also it would probably be useful to know that I actually wear them all night.

734
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, just because of sound.

735
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I use wax. So it really pulls on them so

736
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: damaging the eardrum. I mean, I have. I've had a line years to think about what the

737
01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:13.740
Magan: Name.

738
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I completely hydrated. All I do is just water. Water, water, water, water, it makes that then do it. Is it food, more food less food I played with that I

739
01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't. I had

740
01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.820
Magan: Yeah, so

741
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Cookie. Alright, but we do have a reprieve from it right now, which is nice. So let's see.

742
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But as soon as I swallow it comes back up. Okay, let's see here.

743
01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative cognition of I'm not enough. Let's do a little check in.

744
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:01.740
Okay.

745
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do one to 10 How true is that today.

746
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:12.180
Magan: Or

747
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.520
Magan: If I were to like really apply it to myself.

748
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And try and catch your first response to this now.

749
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Evan. Evan. Okay. And the one you wanted

750
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I see what the positive one. Was I am enough

751
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I am enough

752
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, that one's a scale of one to seven. How true is it right now, today.

753
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.260
Magan: To

754
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:47.820
Was it before.

755
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.150
Magan: It goes for

756
01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough was

757
01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You went down.

758
01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

759
01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:02.220
Magan: Yeah.

760
01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that.

761
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I don't see where

762
01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's transcribed what the other one was though.

763
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But today we have

764
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive cognition SATA to I am enough. Okay.

765
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do some positive inner weaving like I like that one. That's, that's a nice feeling spend some time, and especially since you said that you've had some some irritability and that question I asked earlier, really. Do you want to do it differently. What I meant about that was

766
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, this is enough I typed up and I write all that things on pissed off about

767
01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To Andrew and I

768
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I printed and tucked away somewhere I dated timestamp when it goes away, or I delete it.

769
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of sharing it with the person if you don't think it's productive if you don't think it's right.

770
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:17.460
Magan: Wait wait wait wait wait like doing it in here or do I do it.

771
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: In your life that when that irritability. In other words, honor their ability on or whatever it is that's coming up for you. But, see if you can channel it in a way that

772
01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't self destruct. I don't know if it's if it's doing harm.

773
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:54.720
Magan: Oh, it was, it was definitely doing harm was irritable and snappy, not just with him that I was more vulnerable with him, definitely, like it was easier with him and with the kids, but it was there at work at home around him. I was I was definitely irritable.

774
01:31:55.230 --> 01:32:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to try it. It's, it's kind of a neat thing because when you can't even you write it all out. Just, just to all of the up just raw LIKE YOU SON OF A you wish you would murder. Murder wrote it. Just let it all out and you can kind of see it on the page.

775
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, really know what to give that to them, you know, I'm not going to get that to him. That's

776
01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.550
Magan: What's that going to do is

777
01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna I on with this person. I could leave I have choice. I don't think that'll make a difference. It's just gonna be an argument.

778
01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you may decide you want to share something just less intensely or something. But at least you have a chance to slow time down

779
01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You now have the ability to look at it and make a decision and choice. So I want to share the content of my irritability, because what if part of the heightened irritability, has to do with a byproduct of this Cmdr. And maybe you want to postpone

780
01:32:55.140 --> 01:33:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sharing what's been upsetting you, until it's safer your confidence is is more, there are. I don't know what, maybe that is really a petty concern and maybe there's a bigger issue. I mean, it could be any number of things, but you may

781
01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:09.390
Magan: All start with that.

782
01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And shred it

783
01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:12.720
Okay.

784
01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Only you know whether it's safe to store it.

785
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:36.360
Magan: Well, I used to give. I used to write and I gave my journals to my mom next to hide at her house and I locked them in a box and I put up a combo and she didn't even know it like so she didn't have access to it either. But now that she's gone.

786
01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:38.760
Magan: They're gone. So

787
01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this would just be a really specific thing for a while. Just to see how that feels. To do discharge it onto the page. YOU'RE NOT DISRUPTING relationship. This way, it's reinforcing this you can process with information on your own and just see what happens just tried a couple times.

788
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:57.300
Magan: I'll give it a go. Yeah.

789
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's let's see what we got, we've got we've got our dragon. We've got when you've got Gandalf for a protective figures. We've got nurturing the dog, and we've got my children. Okay, now have those transformed at all. Are there new images that are come up

790
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:20.010
Magan: No, I was just more surprised at how

791
01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:22.470
Magan: Present, you were

792
01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:31.470
Magan: Right, I really was. I was like holy shit man like you really feel especially in those moments.

793
01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:35.160
Magan: A trusted

794
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.620
Magan: Conrad like a

795
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:45.930
Magan: Not just a comrade, but like a paternal figure, almost. It's really weird.

796
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now you said paternal

797
01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be father. Does it feel more like that more of a more of the masculine sense

798
01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:01.140
Magan: Because only because you become

799
01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:10.320
Magan: You became because in here. You're, you're more more feminine more

800
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:13.260
Magan: Not delicate but

801
01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.530
Magan: But in that moment, you just felt more real life.

802
01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:23.970
Magan: And that's, that's why I would say the more masculine side.

803
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:25.530
Magan: But you can't but

804
01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:32.220
Magan: I get this even there was maternal there as well. Right.

805
01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the hand holding there was pulling

806
01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Away, but ultimately what we're looking for. And you found it was there something in here that there's a quality.

807
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Something I do something I have done that you trust the quality of protection that

808
01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:56.820
Magan: Exactly. It's, it's a safe space.

809
01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:04.560
Magan: You were, you were very present for that, that I didn't even know it would happen, but it did.

810
01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.370
Magan: So I was like, what do you know, and

811
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:25.920
Magan: I knew that there was an underlying trust that has been rightfully earned and but I didn't realize that it was to that point to that degree that. Because for me that's a lot. That's a big step for me so

812
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.280
Magan: Having imagery like that and having

813
01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.880
Magan: That feeling was

814
01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:37.170
Magan: A good, a good feeling, but also

815
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:46.080
Magan: A LITTLE OVERWHELMING and intimidating, because, oh shit. What if she would have would have said ends badly, too.

816
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:53.910
Magan: And I do think about that. And I know it's bad, but I do now, I've given that to somebody else.

817
01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:59.940
Magan: You know what I mean. And so that can be a delicate

818
01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:02.430
It.

819
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually deserving of it doesn't really belong so much Dr. Is it that would be interpersonal therapy. And that's always going on with us. That's an underlying piece all throughout

820
01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And

821
01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.320
Magan: I

822
01:37:19.650 --> 01:37:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I think it might be something to

823
01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we just do a little piece of it.

824
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:28.080
Magan: Okay.

825
01:37:28.530 --> 01:37:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you just share with me what it was like for you because you just alluded to it. But this time, you'll share directly with me what it was like for you.

826
01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: To have me as the quality protective to your show up.

827
01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:45.060
Magan: It was

828
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.580
Magan: Scary.

829
01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:49.530
Magan: It was

830
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:51.450
Magan: Relieving

831
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.810
Magan: Surprising comforting.

832
01:37:59.310 --> 01:38:02.610
Magan: There are so many mixed feelings going on with it.

833
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We have the mixture because right now that's all well scary.

834
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:16.830
Magan: It was vulnerability. So there was vulnerable illness. There is a there's a fear. There's a fear that

835
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.260
Magan: Is

836
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:31.200
Magan: Like, like I said, like you could let me down, what if what if everything goes to shit between us in therapy. And what if that trust is broken. What if

837
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:35.790
Magan: What if just what if galore come up and

838
01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:39.930
Magan: I have so many of those in my life.

839
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:45.660
Magan: Now that that that basis is there.

840
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:49.650
Magan: What happens, what am I left with

841
01:38:51.210 --> 01:38:58.230
Magan: Will I be alone again life will I fuck this up, will I not be enough. Will it not meet

842
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.620
Magan: Those, what will I not

843
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.240
Magan: To put into words will I not

844
01:39:08.370 --> 01:39:11.250
Magan: Will I fail. Yeah. Do you know, do you know what I mean.

845
01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, do so. Is there more. I mean, well let me let you know what I heard you were surprised how that imagery JUST CAME UP THERE SHE WAS THERE WAS THERE, THERE WAS IN THE imagery, the one that had the ability to be firm and communicate with your mom and protect you and really not.

846
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.290
Magan: Wireless. That's what it is you

847
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:51.180
Magan: Communicated for me that's what it was. So it was you said what I couldn't say you you

848
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:53.880
Magan: You

849
01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:04.200
Magan: You were the first one you were the one that laid it out there. You were the protector one you were the

850
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:10.350
Magan: The strong one. The confident one, the one that was not willing to accept.

851
01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:15.450
Magan: Will not willing to accept that answer.

852
01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:25.860
Magan: Do you know what I mean. And, and the fact that it was you was like, well, this is so very surprising to me, but I think it is because

853
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:35.160
Magan: You, you are a very present part of my life. And, you know, some very, very, very

854
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.660
Magan: Personal vulnerable things about me and

855
01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:48.510
Magan: To give somebody that kind of trust. I can't even give my husband that trusted that degree so

856
01:40:49.620 --> 01:41:04.800
Magan: I would there things what I thought would pop up didn't and what get pop up with you and I was like holy shit. So it was very surprising, but it wasn't bad. But it is scary.

857
01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so we're gonna we're going to do a little bit more analysis, a little bit more processing of the scary. Okay.

858
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What that is, first I want to go to

859
01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This imagery

860
01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it forced upon you. Did I say, I want you to think about, think about when doing this and this, or did you come up with that on your

861
01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:36.780
Magan: Role it came like I noticed that as we were progressing with the session. And I'm thinking of

862
01:41:38.190 --> 01:41:41.460
Magan: A bit I'm not thinking, but you're guiding it

863
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:43.140
Magan: But

864
01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:45.450
Magan: I am

865
01:41:46.950 --> 01:42:01.350
Magan: You get like you're not planting a seed. You're not forcing it on me. You're giving me room to accept it myself. Find the feeling myself. Find the grounds of of what's going on myself.

866
01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:05.850
Magan: And literally what came up is what came up so

867
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:07.770
Magan: I don't see how that could be

868
01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:09.300
Magan: Mm hmm.

869
01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.120
Magan: Or a miscued you know what an

870
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:14.700
Magan: Excuse. Yeah.

871
01:42:16.110 --> 01:42:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so hold on to that. So you you're endorsing this came from you.

872
01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Now. Now see if you recognize any of the attributes and that imagery of what kind of organically happened with Gwen right with me.

873
01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture that I want you to see just sort of volley back and forth.

874
01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it about when what is it about when even right now and then go to you.

875
01:42:46.470 --> 01:43:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Know to I have those two I see them in one or maybe it's just the imagery, maybe it's not me right in front of you don't know you decide, do I have that to just go back and forth. What do I have in common with her just nice and slow, maybe a split screen here's when

876
01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.660
Magan: Yours, you would be

877
01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:10.950
Okay.

878
01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:15.150
Magan: Honesty would be the first one that comes up.

879
01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:19.110
Magan: A mother.

880
01:43:19.650 --> 01:43:20.160
Mother.

881
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.250
Magan: Wife.

882
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.710
Magan: Daughter

883
01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:28.980
Magan: Friend.

884
01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Quality of protector.

885
01:43:40.230 --> 01:43:40.830
Magan: Mother.

886
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:46.200
Magan: Bear like mama, mama bear

887
01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:54.510
Magan: Empathetic like

888
01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:58.890
Magan: Tender.

889
01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:06.150
Magan: Reassuring

890
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:15.210
Magan: What is the word. It is

891
01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:20.520
Magan: Like where you give somebody that push

892
01:44:22.110 --> 01:44:24.480
Magan: Encouraging. Thank you. I couldn't think of it.

893
01:44:32.190 --> 01:44:36.690
Magan: I think those would be something this. Yeah, that's what I would see in that

894
01:44:37.890 --> 01:44:39.570
Magan: Especially for that session.

895
01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. We've got a little bit of time you've got your two containers. They're there. I saw you measuring shoulder width apart. They're about the same height.

896
01:44:52.890 --> 01:44:55.650
Magan: Yeah, their exact same bottle. Okay.

897
01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think what I'd like you

898
01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To consider is

899
01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the more intense or most intense moments where

900
01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That sense of

901
01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that imagery, whatever you had or maybe something new comes up, but the most intense image around. I'm not enough.

902
01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you have to do is just hold that image. Maybe it was you could see yourself talking to someone, or you feel. I don't know what it is that you can hold that just that piece. And so that's an image you hold the picture in your working memory. And then I want you to pull in

903
01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm enough

904
01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold those two things together.

905
01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.590
Magan: That is really hard because the I'm not enough is very

906
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:09.570
Magan: It's ugly. It's disgusting.

907
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:11.280
Magan: Okay.

908
01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:12.210
So,

909
01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This sounds like

910
01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:18.510
Magan: The imagery is disgusting.

911
01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

912
01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the imagery is disgusting. So, so this is this is part of the desensitization part and this is why the warning is out there that there will be increased, irritability, maybe for you because that's what's happening. And then there's

913
01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The idea of possibly some intruding nightmares. Some images that come right

914
01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.850
Magan: That happened. I did have some nightmares.

915
01:46:44.970 --> 01:47:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, some nightmares. Yeah, so tell you something. Megan, your body wants to heal. It's, it's, it's trying to integrate those things and have a landing place and we have a chance to do that. You don't have to tell me the distressing images you

916
01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:05.430
Magan: I can tell you the image when you said

917
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:09.210
Magan: When you said I'm not enough.

918
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.200
Magan: I have imagery of me naked.

919
01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:17.190
Magan: Kind of curled up in a ball.

920
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:21.150
Magan: And my brother is behind me. Okay.

921
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is interesting about that is, and this might be a symptom of the tele health is it was actually the affirmative was was a positive one that I asked you to hold puts I am enough

922
01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:37.800
Magan: Yeah.

923
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And it didn't work. You went either it was the tele health, but something happened.

924
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

925
01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:51.930
Magan: Oh, I see what you mean. So the communication with lot

926
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha, yeah.

927
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.690
Magan: Okay. So yeah, that's the one that stuck it just stuck there. OK.

928
01:47:58.290 --> 01:48:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So the desensitization if you let it happen if you if you can kind of trust in it a little bit. That's what this bilateral stimulation does

929
01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:09.120
Magan: So what do I do

930
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good. We're going to do it. Now, why don't we, why don't we shift gears and instead, what I want you to do is ask you to hold that image that you just described.

931
01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And this time I want you to picture your team.

932
01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what you're describing

933
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is flesh and you didn't have this team with you. Okay. He didn't have this team cognitively spiritually psychologically didn't have it then. So just let let this this technique work for you. So here we go.

934
01:48:41.820 --> 01:49:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is a positive we've which means these iterations, the bilateral will be slow. Okay, so here we go. I'm going to pull up the WORST piece of it. And I want you to bring the quality of your team to your awareness and you have access and you can access

935
01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection.

936
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing

937
01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And wisdom.

938
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: My short duration in in Hell to the belly.

939
01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you exhale, I want you to just blank out your mind. Let it all go

940
01:49:57.630 --> 01:49:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And in that quiet space.

941
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to the first thing that comes up.

942
01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:09.330
Magan: My room my room.

943
01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.710
Magan: Like this secret room.

944
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go with that.

945
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Good pace worse in my room, your secret place.

946
01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Belly breath. And then nice and slow.

947
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

948
01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:28.050
Magan: I want to go I okay I'm I'm there.

949
01:51:29.670 --> 01:51:32.760
Magan: With that image image naked.

950
01:51:34.410 --> 01:51:35.790
Magan: And he's buying

951
01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.420
Magan: Lola's there.

952
01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:43.470
Magan: She's gonna buy

953
01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: My care.

954
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:47.850
Magan: Okay.

955
01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So with that,

956
01:52:20.730 --> 01:52:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pray together. Inhale.

957
01:52:24.810 --> 01:52:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, nice and slow, really slow. So, so, so, so, exhale

958
01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.300
Magan: Lola's gonna bite.

959
01:52:54.570 --> 01:52:55.230
Magan: You're

960
01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:57.480
Magan: You're

961
01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.840
Magan: Putting your handout for me to grab

962
01:53:01.530 --> 01:53:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: To go

963
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

964
01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What's he doing

965
01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:55.920
Magan: He's biting.

966
01:53:56.670 --> 01:53:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I saw to

967
01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

968
01:54:40.410 --> 01:54:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so what did you see what

969
01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:58.440
Magan: I see that image will have biting you're reaching and the door to the room is there and I want to get to it, but I can't. I can't move.

970
01:55:00.630 --> 01:55:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this last piece. See if you can get one of those resources to help you get remember there's magic in that room there's a magic compartment in there with a magic wand and that magic can get to you.

971
01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:18.690
Okay.

972
01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When's reaching there's this reaching I can't quite get to it, go with that.

973
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:14.220
What's coming up for you.

974
01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: thoughts and beliefs that passed by. What are they

975
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:24.180
Magan: I see that. Let me turn this off.

976
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:26.580
Magan: Lewis biting.

977
01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:36.750
Magan: And the light like I see his leg. Think what Paul's like he's being pulled and drug away.

978
01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:46.080
Magan: And and it's away from the room and I want I'm seeing like the door open.

979
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:55.410
Magan: I can't, I can't find what you're telling me to look for. I can't find that piece. It's supposed to come out.

980
01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.100
Magan: I just I just see

981
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:02.550
Magan: The hand the dog.

982
01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:14.580
Magan: And me and I'm naked and I'm covering my body up and I don't want to move because I'm ashamed. I think it's gross. I think it's disgusting.

983
01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, look at me.

984
01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So do I think you're disgusting your tiny little body to I think it's disgusting. What do I want to do with the tiny body.

985
01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.010
Magan: You want me to get up and

986
01:57:33.690 --> 01:57:38.850
Magan: You would put a blanket. That's what would come up like a blanket or something.

987
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that. Ready, breathe, keep breathing.

988
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the mama bear

989
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing comforting tender reassuring.

990
01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the protection combination of nurturing reassuring.

991
01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:13.710
Keep breathing.

992
01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:16.260
Keep

993
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The thoughts going through your mind.

994
01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:39.240
Magan: Relief that you are there, you have

995
01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.240
Magan: Something to cover me with

996
01:58:44.490 --> 01:58:46.230
Magan: Was pulling him away.

997
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:57.870
Magan: Or JJ can are not there. They're there because I know they're part of the team, but I don't want them to see this. Okay.

998
01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you get to the room.

999
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.040
Magan: I'm just

1000
01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:23.730
Magan: Face facing you face into, you know, your chest. Like, I don't want to see anything. I don't want to look at. And you know, I can hear Lola hurting him and he's yelling, screaming

1001
01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Urine okay we're okay. We're okay.

1002
01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: See, we are okay. We're here today. Okay, keep breathing.

1003
01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:42.810
Okay.

1004
01:59:57.960 --> 01:59:58.680
Last

1005
02:00:04.290 --> 02:00:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, letting it all go this morning. Let it all go

1006
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your mind go blank.

1007
02:00:15.930 --> 02:00:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever imagery. You don't want to work through. Now as we come closer to the end of the hour lunch did put it on that leaf.

1008
02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I and the quality of your children just the quality of it.

1009
02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And the dog Gandalf. We're all there with you and you don't have to even watch the leaf. You can stay nestled in the chest wrapped and safety.

1010
02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just getting further and further away.

1011
02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And feel the warmth

1012
02:00:57.630 --> 02:00:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Reached out to you and to care of you.

1013
02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing to do

1014
02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You are okay.

1015
02:01:18.810 --> 02:01:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune into the body to a scan see

1016
02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: How the theater doing

1017
02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: check in and see if there's any blood down here, see if they're cold or warm if there's motion.

1018
02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:34.590
Magan: There is now that you said it.

1019
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that move up the body.

1020
02:01:41.490 --> 02:01:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To the ankles and calves and shins, let it move through the knees and

1021
02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let calm and relax muscle be possible.

1022
02:01:53.790 --> 02:02:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Warm thighs, letting them rest heavy on the chair just letting it rest. There's blood. They're not all the blood

1023
02:02:02.970 --> 02:02:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just some

1024
02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And scan up the body to your seat bones and

1025
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To your belly.

1026
02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing into it.

1027
02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And the chest.

1028
02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders.

1029
02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Up the neck.

1030
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To the jaw.

1031
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The ears and into the eye sockets and needed a nasal passage, and then up over the forehead.

1032
02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To the top of your head.

1033
02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we revisit the hands. Let's check and see if there's blood there if there's

1034
02:02:56.970 --> 02:03:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Their warm or cold. There's tingling. If there's comfort or distress just just didn't

1035
02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Check the risks for arms.

1036
02:03:11.070 --> 02:03:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking elbows.

1037
02:03:13.710 --> 02:03:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And those large muscle groups also in our biceps.

1038
02:03:19.050 --> 02:03:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let them be warm and resting heavily just resting not needing to be on alert me just rest.

1039
02:03:28.650 --> 02:03:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no danger.

1040
02:03:33.630 --> 02:03:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay.

1041
02:03:41.070 --> 02:03:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1042
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We're okay.

1043
02:04:01.170 --> 02:04:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with that truth.

1044
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

1045
02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1046
02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing to fix, nothing to do

1047
02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just present

1048
02:04:21.930 --> 02:04:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: turning inward.

1049
02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at the intention that she said earlier in the day and

1050
02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you found your way to

1051
02:04:33.570 --> 02:04:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To making that possible for yourself.

1052
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being compassionate witness. That's all.

1053
02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:01.920
Magan: Okay.

1054
02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just spend a little bit of time kind of process a little bit don't have to too much time but no one's knocking at my door right now we're okay.

1055
02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:12.270
So,

1056
02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What's important for you. What do you, what do you noticing. It's important.

1057
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:24.600
Magan: What's important that that I'm noticing is that I caught up in that imagery

1058
02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.870
Magan: And that's a big deal for me.

1059
02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:30.750
Magan: Because that's a real image.

1060
02:05:33.150 --> 02:05:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1061
02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:36.870
Magan: So that's something that really happened.

1062
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:42.300
Magan: And that's one that that is very, very intrusive for me. Yeah.

1063
02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.590
Magan: And you went there. I did and

1064
02:05:48.630 --> 02:06:02.520
Magan: That's what I find surprising. With the EM dr is that it's not controlled it, it's literally what is happening in my brain. Yeah, and it's like a new have no idea.

1065
02:06:04.050 --> 02:06:07.110
Magan: So that's what I find so

1066
02:06:11.610 --> 02:06:28.860
Magan: That's what I find so surprising. It's terrifying because some stuff that's coming up in my brain. I know that stuff. And I've tried to not think about that stuff so much and I'm very good at pushing it away.

1067
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it terrifying.

1068
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:35.100
Magan: It was overwhelming.

1069
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.230
Magan: It was overwhelming.

1070
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:39.960
Magan: But

1071
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:55.740
Magan: I don't know if that was the MD or are not. But you were keeping me focused on a goal. So the fact that that was there was not as suffocating as it always seems okay

1072
02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So you you revisit it that imagery and had a different experience of it.

1073
02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:07.380
Magan: Exactly so that that experience still there, but

1074
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:15.420
Magan: It's different now there's different things have been played out with it now and that's

1075
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:20.790
Magan: In it, I don't even know what to make of it. I really don't.

1076
02:07:21.450 --> 02:07:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to understand some things for the things to work.

1077
02:07:28.770 --> 02:07:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to have insight into it and understand something. I have no idea how this thing works, none of

1078
02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It works done the same. I don't understand what the spleen does

1079
02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:44.550
Magan: I don't, but it works.

1080
02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:45.660
It works.

1081
02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I tried to explain these things, but this is such a complex intervention, because it isn't just in VR, it's

1082
02:07:59.730 --> 02:08:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Attachment focused and Dr. So our relationship is an integral part of what

1083
02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We're doing

1084
02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:07.800
Okay, so

1085
02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You did, hard, hard work.

1086
02:08:13.590 --> 02:08:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do. You can't do it wrong. You did it perfectly.

1087
02:08:18.150 --> 02:08:20.370
Magan: Thank you for supporting me

1088
02:08:21.150 --> 02:08:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. It's my pleasure my privilege. Honestly, my privilege.

1089
02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:31.350
Magan: Thank you very much, but I'll let you go. So you can go to your next person.

1090
02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to what comes up, if it turns

1091
02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:35.820
Magan: Down.

1092
02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, write it down and either you can bring it to me. You can do things like if you want you can take a picture, you could send it to send an email if you want it says, share it with me.

1093
02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: We can make it our focus next time. If you need to, you could schedule another appointment, you're working very hard at something so

1094
02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this may continue to feel a little challenging as those those images there in a network that's kind of cut off from the rest of you in your brain. And so we're slowly getting some connections to it right now.

1095
02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And some memory some fragments may come up. Just be again compassionate witness that would be normal. It would be typical for that to be happening when normally you've been cut off from those memories. So again, don't be surprised if it's worse before it gets better kind of thing.

1096
02:09:34.710 --> 02:09:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget to reach out to me.

1097
02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.610
Magan: Okay, well,

1098
02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:41.520
