Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, how are you

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.010
Jessica Freeman: I like like the two nights before I left on the weekend trip like I was already exhausted like I'd had to get up.

5
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:38.520
Jessica Freeman: Like super early and you know so exhausted and then the trip was just, it was wonderful. But it was also like non stop and I mean I couldn't sleep on the planes and when I got back, it was like, I mean,

6
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.150
Jessica Freeman: The just I'm still exhausted. I i'm not i'm not catching up. Like, I'm just, I have a constant headache.

7
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not good. You wearing yourself down.

8
00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:06.630
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, but like yesterday I took the day, man. I did nothing. I laid on the couch. I didn't know housework it nothing. And you know, I need to feel I need to feel better. In fact, I think I might actually take some headache medicine.

9
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.600
Jessica Freeman: Give me a quick second sorry

10
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that's okay.

11
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.750
Jessica Freeman: Sorry.

12
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's all right.

13
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.940
Jessica Freeman: Everybody's freaking out over the coronavirus and like I went to the store last night and people are going nuts like toilet paper and bottled water and

14
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.130
Jessica Freeman: It's like if people would not do that, then there would be enough for everyone.

15
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

16
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.600
I know

17
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I you know I still don't get the

18
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The obsession over

19
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: an excessive amount of toilet paper.

20
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Candy.

21
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.810
Jessica Freeman: I don't get it either.

22
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To me.

23
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.450
Jessica Freeman: And like the bottle water, stuff like that, for me that's important. I live in the desert, and I have to drink a lot of water and I don't

24
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.640
Jessica Freeman: Trust tap water. And I've gone through a couple Britta pictures and I'm just to the point where

25
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:40.440
Jessica Freeman: I recycle. Okay, so I'm going to drink water. I'm going to drink it all the time. I'm going to always have a bottle of water with me and I try to refill it when I can. But when I can't, then I recycle them, you know,

26
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

27
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me about your trip.

28
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.140
Jessica Freeman: Oh my god. It was amazing. Okay.

29
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.520
Jessica Freeman: Oh, we got in Friday. And I went, and hung out with some, you know, our behavior tech Toby, who said he was going to move here, but he's not going to move here.

30
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.730
Jessica Freeman: You know, he's like a single man on attached he's gay. You know, not married. No kids and he's miserable at his job. So there's no reason

31
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.440
Jessica Freeman: There's no reason that he couldn't just like, you know, change his life, but I don't have any control of that. So, you know, I'm just

32
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.500
Jessica Freeman: It is what it is. And I'm just happy to have him in my life and be friends with them and that's that. So I'm just going to try to stay in touch with

33
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.970
Jessica Freeman: With the people I care about. I did. I took away some, like, really important things from this trip.

34
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:37.710
Jessica Freeman: I don't want to get ahead of myself, but one of them was, if I want to keep in contact with these people that I care about. If I want to maintain these relationships which I do, then I need to be intentional about it.

35
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.870
Jessica Freeman: Like to make sure that I have structured it in with the priorities in my life, you know,

36
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.800
Yeah.

37
00:03:48.390 --> 00:04:09.480
Jessica Freeman: And then Saturday we went down to the robotics tournament, and we spent pretty much all day there. My ex husband and his family were there and you know he has hated me since the day I left like he was crying on the floor, begging me not to leave. And then I left and then

38
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:21.390
Jessica Freeman: The wall came down and he has despised me ever since. And no matter what I try to do. I mean, it's been 15 years Rebecca 15 years of effort where I've

39
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:33.120
Jessica Freeman: Can we work together for our child can we be civil. Can we communicate about our son. Can we co parent. Nope, he doesn't want anything to do with that he hates me so much.

40
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:45.870
Jessica Freeman: Which it makes me sad because you know who suffers for it. Our son. That's who suffers for it. And there's only so much that I can do, I know that it's out of my control, but I have to say I have some feelings about that.

41
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.960
Jessica Freeman: I'm supposed to feel them and not stuff them and I would just like to say for the record that it sucks.

42
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

43
00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:03.510
Jessica Freeman: And then his family like his parents were there. I never had anything bad with his parents like we're cool. We've always been cool but they back away from you know what I mean, like, they're like,

44
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:16.770
Jessica Freeman: Oh, from a distance. And then I go up to my son after the thing. And he standing with everybody and they just kind of like just meander off into a side group and just like Man, there's no fucking reason for this knowing

45
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.320
Jessica Freeman: That it is what it is. I was there for my son and I was very glad he was so excited that we were there and

46
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.930
Jessica Freeman: Then on Saturday night.

47
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.130
Jessica Freeman: I went and met with my friends, and we went to the some like a Greeks pizzeria.

48
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.060
Jessica Freeman: Not

49
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:52.290
Jessica Freeman: Not too far from the meeting and my friend, Elaine, she gave me a really sweet card and some sweet gifts that were really meaningful and she gave a wonderful speech when I got my token I kind of really cool very special token.

50
00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:10.620
Jessica Freeman: Nice and, you know, pay me cry. It was great. And then Sunday I saw my friends Taylor and Jamie in the morning like just flat ass broke, but you don't even know how far they've come like when I met them there was like

51
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.910
Jessica Freeman: panhandling and prostitution and

52
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.790
Jessica Freeman: You know, hardcore drugs and stuff.

53
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:27.660
Jessica Freeman: And they have come so far. I think they've been sober, like, a year and a half now. They have an apartment. They have jobs Jamie's gotten two promotions. They have a car.

54
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.940
Jessica Freeman: You know, and maybe they don't have a lot of cash on hand, but oh my god, how far they have come

55
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:42.750
Jessica Freeman: And I just love them so much. I'm so freaking proud of them. I did. I got a couple i got i and i talked, and I got to be myself and just

56
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:56.340
Jessica Freeman: Pour out all this stuff just be me, you know, and that's another thing that I took away from the trip that I just really haven't brought authentic desk to the table here. I've been like a church mouse at work and

57
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:04.770
Jessica Freeman: You know, I'm not happy with the job and like proofreading transaction documents basically doing compliance work all the time, not happy with it.

58
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:17.490
Jessica Freeman: So, and then send so we went back down to the robotics tournament, and my son, bless his heart he suffered a major loss and like his team.

59
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.850
Jessica Freeman: Is out now and like they'll have another chance to re qualify in a couple of weeks. But, but, like,

60
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:33.120
Jessica Freeman: He was so heartbroken. He was so disappointed. And it was so hard, but I was also so glad that I could be there for him and

61
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:49.020
Jessica Freeman: I mean, there was no cheering him up, but I did make him giggle. A couple of times and I did you know I told him a story about when I was in high school and something you know really just similar happened to me and how hard it was. And I think it helped

62
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:56.340
Jessica Freeman: It was just really good to be there for him and be with him. And I've also like I've been trying to

63
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:03.000
Jessica Freeman: Text him. Like, if not every day, every other day since I got back because I just

64
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.620
Jessica Freeman: Have been bad about that I've let it go for weeks and like he's my son. He's my baby. I missed him and I want him to know how much

65
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:23.040
Jessica Freeman: Like I'm in. I want to stay involved and I want to stay connected and that's another thing I need to be really intentional about not let it slip through the cracks. So it was wonderful. It was it was a great, great job.

66
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. You needed that.

67
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.320
Jessica Freeman: Yes, I did. It was perfect timing.

68
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:36.810
Jessica Freeman: And my heart and, you know, it's just all these feelings. I've been. I mean, it really made me realize I've been kind of numb for a while.

69
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:50.970
Jessica Freeman: And having all these feelings. It just made me feel alive and like I want to, I want to hold on to that and quit making excuses. Get out of my shell, go do stuff have a life meet people.

70
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go ahead. Good.

71
00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:08.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because, you know, it's crazy because we forget about living you know we get in this whole mindset of working and taking care of the family and and just, you know, doing that we forget to live in this whole process to

72
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.560
Jessica Freeman: This very true.

73
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.310
You know,

74
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:19.320
Jessica Freeman: So I have, I have some other news on Thursday before the trip when I was at work after I talked to you.

75
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:30.780
Jessica Freeman: I got a call from another realty office that picked up my resume off of. Indeed, which has been inactive since January, but I guess it was meant to be. It's meant to be.

76
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:39.360
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, they set up an interview with me and I went to this interview on Monday, and instead of doing compliance. I'll actually be doing

77
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:56.850
Jessica Freeman: Digital and print design and you're doing some marketing and brochures and like online stuff like social media like all the stuff that I love to do that. I'm really passionate about and that's what they want me to do an hourly is $4 more per hour.

78
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:06.750
Jessica Freeman: Wow. Yeah. So I took it, of course, are they called me 20 minutes after the interview and get and offered me the job. So I think it's going to be a really good fit. I started on Monday.

79
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No days.

80
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Oh, how exciting laughable.

81
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:21.870
Jessica Freeman: And I actually, I made I sent a text or maybe an email but I reached out to somebody that was like a friend that I met at Coldwell Banker and I said hey,

82
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.870
Jessica Freeman: Do you like trivia. I love trivia. There's trivia every night of the week in this town. What do you think you want to go.

83
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:43.440
Jessica Freeman: I need friends, man. I need to life and and he was like, oh yeah, let's go. Now, I made it very clear that like this is friends only and boys are stupid. He may even still be confused, but I'm gonna like he's way too young for me. He's a ginger, not my time but

84
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:57.090
Jessica Freeman: We got along really well and I thought it would be really cool to just go out and I was like, bring people bring people I know, bring people. I don't know. I don't care. Let's just go out, so he got back to me and we're gonna do some we're going to go out to trivia Friday night now.

85
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:58.860
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

86
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, what a. What an amazing rejuvenation.

87
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I mean,

88
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.390
Jessica Freeman: Big time. Big time. I needed it so bad.

89
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just good stuff. Good stuff, you come back you have this open heart. You have this open mind. You got a new job, you know,

90
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You you put in your notice and

91
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have a week and then or are you off this whole week and i mean

92
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:32.100
Jessica Freeman: I put in. Notice, but I'm off this week, you know, it's never fun, leaving a job, even under the best of circumstances. It's not fun, leaving a job.

93
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:45.840
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, but I thank them for the opportunity and I apologize for, you know, wasting time and resources like if I if I had known that I was going to be in a corner proofreading documents all day every day.

94
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:56.070
Jessica Freeman: I wouldn't have wasted anyone's time. It's just not as I can't do it. I can't, like, another thing I took from the trip is that it's important that

95
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.930
Jessica Freeman: For me, that

96
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:11.070
Jessica Freeman: That I'm not having anything or anyone put a cap on my potential like my boss. She didn't see me and part of that's me. I didn't show me.

97
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.150
Jessica Freeman: But that's what I need to do I need to be who I am. And that's what I did.

98
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:24.360
Jessica Freeman: Like in the interview right after the trip. I mean, I was I just walked in there and I was totally comfortable in my own skin. And I just am who I am and

99
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:38.490
Jessica Freeman: Just spoke freely and it was, it was great, you know, totally connected, but no, it was not fun, leaving cold. Well, but I tried to do my best. You know, to leave bridges intact and be respectful and

100
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.480
Jessica Freeman: Gratitude.

101
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. WELL, IT'S CRAZY, BUT IT. Another good piece of it is that you have the week.

102
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:51.630
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Oh, it's been, I've been so exhausted. Like I said, it's Thursday. I'm trying to catch up. I'm still on brought up.

103
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.350
Mm hmm.

104
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, but you get this time, you know,

105
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:12.480
Jessica Freeman: Another thing I've been thinking about is, like, so I'm scrolling through like HBO and Netflix and Amazon Prime and Hulu and I'm seeing all the stuff on on TV and all the movies that have ever been made and

106
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:30.090
Jessica Freeman: I know I've said this before. I don't know if I've said it to you, but so much garbage. It's like so much garbage and all these like so much money is getting spent on this garbage when there are. There's so much need in the world, and they're just

107
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:37.590
Jessica Freeman: churning out garbage and like spending billions of dollars on it every year. It's just insane. Yeah.

108
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.920
Jessica Freeman: Kind of what I can do about it. But I gotta say it bugs, the shit out of me.

109
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

110
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. There's a lot of

111
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. I agree.

112
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do the same thing. I'll scroll scroll through and I can't find anything that I want, or

113
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Interest me to be able to sit down and watch. I mean, there used to be good wholesome movies are used to be good. You know what I mean. And it just feels like

114
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

115
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.480
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and nobody's making good music anymore.

116
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.580
Jessica Freeman: And all the movies. It's like just a regurgitation of past ideas with a bigger budget.

117
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.900
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. Stupid.

118
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

119
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.120
I agree waste.

120
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree. Definitely. Um, how is things with your son.

121
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.670
Jessica Freeman: My little one.

122
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:37.800
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, um, he's good. It's picture day so of course he got breakfast all over his shirt.

123
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.720
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

124
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:55.410
Jessica Freeman: No. He's good. He's good still on the proverbial waiting list for ABA I'm just planning on him finishing OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR AT COLE charter. And so far, so good.

125
00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:07.260
Jessica Freeman: I'm going to accompany his class on a field trip. Next Thursday to the Zoo. And the main reason I want to do that just for his safety yeah cuz he's a runner like he he could get

126
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:18.240
Jessica Freeman: He's, he's unpredictable. I'm his mom. Okay, I can predict him better than anybody but still he shocked the hell out of me.

127
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It really does.

128
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:30.900
Jessica Freeman: So I want to just, I know how he'll do at the zoo. And so I just kind of want to be there to make sure and I think everybody's going to appreciate that, honestly, because

129
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

130
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.240
Jessica Freeman: It's a lot. It's

131
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it is a lot and it's cool that you're able to be present and go with him, you know. These are memories that we make with our kids that we can never replace you know

132
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:45.840
Yeah.

133
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:57.780
Jessica Freeman: Robotics thing was so important for Brendan, even though it was a loss. You know, I think maybe because it was a loss. He might even look back on it more and take that memory with them, you know,

134
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. So you didn't get to have any kind of good, decent conversation with your ex husband or your ex in laws they just stayed really distant

135
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:22.140
Jessica Freeman: That's what they always do. And my mom actually because I was bitching about it, I was like, you don't have to do that, like, I'm not going to be mean to anybody. I mean,

136
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:32.850
Jessica Freeman: What, why do they have to back away. You know, so I'm bitching about it to my mom and she's like, do you know why he can't look at you and I was like, no.

137
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:48.840
Jessica Freeman: And she says she said that he was so in love with you, Jessica. And he broke his heart. And I'm like, Well, I've had Inklings about that. Okay. Maybe that's the deal, but I've had my heart broken a few times.

138
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.960
Jessica Freeman: My bad kids died broke my heart. You know what, I can still like suck it up and

139
00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.030
Jessica Freeman: You know, be a co parent, the parent you civil be a human.

140
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:08.130
Jessica Freeman: It, it sucks that Scott doesn't have the skills to be able to deal with his emotions like that.

141
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.590
Jessica Freeman: I mean, it makes me sad.

142
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, if

143
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If US adults as adults would just get out of our own way, things would go so much smoother and better for the for the kids. You know what I mean.

144
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to keep an eye on the prize, which is the which is the child. Do you not. I mean, they're the ones that are affected the most and you know your son felt it to. You know what I mean. He felt that

145
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Between you guys, you know what I mean. And it's sad because you know is all the day should have been about was about him, you know,

146
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.160
Jessica Freeman: Well, I didn't make a scene or anything. I just, I was really happy and bubbly and

147
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:56.310
Jessica Freeman: You know, just want there to spend time with them. Oh. Get this. Get this. Okay. So at the very beginning before I even had a chance to like hug him because he was doing something

148
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:08.700
Jessica Freeman: They made this announcement about how like in the whole robotics like statewide organization they only have one way that they can honor the individual

149
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:20.370
Jessica Freeman: Rather than the team and it's like this. This Dean's List award and it'll put him like first on the list for like over 200 scholarships like worldwide.

150
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:35.790
Jessica Freeman: So it's like this. Dean's List award or whatever. And they're like, what all the the recipients of this award stand up and there's like six kids and the entire arena. My son is one of them. My son, I was like,

151
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.220
Jessica Freeman: Cool. Ah, so I was like so.

152
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:49.230
Jessica Freeman: Just, I mean, and then my mom was like, oh, you should have seen his face when you were having him and telling him how proud of you proud of me. You are so I guess like it made him really happy.

153
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good to know even

154
00:18:51.930 --> 00:19:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Back. Yeah. And just, you know, I can't even imagine. I can't imagine you know being a kid and feeling supported and seeing your parents. You know what I mean having your mom there.

155
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:11.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, from the other side of the country to be able to be there be present. You know, that's huge. And that's memories. He's always going to have, you know what I mean.

156
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is awesome. Yeah, almost made me cry.

157
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:28.530
Jessica Freeman: I've given them. I've given them some bad ones over the course of his life. So it's, it means that much more to be able to give him some good ones.

158
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. These are things that

159
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:45.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That we forget about in even people even people outside of the addiction field that normal everyday. You know what I mean that they don't struggle with it that didn't have, you know, this period of

160
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Addiction they you know they don't appreciate these little things. It's like another day. You know, they forget the importance of these things they forget about being present.

161
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:04.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and being up front and being there and being available. You know, it's just another day or just another you know thing. And when you sit me people. I'm a people watcher

162
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:23.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you sit and you watch people, you know, in those scenarios and you wonder, how come they don't feel you know as bubbly as present. You know what I mean. And I got it. It was like it was because they haven't had to have that rough struggle to realize and appreciate what's good

163
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what these things are about, and how much they really mean to our kids, you know,

164
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:42.120
Jessica Freeman: I agree. I agree. I will never take it for granted, man. Any, any little gift that I'm able to give my son, or that I get, because I'm with him. I, I will never take it for granted ever

165
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pretty amazing.

166
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you start a new job on Monday.

167
00:20:48.300 --> 00:21:00.600
Jessica Freeman: I'm excited. I'm excited about the job. The people seem great I get to wear jeans. I don't have to take a lunch hour so I can just go in for my four or five hours and be done. It's not going to have to take up a whole damn day

168
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:15.990
Jessica Freeman: It's, I don't have to answer phones, I have to proofread anything but I'm I did say you know i mean i have 13 plus years as a paralegal so I have wicked ass administration skills. So if there's anything like we're just talking about like cross training.

169
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.370
Jessica Freeman: You know, and

170
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.940
Jessica Freeman: The girl that I'm going to be, you know, working with

171
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:31.530
Jessica Freeman: Like she's like the office manager type she's just really excited to have me on board. I'm excited to be there. Everybody seems just great. So yea.

172
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.430
Yea,

173
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:52.800
Jessica Freeman: Create I'll get to design. I'll get to like, you know, not be limited to menial tasks. I'm actually going to get to explore some new software and you know she's like, however you want to do it. You know, this is your thing just

174
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:58.500
Jessica Freeman: Be free and like, okay, great, because, you know, that's exactly what I want to do.

175
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, I actually, I made it made

176
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:15.300
Jessica Freeman: This whole process and the last few weeks. Well, a couple months actually learning about, you know, the whole realtor deal. And then, you know, missing what I was doing my old job and then now I have this opportunity to go into this new thing.

177
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.910
Jessica Freeman: You know, I decided I don't want to be a realtor. I think I don't know if I told you that

178
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.320
Jessica Freeman: I don't have to

179
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:32.910
Jessica Freeman: Desire to make it a lifestyle. I don't have the like the all in mentality that it requires and I don't have the resilience to be in

180
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:39.540
Jessica Freeman: Sales like that. I just don't I know myself. And I'll have a hard time with the rejection of sales.

181
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:51.030
Jessica Freeman: But I do love all of this, this, you know, the print design digital design web development, you know, marketing, social media like all that content creation.

182
00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:10.950
Jessica Freeman: I just, I love it. It's what I did at my last job, so I I've actually talked to my mom about oh, we did talk about this. We did I talked to her about, you know, maybe take not taking a break from work, but over the like the real estate slows down for a period of time, usually in the fall.

183
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.200
Jessica Freeman: And winter, like when it's cold.

184
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.970
Jessica Freeman: It's not that cold here, but whatever.

185
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.780
And

186
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:33.870
Jessica Freeman: So I want to like take some classes, you know, learn some new software graphic design some more coding and then do the side work and stuff like pickups and things on the side and then maybe you know hang a shingle. So I text my mom about all this and her husband and they are both like

187
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:46.620
Jessica Freeman: Great. They are in full support, they think it's exactly what I should be doing, you know I told them I just eventually I want to work for myself. I mean, Not anytime soon. But eventually, it's

188
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:53.340
Jessica Freeman: Going to be really good for me and they are great and they're on board and they're supportive. So, yes.

189
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go ahead. What is going on.

190
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.240
Every day.

191
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.600
Jessica Freeman: It's a new wave of awesomeness.

192
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:06.480
Jessica Freeman: That there was a huge wave of awesomeness. You know, and then it's been kind of a low and

193
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:06.900
Jessica Freeman: Now it's

194
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is really, really good.

195
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really good.

196
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, you've got every you've got so much going on so much good stuff going on. You know, it's just amazing. Yeah.

197
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:26.520
Jessica Freeman: I'm in a good place right now. I mean, and I know I have a lot of work to do.

198
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:41.010
Jessica Freeman: It's gonna, it's not gonna be easy. And there's going to be stuff that you know gets put in my path. There's going to be setbacks. There's going to be obstacles. That's okay. It's okay. Like, I can handle that. Look what I've been through, man.

199
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

200
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:57.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you know, really, that makes you resilient. That's the funny part about it. It's like every obstacle makes you more and more and more resilient, you know, for the next one and it's pretty amazing.

201
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, through the muscles.

202
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:12.420
Jessica Freeman: And remembering that i'm i'm where I'm supposed to be right now that I don't have to get ahead of myself. I don't have to worry because my higher power is he's in charge. I'm not

203
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.930
Jessica Freeman: I'm responsible for the effort. That's my job.

204
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:20.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah look at he open that door and you walked right through it.

205
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With grace. You know what I mean.

206
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely, definitely. Amazing.

207
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:42.570
Jessica Freeman: I'm excited. I wish things have gotten better with Coldwell Banker. I really do. But you know, I said what I needed to say, and I feel like I had the right attitude and the rest is not on me. Yeah.

208
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was their response that they give you a response to what you told them.

209
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:54.420
Jessica Freeman: They were just real short. You know, like, Okay. Good luck. Yeah. Don't let the door hit you.

210
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.760
Jessica Freeman: Know, I mean, I get it. I do.

211
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:08.100
Jessica Freeman: Because they really want they want me to. They don't get smart people in my position in that position very often.

212
00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.560
Jessica Freeman: I mean it's $10 an hour.

213
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:11.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, wow.

214
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:20.310
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I've never worked for that little night, even in high school, I always made better money than that. But anyway, it's $10 an hour, it's a part time admin job.

215
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:27.000
Jessica Freeman: So they don't get a lot of a good quality candidates. So for me to come in and they're like, okay, like

216
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:32.940
Jessica Freeman: We see that you like we can train you on this. So that's all they wanted to train me on

217
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:46.200
Jessica Freeman: You know the transaction documents when I started. I mean, I had a list of stuff that these were going to be my responsibilities and it turned out that all they wanted me to do was proofread transaction documents.

218
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.140
Jessica Freeman: And some mind numbing shit. I can't

219
00:26:49.440 --> 00:27:01.890
Jessica Freeman: I can't do that all day, every day I got to have some some liberty. I gotta be able to stretch my arms and my you know my brain. I can't do that all the time.

220
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

221
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.380
Jessica Freeman: It would a little you do it, maybe even media, but not all the time. Yeah.

222
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that would be pretty

223
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Boring.

224
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.260
Jessica Freeman: Yes parched.

225
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.410
Jessica Freeman: King open

226
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.220
Right.

227
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's probably part of, you know, the misery and the discontent and being able to expand and open up and get a job that not only pays more money.

228
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, but actually touches on the areas that you have a passion for makes a huge difference.

229
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

230
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The quality of life. Oh my gosh. Here it is.

231
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.960
Jessica Freeman: You know, I thought, I thought that I would be, I mean, Mary Kay told me when I first started that I would be doing

232
00:27:49.380 --> 00:28:02.310
Jessica Freeman: That I could do the social media stuff like I could take it over. And for me, that would be great because I could create the, you know, content digital content and you know the written content and I would be really happy with that. But

233
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.980
Jessica Freeman: I never got to touch it and she she told me she was like

234
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:11.790
Jessica Freeman: This is what I want you to do like this, it's really important that you get this and this. So this is all you're gonna do. Okay.

235
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:28.440
Jessica Freeman: And then she told me like my, my understanding what I was trained to do the first two weeks that I was there was to do all the stuff in the office, like the the the technology, the you know the software into and to be able to help the agents.

236
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:41.730
Jessica Freeman: With what they need in and then Mary Kay told me not to help the agents at all. She's like, don't even engage in conversation with them unless it's work related and it has to be under five minutes. Okay, she's like

237
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

238
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.990
Jessica Freeman: Said, you're not here for them. You're here for me. And this is what I need you to doing

239
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lots of crazy.

240
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.500
Yeah.

241
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.180
Jessica Freeman: Seriously.

242
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.290
Wow.

243
00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:04.710
Jessica Freeman: I thought I was. I thought that was the job was to help agents, you know, know how to use the software to obtain the forms and, you know,

244
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:16.320
Jessica Freeman: Upload and sort and name and assign and all the stuff that you need to do it on software. So I learned all that software and I can help the agents with stuff there for

245
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:24.540
Jessica Freeman: Two months I could totally help them with whatever they needed but all that training just went to waste. So I could look at transaction.

246
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.910
Jessica Freeman: Book my life.

247
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lot didn't. That doesn't make a lick of sense. I wonder what changed.

248
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:40.680
Jessica Freeman: Mary Kay told me to forget everything that I was trained in the first two weeks. She said, I'm the one that pays you you're here, you're here for me, you're not here for anybody else.

249
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:43.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Huh.

250
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, well it's over.

251
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.850
Jessica Freeman: Yes, thank God.

252
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No more of that done.

253
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.340
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited about the new job.

254
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So have you been able to go to a meeting since you got back

255
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.890
Jessica Freeman: Was I got back as it could have, but I haven't

256
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:14.250
Jessica Freeman: That's something I need to do. I just honestly just been trying to like recover like physically and just being so so exhausted bone deep, man.

257
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:15.240
Tired.

258
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.410
Jessica Freeman: I feel better today than I have any other day

259
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.400
Jessica Freeman: But I do need to get some stuff done because key and is off school tomorrow. And then the weekend starts

260
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:36.840
Jessica Freeman: I do have a thing tomorrow. I have to go to an assessment with New Mexico works. So I got to see it, my pay stubs.

261
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:43.170
Jessica Freeman: I think, I think that's all I need to read that letter. Again, I gotta take a bunch of shit in go spend two hours.

262
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.720
Jessica Freeman: Even though I already have a job.

263
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.520
Jessica Freeman: You Mexico.

264
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.050
Yeah.

265
00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:06.660
Jessica Freeman: So I'm thinking, since I'm going to get like queued up for that tomorrow, like, you know, hair, makeup cute outfit. Whatever, I'll probably go to the to the the licensed branch and get my new mexico driver's license.

266
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.490
Jessica Freeman: I can do that.

267
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.250
Jessica Freeman: I need to do that.

268
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:12.930
Jessica Freeman: live here.

269
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.980
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it needs to become a new Mexican

270
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.640
Jessica Freeman: No longer Hoosier

271
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A whole longer. How does that feel when you say that

272
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.800
Jessica Freeman: It feels really good. I got I got mixed feelings on it though, a little bit because like

273
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.200
Jessica Freeman: When I die.

274
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.770
Jessica Freeman: It's my funeral than to be here or there.

275
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.680
I don't know.

276
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.090
Jessica Freeman: I want my ashes spread somewhere or turned into a diamond.

277
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:55.350
Jessica Freeman: Or a tree or something, I don't know me into a tree and then you can Shel Silverstein my ass.

278
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.510
Jessica Freeman: Seriously though,

279
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:00.900
Like

280
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.620
Jessica Freeman: Where would I would I have a funeral. Well, I'll be

281
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.330
Jessica Freeman: Probably back at home because at this point because my family's there.

282
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

283
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.690
Jessica Freeman: The longer I'm here. Is that going to change.

284
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:16.800
Maybe

285
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.650
Jessica Freeman: So that's a quandary.

286
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:36.330
Jessica Freeman: But it's not that right now. I mean, who knows it is what it is, but I don't know it feels good, because I'm doing something new, most people aren't brave man, people will get, like, especially from where I'm from people, people have never even been to California.

287
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.170
Jessica Freeman: They go to be. I know, right. They just don't go

288
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:48.690
Jessica Freeman: It just don't go, they go to Florida to go to like the lakes and Kentucky and Tennessee. Don't even go to the northeast, much like

289
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything is

290
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From the East Coast to the West Coast, that's for sure.

291
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:54.660
Jessica Freeman: Oh, yeah.

292
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:55.830
You know,

293
00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The weather, the weather alone is is crazy. The humidity.

294
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.700
Oh god.

295
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

296
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.430
Jessica Freeman: No, it's great, though. I mean, I moved to Vegas in my late 20s.

297
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:26.790
Jessica Freeman: And while it was like if it was just me. That was you know what an awesome experience. You know, I learned so much and blah, blah, blah. But it wasn't just me. I affected my son, and now it says, I don't want to say it's a regret, but it's definitely regret.

298
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:35.010
Jessica Freeman: To now being here on like a family sanctioned move like whoa, like it's good to be here.

299
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.930
Jessica Freeman: And everyone is supportive of it like it's good. It feels really good.

300
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.450
Jessica Freeman: Kind of weird.

301
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.250
Jessica Freeman: I'll get used to it.

302
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You will

303
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:46.410
You will

304
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:55.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The more that you develop your support system here, you know, in New Mexico. The more that you get acclimated

305
00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:11.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The better it starts feeling it doesn't mean that you're all you're, you're going to lose that connection from the people you know in the East Coast, but it just means that you'll have that dual life, you'll be happy here and you'll be happy there. You know what I mean.

306
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Down.

307
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it just takes it just takes time and adjustment and

308
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Perseverance, you know it does.

309
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you'll find the right meeting, you'll find the right glitch. You'll find the right people.

310
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:39.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I just kind of have a feeling that this new job is going to open up you know all of this possibility and potential for you to be able to you know get to know people and be who you're supposed to be, you know,

311
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.470
Yeah.

312
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:46.710
Jessica Freeman: Well, you know, this job that I just left is right around the corner from my house.

313
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.750
Jessica Freeman: So I would go to work.

314
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:55.140
Jessica Freeman: And I would come home on lunch. LET IT GO BACK TO WORK AND I WILL COME STRAIGHT HOME. SO THIS NEW JOB IS

315
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.890
Jessica Freeman: 1520 minutes away depending on traffic. It's on the northwest side I'm on the northeast side.

316
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.120
Jessica Freeman: So that means I won't be coming home for lunch anymore.

317
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:14.310
Jessica Freeman: Which is good because it's going to force me to take that that personal recreational time and do something else with it.

318
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.150
Yeah.

319
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah branch out

320
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:19.680
Jessica Freeman: Huh.

321
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This would be go

322
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.410
Jessica Freeman: That'd be good. It'll be good and trivia Friday.

323
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:34.620
Jessica Freeman: I loved trivia. Don't ask me sports questions, but just about everything else I can hang in there so

324
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You guys, where do you go for that.

325
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:43.680
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. They got trivia. Well, it's a bars, but I'm okay with that. Now like I couldn't do that before.

326
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:52.590
Jessica Freeman: But I've been like, you know, Toby and I went to the drag show like three times now everybody's drink, and I don't care I had work events at my last job.

327
00:35:52.860 --> 00:36:00.060
Jessica Freeman: Where you know people are drinking all around me and seriously. It doesn't bother me. I have absolutely no desire to drink that because

328
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:11.130
Jessica Freeman: I'm not going to look like these people look when they're drinking. I'm going to make an ass of myself and I'm going to hurt myself or someone else. And I'm going to lose things that are valuable to me.

329
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:19.530
Jessica Freeman: And it's just I don't even. I don't even think about it. I don't even like the smell. It's like people can do what they do. I don't have any trouble and

330
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:32.130
Jessica Freeman: Like if I ever felt like I was at risk to do that exit strategy. Hey, I'm not going to stay in a situation where I feel like, oh, I really want to, like, that sounds like a good idea. It's not a good idea.

331
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:45.120
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I mean, I've worked too hard and come too far, I have rebuilt my life from the ground up from the gutter. OK, and now I'm here. It's not worth it. It's not worth it.

332
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's absolutely not worth it. You know, you've got all these good things that are happening. You know what I mean. And it opening that door would just take it all. And it's kind of amazing that

333
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:05.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're aware of that. You know what I mean. And you have that solidity in your mind that says absolutely no way, you know,

334
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, important

335
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:21.360
Jessica Freeman: Well, if I hadn't had that period of relapse. You know, I probably wouldn't be as definitive about it as I am now because I spent a year just revolving in and out of the rooms and it was miserable.

336
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:29.850
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, you just don't want to ever go back to that ever so yeah trivia is at bars, but you don't have to worry about me or the okay

337
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:41.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. I like the fact that you have that you know that mindset and you know you know where you're at in your where you're in a good place, mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, you know what I mean.

338
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:52.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have a really good place and knowing that going in there having an exit strategy is, you know, vitally important, you have that, you know what I mean.

339
00:37:52.410 --> 00:38:10.050
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, yeah. And I'd rather like you know help people. Or if somebody asked me why I'm not drinking, I would instead of being like embarrassed or. Oh, I guess I should I be like, well, this is why I'm not drinking because I'm an alcoholic and because

340
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.920
Jessica Freeman: You know, I just, here's my story.

341
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.370
Jessica Freeman: I already went through all you know i'd rather help somebody

342
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:24.150
Jessica Freeman: With my experience then have somebody else's experience make me feel bad or weird

343
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.210
Jessica Freeman: Like, I need to do something that I know I don't want to do

344
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.340
Jessica Freeman: I'm just, I'm beyond that now.

345
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.030
Yeah.

346
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of amazing when you do get the point. You know,

347
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.890
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's great.

348
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:46.170
Jessica Freeman: Another thing I took from the trip. And there's a piece of my recovery that's been missing since I got here and I just completely overlooked it service.

349
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah service work.

350
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:58.500
Jessica Freeman: I need to be doing that I need to be doing that and I had a service position in Indianapolis. I was a secretary treasurer for a meeting for a long time.

351
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:09.150
Jessica Freeman: And I left that position. I came here and I can't walk into that kind of a position here because the meetings are different, you know i don't i don't know the structure yet of how

352
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:17.580
Jessica Freeman: Because of all these different me it's just it's a different world. So I'm not ready to be a chairperson and or a secretary treasurer, because I don't really know how it goes. Yeah.

353
00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:30.510
Jessica Freeman: Get there. I'll get there. But in the meantime, it's not. I can't give myself a pass on service work for that, like, I need, I need to still be doing something. I'm going to, I'm going to do that, like, definitely. It's a big piece.

354
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what are you going to do

355
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:41.790
Jessica Freeman: Well, I'm going to start by going early and staying late setting up and tearing down talking to people.

356
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.810
Jessica Freeman: That's a good place to start. And then I'm going to

357
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.260
Jessica Freeman: You know, look for opportunities. Maybe there's like a fundraiser. Maybe there's

358
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.530
Jessica Freeman: An event that needs organized like stuff I'm good at like that where I can really help.

359
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

360
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.550
Jessica Freeman: God, I'll open the door.

361
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.450
Someone

362
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:11.700
Jessica Freeman: Need to have an attitude of service. It's about that attitude. It's about the willingness to take the time and put in the effort.

363
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:27.660
Jessica Freeman: And I don't think I'm ready to sponsor anybody right now is because I don't know how they do it here, but I do, I do want to be available to give rides to people. I want to be like a friend to the newcomer

364
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:31.560
Jessica Freeman: I think I can do those things.

365
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.730
Jessica Freeman: That's pretty awesome. Thanks.

366
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:36.690
You know,

367
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, you can't keep it if you don't give it away.

368
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:45.000
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and I haven't been doing much of anything. So I need to

369
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.860
Jessica Freeman: I'm going to do that.

370
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.270
Jessica Freeman: I know how I feel when I do that, and it's worth it.

371
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes a difference.

372
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.870
Jessica Freeman: It really does.

373
00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:57.840
Jessica Freeman: Is my recovery is not just about me.

374
00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Long

375
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:08.880
Jessica Freeman: It can't be. It has to be about. I mean hell. That's the whole 12 step, you get to this whole step you carry a message. What have I been doing. I've been hoarding the message.

376
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.970
Jessica Freeman: I gave it away.

377
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But at the same time, you got to give yourself.

378
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A little bit of leeway because of the move and the job and you know getting

379
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:32.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To new places tough, you know, one thing we hate is change. And it seems like that's always consistent. Right. So one thing that's that's a constant in life is change.

380
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah. So being able to adjust to that and, you know, working out these you know these things with your son and making sure his appointments are met his needs are met.

381
00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, it's tough. And it is so stressful to move from one place to another, to leave your support system, go to a place where you have family.

382
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:59.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But now you got to rebuild everything else. You know what I mean, it's tough. It's tough. And so here you go.

383
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right been here and now you went back, you got your cup full you're coming back with an open mind and open heart with motivation with everything you're seeing things in a whole different light.

384
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:12.660
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

385
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:19.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And that's huge got a new job right after that, you know, you've only been back. You know what a week.

386
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.520
Jessica Freeman: Not even

387
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.450
Like four days.

388
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:30.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And all these things are just falling into place. All of a sudden, you know, what are we, and it's it's amazing to watch

389
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:38.130
Jessica Freeman: Thank you. It's amazing to experience and I'm super grateful for it because I was in, I was in a little

390
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.440
Jessica Freeman: bubble of self pity.

391
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:54.600
Jessica Freeman: And that you know it's okay to do that for a minute, but you can't stay there. So I'm going to like give myself grace on these past few months because of everything you just said with the move like that was that. And now,

392
00:42:54.930 --> 00:43:05.940
Jessica Freeman: I know what my goals are. I know what's important to me and I like in a rejuvenated way. It's new, it's fresh. I'm motivated and I'm going to do it.

393
00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Move forward.

394
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Awesome.

395
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you still planning on did you, you got to spend time with your sponsor.

396
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:21.450
Jessica Freeman: Oh, I haven't seen her since I've been back. I'm actually going to shoot her text today and be like, Hey, let's get together. Oh.

397
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:31.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. I bet you she'll be happy to hear and see where you're at, you know, the place that you're sitting at right now. She'll be like, what

398
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.530
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, make your job easy right

399
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:37.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

400
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.740
Jessica Freeman: No, you're a super helpful, though, like with the affirmations and

401
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:49.560
Jessica Freeman: You know, some of the things you've said, I've just been really, really helpful. And it's really good to have somebody to talk to. Is my mom is not the one she's just not

402
00:43:50.040 --> 00:44:02.190
Jessica Freeman: Like, I have to tell her over and over again, Mom. If I'm upset about something, you don't have to do anything just hugged me and say, Oh honey, honey. That sucks. I love you. That's it. That's all you have to do.

403
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:12.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, she still didn't get it. She didn't get it. She may never get it. That's okay. I'll just keep reminding her say that and then she'll make fun of me. She was like, well, that's that's honey like woman.

404
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:27.330
Jessica Freeman: She's great though we had fun mom and I had fun on the trip we always we've always traveled well together. I thought maybe it might be dramatic, but now she's great. She's great. We had

405
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To everything she wasn't sick through the whole trip.

406
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:35.010
Jessica Freeman: She got antibiotics, the day before. And in her mind that made her well

407
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:46.080
Jessica Freeman: She is a person. She's the person that like she will not leave the doctor's office without an antibiotic, you know, if that's what she wants. And that's what she's going to get. She's really forceful

408
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.930
Jessica Freeman: So she got what she wanted. And then, you know, mentally that like that made her feel okay so she was okay.

409
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that's good.

410
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally good. And there was no issues that came up no arguments. No.

411
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.390
Jessica Freeman: She got pissed off at me about something that I did a month ago.

412
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:13.350
Jessica Freeman: And it was an accident. Like, it was like a total misunderstanding. It was a stupid thing I had asked her husband to sell something on eBay for me.

413
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:21.570
Jessica Freeman: And then like they sold it, but the sale fell through. And so he gave it back to me. I didn't know that he was still trying to sell it on eBay.

414
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:33.150
Jessica Freeman: So I actually gave gave it was a digital camera I gave it to Toby, because he wanted to take all these pictures and it was he was here for a month with us. I just really wanted to give him something special.

415
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.820
Jessica Freeman: And it was my side.

416
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:42.930
Jessica Freeman: But then Bob sold it on eBay. And he was like, oh, hey, I need you know I need, I need you to ship that out. And I was like, oh,

417
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.280
Jessica Freeman: So my mom was like, well, yeah.

418
00:45:49.410 --> 00:46:06.630
Jessica Freeman: She was pissed off. And this was like on our drive down to Bloomington on Saturday morning, and I was like, Listen, I have accepted responsibility. I have told you I was wrong. It was a mistake. I'm sorry it's done, it's over. I can't do anything to change it.

419
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.930
Jessica Freeman: Are we going to ruin the whole trip. No.

420
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:15.000
Jessica Freeman: So she said, They're fuming for about 10 or 15 more minutes.

421
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.740
Jessica Freeman: And then I played some music we saying we're fine.

422
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good.

423
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good, good, good. I'm glad that it didn't run you guys this trip and that everything turned out really good.

424
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.470
Jessica Freeman: It was good. I got my hair down to see the color I got cut so pretty.

425
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.340
Looks good.

426
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me,

427
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did, did you put affirmations up

428
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:50.070
Jessica Freeman: Oh, I knew you weren't here. So I got them in the mail in their hearts. Okay, so what I do.

429
00:46:50.610 --> 00:47:04.770
Jessica Freeman: Is and I'm going to do the post it thing too, because I needed to be like personal I just got these and they're really fun. So you spread the cards out, blah blah blah, and then you pray like hey something meaningful for me today. Not like tarot cards.

430
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.330
Jessica Freeman: Then you pick one. And then, you know, I see what today some

431
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:27.450
Jessica Freeman: Options, as I open to the abundant possibilities of my life's path. I'm reminded that I always have unlimited options. Life is a buffet and I allow myself to choose whatever makes me happiest without limiting thoughts like you can't put mac and cheese on your baked potato.

432
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hahaha

433
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:30.720
Jessica Freeman: I like it.

434
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.000
Jessica Freeman: And it's super relevant right

435
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is right.

436
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:54.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of like opening up you know your daily meditation book and just picking one picking whatever's there to read. It's amazing how you can do that even in the in the big book, you can do that and it just seems that what you need to hear is right in front of you.

437
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.940
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. If you're open to it. If that's what if that's what you want and you ask for it.

438
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.280
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I agree.

439
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.040
Jessica Freeman: Put up the post itself.

440
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that one that you just read is super relevant

441
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.130
Jessica Freeman: Crazy.

442
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is crazy, but I love stuff like that when it just kind of aligns up because it's a reaffirmation that what we believe and the path that we're on is exactly where we need to be, you know,

443
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:28.020
Yeah.

444
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

445
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What a great what a great place. You started my day out. Awesome.

446
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.430
Jessica Freeman: Not just for just anymore.

447
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good. I was really, I was very hopeful for your trip. I really thought that you were going to have, you know, a lot of good

448
00:48:47.190 --> 00:49:04.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Come out of it. You know, it's always good when you're going back. First off, to be with your kid and then Second off, you know, for that sober support system, it's just always feeling it's just always gold. Yeah. You know what I mean. And you got exactly what I thought you get out of it.

449
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.480
Jessica Freeman: Even more actually even more. Yeah.

450
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:18.180
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I was I was trying to open myself up and I was hoping for, you know, get that that spiritual and the love and support and everything, but like what I got out of it was so much more than I expected.

451
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:33.600
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I got some clarity on some things I got some vision, like on what I need to be doing that I've lost sight of, you know, I got some just real real like a real rejuvenation. Like you said, spiritually, you know,

452
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:35.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing.

453
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

454
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, knowing now that you need to

455
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:46.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be connected and stay connected. No. If ands, or buts, and that needs to be implemented in your, you know, routine.

456
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And the more that you build where you're at.

457
00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:57.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The more you'll still love what you have over there, too. You know what I mean, it's kind of a direct connection.

458
00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that's going to be pretty amazing to there's nothing but good things and you know I tell people all the time that

459
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When we get server and we start changing our life, things aren't always going to come into line, the way we think that it should, but they always come into line the way they're supposed to be.

460
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:17.130
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

461
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know we just got to be open to see it and start focusing on the good things that are going on in our life and work through the negative stuff. You know what I mean. But the human nature is to always focus on the negative stuff.

462
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when

463
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When we do that we forget all the good

464
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And the good is what fills us

465
00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The good is what makes us happy.

466
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what keeps us motivated and you know what I mean, it's just our nature to go straight for that negativity.

467
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

468
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:59.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We have to make a conscious decision to say, you know what today. I don't care what gets done on my path. I'm going to keep a positive attitude. I'm going to, you know, go forward with grace.

469
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the doors.

470
00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They just open

471
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.930
Jessica Freeman: They fly open

472
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:12.600
Jessica Freeman: Like unexpected doors. He wouldn't even have thought of. And it's, it's great. One of the first things I learned when I like started

473
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.470
Jessica Freeman: You know, addiction treatment therapy stuff.

474
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.410
Jessica Freeman: Was to take the words.

475
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:26.550
Jessica Freeman: Word should at, like, just out of my vocabulary not should all over myself.

476
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:32.130
Jessica Freeman: And yes, yeah. Because that it's those expectations that

477
00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:42.510
Jessica Freeman: That I you know I get this picture in my head, and I think it's going to be this way. And it's not that way and then that just burst my bubble. But if I didn't have that expectation at all, then I would

478
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:53.370
Jessica Freeman: Be fine with whatever I got so that's something I've been practicing since day one. And I it's really helped with the acceptance stuff and you know rolling with the punches.

479
00:51:53.730 --> 00:52:00.990
Jessica Freeman: And then when you can get that in line, then the emotional regulation comes kind of naturally because you're not reacting to everything.

480
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:10.890
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and set up for disappointment and it's it's really, it's good. We don't, we don't should up in here.

481
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right. Hey,

482
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What it should. It does get them out there to get them out the door because they don't do any good.

483
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, I talked that all the time because it's, you know, we can regret and we can hold on to guilt. We can hold on to all of that stuff that we did or said, or, you know, in the past, but what good is that doing helping us move forward.

484
00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it doesn't do us any good. It's good that we recognize that we needed to change those behaviors that we don't want to be that person. But what is it really doing helping us move forward. Nothing.

485
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's this heavy weight that's on her back that just holds us you know in that MISERABLE STATE. It's like no good.

486
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.340
No good.

487
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's like letting it go but not you know

488
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:09.750
Jessica Freeman: I still struggle with that you know with with having left my son. I'm when he was four. You know, I'm probably always going to have, you know, a certain level of just

489
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:21.870
Jessica Freeman: sucks so bad, you know, and I can't, I can't change it, but I really try not to let it dictate my behavior going forward. And in the moment. You know, I really, I really do want to

490
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:29.910
Jessica Freeman: Make what we have as best as it can be. And and dwelling on the past doesn't help, but

491
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:42.450
Jessica Freeman: There's no way that I'm ever going to like not feel bad that I did that you know I'm always gonna hate myself a little for that. But as long as I take it and move forward and do what I can. And you know, it's just going to get better.

492
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:44.370
Jessica Freeman: Maybe do

493
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Memories.

494
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.630
Jessica Freeman: And maybe a perception of the situation.

495
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe that's a piece of it.

496
00:53:53.220 --> 00:54:00.390
Jessica Freeman: Honestly I think like what gets me now is when I think about my little boy. Mm hmm. You know, crying.

497
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:14.610
Jessica Freeman: In his bed alone missing his mommy wondering why she's not there, you know, school events. What does even tell his friends. You know how much pain. Did I cause him that I never even thought about until

498
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.310
Jessica Freeman: I got sober. I mean I cost him a lot of pain. A lot. That's what

499
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You were in your addiction. When he left.

500
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:25.830
Jessica Freeman: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

501
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:33.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so he and this is just another way of looking at it. But really,

502
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:39.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes you causes them pain by leaving, but there could have been so much more

503
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you could have caused him by staying

504
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At that time, addiction, they don't you know your disease it it takes no prisoners, you know, it really doesn't. And, you know, was it the best thing in the moment right now and you know being sober and thinking about it.

505
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:01.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe

506
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe it was

507
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:17.520
Jessica Freeman: Because I got full custody of them in the divorce. And so when I when I sent him to live with his dad when I left. And if I had never left then he would have been in my full custody.

508
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:35.700
Jessica Freeman: And yeah, I was. I remember when he was three before I moved you know cocaine and alcohol and you know men, and while he was there, you know, Superman, which at the time I didn't, you know, and but now

509
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.790
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, you're probably right.

510
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:43.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's about changing the perception of the situation.

511
00:55:44.100 --> 00:56:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and saying, you know, I don't know, because we don't know the outcome of that because you didn't stay right but you think about it in those terms, you know, what would I have put him through. If I would have drug him through my addiction with me farther than I had already done.

512
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There could have been more damage done things could have happened. You know what I mean. And you think about it in those terms. Your perception is that you know what I mean, you did this, this bad thing by leaving him, but in my perception.

513
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's two always two truths of the same situation.

514
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.130
Jessica Freeman: You know, I hadn't thought of it that way. Thank you.

515
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

516
00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.820
Jessica Freeman: Hmm. Thank you. It does make me feel better.

517
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you just don't, you know, these are the what. So the. Don't you know the things that you don't know. But in the same sense knowing what you went through.

518
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know through your addiction, you know, the things that you, the people you had around you, the things that you are doing just not being present with him. You know what I mean.

519
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:59.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Would you been a but would you have been able to meet as good as schools, you know, his functions and you know how good and how President, would you have been able to be

520
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:17.070
Jessica Freeman: I probably. I mean, I have a friend whose wife is no colleague and she had got arrested at her daughter school for having shown up like drunk to accompany them on a field trip. I could see myself having done something like that.

521
00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.360
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and how much damage. Would that have caused. Yeah.

522
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, you've got to what that, what did they tell you in a it's like don't live in the past.

523
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:39.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep the door open so that you can always remember where you don't want to go back to you, but don't hold on to that guilt don't hold on to that you did the best that you could do with the tools that you had in that moment.

524
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.640
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I didn't have very many tools.

525
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.290
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, you're right. I see where I'm coming from.

526
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And one day, you know, you'll be able to have this conversation with your son, and you get to, you know, tell him you know what I mean.

527
00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:04.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was like, it's like, you think about that you think about you know where it could have been or what could have happened versus, you know, your decision to say I can't take care of him.

528
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's a hard place for a parent to be, but in the same sense

529
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's one of the best parenting, you know, things that we

530
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That we have to recognize when we realize that our ability to to take care of our child. It has been is hindered or hampered with, you know what I mean. And we are willing, even unwilling, but do it anyways.

531
00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To put their needs first

532
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It says a lot about

533
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. That says a lot about that parent about that parent

534
00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:49.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about it in different. It's the perception of the situation and how you view it. You know what I mean.

535
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.320
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

536
00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:55.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Another way to look at it.

537
00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:07.770
Jessica Freeman: It is we've had my, you know, when I was making my amends I we have had some conversations where, you know, I have been able to provide some sort of explanation.

538
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:11.160
Jessica Freeman: That he's been able to accept.

539
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:19.710
Jessica Freeman: And also, you know, I told him I'm supposed to forgive myself but it doesn't ever mean

540
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:36.480
Jessica Freeman: It didn't happen. You know, I'm not trying. I'm not trying to erase the past and be like, Oh, I'm off the hook. I'm scot free that's never the case. It's just, you know, I want to move forward with you and it's been good. This trip was really, really good.

541
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:48.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it sounds like it was really, really good. And he was probably very, very happy that you were there, you know, yeah, you showed him that you know he does matter no if ands, or buts. He matters.

542
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:54.810
Jessica Freeman: Oh, he matters. Yes. And I'm going to keep in contact with him better. Much better.

543
00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:57.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got a lot to do.

544
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah, or as

545
01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting prepared and building this whole new life. And, you know, getting connected and staying connected at the same time.

546
01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:21.540
Jessica Freeman: Well, I did it before when I came back from a year of relapse. I, I like double down and I structured my life and it worked. And I can do it again, do it right now.

547
01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:26.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can do it. Definitely. I'll be excited to hear

548
01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Next week you know who you connected with and your service work and what affirmations are you going to put up that you get to see every day.

549
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay. Yeah, and you know you're in a really good space right now. You know what I mean. And let's just keep that momentum going. Keep the connections alive.

550
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:58.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He you know those phone calls come in video chat and happening. You know what I mean, go to meetings, talk to your sponsor, just keep doing what you're doing. Jessica, you're in such a good place right this very moment.

551
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:12.330
Jessica Freeman: I think this job is going to help, too, because since I'm not, I'm not going to have to spend all day at work, like I can drop my son off at school go to a meeting go to work or vice versa, you know,

552
01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:19.110
Jessica Freeman: It'll give me some more time to get done. You know, the things that I need to get done. Yeah.

553
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.530
Jessica Freeman: Like self care and meetings and service.

554
01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.350
Jessica Freeman: Yes, they can volunteer somewhere.

555
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:27.690
Jessica Freeman: That'd be cool.

556
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.310
