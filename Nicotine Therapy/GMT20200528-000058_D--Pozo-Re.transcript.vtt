00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:16.859
Erika Romero: And I know I don't know what's going on with the with the clinic. I can't seem to get through there, like it has the whole screen.

2
00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:35.070
Erika Romero: And then it goes from the whole screen and it goes to the black screen where it says connecting and then it goes right to the whole screen and literally I saw on hold us today between when I first email before when I first started

3
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.420
Erika Romero: And then I emailed you and then I tried back again.

4
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.580
Erika Romero: I was on hold that early find out if you're struggling altogether.

5
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.620
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I

6
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.010
Erika Romero: Went in and I figured, okay, well, I'll just go ahead and check in early since I have such a problem.

7
00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.530
Erika Romero: Yesterday, and I got on I exactly 527 and same thing. I don't know what's going on with that.

8
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.480
Erika Romero: I know that you guys changed in that or they changed the system that they told me that a while back, but

9
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.410
Erika Romero: I don't know if that's what's causing all the problems or what

10
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.530
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm not

11
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.430
Dominique Pozo: Sure, either.

12
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.960
Dominique Pozo: Hi, you're getting

13
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.460
Erika Romero: Yo, and then I and then

14
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.900
Dominique Pozo: You're, you're very broken up Erica, I'm having a hard time hearing you. I'm not hearing you actually

15
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.490
Erika Romero: Yeah, I know. That's because my phone is almost dead. So, can you hear me now, you better

16
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.270
Erika Romero: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I had to plug my phone in

17
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.710
Erika Romero: Okay, yeah.

18
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.230
Erika Romero: So it was just a big mess yesterday and I do apologize I did try to get in.

19
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.940
Erika Romero: But

20
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.480
Dominique Pozo: That's okay.

21
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:05.340
Dominique Pozo: Although you I let you in without you checking into the zoom room which I mean to the virtual clinic, which is not we're not supposed to do that. So if you can just let me know.

22
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.090
Dominique Pozo: Check in after the session because they do need to check you in through that. Can you do that.

23
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.570
Dominique Pozo: Are you able to just let them know, hey, I had my session.

24
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.050
Erika Romero: Yeah, I can I can I can do that.

25
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.970
Dominique Pozo: That's not okay. That would be great. One second. I'm just going to grab

26
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.500
Dominique Pozo: One thing.

27
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.960
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

28
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:49.560
Dominique Pozo: And and I did. I responded to your email. I don't know if you missed it, or what but Dr. Kendall responded as well. And she said she, she called your scripted.

29
00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:05.730
Erika Romero: Yeah, I just now got that too. So I don't know if there's just a delay or what I don't know because it was right after I emailed you this last time that I got that I got the response, the response from you and from Dr kendo

30
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.540
Erika Romero: So everything's fine. My husband's going now to Walgreens to go

31
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.830
Erika Romero: Pick up my script so

32
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.180
Erika Romero: I was like I was like really fresh. I was like, I don't know what's going on. It was on my end or if it's on on on your guys's end and

33
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:34.950
Erika Romero: I guess that's the thing that's really stressing me out is because I don't know if it's if it's me if it's something that I'm doing or something is going on with my my service that you know that's causing this problem and so

34
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.790
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

35
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.840
Erika Romero: I was like, I don't know what to do, as Thomas said, I'm just so frustrated right now because I really don't know what to do. I don't know what's going on.

36
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:56.550
Erika Romero: I said, I know that I need to be in my sessions and I sit in. I really don't want you know that to become a problem to where you know if I'm not able to make my my sessions, whether it be

37
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:17.910
Erika Romero: My individual therapy with you or my group sessions years. I really enjoy them, you know, and so and and i think it gets it gets a some sort of adult first of all adult can't guess I have a three three year old contact all day long. So, you know, I don't have any other

38
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.140
Erika Romero: Besides, my husband adult human contact so

39
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.300
Erika Romero: During the days. And so that kind of gives me adult interaction.

40
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:37.710
Erika Romero: And also, you know, gives me an outlet to, you know, deal with whatever might be going on, you know, during that week. And so

41
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:48.780
Erika Romero: Plus. On top of that, that's, you know, I don't want that to be an issue when it comes to my medication to, you know what I mean, because I know we've had that talk about

42
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:59.640
Erika Romero: About if we don't make our groups and stuff like that that you know that could become a hindrance with our, our medications and that's not definitely not something that I want to do right now.

43
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.640
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely. I get that. And I am

44
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.110
Dominique Pozo: I think the virtual clinic is having a hard time right now. They're just flooded with

45
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:23.550
Dominique Pozo: With new patients, which isn't an excuse. It's not, you know, it's not okay that you're waiting an hour, I guess if you're able, they are saying that people can sign up to six hours in advance. So if you're able to do it earlier in the day, then they'll call you with a number

46
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:35.700
Dominique Pozo: Later, that's one option and to I'm going to i. This has happened a few times with different people. That's a week. So I'm going to definitely talk to bright heart health, and just checking around that.

47
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.380
Erika Romero: And well I when I did my I did my survey early yesterday and I thought, okay, I'll go ahead and get that taken care of.

48
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.870
Erika Romero: That will be done and I won't have to hassle. With that, you know, before Clint before I went to my before I went to group, but

49
00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:04.350
Erika Romero: I didn't have time to do the check in. So I said, Okay, well, just try to get in earlier so that I don't have to, you know, there won't be a problem trying to get in.

50
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:19.500
Erika Romero: That's why I got on yesterday at a quarter after so that I could be. I could be in group or by four by six o'clock yesterday. So it was a

51
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:29.280
Erika Romero: Quarter after five is when I when I ended up and I didn't finally hang up and text you. I think it was about 615 is when I find two 610 615

52
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:40.500
Erika Romero: Is when I finally texted, or emailed you and said, Okay, I've been sitting on hold. I don't know what's going on. And then after I emailed you I got back on again.

53
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:49.710
Erika Romero: And I sat on holds probably for another 2030 minutes before my granddaughter had a little spill outside, she was trying to go down the stairs. So

54
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.970
Dominique Pozo: No. Yeah.

55
00:06:51.030 --> 00:07:01.110
Erika Romero: Yeah, and did have a little spill. So, um, so I never even got your email telling me that you know to call the number to go ahead and go on in

56
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.470
Erika Romero: So, but anyway, I'm here.

57
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.470
Dominique Pozo: Great. Yay, okay. I'm so glad

58
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.720
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

59
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.150
Erika Romero: But anyway.

60
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.170
Erika Romero: This week's been pretty good. This been it's been a pretty good week so far.

61
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.990
Erika Romero: And I guess I

62
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.070
Erika Romero: My daughter ended up

63
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.770
Erika Romero: She ended up I'm texting my husband this this last week, which kind of raised a lot of

64
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.450
Erika Romero: Issues for me but I mean with my daughter. I gotta take what she says with a grain of salt.

65
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:46.890
Erika Romero: You know, because she she does cause a lot of psychological BS for me.

66
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.180
Erika Romero: I mean aside from that, it's been a pretty good week.

67
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.170
Don't

68
00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:06.510
Dominique Pozo: Create and how about I don't know if this is an issue for you still are fixed up at the moment, but I'm just wondering how how's it going with your husband and his porn and all that, have you addressed that more

69
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.860
Erika Romero: Yeah, him and I had a talk about it as a matter of fact, the last time that we had, you and I

70
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:25.800
Erika Romero: Had our session. And yeah, he is so he's he's working on it. And I did let him know you know that I really needed

71
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.770
Erika Romero: Him to his, his support a lot more, you know and and

72
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.030
Erika Romero: And kind of to be on a united front together.

73
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.870
Erika Romero: Regardless of

74
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:49.710
Erika Romero: Whether it be our marriage or, you know, with my granddaughter whatever and and he he heard me out and and to

75
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.610
Erika Romero: Us. Well, you know, he's willing to work on it. That's one thing.

76
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.410
Erika Romero: I've really gotten lucky with with him is I'm

77
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:15.270
Erika Romero: Me. I don't know really how to speak to people without being a jerk. So like I said, like I told you I really have to think about what I say. But with him. I've really gotten lucky because he when I bring certain things to his attention.

78
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.980
Erika Romero: Sometimes it doesn't go so well initially

79
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.380
Erika Romero: Um, but

80
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:32.820
Erika Romero: He does try to work through whatever you know whatever whatever is not not making me happy. He tries to fix it.

81
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.560
Erika Romero: So, um,

82
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.280
Erika Romero: Yeah, he he's he's doing pretty good.

83
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.540
Erika Romero: We'll see. We'll see how he maintains that

84
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:54.630
Erika Romero: But um yeah he's I'm really lucky that way. I am because my last two marriages weren't like that I I struggled a lot with those with

85
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:04.920
Erika Romero: With those marriages and and I struggled with my own with my, my, my husband now to in the beginning, him and I really

86
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.120
Erika Romero: Had a rough start, you know, and probably

87
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:23.910
Erika Romero: WITH THE WAY THAT OUR MARRIAGE STARTED, I probably shouldn't have married him just because of what he had what he did the things that he did but and and probably any sane woman would have been like

88
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.390
Erika Romero: Think so, you know,

89
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.170
Erika Romero: Because I think because I've been through so much in my life with, especially with men.

90
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:44.520
Erika Romero: But I think I kind of really try to give him the benefit of the doubt and kind of just work through things with him.

91
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.670
Erika Romero: And and so

92
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.220
Erika Romero: It's been

93
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.000
Erika Romero: It's been fairly easy with

94
00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:04.260
Erika Romero: It just, it's just a matter of how I approach things because I really don't know how to speak to people and I never really have and so

95
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.760
Erika Romero: Or how to get my point across, without being a jerk, all the time you know about it.

96
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.530
Erika Romero: But

97
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.360
Dominique Pozo: Well here's I have a good. I have a good exercise for that. If you want to try something.

98
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.750
Dominique Pozo: Sure. So think about

99
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.060
Dominique Pozo: Maybe some expectations. You have to have a piece of paper and a pen. Be good to write some of this down.

100
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.170
Yep.

101
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.360
Erika Romero: In my room this time. So I have to go to see my

102
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.130
Dominique Pozo: Screen.

103
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.010
Erika Romero: I always leave you on hold. I'll be right back.

104
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.000
Okay.

105
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.970
Dominique Pozo: No problem.

106
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.210
Erika Romero: Hold on, you just

107
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.430
Erika Romero: Hear me ok I

108
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.910
Erika Romero: See, all right. Can you see me.

109
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.850
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Okay. So start with some expectations that you may have of your husband.

110
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.490
Erika Romero: Okay.

111
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.540
Dominique Pozo: Maybe, maybe, let's start with like

112
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.770
Dominique Pozo: Anywhere between

113
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.670
Dominique Pozo: three and five.

114
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.050
Okay.

115
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:20.160
Erika Romero: Now these are expectations that I have of him that I feel sometimes that he kind of isn't

116
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.840
Erika Romero: up to par with, I think, and so

117
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:36.780
Erika Romero: I guess these are my. Okay, that's him that I expect for him to because he came lakhs on on the on these things. So I have three of them really that that are

118
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.250
Erika Romero: The biggest ones for me, so I'm

119
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:49.890
Erika Romero: Helping me around the house that equal parenting roles and respecting me as a woman, and his wife.

120
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.360
Erika Romero: And and I'll explain that and because

121
00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:04.830
Erika Romero: I think I told you his whole his PORNOGRAPHY THING. And so, and that's what I'm. That's what I'm referring to when it comes to that.

122
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:12.780
Erika Romero: So, and then the equal parenting rules, just because he parents completely different than I parent

123
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.530
Yeah.

124
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.920
Erika Romero: help around the house because I really work hard. I'm I have OCD really bad, so it

125
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:37.530
Erika Romero: My house is very welcome. But as soon as he walks through the door. It's this there you know it's and I'm like dude, I just spent the whole day cleaning up you know attracts mud through the floors, you know, so those are, these are the ones that are the biggest on my list so

126
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.300
Erika Romero: Yeah, so okay though. There you go. There you go. Those are what I have on here.

127
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.440
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so from what you've written I wondering

128
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:57.030
Dominique Pozo: Let's see, I'm gonna, I'm going to pull up this list of needs here and have you

129
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.690
Dominique Pozo: Write down maybe like three or four

130
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.960
Dominique Pozo: Needs that go that that

131
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.870
Dominique Pozo: Connect to these expectations. Okay, just

132
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.060
Dominique Pozo: So it's kind of like underneath each of these, you're gonna

133
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.240
Dominique Pozo: You're gonna write down a few of these.

134
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.030
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

135
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.350

Erika Romero: I'm here.

140
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.900
Dominique Pozo: Okay, how's it. Are you still writing needs done

141
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.640
Erika Romero: Yeah.

142
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.110
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Take your time.

143
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.340
Dominique Pozo: It's all good. I just wanted to

144
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.540
Dominique Pozo: check in and see how it's going

145
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.770
Erika Romero: I'm almost done.

146
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:23.520
Okay.

147
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.110
Erika Romero: Okay, I think I got it.

148
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.820
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Do we you share with me what you wrote down for sure.

149
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:59.700
Erika Romero: Okay, so under our help around the house. I put appreciation cooperation and participation.

150
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:07.050
Erika Romero: Okay, under equal parenting roles equality contribution and participation.

151
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.640
Erika Romero: Now the last one I put a few quite a few of them.

152
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:21.630
Erika Romero: Are respecting me as a woman, so I'm consideration, but the security trust integrity and to matter.

153
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.650
Hmm.

154
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:34.590
Dominique Pozo: So why I'm doing this is because I'd really love to support you in. I've heard you say a few times when you communicate. You can be an asshole. I heard you say that I'm not saying that I've heard you say it.

155
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.910
Dominique Pozo: You know,

156
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:46.650
Dominique Pozo: What I'm wanting to help support is for you to be heard and for to foster more connection when you want things to change or to get your needs met, not to have

157
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.490
Dominique Pozo: You know the pushback or the fights or whatever. So, um,

158
00:20:51.180 --> 00:21:06.690
Dominique Pozo: So now that you've done this. Okay, you've identified the expectations you have you're getting really clear on the needs what requests, could you make that are really clear direct maybe have already done this, I don't know, but I just, I'm wanting to help you come up with

159
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:15.390
Dominique Pozo: A way that you can communicate your needs and make requests. So hopefully they're met and things do start shifting

160
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:29.430
Erika Romero: Right. So yeah, it needs in these areas I have, we have spoken about it. And so it's not like it's something that has has not been addressed.

161
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:44.940
Erika Romero: I think it. I think I've kind of come to the conclusion that enter just men and they would like you to talk to them and things go in one ear and come out the other. You know, and they have short term memory loss, you know, and

162
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.700
Dominique Pozo: I don't know. I don't wanna. I don't want to let them off. That easy.

163
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.150
Erika Romero: Or I don't know what it is.

164
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.770
Erika Romero: Kind of things get lost. Sometimes, and I think

165
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.120
Erika Romero: I tried like with one I

166
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.630
Erika Romero: Like what the thing about home you know and i i bring it to his attention and I tell him that

167
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:17.070
Erika Romero: Why do you do this, you know, because he he'll take his dishes, all the way to the kitchen and leave them on the counter.

168
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:24.240
Erika Romero: Okay, why can't you put them in the sink or, you know, a paper plate, throw it in the trash. You know, and he says, oh,

169
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.820
Erika Romero: I, as a matter of fact, we had this conversation just two days ago because I asked him, he said, Why you do this.

170
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:45.030
Erika Romero: I don't understand why do you do this, you know, you get everything all the way to the kitchen and then you just put it right here. You open up something and you need the wrapper on the counter. Is this all eventually I'll get to it. I said, Well, how long is eventually I said doesn't

171
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:45.870
Dominique Pozo: Mean that

172
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.510
Erika Romero: You're going to have a stack of stuff here before.

173
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.280
Erika Romero: I leave like get to it or

174
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:59.670
Erika Romero: You know it's going to be spread out all over the kitchen or, you know, I don't get it. So, you know, we do have these conversations and

175
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.290
Erika Romero: And I

176
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:09.810
Erika Romero: That's one of the things that I can't seem to get in him to work on. So, um, and, and he'll tell me. Hey, sorry, you know, and He'll. He'll

177
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:17.220
Erika Romero: You know, go pick it up, but here five minutes later, he'll do the exact same thing you know and and i just like

178
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.770
Erika Romero: To let

179
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:21.840
Erika Romero: You know I

180
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:37.860
Erika Romero: Can understand why we we can't, you know, move past this this area and so me. I've always been the one have been one to say, okay, well, how was it all just do it. You know what I mean, because it

181
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:45.450
Erika Romero: It's easier for me than to have to keep repeating myself and repeating myself, and because there's not a

182
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.590
Dominique Pozo: I imagine I imagine that resentment could build over time if if you keep doing this.

183
00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:53.610
Erika Romero: It does.

184
00:23:54.270 --> 00:24:01.860
Erika Romero: It does, it does get very frustrating for me. And I just wanted to take what what he's left on the counter and throw it at him and say,

185
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.700
Yeah.

186
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.410
Erika Romero: You know you've gotten it here. What's another you know

187
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:07.680
Yeah.

188
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:17.970
Erika Romero: You know, you, you can take it from the top of the counter and will it down six inches and put it in the trash, you know. Yeah. Or, or, all you have to do is turn around.

189
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:32.400
Erika Romero: Put it in the trash can. So what. Where's the, where's the disconnection there, you know, or is it just stops there, you know, and why it doesn't progress any further than that.

190
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:38.460
Erika Romero: So that, that's one thing that I do get really frustrated with and

191
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:58.110
Erika Romero: But yes, it does become reason I do become resentful because I've always been like that was my kids to, you know, and for some reason I put men and children in the same category you know they have they have about the same rank and expansion in there. You know that there's no

192
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:12.270
Erika Romero: I'm for some reason. There's a wall there that doesn't allow them to go any further. Are you know i don't know what it is that the just, it just stops at a certain point, you know, and it doesn't go any further.

193
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:21.090
Dominique Pozo: Well, I want to. I'm going to challenge that because I think that could be true for many men, not all. And I also think that

194
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.070
Dominique Pozo: If you are holding this belief.

195
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.940
Dominique Pozo: It's going to keep him in that late and things are not going to change. So

196
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:35.730
Dominique Pozo: I am going to invite that we've just explore a little bit like what kind of request, could you make that include your needs and start to really

197
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:49.230
Dominique Pozo: Because I hear that you're talking about it and you might be saying, hey, please do this yet. I, I don't know, I'm not sure. And maybe you are but not sure if he's really hearing your deep needs behind

198
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:57.990
Dominique Pozo: And I'm sure you know, if we really think about, it's like it's obvious. I need cooperation, I need me to ality I need all these things yet. Sometimes people need to hear it.

199
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.840
Erika Romero: Right, so I guess if if if I had to

200
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:26.730
Erika Romero: If I have to address that further. I guess I could probably look it I've, I've been working really hard all day long and I really would appreciate it if you would just help me out a little bit more, maybe get, get your trash into the trash can or put your socks in the hamper, you know,

201
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:32.340
Dominique Pozo: Instead, because the why, so can you. Will you share with me. The needs. I want to hear it. It's

202
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:38.400
Dominique Pozo: It's really owning you have these needs. So what are the from what you wrote down what are the needs

203
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:50.040
Erika Romero: Because I need you to appreciate what you know the fact that I work all the log it be like if I came to your job site and

204
00:26:50.550 --> 00:27:05.370
Erika Romero: You know, and took apart one year air conditioners, you know, after you spent the whole day up on a roof somewhere, putting an air conditioner and, you know, and I came and I took it all apart and said, Oh, well, you have to do it again, you know,

205
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:11.730
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's a great example. So, appreciation, what else I imagine there's more need tied up in there.

206
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:13.830
Erika Romero: Just

207
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:23.790
Erika Romero: For him to be cooperative, you know, to cooperate with me and and you know work hand in hand with me.

208
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.580
Dominique Pozo: To being a team being more the team is

209
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:27.660
Dry

210
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.020
Erika Romero: Not the head coach and you're

211
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.670
Erika Romero: You know, you're, you're the student or you're, you know, the little league baseball player. Yeah.

212
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.250
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah yeah

213
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:56.190
Erika Romero: You know i i feel like, you know, we should be cooperating together and doing what we need to do what needs to be done together as a team, rather than me, being the coach in new beings.

214
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.740
Erika Romero: You know, a little league.

215
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.070
Erika Romero: Player

216
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:09.990
Dominique Pozo: I wonder, I don't know if that would offend him maybe he'd LAUGH Maybe not, but I think just simply saying being more of a team sounds really good to me.

217
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.200
Erika Romero: And then, you know, I have the

218
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:27.270
Erika Romero: Participation in with in there too, which I guess would be probably, you know, in that same category you know just participate with me and and and helped me out and

219
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:44.010
Erika Romero: Appreciate that. You know that I have worked hard all day long and that you come home to a nice clean home and you know that as soon as you walk through the door. There's a much trail right next to your clothing trail.

220
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.740
Erika Romero: They take an article of clothing off at a time and it's

221
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.680
Erika Romero: A TRIP OVER THE SHOES.

222
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.380
Erika Romero: Yes.

223
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.380
Erika Romero: That's so interesting. I

224
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:13.920
Dominique Pozo: I, I just was hearing from someone yesterday about things being left on the floor that they could potentially trip on it, even though it sounds minor it's it's really upsetting.

225
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.140
Erika Romero: It is because

226
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.260
Erika Romero: And then on top of that you know i all day long.

227
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:30.240
Erika Romero: We don't live in a very big house. So when my granddaughter throws her toys on the floor. It is literally the walkway you know of everywhere.

228
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.980
Erika Romero: Anywhere that she can throw it is a walkway, you know,

229
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:47.010
Erika Romero: There's so there's not a whole lot of space. And so as soon as he gets home her toys are on the floor and then his stuffs on the floor, you know, and I'm tripping over toys and stepping on little toys and

230
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.960
Erika Romero: tripping over shoes and

231
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:57.570
Erika Romero: Oh, it does get it. First of all, it gets pretty mundane to have to keep doing the same thing over and over and over all

232
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:09.720
Erika Romero: And I feel with my granddaughter because like I said, our houses and all that big. So I have to pick up her toys, because she's good. She goes from one thing to the next in about 30 seconds you

233
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.230
Know,

234
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.920
Erika Romero: Constantly changing activities or or changing toys that she wants to play with.

235
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.050
Erika Romero: So it becomes it does become

236
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.740
Erika Romero: Intrusive after soul, you know, after she's changed activities once or twice.

237
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:38.190
Erika Romero: But then my husband gets home. And it's the same thing. You know, so I'm dealing not only with our stuff everywhere, but then I'm dealing with his stuff everywhere.

238
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.330
Erika Romero: And it does be

239
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:46.860
Erika Romero: Stressful. You know, because at some point, I would just like to sit down and my husband always tells me that the honey. Why don't you sit down.

240
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:52.770
Erika Romero: Sit down. If I could sit down and I would, because I get tired.

241
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.730
Erika Romero: Yeah today.

242
00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:15.690
Erika Romero: Austin, because I spent my whole day yesterday. Just cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, because it was a long three day weekend and Monday through Sunday are my, you know, clean up after my husband comes back to work day, you know, but we had a three day weekend, which made it one day more dirt.

243
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.570
Erika Romero: I spend my whole day yesterday. Just cleaning, cleaning minutes so tired.

244
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:32.400
Erika Romero: I'm exhausted today too. And you know, I take for granted. Sometimes the fact that I'm not as is young and

245
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.440
Erika Romero: And or have as much energy as I used to, you know, and

246
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.890
Erika Romero: The same way you know and I just don't have that energy anymore.

247
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:57.780
Dominique Pozo: This is where I really hear the importance of this need for support from him because you're changing you know your your energy levels are not the same, and no raising a three year old and then and then it sounds like an adult.

248
00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.040
Child

249
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.170
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

250
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.060
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

251
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.680
Erika Romero: Yeah. Yeah, it does. It is hard, but

252
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:20.700
Erika Romero: You know, I still try to keep up with it. And that, but it's just not the same. I don't have that energy anymore and I you know I would love to just be able to sit down and say, okay, my days over you.

253
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.210
Dominique Pozo: Know,

254
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:38.550
Erika Romero: And then he gets home and her behavior changes completely to because all day long and she can just entertain herself, and she very rarely give me any problems. But as soon as he walks to the door because she knows that he's

255
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.840
Erika Romero: The pushover. It becomes a whole circus with her because

256
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:57.210
Erika Romero: You know, really, that behavior starts changing and her attitude starts changing and she starts really being really needy.

257
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:07.590
Erika Romero: And I think that's because her grandpa just gives her gives her gifts are gifts are and that's a good thing. But his mind in his parenting style and so completely different.

258
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.380
Erika Romero: And so

259
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:17.940
Erika Romero: At that point, you know, I think, Okay, well, my husband's home you know he can deal with her. But then I have to deal with, or two, because I've

260
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:32.160
Erika Romero: Still got to discipline her, you know, and he's really working on trying to work on that to try and work on the discipline aspect which i'm glad for because I you know they're there for a while.

261
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.700
Erika Romero: We were really just butting heads.

262
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.560
Erika Romero: Big time with her.

263
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:45.240
Erika Romero: Over her because you was the, give, give, give, and let her do what she wants. Let her do what she wants.

264
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:54.270
Erika Romero: More the the strict grandparent. Who likes did discipline. You know what I mean, I think.

265
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:55.860
Dominique Pozo: Boundaries and kids.

266
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.280
Erika Romero: And me and so

267
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:07.410
Erika Romero: If I hit it with her with him. She has no boundaries or they're starting to become a lot

268
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:10.860
Erika Romero: A lot more boundaries with him.

269
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:19.920
Erika Romero: But it wasn't like that. And it's only starting it been starting to change over the last few months.

270
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.960
Erika Romero: Because we've really had to have

271
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:30.930
Erika Romero: A heart to heart about that you know where I've had to sit him down on on a couple of occasions and tell him you know I really need your house.

272
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.710
I can

273
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:33.780
Dominique Pozo: I can

274
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:47.190
Erika Romero: You know, and he's still the pushover. But he's starting to put his foot down more often with her and and you know put limits on her. And so, and that that's

275
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.670
Erika Romero: pretty helpful. But you know that there's still those gap.

276
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.080
Dominique Pozo: You know, and

277
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.530
So,

278
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:03.900
Erika Romero: And so it does make your heart. And then so it just kind of seems like it's constant

279
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.610
Erika Romero: Its constant, you know, around here.

280
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.320
Erika Romero: For me, anyway, you know,

281
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:17.730
Erika Romero: Where I would like to be able to end my day or and be able to relax and that's not the case.

282
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.990
Dominique Pozo: You know, just kind of

283
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:36.000
Erika Romero: Just keeps going and going and going and going in it, sometimes it doesn't. My day don't until 1112 o'clock at night when she finally goes to sleep. But then again, that's, that's where that short all is with him because he's the one that puts her to sleep.

284
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.970
Erika Romero: Because she wants her to sleep.

285
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:52.440
Erika Romero: And because she knows he'll put the TV on for her and let her watch TV or, as I say, Okay, you can watch 30 minutes of your show. And that's it. TV goes off, you know, now it's bedtime.

286
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.370
Erika Romero: So I'm really trying to get her into a routine. It's not working.

287
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:07.290
Erika Romero: It's not working. So we're it's still a work in progress. It really is working with with her.

288
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.540
Erika Romero: So is that

289
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.550
Dominique Pozo: Is what I am inviting you to do helpful.

290
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.750
Erika Romero: To like

291
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.400
Dominique Pozo: Name the needs that are behind the expectations and then think about request.

292
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.560
Erika Romero: Absolutely, yeah.

293
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.990
Erika Romero: Because that gives me a way to kind of

294
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:30.180
Erika Romero: A to say what I what I expect without being a jerk.

295
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.710
Dominique Pozo: You know, yeah.

296
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:38.640
Erika Romero: Okay, give me some other words to use without beings, you know, so I'm

297
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.620
Erika Romero: Forward.

298
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.630
Erika Romero: Yeah, and so

299
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:44.940
Dominique Pozo: And I think you can be

300
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.050
Dominique Pozo: Forward and be told.

301
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:54.960
Dominique Pozo: That's what it's about. Yeah. And the whole point. So what I'm actually sharing with you are. It's called compassionate communication skills.

302
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:55.830
Erika Romero: And

303
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.240
Dominique Pozo: The whole point of that is to

304
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.610
Dominique Pozo: Stay connected and not disconnect

305
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:10.560
Dominique Pozo: Through conflict because I think you know that's what I think most of us want that. We want connection. That's why we're having conflict because something's not flowing

306
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:26.520
Dominique Pozo: And so, you know, if we're just reactive and being a jerk, like you say you can be that creates even more of what you don't want. So it's like, Okay, how to stay connected through the conflict and then hopefully have some resolution that leads towards change.

307
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:44.010
Erika Romero: You know, right, right. And I see that you know and when you put the list up for me when you started this exercise with me. I said, Okay, well I know my expectations are, you know, and then you put the list of for me it clicked. I said,

308
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:55.380
Erika Romero: Okay, I know what she's doing. She's given me a way to be able to speak, you know, my mind without using harsh words without, you know saying things that I'll regret, you know,

309
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.280
Dominique Pozo: Right, right.

310
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.890
Erika Romero: Some other word options.

311
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:06.780
Erika Romero: Um, yeah, to come me indicate how I feel and what I'm thinking. And what I'm going through

312
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:20.100
Erika Romero: So yeah that's that's definitely helpful because sometimes I get at a loss for words. And like I said, I can say things that can be really, really hateful or

313
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:21.540
Erika Romero: Mean or

314
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.960
Erika Romero: You know, industry, respectful, just because you know

315
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.210
Erika Romero: I'm frustrated or I'm

316
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:41.640
Erika Romero: Angry or whatever. And in a lot of times we say things without thinking about it or without knowing how to approach it. And I think that's my biggest thing is I

317
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:58.350
Erika Romero: I don't really know how to approach certain things and and I think that's why I have to stop it when I'm in in the heat of an argument, I have to stop you know myself and separate myself not only just to

318
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:05.610
Erika Romero: Cool down but to think about what I need to say without

319
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:07.470
Erika Romero: Without

320
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.650
Erika Romero: You know, hurting somebody's

321
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.710
Erika Romero: Feelings or something that I regret. So that's very helpful.

322
00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:28.530
Erika Romero: Oh, not just in this situation, but I mean, it gives me something to think about. You know, it should anything, any other situations arise. I appreciate that. That

323
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:35.070
Erika Romero: You doing that with me because I don't really know how sometimes so

324
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you're over there.

325
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.500
Dominique Pozo: That's very good catch on, you're catching on so quickly, so I'm

326
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:47.490
Dominique Pozo: You know this. These are just skills and tools that you know we just got to keep flexing those muscles when I know I do. When

327
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.670
Dominique Pozo: When I get reactive, it's like, Okay, take a deep breath. Okay, what's happening, what needs are not being met and then be able to just speak from there.

328
00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:02.370
Dominique Pozo: And it helps with the other to, you know, to, like, you know, he has his reasons for

329
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:16.380
Dominique Pozo: For doing what he does. I'm going to pull up the list and sometimes it's helpful to try to get someone's needs and then let them tell you. Yeah, that's true or not, so that they feel understood. So I wonder if some of his

330
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:25.890
Dominique Pozo: Needs are when he gets home after a long day. I wonder some of his needs may be

331
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:37.380
Dominique Pozo: Self expression. I don't see relaxation in here, but that is the need relaxation ease

332
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:55.920
Dominique Pozo: Support. You know, I wonder, I wonder, some of understanding spontaneity. You know, he's working all day and it's not. It's definitely by no means is it justified his behavior, but

333
00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:06.570
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes it helps to say okay I imagine you're throwing your stuff everywhere because you just need to like, relax. Not saying do this and it's not working for me and it helps

334
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.450
Dominique Pozo: That helps sometimes when someone else is

335
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.410
Is

336
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:17.490
Dominique Pozo: They see oh wow okay they're considering my approach, even though it doesn't work for them.

337
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:38.760
Erika Romero: All right. Oh yeah, and I do I you know I kind of give that to him, because I know he's been you know he does each back so I know he does spends a lot of his day outside and on on top of people's roofs, especially in, you know, we live in Mexico, so it's

338
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:51.300
Erika Romero: Hotter than hat, you know, and so I know that when he comes home all he wants to do is just shut off air being that he's been you know he's been in all day long.

339
00:41:53.010 --> 00:42:06.060
Erika Romero: But at the same time, I need him to understand that, you know, I've been here all day doing my job. My job is equally as hard as yours. I actually have two jobs. I'm the housekeeper and the babysitter.

340
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.070
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

341
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:25.260
Erika Romero: So, you know, I kind of need you to understand and need him to understand that, you know, and my job is a 24 hour a day job, you know, I get up in the middle of the night and and deal with situations with the baby almost every single night, you know,

342
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:42.300
Dominique Pozo: Erica, you're such a creative woman. I'm wondering if you can come up because I just came up with one, but I don't want to put it in your situation. I wonder if you come up with a creative solution so that he can still

343
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:52.890
Dominique Pozo: do his thing, and it doesn't impact you in the way it is. So can you think of a creative way that that could work that could actually maybe be enjoyable for the both of you and

344
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.670
Dominique Pozo: Or at least for him and then meet your need for more order and

345
00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.400
Dominique Pozo: Respect for what you've done all day.

346
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.850
Dominique Pozo: Why don't you think about it.

347
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.340
Dominique Pozo: Think about it this week and then I'm not going to

348
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.370
Dominique Pozo: Say what I am thinking I'm going to remember it. I know I will.

349
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:48.210
Dominique Pozo: So see if you could come up with a creative solution that will meet both of your needs and we'll check in about it next week. And if you still haven't come up with one I'll put out a an offering a possibility of something

350
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:58.080
Erika Romero: Yeah, that's because to me, I'm one of those kind of cut to the chase kind of people you know what I mean. No.

351
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.540
Erika Romero: I don't see

352
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:07.800
Erika Romero: Black and white sometimes, you know, or I see it as black and white. You know my way

353
00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:24.540
Erika Romero: To come to a conclusion to our weekend we can meet in the middle. Because I am I am a black and white kind of person that's gonna have to take some time.

354
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:51.930
Dominique Pozo: And this is this really goes along with addictive behavior. It's often black and white. It's all or nothing. It's very, it can be very extreme. So I think what I'm inviting you to do. I know I am.

355
00:44:52.320 --> 00:45:02.940
Dominique Pozo: Is not only with your relationship with your husband, but just in general, it's like a key finding that middle ground where the behavior isn't so extreme where the thinking isn't so black and white.

356
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.290
Erika Romero: It.

357
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:11.400
Dominique Pozo: Kind of goes across the board with part of the recovery. So, this I would say this is a part of the recovery process to is

358
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.960
Dominique Pozo: You know, finding those

359
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.350
Dominique Pozo: creative solutions that are more in the middle ground.

360
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:17.610
Okay.

361
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.040
Erika Romero: My best shot at that.

362
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.290
Erika Romero: Yeah, for me.

363
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:33.660
Erika Romero: straight to the point. It's always been straight to the black or white. There's no gray area that's just black and white.

364
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.600
Erika Romero: So you're giving me a

365
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.570
Erika Romero: huge challenge.

366
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.090
Erika Romero: To the occasion.

367
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:54.420
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, it makes me think of like a tree, you know, and that's saying that you know what doesn't bend breaks and, you know, eventually

368
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:06.690
Dominique Pozo: If I i believe i think if it stays so black or white. Something cracks along the way. So it's like you know how to keep finding that middle ground that's

369
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:18.420
Dominique Pozo: More bendable within limits, you know, not overriding your needs and not you know overextending for someone else, but just finding that place that hopefully it will support more easy for you and everyone

370
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:25.200
Erika Romero: Well, and I think with that black and white mentality come

371
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:39.900
Erika Romero: Just pointless because God. I know that because there's those know crazy sometimes that you know you have set yourself up for great expectations.

372
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.070
Dominique Pozo: You know, I'm not

373
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:49.200
Erika Romero: Black or black or white scenario. And you kind of set yourself up for disappointment.

374
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:56.220
Erika Romero: Because there isn't that gray area, you know, to do. Yes, you do. Or you don't

375
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.330
Right.

376
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.310
Erika Romero: And then a lot of times I know a lot of times, though.

377
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.450
Erika Romero: A lot of things are in that gray area so

378
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.250
Erika Romero: I have been disappointed. A whole lot

379
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:17.820
Erika Romero: Making anything that's probably why.

380
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.670
Erika Romero: You know, now that I'm thinking about it that's

381
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.630
Probably why

382
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:31.440
Erika Romero: I haven't done room for that group or just giving you know that's that's a black or white. So

383
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.070
Erika Romero: Towns dominate us or that isn't

384
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.240
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great.

385
00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.030
Erika Romero: You. I know you will. I trust you will. Yeah.

386
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.020
Dominique Pozo: So,

387
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.460
Dominique Pozo: We're getting close to the end of the

388
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.070
Erika Romero: Session know what

389
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:56.280
Erika Romero: I was gonna ask you this for cuz I gotta go run to the pharmacy before they shut down before they close tonight so

390
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.200
Dominique Pozo: That's fine. I just want to

391
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:05.040
Dominique Pozo: Just check in with you about the calendar and our next session.

392
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:12.390
Dominique Pozo: Are we doing, can you remind me. I have got so many different clients. I don't remember we doing every week or every other week. What would you

393
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.810
Dominique Pozo: Like to

394
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.430
Dominique Pozo: Get every other

395
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.930

396
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.550
Erika Romero: Sure, that'd be great.

397
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:22.590
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. I'm going to put you on for the 10th.

Erika Romero: You too. Bye bye.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:32.640
Okay.
