Ateeq Dean: You say, I noticed he wants.

27
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.710
Ateeq Dean: 24 hour period. Yes, my appetite thing is still

28
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:05.610
Ateeq Dean: You know, still my girlfriend made steaks, you may trim for my birthday. I didn't really, I only took one bite of that and you know I told her I would save it for today.

29
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:17.160
Ateeq Dean: And previous before she made me something I stopped at Sonic and got me a crony so I was able to eat the county, you know, the. That's all I really agents tree.

30
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's a coney is that our carbohydrate.

31
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.560
Ateeq Dean: Know coney is a hot dog and a bond with the

32
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

33
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:43.170
Ateeq Dean: She was like, I made a beautiful steak with shrimp and me know she made me a nice meal and all that. And you know, I got a little angry and I stopped over there, got me a little song I didn't always you know she wasn't making

34
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.010
Ateeq Dean: Something to surprise me.

35
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.430
Ateeq Dean: And I didn't really have much of an appetite.

36
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.090
So that's how I was just out

37
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, um, how many days. Have you been at the 575 milligram

38
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.720
Ateeq Dean: I started last week.

39
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.870
Ateeq Dean: Last Monday. Okay.

40
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.100
Last Monday.

41
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: February 24

42
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To 24 okay so that feel like back to your new optimum right here.

43
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.590
Ateeq Dean: It goes this because he changed the milligrams before they would a little bit

44
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: With the

45
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.070
Ateeq Dean: Ticket was eight milligrams of

46
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.870
Ateeq Dean: buprenorphine and to milligram loxton

47
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.810
Ateeq Dean: It's down by half. So now this trip I get 34 milligrams buprenorphine and then one milligram and

48
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.190
Right.

49
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.000
Ateeq Dean: Now, the thing I noticed about the stresses that

50
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.610
Ateeq Dean: They seem lot bigger than the ones I was taking for

51
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's odd.

52
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.120
Yeah.

53
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:14.610
Ateeq Dean: Other ones were hidden right away like 30 minutes I could tell like you know I'm starting to feel better. This one takes a lot longer sometimes up to two hours for me to feel any difference.

54
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I did the brand change.

55
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.090
Ateeq Dean: I never noticed the brand.

56
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I would recommend you do

57
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to it.

58
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.510
Ateeq Dean: Tonight, look at what Brenda says

59
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'll make a note of it. Sure.

60
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.380
Ateeq Dean: This one says, Dr. Ready on it. Yep.

61
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have any of your strengths from before. And remember them saying

62
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Suboxone

63
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.290
Ateeq Dean: And other ones. The eight milligram ones that the ones. The other one said, I don't have any more of those. But that's what he said.

64
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: He changed friend.

65
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.580
Ateeq Dean: Oh,

66
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's going to be an adjustment, my recommendation for everyone is it's complicated, but stick with one. So you talk to pharmacy and you say, I'm probably going to be using these for the next few months.

67
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you guys if you have like regulars coming in for this particular medication. Do you tend to stick with the same one because it's very likely. I'm going to be continuing to need this particular brand because they do very

68
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is anecdotal from you guys. They vary in potency between brands.

69
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I if I were you, I'd be advocating with my pharmacist and saying, since that's been the experience and they'll, they'll disagree with you. They'll say, Okay, that's not true. But don't you don't have to get into a debate with them. You just get into a discussion.

70
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have to debate with anyone. Um,

71
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I know my doctor wants me to stick with a particular brand. Is there any challenges with keeping this particular doctor ready ground coming in. Do you think that these orders are the ones will be using for these formula groundstrokes

72
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll probably say yes far as I know, and then you started that conversation so that later on.

73
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have to have a conversation with that pharmacists, oh you changed it to

74
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This other stuff.

75
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.260
I'm waiting for the word to show up in my head.

76
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: No gonna show player. Anyway, there's a few of them.

77
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It can change this one to that one to this one to that one. So you really want me

78
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.470
Ateeq Dean: I know it's a big things from the eight and

79
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.880
Ateeq Dean: Now you see why I'm saying, No, I understand. Yeah, yeah.

80
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to stick because you're going to normalize to to Dr. Reddy

81
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Potency you're going to normalize to it. Then they switch it

82
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Normalized to that and this notion of tapering is going to feel like this is

83
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to go up and never even went up. So that's not what we want for you, especially for you because you present with

84
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Dr calls it sticky receptors. I might say, you know, low tolerance for some of the withdrawal symptoms. So I want you to feel good for like for a couple weeks or a week and a half, at least before you take for again which to feel good and not be going up and down. Yeah.

85
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.720
Ateeq Dean: No, my appetite spin really bad.

86
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.890
Ateeq Dean: I he wants a day. I try to eat once a day if I cannot eat. I don't eat, you know,

87
00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.790
Ateeq Dean: There's

88
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.620
Ateeq Dean: No appetite really

89
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, are you losing weight. Do you think I don't

90
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.110
Ateeq Dean: Drink lot of sodas. Not a whole lot. I put down the sodas, but I still drink soda and water.

91
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I've already calories in

92
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Calories on it. Yeah.

93
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So all right, let me just make a little note. Today's three 520 and your original target Dole was you'd be at point five milligrams

94
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Everywhere is six sixth

95
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me. Yeah, so your original plan. I'll just show it to you so you don't

96
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.950
get confused.

97
00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This was the original plan that was set up probably in October. So we've changed it because you're going down to half a milligram

98
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But just noticed that it's slowing down quite a bit your original plan was on February 6 to be at point five actually January 23 to be a point five. So it's slowed way down. Okay, so today, you're at 5.75 milligrams. So persevere, you know, because you know

99
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get you down. I'd like to understand more about what's going on with this appetite, but I'm just wondering if it really has to do with all that sugar and it's been something you wanted to do was cut down on the sugar but you seem to maybe be

100
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, how much reduction is there in sugar from those sodas.

101
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.910
Ateeq Dean: Well, I remember

102
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.900
Ateeq Dean: I used to drink cold months ago, I should drink a two liter.

103
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.590
Ateeq Dean: Of Pepsi or Dr. Pepper and

104
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.130
Ateeq Dean: A lot of soda drink like a six pack of sodas.

105
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:20.250
Ateeq Dean: And I've cut it down now a two liter bottle of action asked me two days. So I read. It's a big difference from drinking a two liter. A DAY. OKAY, SO two days and I still have some we have bought a two liter two days built that I still have half of it.

106
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to go a goal for you. We're going to review it got three of them here. I want to go to the gym, three times a week. How you doing on that for your, your goal.

107
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.600
Ateeq Dean: I haven't done that at all.

108
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you have a membership.

109
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:48.300
Ateeq Dean: No, but there's a place out here that it's the community center. And it's from. I used to go there to the community center.

110
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Funny things getting in the way you're doing that.

111
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.960
Ateeq Dean: Me being lazy well

112
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Lacey's an interesting thing. You guys call yourselves lazy. But there's usually something else going on.

113
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Lazy is a judgment about I'm going to choose to sit here, but I don't think it's that simple.

114
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working you're working hard. We have a newborn, you have this activity, baby. So I'm not quite seeing lazy, tell me why you call yourself lazy.

115
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:36.660
Ateeq Dean: Because it goes to my head like I should I have time to go to the gym right now. But then I'll just be sitting here on the couch and not doing it. These are watching TV.

116
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:54.030
Ateeq Dean: I get to a point where my, my mind is up and then my body feels exhausted or then it changes my body is tired reminds tired or my body is awakened word. So it's the flops on

117
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you don't know is that if you actually exercise, you might feel better. And it's, it's actually getting started that for most people is the problem. Once you're actually driving you're unlikely to stop, turn around and go home.

118
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're unlikely. Once you already have your gym clothes on already have your attendees on to stop and plop down on the couch. It's about

119
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Going in getting those gym clothes on getting the bag ready. That's typically where the biggest challenges is getting good

120
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.570
just getting started.

121
00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So getting it in your mind that you're never going to feel like it might be helpful. You're not going to your mind and body are not going to want to do it.

122
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

123
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Important you've set this goal. You've had this goal here for a long time.

124
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember why you want it.

125
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:25.590
Ateeq Dean: I just want to feel good in life I you know I see a lot of not even old people anymore I you know I told you I work in a nursing facility. I see a bunch of young people like me.

126
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:31.200
Ateeq Dean: That are bed bound, they can't even get out of bed and you know I just be, you know,

127
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:38.430
Ateeq Dean: I just want to take that for granted. I can get out of bed. I can go to the bathroom I brush my teeth. I can, you know, even the little things that I do.

128
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.710
Ateeq Dean: You know, I try not to take for granted. I see these young people that are even younger than me. They could never get all they're just stuck in their bed.

129
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.460
Ateeq Dean: Their life, you know, and it just makes you

130
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes you think

131
00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:03.300
Ateeq Dean: Makes me think that, uh, you know, just appreciate the life that you were given because I'm on borrowed time right we all are.

132
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

133
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.170
Ateeq Dean: Like we're all space dust, we go back

134
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's right.

135
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.020
Ateeq Dean: Do you know this is a human experience.

136
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

137
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's cool to hear you share some of your philosophical beliefs, you tend to be pretty timid about that I really invite those kind of discussions, I have no problem, hearing, hearing that. Okay, you're not. I'm not your parents.

138
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah i'm i'm open

139
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What's working for people

140
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.370
Yeah.

141
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but let's take that if I'm space dust. Well then, why do I bother. If I'm just going to turn into dust. Again, what do you answer to that.

142
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.050
Ateeq Dean: My answer to that as

143
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:19.770
Ateeq Dean: Well, okay. I just know becoming a human being, being born into the world is like hitting the lottery 10 times in a row, so the chances of me warming from spaced us to having a human experience is really, really here.

144
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:34.200
Ateeq Dean: And a lot of people they don't understand that, you know, I didn't understand either that, you know, me being born into the world was already hitting delivery and already having everything

145
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:40.860
Ateeq Dean: I just learned this time and I'm starting to see that is true.

146
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.960
You know,

147
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.030
Different ways

148
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are your actions contradictory to that.

149
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.560
Ateeq Dean: Oh, I just want to enjoy the experience

150
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.660
Ateeq Dean: Want to enjoy it and

151
00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Sitting on the couch is what

152
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.080
Enjoy.

153
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It is enjoying it in the moment.

154
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that is is it's it's

155
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Immediate Gratification. It is a lot easier to just stay put the body doesn't actually like that. So it wants you in motion.

156
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You have those legs for a reason. You have joints for a reason. It doesn't actually want you plopping down. It wants you in motion. We do need to rest. That's where all of our repair happens when we're resting rest is super important.

157
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But exercise. Let's just take exercise for a moment.

158
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: At age 30. And you're how old

159
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.500
Ateeq Dean: I turned 36 now.

160
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: At age 30 our brain starts shrinking.

161
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

162
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, if you want to

163
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase

164
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain size.

165
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: At least the hippocampus, where we store memory.

166
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Exercise promotes this. It's called the brain derived neurotrophic factor. It's a protein that promotes brain growth exercise is what does it three times.

167
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So short term gain is

168
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel good. I'm going to stay put. But you are not promoting the potential of your brain. But if you say, well, long term happiness might be

169
00:18:50.340 --> 00:19:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If I post calm short term comfort staying on the couch, so that I can invest in long term health and happiness, but it does mean but you you're looking too far ahead. All you have to do is as soon as you remember this conversation just picture a little brain getting smaller.

170
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What we got to get motivated by something like my brain is drinking my brain is thinking on this couch. Okay, so let's say that one works and you pop up. You're like, Dang, all you have to do is walk to your closet and get your tennis shoes. That's all you have to do.

171
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You overthink it. You're already thinking how much effort, it's going to be. You don't walking you we haven't have no problem. If the baby was crying going up and getting her so it's just the second thing is you got you got four seconds. Soon as you have the thought. Remember that one.

172
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I have

173
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I have time, you get up, you go put the shoes on.

174
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The likelihood that you're going to keep moving and head to the community center goes up exponentially.

175
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's like, well, now all the next step is just need to get the shorts find my keys bring a water bottle in a towel and you're already in motion. So the likelihood that you're going to follow through with that goes up much higher

176
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think would motivate you.

177
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.510
Ateeq Dean: Know doesn't motivating right here.

178
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A shrinking rain.

179
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Motivating I thought it might

180
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:41.310
Ateeq Dean: Change into and that's a lot of motivation. I don't like the wintertime, the weather's been changed. We're about to change that we're here. So it's going to go in our head next Sunday. So right now it's a something like 830 it'd be 930 after Sunday.

181
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you looking forward to that or not.

182
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll have more daylight.

183
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:55.770
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I hate the way because by time. I wake up, it's dark by time I come home, it's still dark, you know, by time I sleep. I miss out on all the daylight.

184
00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:08.790
Ateeq Dean: Pretty much. So now I noticed you know back here you can see the light and all that. So it is getting a lot brighter. So that's what we're going to do that. Daylight Savings day but it's gonna be a lot better. And that's how I like it.

185
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that will support some progress for you.

186
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, you got a couple of goals here you've got, we've done this one actually

187
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them, everyone has this one which is identify how spirituality affects your recovery. How often do you use your spiritual right universal law. How often do you visit that on a weekly, daily monthly basis.

188
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.180
Ateeq Dean: I've been visiting get more and more

189
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.250
Ateeq Dean: Leverage

190
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me end. What's the thing. How do you connect it to your recovery.

191
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:56.790
Ateeq Dean: I connect to my curry by you know even what I'm thinking right now. I know that it's a lot weaker than the other ones that I know you know like

192
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:06.510
Ateeq Dean: It, you know, the way I've been feeling pretty shitty. I'm gonna lie. I've been feeling really funny. But at the same time, I know that.

193
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:14.070
Ateeq Dean: It's not going to be like this forever. I'm going to pass this I'm going to get past this by taking small baby steps.

194
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:26.130
Ateeq Dean: And how I connected is like the weather's changing it will go out there, get some sunlight, because I've been getting the hot spots you know about it cold. It's not supposed to be nice in here.

195
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:38.550
Ateeq Dean: But I'm cold and drenching hard. You know, when I get like that I go outside, right, man. You know, I'll take a shower. That seems to help me a lot to

196
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That feels spiritual that feels like your connection spirituality. Do your recovery.

197
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.150
Ateeq Dean: Yeah.

198
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

199
00:22:46.260 --> 00:23:01.860
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, because, like, well, it's definitely doing the action part of it, but the spiritual part of it is me, just the spiritual beliefs. I have in my head. Like I have, you know, they that I'll get through, see.

200
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:22.440
Ateeq Dean: Oh, I was telling me to go to the casino again for spending a lot of money there I I stopped going after, you know, after all that I haven't been going, you know, yesterday was my birthday went through my head. It took me to that reptilian place to where the good times are

201
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.340
Ateeq Dean: And I didn't like we got myself out of there.

202
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:41.700
Ateeq Dean: I told my girlfriend about it. I talked to her about it, you know. And she's like, Yeah, no, I'm glad you told me we have a global built together you know she's wanting to go with me to but you know I got myself out there and

203
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:50.520
Ateeq Dean: Just things like that, you know, spiritually, I know just looking more into that type of stuff.

204
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I will say that the way you phrase it

205
00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:58.950
Is bad

206
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: T. Oh.

207
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no, no, no.

208
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Only has to do with when I can hear is, you are thinking about the future. I'll get through this. The part I can't quite here yet. I guess I really want to know the thought that represents faith. I'll give you an example of somebody else's I'm making this up.

209
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This question that I asked you what's your connection between your spiritual faith and your long term recovery and you talked about some things. But what I didn't hear something like this.

210
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember I don't have control over everything. And all I need to do is control this next moment, and then I let go and let God can hold on.

211
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's someone else's. In fact, I made that up.

212
00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can really hear the faith. You can see here the faith in it. Right. I let go and let God that's

213
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A leap of faith. I stopped controlling I stopped having to know everything.

214
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Make everyone put things where they're supposed to go say the right things. They gotta love me, gotta give me what I want. I let go of control. That's someone who can really precisely get ahold of right at the moment where they go like this.

215
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta let go of the need to control this moment, relax into it and just have faith that's someone who can really articulate it

216
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no no of course I you just said what I do something bad. No, of course not.

217
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just someone who really wants to hear the piece about I want to enter your mind. I want to understand how you talk to yourself when it comes to that space of faith, I wouldn't know how that inner voice sounds. That's all.

218
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:56.460
Ateeq Dean: Quiet. I'm not used to waking up. I'm used to being up already. You know, so

219
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great. These are sitting. You're talking about philosophy at eight in the morning. This is hard to do.

220
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:16.680
Ateeq Dean: No, I'm understanding what you're saying. I am so the way I get my spiritual faith is one of the stories I've heard when I was growing up as a kid was the story about David Goliath that big.

221
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:28.440
Ateeq Dean: You know, Tyrion guy and you know a little guide that hit him with a walk at the longer that story with the people I had. And you know, I started thinking, you know,

222
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:40.560
Ateeq Dean: People you know that time. We're always talking about a big nobody take them out and then just like hit them with the rock and you know that that was old story or to my friend and but

223
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:49.890
Ateeq Dean: But the way I feel about that. What brings my spirituality and my pay a little bit to connect the dots as that I feel like everybody

224
00:26:50.400 --> 00:27:04.320
Ateeq Dean: Faces their own David's in their lives, you know, whether it's loss of somebody you know broken heart an addiction, something like that, is there, David, and you know we conquered that you know

225
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.770
Ateeq Dean: Didn't that's what goes to my mind sometimes don't so

226
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I get, if I'm hearing you correctly, a teak you think to yourself, I too am facing Goliath. It is my addiction. And so where is your strength coming from, how do you find it. How do you match it as this little guy. What do you do

227
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.300
Ateeq Dean: You have faith and people believe in yourself that you're

228
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Finished that

229
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:51.330
Ateeq Dean: You have faith in yourself that you're doing a conquer Sir David whether you know to loss of someone or in addiction. You just gotta believe in yourself and move forward, even in baby steps.

230
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.550
Ateeq Dean: You know, we all think

231
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I get it now.

232
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.840
Ateeq Dean: Mini goal is

233
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To hold on to that I want to hear you apply it to getting your tennis shoes on. See if you can do it.

234
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you take that philosophy and apply it to conquering physical health. So just see if you can do it. How do you take that philosophy and get your Toshi over that closet with those techniques on how do you do it, how do you take faith in, get in tennis shoes.

235
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.010
Ateeq Dean: Will get up.

236
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear the inner voice I take

237
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.210
That

238
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not gonna want to do it.

239
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.770
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, you

240
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.360
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I guess you would have to have faith into putting on the tennis shoes to getting to the closet to get your stuff.

241
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Face and what what's the value, what's the point. What's the purpose, why bother. How do you answer yourself with that.

242
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.500
Ateeq Dean: Well, if I don't put on my shoes.

243
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:09.060
Ateeq Dean: Then I'm probably not gonna put my socks and then I'm probably gonna probably shorts or my shirt and then I'm just gonna be naked in my little problem in here, and I'm not going to get ready.

244
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to come out and

245
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.190
Ateeq Dean: You know, like another time where I had to use my face was when I was going to school.

246
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:28.860
Ateeq Dean: Middle School. And that was a bad time because I got bullied in and it was by a group of people. And it was a place I did not want to go.

247
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:37.800
Ateeq Dean: And it came to the point where my mom and Apple going to court. They were getting in trouble because I wasn't attending school I try every excuse in the book to not go

248
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:48.300
Ateeq Dean: And the faith of that part was, you know, you just got to get through it. You just got it go, you know, even we talked to counselors and stuff like that. There, you know, but

249
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.450
Ateeq Dean: It came to a point where I had to fight back.

250
00:29:52.680 --> 00:30:02.700
Ateeq Dean: And it wasn't just one person I was buying like four or five guys just stand there and these are kids. God didn't even make the high school, they should have been sophomores.

251
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:15.330
Ateeq Dean: Low so they stayed back eighth grade, seventh grade, you know that I just remember like just going passing these guys every day and constantly getting name called and rocks don't

252
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:31.080
Ateeq Dean: You know what I'm going to try to come find me right away. And that was something I had to go through every day and I just remember lighting at one point, you know, it took me to getting suspended to getting out of school.

253
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry that happened I hit that people are bullied. I know a lot of people much attention on

254
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:53.640
Ateeq Dean: A place where I had to use my pay to, you know, to get through something like that. So it was a lot deeper than. So when you know i you know like the shoe thing. Like it doesn't click to me like I'm a cutaway but I can use something like that, you know,

255
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.280
Ateeq Dean: So if the dances like

256
00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:04.500
Ateeq Dean: Those were my David's I had to fly it but at that point alive. You know, I didn't, you know, because I knew at that time. I didn't know

257
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:16.800
Ateeq Dean: That one day I would be 36 years old with my own baby, my own life. I was stuck in that moment where there was five other teenagers older than me, bigger than me, you know,

258
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I still haven't heard the voice inside what

259
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I know the story, the story I may be small, like David. I want to hear the voice what you told yourself at made it okay for you to go to that school and stand up for yourself. What did you say to yourself a teak

260
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.280
Ateeq Dean: I hate this shit.

261
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.070
Ateeq Dean: I hate this. It

262
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:48.690
Ateeq Dean: Took me

263
00:31:49.470 --> 00:32:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well maybe that's it. Let's see where that takes us at least, that sounds really honest and you're not trying to tiptoe around so I hate this shit. What's the shit. What's the actual not being able to walk through the classroom pretending like a

264
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.520
Ateeq Dean: Courtyard the school.

265
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.850
Ateeq Dean: Um, I hate the ship, because I never did anything wrong to anybody.

266
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.470
Ateeq Dean: Yeah. Why am I having to face these assholes that are picking on me.

267
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: On a deal. Yeah, there we go, Why me, why me there. Now go to face. How does face answer you.

268
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.850
Ateeq Dean: I just remember my adrenaline running data for me by giving me a bunch of totally

269
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:47.970
Ateeq Dean: Honest.

270
00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll put it over here. This is a pretty important concept. And the reason why I'm being so picky about it is the inner voice our ability to have that inner voice and really know that it's going on conserve

271
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: In a lot of different ways. I'm so I keep trying to hear what your inner voice sounds like. And I heard a little bit around the gambling. Yeah, but so I could hear that one, but I'm having a little difficulty with

272
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: The middle schooler if I'm you. I don't know if this was happening to you, but I might have been thinking

273
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be okay.

274
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It is wait let me finish. It is not for me to know why.

275
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That is faith. It is for me to recognize this ship.

276
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Unacceptable. I can't live like this.

277
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to stand my ground. I have no idea if I'm going to survive it, and be enough by feet five people that's faith. But see how you can hear how I'm talking to myself.

278
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hear how I can't hear your voice inside your head, put a pin in that

279
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to talk about going to the gym, you and I are not talking about being naked in an apartment.

280
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I was trying to tell you that once the momentum starts. That's a different topic that was once the momentum starts to get the shoes on, it's likely you'll make it to the gym but this has to do with exercise fatigue. So hold on go nice and slow.

281
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This morning, my alarm went off at 540

282
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I did not get up.

283
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, that's not true. How did it go 511. No, it was at 411 I woke up before the alarm. And I was like, Oh, I can sleep for another hour

284
00:34:53.820 --> 00:35:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, Oh, these, these exercises to try and go back to sleep. And I couldn't inside my mind decided to run through every single client that I have

285
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And see how they're all doing you know in my head.

286
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This claim what might I talked with them about it did its job. It was

287
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.470
It was on

288
00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: On there was no going back to sleep.

289
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and then I was kind of tired by the time the alarm went off and I didn't want to get up. I didn't want to exercise. I don't want to sign my notes. I just want to lay in bed.

290
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What I did instead was start to do some stretching

291
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I did Child's Pose, which in bed is if you know yoga, but it's your arms around, you're basically on your knees and I started doing that and that felt good. I felt good.

292
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I did Cat Pose. Or I was on my old for and all of a sudden, I'm kind of up a little bit like I'm on my hands and knees. I'm up and I'm like,

293
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, just throw the covers off. Let's do the curse off I NEEDED YOUR use the restroom. Well, I'm already up. I saw my tennis shoes. As I was walking by.

294
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I grabbed him I drag them into the bathroom with my well they're already here. I'll put them on.

295
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.390
Ateeq Dean: No. Okay, yeah, I see.

296
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

297
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't analyze it didn't analyze it. I just that. Next thing, just the next thing. The next thing. The next thing. The next thing.

298
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And and on top of that, not only in the moment. Was I doing things, but I was also using my belief system. My spiritual belief which is

299
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. I'm 50 yeah I need to exercise.

300
00:36:45.990 --> 00:37:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I use my brain, like all day long, analyzing, analyzing, and I have to have my memory. I have to be sharp. I have to, there's a lot of pressure in here. Right. It's not a regular psychotherapy were normal psychotherapy, there'd be long minutes of silence.

301
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Telehealth doesn't tolerate that very well. We're, we're like this talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, but in therapy. Usually we're like,

302
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't do that in here. It's like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, everybody's talked. I talked to her.

303
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I happen to have a really, you know, that kind of personality that it works really well, but it does require I am using a lot of glucose. My brain is going all day long. Go, go, go, go, go. I need to stay sharp. So as much as I don't really feel like exercising. I do see

304
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The spiritual importance of making sure this body is taken care of, because it happens to be my my belief right only get this one body, it's not too different than the way you're describing, right.

305
00:37:52.770 --> 00:38:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can see what's going on in my head, spiritually, I can see it. I don't have to get ahead and say, I'm going to enjoy this.

306
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I just do the next right thing which is I know I need to write my notes. And that's when I do it in the morning and I do it on my little stepper so I do two things at the same time.

307
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm exercising I'm helping my brain and I'm staying on task with my career. Of course I need those things. And so I'm doing a lot of things all at once.

308
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that I just gave you a random example.

309
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to

310
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You can pull this is hard. Pull, how your spiritual beliefs can help you get to the community center.

311
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: With an interview with an inner voice, but with the inner voice sound like in your head.

312
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.510
Ateeq Dean: Okay, so when I get up.

313
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.150
Ateeq Dean: I'm going to put on my shoes.

314
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:59.400
Ateeq Dean: Go to the bathroom shave your face come out to the kitchen. Make me a nice cup of coffee.

315
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:17.700
Ateeq Dean: Maybe go outside see outlets out there, keep them warm cold. But notice the weather's getting better. So more like these could be a nice day today. And then what I'll do is I'll go outside and start the car. Little bit.

316
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.320
Ateeq Dean: You know,

317
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.770
Ateeq Dean: call my mom. See how they're doing.

318
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:24.750
Ateeq Dean: check up on them.

319
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.680
Ateeq Dean: See how they're doing. And then after that I would get in the car and

320
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.960
Ateeq Dean: Drive to the community center and

321
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:45.960
Ateeq Dean: See if I can drop me got someone for getting a membership to join it, which is free, which is free and just putting putting it

322
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.680
Ateeq Dean: Bending maybe 30 minutes

323
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.910
Ateeq Dean: Right now we're after that starting small

324
00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.340
Ateeq Dean: Going up for my

325
00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Part I didn't hear. I heard how you would get it done. And that's doing one little step in front of the other, not getting way ahead of you. What's the spiritual why

326
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Bother. It doesn't feel good. Now that's the inner voice. What does it say when there's going to be a voice that says stay right here. It's comfy in this couch what the boys gonna say

327
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:24.210
Ateeq Dean: Though the voice in my head says that

328
00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:41.070
Ateeq Dean: I know that I could be doing a lot more than what I'm doing as of right now, like when I sit on the couch and watch TV. My inner voice tells me you can be out there. You can jog, a little bit you know exercise your minds a little bit

329
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:43.530
Ateeq Dean: And

330
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.140
Ateeq Dean: It tells me that

331
00:40:47.670 --> 00:41:09.840
Ateeq Dean: To do better at it, it's kind of, you know, but no, that's my inner voice telling me like being like that you know to do a little bit better. I don't like where I'm at. Exactly. I do like where I'm at. But I don't health wise, you know, I'll make up 36 I you don't be up there. I feel

332
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think the connection to spirituality is really available to you. It's not in this moment. Or maybe it's there.

333
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's that you can't articulate it

334
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.400
Ateeq Dean: Maybe not.

335
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But my concern has to do with if you can articulate it here. I wonder if you're

336
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have it.

337
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard. Well, wait, I heard something which had to do with

338
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Kara earlier about the gambling.

339
00:41:44.550 --> 00:42:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I think you probably had the thought, Oh, I do feel like gambling, but did you for a second. Like you value the relationship. And if you gamble that might affect the relationship that's an inner voice like Oh, she might not like that I might lose our money. Right.

340
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an inner voice that's you talking to you. So now switch out

341
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Her with

342
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your belief and faith. You see, if I don't do it if I don't exercise. How is this in support or not and supportive my faith.

343
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one is in faith, the one where you get up and you take care of this one body, or is it staying on the couch. Which ones more congruent with your faith.

344
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.580
Ateeq Dean: So when I get up and take care of this body.

345
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the, that's the inner dialogue that you can't articulate much. I don't even know if it's happening.

346
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's long term happiness. That's I'm making the most out of this vessel that I was given. This is the shape and it's a miracle. I have it at all.

347
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I will no longer put poisons which sugar is yeah I won't put tobacco. I won't put poison in this precious body that's congruent with the kind of faith that some people have

348
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's hard to look at our, our hypocrisy is it's really hard for the psyche, to look at that.

349
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just do one at a time. I'm just going to get to the shoes, just see if this propels me all the way to the gym. I'll see if I like it, and maybe you will maybe it'll keep happening keep happening in your say, look at me, I'm in line with my faith.

350
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it'll happen three times a week.

351
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that inner voice will get more and more developed

352
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a hard a hard conversation.

353
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.050
Ateeq Dean: I've never had anybody about this stuff.

354
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:50.880
Ateeq Dean: Anybody about this type of stuff you know this is stuff that I've got was kept to myself. So it's hard for would even talk about

355
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, I just assume you're talking to her all the time, or this is kind of, I forget that you didn't grow up kind of being able to have that open

356
00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.240
Ateeq Dean: Ended up getting like we didn't really communicate to each other.

357
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.740
I forget.

358
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're doing great. But, but the thing about about bad that was that shocked me you don't. There's no way for a client to do

359
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: The therapy bad you guys like you can't go wrong. Anything you say, and you're all just you're the client. I can't do stuff. I can have a misstep and maybe I went the wrong direction or something. But you just do you man.

360
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.210
Okay.

361
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's schedule another appointment.

Ateeq Dean: I like the timing but Kara's she like 10 o'clock, she does, but she says. Lot of times slower deeper

369
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do. Um, yeah, she wanted. We want to do some couples. That'd be fun. How about the video.

Here's

384
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your condition. So, hmm, you were awfully excited. The last time I met with you. You had things moving and grooving has it continue to move that that fast chosen a different path.

385
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.930
Jen: Um, things are things are

386
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.890
Jen: Moving fine work was, um,

387
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.110
Jen: I'm just waiting.

388
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:49.740
Jen: To get credentialed in here from her as far as when that starts happening. I just touched base with

389
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:58.200
Jen: The landlord of my new office yesterday and he's sending the lease agreement in the next week.

390
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:19.530
Jen: And so, yeah, that's feeling good. I'm every client that I've talked to about it wants to come with me and is happy about that. And yeah, so that's feeling good. I even strangely enough, I had a couple of clients from like two years ago. Reach out this week and want to start again and

391
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.120
Jen: And so yeah, things are going really well with work.

392
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.400
Jen: My show on the other hand is. Oh. Oh my god.

393
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:31.290
It's amazing.

394
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What it's amazing.

395
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.700
Jen: It's amazing. Yeah, I feel like

396
00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:43.200
Jen: It's amazing how like when one thing feels better.

397
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.990
Jen: The universe can sometimes like give you some more things to do.

398
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:59.670
Jen: And so with that, it's just heartbreaking. I think it'll do a little bit about the show that it's about two college age freshman

399
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:15.150
Jen: At Princeton University. One is black one is white Jewish and it's about sexual assaults and so it's beautiful show, um, where they go back and forth between being in an arbitration room.

400
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:25.290
Jen: I'm as happens that on so many college campuses. When this happens, where it isn't a court of law. It's basically up to these

401
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:37.560
Jen: People at a university. And so it's really cool. It goes back and forth between them like being in that situation, and then it goes back to like the scene of the night that they met of the night and question.

402
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:49.980
Jen: Um, and then what I think is beautiful is that it starts out we like it begins with this this scene of them like meeting the night of the of what happened and kind of like

403
00:48:51.120 --> 00:49:13.650
Jen: Their date and then we end with the same night with the same date, but it has a different energy to it because now we have all of this information. And so it's just really cool, but basically my lead actor. He is 42 years old but is playing an 18 year old because he looks incredibly young

404
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.480
Jen: And he is just phenomenal in the role

405
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:27.510
Jen: But we've just had some difficulty because like he's in a show right now. So he's in performances in the weekends and then he does rehearsals with us during the week.

406
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:42.600
Jen: And so he's just booked. And so he was really sick and had to miss a couple rehearsals and then he had a conflict and had to miss a couple rehearsals and then on Tuesday. Two days ago I woke up to a text from him, saying, Jen.

407
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:52.380
Jen: He has a 21 year old daughter at Ohio State University. And he said, my daughter tried to take her own life last night.

408
00:49:54.090 --> 00:50:07.650
Jen: She's okay they they got her to the hospital and pumped her stomach. But I haven't talked to her. I'll be at rehearsal tonight, but I won't. That'll be on my mind and I was like, No, you're not coming to rehearsals.

409
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

410
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:14.820
Jen: Like, I appreciate your professionalism. But no, like, please take care of your family.

411
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:27.030
Jen: And so basically he's just further behind than the other actor. I talked to him last night. He does not want to drop out. Um, he it was actually interesting talking to him because he was like your therapist.

412
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:34.920
Jen: I, you know, he was like my daughter's my world. I talked to her four or five times a week. I talked to her on Sunday.

413
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:43.620
Jen: And honestly, this is out of nowhere for all of us. There was nothing. And he was like, and honestly, like she gets everything she wants.

414
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:53.250
Jen: Like she has all of her bills paid. She's going to university, she wants to go to. She has a car she all this stuff. And he was like, and this sounds awful. But I am I'm I'm having trouble.

415
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:59.850
Jen: Finding my sympathy. I am mad at her right now I get it. Okay, wow, and

416
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what, what's the challenge for you and you said the universe is kind of bringing you something to work with.

417
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.750
Jen: It's interesting because to be honest. At the end of the day it's a fucking community play

418
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:33.870
Jen: And that's how I feel like I've been doing this for so long that I'm just like, I don't give a shit if we have to push back to show a week. I don't care if like you had to hold the script for the first weekend, like this is your life so much more important.

419
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:56.010
Jen: And so there's that. And what's nice is that like my my female actor. She is just so so strong so far ahead. She's been off books since day one and hat if she weren't so strong. I would feel more nervous about the show but she's just on it. And so, um,

420
00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:10.950
Jen: I feel I do feel nervous about the show, just because it's less rehearsal than I am used to or that I would like, um, but at the end of the day, I think it's gonna be fine. I think more than anything, um,

421
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.220
It just kills me.

422
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:24.780
Jen: To see someone who I love going through that I've worked with him before. Um, and I really respect and love him and

423
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:40.530
Jen: Yeah, that just breaks my heart. I've had. I don't know what's going on, but three of my team three of my team clients have peers who committed suicide here in Albuquerque. In the last two months.

424
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:49.410
Jen: So part one. It's funny because like my mother's mother killed herself.

425
00:52:50.490 --> 00:53:00.270
Jen: And my husband's mother, his bio mother was married to a woman for 24 years she killed herself.

426
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:14.010
Jen: And my mother. I don't think necessarily killed herself, but had a lot of habits that we all believe contributed to her heart failure, which ended her life.

427
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:15.780
Jen: And so

428
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:21.000
Jen: What's interesting is that I don't find

429
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:34.890
Jen: The concept of suicide to be as scary or threatening as other people, I think, probably because I've had more direct experience with it. Um,

430
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:47.040
Jen: And I guess it's so awful for the people that you leave behind because there are always so many questions. And there's just always

431
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:52.830
Jen: Just this uncertainty of like what could I have done, yada, yada.

432
00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:05.280
Jen: But then also talking with people about it. I think that there's a certain like freedom that we all see in the idea of suicide as far as being like

433
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:12.450
Jen: Oh god, I have to do this. No, I don't. I just kill myself in like that way of like I could

434
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:19.290
Jen: I do not want to nor shall lie, but that is an option. We all have open to us. We do.

435
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:21.270
Jen: Um,

436
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not constrained by I'm assuming hell. Right. Yes.

437
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not an option.

438
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.850
Jen: And that's a really good point.

439
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the downside of of not having right that kind of religious sort of faith piece it together freedom that you have no

440
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:50.310
Yeah.

441
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder why that topics coming up right now. I'm wondering why we

442
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.050
Jen: Know, as to why um

443
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.070
Jen: Yeah.

444
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.280
Jen: Well, what's interesting, too, is like

445
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:17.040
Jen: I feel like this show is more triggering than I would have anticipated.

446
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:31.290
Jen: Because of my relationship to sex and as far as like the cheating that happened in my relationship. A few years ago, and the kind of sex. I was having with men and

447
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to hear yourself just free associate and see if you land on something valuable to you. You want to just go there, see what

448
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:43.200
Jen: Okay, yeah.

449
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.600
Jen: I'm

450
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:51.330
Jen: From the time that I was very young. I found rape scenes to be really

451
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:59.850
Jen: Sexually like it turned me on. I'm from I remember being like

452
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:04.560
Jen: Um, when I realized that was first there.

453
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.420
Jen: And

454
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:22.410
Jen: As I was, as I like open up to my mother about it because what what was really nice about my mom is that she like nothing was ever off the table. Like I could go to her and talk to her about anything. And she would talk to me about anything she

455
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.670
Jen: Even though, like we had this like evangelical church part of my upbringing.

456
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:40.140
Jen: Within it, my mother was always really careful about like never wanting to shame me for masturbation like never like shaming and also like even

457
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:52.170
Jen: Like, even though I knew within the church. It was taught not to have sex before marriage, like my mother was, she was just like, whatever, like, you know, go with the flow.

458
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.790
Jen: I think it was much more important to her that I

459
00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:04.800
Jen: Had a good time and that I was in a situation that I wanted to be in. And so

460
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:06.810
Jen: I was very much

461
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.940
Jen: a late bloomer, like I didn't have my first sexual experience until I was 19

462
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:19.530
Jen: I didn't have like a full like penis and vagina experience until I was 21 um

463
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:29.220
Jen: And so then when things started to fall apart in my marriage around 2014 and

464
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:42.630
Jen: I had a soft deal structure and I lost like 70 pounds in the course of, like, eight months. And so I also had this new body that I saw.

465
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:53.820
Jen: Getting different reactions. Um, and so then I felt this power in a different way that I hadn't felt before.

466
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:59.820
Jen: And then I very much sought out because that was another thing is that, like with

467
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:14.940
Jen: My husband Joshua, he has never been even want he's never wanted to try like rape fantasies even like sexually like aggressive like anything like that may seem really uncomfortable and he doesn't want to be a part of it. And he's always

468
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:19.800
Jen: Been really weirded out that that was part of what I wanted.

469
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:37.470
Jen: And so that was hard. And so then when I found it with like strangers. It was really exciting to me because then I was having the sex that I had always wanted to have and I felt really empowered by it and felt really gratified by it.

470
00:58:38.250 --> 00:59:03.090
Jen: And it wasn't until I guess like a year end that I started to look back at some of the experience I was having with these men that I was feeling so empowered by that were really violent and really like. Now I don't want any part of it. I don't know what happened after

471
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.740
Jen: Trump got elected, but everything like really changed for me. Um,

472
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:19.830
Jen: And I didn't, I just didn't crave that anymore and I craved

473
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:32.790
Jen: A more like intimate connection which ultimately brought me back to my marriage and really strengthened did, um, I think what's been hard and weird. Is that like

474
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:50.850
Jen: My libido has dropped completely from where was, um, I would say like age like 34 to 38 was like off the charts. Nothing I had ever experienced in my life before, and now it has dipped to nothing and

475
00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:59.040
Jen: For sure. I don't know if it's just because we've been together so long and he's older but my husband is okay with that we've had.

476
00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:10.350
Jen: A lot of talks about it because I was very much like we need to have a night like at least once a week, we're going to connect. We're going to do this. And he was like, if you want to do that, we can absolutely do that.

477
01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:30.840
Jen: But like, um, if you also just like don't want to have sex right now. I'm fine with that too. We can take it organically. And so that's what we've been doing, which has resulted in us, not having sex. But as far as I know that I am not upset about that and as far as I can tell he's not um

478
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:37.470
Jen: But the second I was having

479
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.630
Jen: Fox with me sometimes.

480
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.850
Jen: That I

481
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:50.190
Jen: I don't know that I wanted or needed to go there and have and be treated that way.

482
01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.580
Jen: Are you still here.
