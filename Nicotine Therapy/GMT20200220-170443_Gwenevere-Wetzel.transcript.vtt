Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

4
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.840
So,

5
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I really want to make sure we get to our today working on that nasty little shame issue are yours.

6
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go at it.

7
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it happening right now. Are you like

8
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.770
Cynthia We: Really totally

9
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, gosh. Oh, Cindy.

10
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.470
Let's just bring it together.

11
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.810
Let's just be okay.

12
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice nourishing broth speed. Okay, now. Okay.

13
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to that greenhouse together.

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Some allow your imaginations bring you there. The warmth that comes from being in that greenhouse

15
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The vibrant colors.

16
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: From the plants.

17
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The smells that come to your awareness of being in there and even smelling the warmth can even bring it

18
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.880
Consciousness.

19
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And then nothing negative can get in

20
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.170
Only what you need.

21
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What fuels nourishes the soul.

22
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To have that breath go

23
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Deep into the lungs.

24
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your posture direct allow that air into the lungs as possible just breathing it in nice and deep

25
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice whatever negative things that they're far and and distance use that distancing metaphor and sort of habit.

26
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of distancing further and further away.

27
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's just a little speck

28
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you notice a more relaxed body if the muscles start to be less tense as negativity gets further and further away.

29
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be a thought.

30
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be a worry

31
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be a negative memory or image, I'd be a statement.

32
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just again and again as they pop up just putting them.

33
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: On that distance metaphor. Not sure what yours was whether it was river or a balloon that floats away just have it go further and further away.

34
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: continue paying attention to your body, remembering that yet will message to stress before don't even have a thought.

35
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So on that leaf on the river. Just have it floating away whatever the negativity.

36
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I can safely pick it up and explore together. But for now, it's not urgent might be important that we don't have to have a nearby right now.

37
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then find yourself on the shore of the river, the river bank.

38
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling the quality

39
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Of right Jim Shauna since value and air right just be present with those qualities over there on the side. This is what you're left with is all of the amazing feeling of strength and calm.

40
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That this protective figure

41
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing and wisdom.

42
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: riverbank you can have the thought, I am handling this

43
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: scan your body and see if there's still a great deal of charge anywhere. See if there's a more relaxed.

44
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what's going on with you. I

45
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.590
Feel much better. You

46
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

47
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Take time to clear out the nose and

48
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You

49
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.470
Cynthia We: Know,

50
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice.

51
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

52
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my idea for today.

53
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a trigger that happened in your real life.

54
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all we need.

55
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we can work with that today.

56
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to do some of the desensitization want to do some of the positive weeding out of positive figures and positive cognition and let's get to it.

57
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put this behind you.

58
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If it brings up stress. If you really don't want to let it go. If you really, really want to hold on to shame. You've known it so long, don't I do, but you may

59
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You you've gotten so intimate with it for so long. You may not want to let it go.

60
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's okay too in here. It's just fine.

61
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:21.720
Cynthia We: I feel like I don't have any other way to react, even though I believe that you taught me some skills I it's so automatic and that's right I even can can see it happening and

62
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna win. Let's work on it today. Let's not waste.

63
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.570
Cynthia We: And

64
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get into it.

65
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.790
Cynthia We: So why don't know what happened, or do you care.

66
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.490
Cynthia We: Oh care. Absolutely. Well, I mean,

67
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.360
Cynthia We: Yeah.

68
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.890
Cynthia We: What it was

69
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.840
Cynthia We: Or not right.

70
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do the work. Work looks a little different than feeling someone here you

71
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is really specific work. We're going to do the MTR. It's a little different.

72
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do. Are you willing to do some of the MTR today.

73
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.010
Cynthia We: Oh, I'd love to. Yeah.

74
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Gorgeous. So I hope you know I care a day.

75
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.340
Cynthia We: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

76
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:10.170
Cynthia We: I just meant like for this, for this particular like you need. Do you want the information right now or do you even need to know it, or

77
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't even

78
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.860
Cynthia We: I just need to remember it. When we're doing the most right

79
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll take care of you.

80
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

81
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.620
Cynthia We: Very typical of what what happens in

82
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so good. Take a deep breath.

83
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be aware that I don't know if you refer to me as Gwen therapist or one of your how you think about me but Gwen Gwen is here and she's going to guide me

84
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.820
She's going to help me working through this chain.

85
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To see how true that is for you is that here today. Mm hmm. Yes. Okay.

86
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel that too. I feel like I've got a real plan. I know, I know what we're going to do.

87
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are on a laptop. Mm hmm. Okay. I'd like to have it so that your face is right in the center and see how mine is in the center because when you do these bilateral movements, you're going to be looking at the left and right.

88
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: With this blue light. And I want you to have the full nice

89
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.210
Cynthia We: Let me relocate our coffee cup.

90
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.390
Okay.

91
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How activated carbon from zero to 100 right now.

92
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.670
Cynthia We: Um, I was probably at a 75 when I came

93
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:46.080
Cynthia We: And I'm like, I think I calm down and probably at a 40 okay

94
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a great place to actually work is right there at a 40 you like you can still think right now.

95
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got some right. You can even say

96
00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What a shame is automatic. Man, I wish it was this other thing. But there it is again you can sort of say that's true. You can almost have a tiny bit of distance from that truth so you're able to use for that prefrontal cortex, you're not completely

97
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In the emotion. You can use all of the different parts of your brain 40s, a nice place to work. If it starts to go really, really high, you can always just kind of do this.

98
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You've said to me once, I wouldn't dare or something like that, interrupting yeah do dare dare as many times as you want to, I want you to be my most difficult client. Don't be my easiest client. Don't be

99
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.210
Cynthia We: A good

100
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.200
Cynthia We: Client Sunday.

101
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to rob yourself of treatment. Okay, be a pain in the ass be defiant be resistant. I, I just need you to pay attention to what comes up and not worry about

102
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What I think. Okay, catch it as fast as you can.

103
00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You can name it if you catch it. Oh, I just started thinking about, we think about me. We can say it out loud. That's great. If you want to skip that part and just say your next truth that's fine too. Got to be really mindful of that. Okay. A lot of you guys do that you you do that thing.

104
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

105
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into it.

106
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're social people we care about what people think of us.

107
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

108
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:29.190
Cynthia We: The attics would be so that would care so much about what somebody thinks it's

109
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of shame.

110
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right that judgment.

111
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so we're going to get into this, I'm going to share my screen with you. And again, you can say stop. You can put your hands up like this, you can always just get up and walk out of the room. Okay.

112
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You can also beckoned me on. Sometimes my iterations are too slow. And you're working through something something important is maybe coming from the unconscious

113
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: From in from the hippocampus right it's getting pulled up and you want a little more time. You can do this because they're probably going to last about I think you liked think it was 20 seconds.

114
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.930
Cynthia We: Yeah, you can do it a little bit longer like 30 seconds. Maybe. Okay.

115
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Three and make

116
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It make them, but it may feel really long. And so just, just give me something. What do you think you'll do this or this. What would you like to do

117
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

118
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me pause up

119
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hope to see it a lot of times, my eyes are at the bottom and I'm looking at time, but I hope to see it. So get the positive and the screen so I can see him, but if you want more. What will you do to show me one more.

120
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.810
Cynthia We: This is a little weird but

121
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.770
You want to do

122
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I can't see your hand.

123
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.290
Cynthia We: That's all I guess that's or I'll just say more. Can I just say more.

124
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Or she can also

125
00:12:51.150 --> 00:13:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Delete. Your turn. The screen. So I just see. I don't need information from the top of your head. I'm interested more in your body. So as little of okay now sit back

126
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's better. Now I'll see a little bit. A little bit more subtle stuff a little bit of a great. Okay. Alright. So let me just see what

127
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:19.020
Cynthia We: Except, then you can see my nightstand and all this shit that's on top of it, which is upsetting me. Okay. Well, we had, we can start

128
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: There. So what does that say about you that you

129
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.700
Cynthia We: Know, well, I'll just put my purse. No.

130
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not she use it as our

131
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.060
Cynthia We: Call you

132
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.560
Cynthia We: It says that I'm a slob. And that I don't have my shit together and

133
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, call that I'm a slob.

134
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have my shit together. How old is that

135
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.930
Cynthia We: I'm

136
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.080
Like

137
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.370
Ancient Yeah, what's the

138
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, the age or maybe the most intense time where that was true really comes to mind.

139
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.950
Cynthia We: Well, I think it's like currently it's really currently it's really a problem.

140
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.490
Cynthia We: I don't think my mom and dad were so much worried about that, but I think my husband really

141
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do this. That part I'll do the analysis for you today. You get a break. You don't have to do the analysis, you just get to just relax into whatever's coming up for you.

142
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:32.700
Cynthia We: What I mean is that I don't think that I've always been so disorganized and I've always felt this way. I think it's more of them on a new feeling

143
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And

144
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.170
Cynthia We: When it's done. Yeah. When

145
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.780
Cynthia We: The mess and you don't have your shit together. That's like a newer thing it's

146
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So noisy.

147
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Years recent years. Yeah, see if you can find the most intense time where that was true.

148
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.030
Like know

149
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that that's the case up. Yeah.

150
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.150
Cynthia We: Now, or I'm

151
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.340
Cynthia We: Tell me, within the last

152
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.630
Cynthia We: Probably the last 10 years

153
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.610
Cynthia We: Five years

154
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what constitutes. This is ancient

155
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.130
Cynthia We: Um,

156
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:29.220
Cynthia We: No, I think I misspoke when I said that because I don't believe that it was always case.

157
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.120
Cynthia We: So it's not very ancient it's more of a

158
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.840
Cynthia We: Recent feeling

159
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no more intense awareness of not great. I don't have my shit together. There's no more intense time than today.

160
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.370
Know,

161
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.090
Cynthia We: When the kids were babies.

162
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.410
Cynthia We: I felt really

163
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How old are you,

164
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:09.450
Cynthia We: 3030 3837

165
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:21.240
Cynthia We: Yeah. There was one time when I really, really didn't have my shit together even more than I don't know so that that would be like 3737 okay

166
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And

167
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion that goes with that memory that just passed through your awareness, your consciousness.

168
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Chain.

169
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And the belief about yourself. One more time. What is it,

170
00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.640
Cynthia We: I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't have my shit together and I'm

171
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.270
Cynthia We: A loser.

172
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would you like to be thinking about yourself.

173
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:08.910
Cynthia We: I would like to be thinking that I'm just a human, trying to figure it out. And that it's okay. I'm okay.

174
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

175
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:12.390
Yes.

176
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And how true is the MLK from one to seven, it's

177
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.380
Cynthia We: Never true. Oh.

178
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now it's not it's not it's not true at all.

179
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.790
Cynthia We: Intellectually, I know I should be okay. But I don't feel okay

180
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So, it said, uh,

181
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.190
Cynthia We: Yeah, like a to

182
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A to

183
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:42.090
Cynthia We: I don't want to kill myself. But I'm not feeling very good about myself. Okay.

184
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So true it about a two.

185
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was any lower than that.

186
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.150
Cynthia We: That I want to kill myself. Okay.

187
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.620
Cynthia We: At a one. Yeah.

188
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's pretty close.

189
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a pretty negative thing you're feeling about yourself.

190
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.120
Yeah.

191
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And how distress from zero to 100. Are you right now.

192
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.610
Cynthia We: I'm, I'm, like, at a 16 oh

193
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.740
Cynthia We: Maybe 15

194
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:12.540
Cynthia We: Again,

195
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, of course I went up a little bit. Without awareness.

196
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.750
Cynthia We: A little bit. Okay.

197
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little bit of more rapid

198
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Eye movement.

199
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's going to feel a little bit more intense. Remember you don't want to strain your eyes don't get too too close. We just want it moving about a shoulder distance, don't get too too close.

200
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is desensitization. This isn't interweaving the positive. So you're going to be sitting with the worst image at 37 horse picture.

201
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.430
Okay.

202
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a loser.

203
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to concentrate on this light.

204
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Together. Inhale, big belly, all the way down to the bottom of that long. And then exhale, it all out.

205
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And gently.

206
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: turn in to self reflection and awareness just pay attention to what comes up.

207
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.420
Cynthia We: Um,

208
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.800
Cynthia We: I don't really like to think about that time.

209
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing in your body.

210
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.600
Cynthia We: That I keep stopping breathing.

211
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Spend some time breathing bring that air down into the belly way down low, pressing that diaphragm pushing those organs down really, it takes effort to breathe like that. Get it out of the top of the chest, just really push that belly.

212
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.990
Cynthia We: Should even do it. It's so hard.

213
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But

214
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do the lazy boy pose. Put your paws behind your head.

215
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of reach those elbows back

216
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now just

217
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.310
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

218
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Fried fried into the long nice as much as she can. And they're trying to push it low

219
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just paying attention to. Oh, look at me, I'm doing it a little bit more my feel the difference

220
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel this different kind of positioning

221
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.820
Cynthia We: Different ways, but actually like goes down there.

222
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like a little

223
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Little baby, let's get that belly just sort of rolling out there.

224
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And if your arms get tired, you can put them on your hips. That's sort of Wonder Woman pose. I know you're seated, but you can certainly do that as well. Kind of hands on hips. When if you wanted to switch it. Same kind of thing.

225
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your stress level or

226
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.840
Cynthia We: Maybe, maybe back down to a 40. Can I grab a Kleenex again.

227
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Who do you think

228
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your quality of those figures.

229
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective quality nurturing figure

230
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Or wise of those three for a moment in your imagination. I want you to picture or something you don't like to think about

231
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe the support and presence of one of those figures.

232
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they've got some some useful tips and support or their presence. Who do you want to get support from around this. I don't want to think about them.

233
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.910
Cynthia We: Jim Shaughnessy

234
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as she thought of him what his face look like

235
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.300
Cynthia We: I'm

236
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.120
Cynthia We: And

237
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.070
Cynthia We: Like he's like smirking

238
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.490
Cynthia We: I don't know smirking sorry more but

239
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.650
Cynthia We: He's smiling.

240
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:18.750
Cynthia We: Kind of chuckling to himself, because he he actually should be my wise figure because he's an alcoholic. That kind of knows everything that I'm thinking and knows the answer.

241
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.760
Cynthia We: Okay alcoholic with with like long term sobriety.

242
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: One time here. So for now, Jim Shaughnessy is really in the quality of wisdom. Yeah.

243
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:40.380
Cynthia We: But he's usually the protector, but I think like he's all of the things

244
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So be present with him.

245
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing is kind of smiling face.

246
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: He has lived experience that you don't have to explain yourself.

247
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to explain yourself to him.

248
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so much common territory.

249
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you in your imagination, tell him why you don't like to think about

250
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That image.

251
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: At 37

252
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.780
Cynthia We: Would you like me to say it out loud.

253
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

254
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.020
Cynthia We: Oh, well, I'm

255
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:28.770
I'm

256
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.210
Cynthia We: Because I was using, and I'm

257
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.320
Cynthia We: I was a mom.

258
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.000
Cynthia We: And the two of those things don't go together.

259
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.800
Cynthia We: In my mind,

260
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And where do you think about yourself, what's the I Am.

261
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.980
Cynthia We: I'm a piece of shit.

262
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Now look at Jim's face.

263
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What does he do without self appraisal.

264
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: See, let that sit there

265
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.440
Cynthia We: Whoa know

266
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What does he do

267
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.990
Cynthia We: He likes chuckles and

268
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.460
Cynthia We: So the understands. But that's absolutely not true.

269
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Who would understand right now.

270
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about your nurturing figure

271
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: On your environment, who would understand

272
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.160
Cynthia We: He totally understands

273
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's revisit that again.

274
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to say to him out loud, I'm a piece of shit and tell him why I want you to notice his reaction.

275
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:21.540
Cynthia We: Because I was using, and I will have a piece of shit because I'm using and I'm a new mom.

276
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.610
Cynthia We: And those two things don't go together and

277
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this face look like

278
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:33.390
I'm

279
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.060
Cynthia We: Concerned, and

280
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.860
Cynthia We: Looks concern and

281
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.400
Cynthia We: Like he totally gets it and

282
00:27:50.640 --> 00:28:03.450
Cynthia We: He's a little bit sarcastic and and spunky so like he always would respond in a way that you know doesn't sound nurturing or like he's protecting me from the host

283
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.140
Cynthia We: But, but I feel like

284
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.540
Cynthia We: It's very hard to

285
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.330
Cynthia We: Describe exactly how he

286
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: See what happens. I'm a piece of shit. I want you to see his face. He looks concerned he gets it.

287
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.920
Cynthia We: Yeah. And he told me no

288
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:23.910
Okay.

289
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that hold that in your awareness, Cindy.

290
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm shit he looks at you and says, I understand he looks at you and gets it and then that other piece you're going to go with that.

291
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.140
Okay.

292
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend together.

293
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: He'll get it down that lower long and then when you're ready, push it.

294
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: out out out out out out out let it go.

295
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up and let me know what you nurse.

296
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.250
Cynthia We: Oh, he doesn't agree. Yeah.

297
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What does he. What does he say

298
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.170
Cynthia We: Boys.

299
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.470

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This impression of you.

459
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder what you might say,

460
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.910
Well, he told me that talented.

461
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.180
From my

462
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:16.320
Cynthia We: From my writing what I've written about it. He knows

463
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.550
Cynthia We: He knows that I'm

464
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.830
A good person.

465
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.920
Didn't do things.

466
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.110
Intentionally

467
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.150
Cynthia We: There's no indication that I have a bad person.

468
00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

469
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:46.110
Cynthia We: Shaughnessy would like to suggest something

470
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

471
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:52.350
Cynthia We: To it attics

472
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.110
Cynthia We: Go to a meeting.

473
00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:56.490
Meeting.

474
00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do my say go

475
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:03.180
Cynthia We: Go to a meeting.

476
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: people that understand you.

477
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

478
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:18.870
Cynthia We: I wasn't asking him, but

479
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale,

480
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: quiet, slow rhythm.

481
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Watching the process.

482
00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Miss quiet that will happen between us.

483
00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

484
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.170
Cynthia We: I think that that's always the solution actually

485
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.470
To go to a meeting.

486
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:28.620
Cynthia We: And probably no matter how long it's been probably that will remain the solution.

487
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you get there. When you go to a meeting.

488
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.380
Cynthia We: Understanding

489
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:40.380
People who get me.

490
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.470
Cynthia We: And friends that

491
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.880
Cynthia We: That I haven't seen in a long time.

492
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.910
Cynthia We: But anytime I see them.

493
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:58.890
Cynthia We: I reminded of that camaraderie.

494
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:08.160
Cynthia We: You know, you're, you're a deeper with that and then you are with people in your everyday life because they know more about

495
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're in

496
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.310
Cynthia We: And they know your dark secrets and they don't think you're a bad person.

497
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:19.770
Cynthia We: They totally get it.

498
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You

499
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that understanding to other people.

500
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:28.830
Cynthia We: Do I

501
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Will have done shitty things and they're good people.

502
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:37.710
Yeah.

503
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture one of them in your imagination.

504
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe holding the opinion.

505
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you think about them in your mind.

506
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief you have about them.

507
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Without opinion, be that belief without them.

508
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:35.820
Cynthia We: That they aren't acting like themselves when they're using. So that is separate from who they are as a person.

509
00:54:37.710 --> 00:55:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with that pull up that worst image at 37

510
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Inhale.

511
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Take this time at the top of the hour to reflect on some of the

512
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Pieces that came up for you.

513
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.830
Cynthia We: I think it's very important that they're separate they're separate things that separate separate

514
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Separate as in

515
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.040
Cynthia We: There so that doesn't make you a bad person. Just because you did things in your us

516
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: As in there, Cindy.

517
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's out who can on that she did some shitty things when she was in active addiction. There's the authentic Cindy, who wouldn't do that. And there's the attic to would there. Cindy is a good person. And there's a selfish act that doesn't give a shit. And they're Cindy, there's the

518
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.940
Cynthia We: Two separate entities.

519
00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.110
There Sephora.

520
00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy.

521
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:50.010
Cynthia We: It's very interesting that I had to see it from an outside perspective in order to see it.

522
00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.040
Cynthia We: You're very smart for being able to pick that out. I'm impressed.

523
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.280
Cynthia We: For being able to like

524
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:07.830
Cynthia We: Determine that maybe that was the problem that I couldn't see it myself. But it was easier. It

525
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:11.040
Cynthia We: Worse.

526
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:19.560
And I didn't do anything. You did all the heavy lifting. Cindy just now.

527
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's all just this all came from you.

528
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We didn't know what to do.

529
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:32.400
Cynthia We: Yeah.

530
00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment. If you can afford it. I've got that on my mind.

531
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll do what's right for your family. So you tell me what you want to do.

532
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.010
Cynthia We: Well, I would like to come next week on

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.890
Cynthia We: The priority for me so

534
00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we'll meet it. Close the

535
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.300
Cynthia We: Board for my family. Okay, so

536
00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:55.920
Cynthia We: Well,

537
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.500
Cynthia We: Thank you for

538
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:03.810
Cynthia We: The monthly alarm you to go to group once a month. That's great.

539
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't remember like talk with her about it. Do you remember

540
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.710
Cynthia We: You just I think

541
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:23.100
Cynthia We: Maybe you had talked with her about it like outside of group because, um, you mentioned that. And then that you were I needed a month supply for reasons that you had talked about. Okay, good.

542
00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So as long as I got done because all forget who, if it gets kind of

543
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Confusing. But then if stuff comes up. That's normal. Some of it could be released some of it could be more interesting images and thoughts and irritability.

544
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's not a backslide that would be normal. This is intense work we're pulling up all stuff. So don't just reach out to me or go to a meeting.

545
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Be good to you, no matter what.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.800
