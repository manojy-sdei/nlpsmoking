158
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.510

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.640
Magalie Marcellus: Still in the household. So how does that

164
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:12.150
Magalie Marcellus: How does that work with the dynamic with their relationship and you as the sun, you know, wanted to make sure that your mom is okay. So how does that work.

165
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:22.050
N817: I'm really a reprint manners. When she gets back of their toe and believes

172
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.800
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. How long ago was that, again, I sent you a teenager when that happened,

N817: Right here, because this is her house.

180
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.480
N817: So,

181
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:44.070
N817: Either we're gonna stay here or we're going to move to a different somewhere else.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.630
Magalie Marcellus: Oh,

280
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.400
N817: People judge you.

281
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.770
N817: Oh, every time I go. So we're always think that people

282
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.380
Magalie Marcellus: Maybe just you thinking that

283
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.300
N817: Yeah.

284
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:42.750
And

285
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.290
Magalie Marcellus: So I'm

286
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.270
N817: Even though they're

287
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.780
Magalie Marcellus: Not even thinking, oh, by the way.

288
00:26:52.080 --> 00:27:09.750
Magalie Marcellus: But because that's in your head. So you go with your thought, you know, which is sometimes that thought we have you thinking is the we do. Yeah, that's him. But it's not is because you have that anxiety that you know you think people are looking at you for whatever reason.

289
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.240
N817: Yeah, that causes

290
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:29.730
N817: So usually like I'm fine. I'm just like what 144 out. But if I get out of more than man. Then I start like having like headings ID.

291
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.670
N817: And you know, I don't know exactly like

292

294
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:49.740
N817: And

295
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.810
N817: That's why he was prescribed me the Xanax down there.

296
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:06.030
N817: You know, I did that for two years or so, I had two years of

297
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.160
N817: Pretty good quality of life, but I could actually get out

298
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:18.360

721
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:43.980
Magalie Marcellus: If you ever get a chance

722
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.050
Magalie Marcellus: You should try. It's really

723
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:50.490
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, sure. It's probably somewhere around. I just never heard about it.

Martin’s iPhone: You know, I just gotta practice mindfulness and

727
01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:13.020
Martin’s iPhone: You know, I kind of wasn't really

728
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:16.920
Martin’s iPhone: Focused when I was listening to the

729
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:26.610
Martin’s iPhone: To the video and everything. And I was kind of more or less referencing mindfulness as being aware of my surroundings and things like that.

730
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:28.500
Martin’s iPhone: Whereas on a more

731
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.050
Martin’s iPhone: psychological and emotional aspects of mindfulness

732
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:41.880
Martin’s iPhone: Like why I'm I am aware of my feelings and when I get angry. How do I react.

733
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:43.230
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh. Yeah.

734
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.420
Martin’s iPhone: Need to be more mindful of that, and mindful of my surroundings in general as far

735
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.560
Martin’s iPhone: As worry

736
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:57.270

737
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.370

738
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.990
Martin’s iPhone: I need to work on that. Yeah, I get mad. Pretty easy sometimes

739
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:05.700
Martin’s iPhone: And

740
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.930
Martin’s iPhone: I have a problem. It's like on and off switch. You know, if I get

741
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.300
Martin’s iPhone: Turn my switch on and I'm just interested in anger or turn it off.

742
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.680
Magalie Marcellus: So there's no in between.

743
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:17.670
Yeah.

744
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:28.770
Magalie Marcellus: You are you writing. What are those triggers that gets you to the, the high level. Yeah.

745
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:29.940
Magalie Marcellus: I'm sad or

746
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:37.080
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do, just like learning. I had to learn patience to learn forgiveness tomorrow.

747
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:41.370
Martin’s iPhone: I know them, but I have to practice the emotion, so

748
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:53.040
Magalie Marcellus: But sometimes it's because the way we think about a situation that made you you know get angry, but if you have it or don't go just by the fight itself.

749
01:03:53.730 --> 01:04:05.160
Magalie Marcellus: Because it's thank then feeling so if you thought of it in a different way than the killing many different that we actively be different. Yeah, we always go with the thinking. Then we act.

750
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:12.810
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I have a problem with that too. I noticed, like when I try to drive like heavy equipment and things like that.

751
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:20.340
Martin’s iPhone: If you make her own move them, that kind of stuff. It can go back real quick. So sometimes I worry about when I'm

752
