Jerry Howard: I got laid off from work.

16
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.650
Jerry Howard: My mom died.

17
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.870
Jerry Howard: So I had

18
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.960
Jerry Howard: My first and then we just held back by birth, but you know $400

19
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:27.300
Jerry Howard: That I don't even like my drug time and I just got a new drug because I was getting paid $1,000 a week. No. And now I'm only getting $430 a week.

20
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.070
Jerry Howard: Dress and the ran in my truck payment and like this morning. I don't know if it were have been stressing over that or not.

21
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:52.980
Jerry Howard: But I woke up and I was just really depressed and a rage. Fine. I got on my step daughter, because she hasn't helped her laundry and probably a week.

22
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.450
Jerry Howard: And our

23
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:05.460
Jerry Howard: Dish their background, you know, I went off and I can't help it. I don't really know why that was right. Let's talk about

24
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:15.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, it is time to get some clarification. Is this the new job that you was on looking forward to starting was this other job.

25
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.910
Jerry Howard: Now this was a new one.

26
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So did they give you a restart date when this all dies down you can report back to work. Or it's just one of those they terminated you and you don't know when you'll ever

27
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.730
Jerry Howard: Know I'm just, I'm light off and kill my birth.

28
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.140
Jerry Howard: Oh, roughly around three week

29
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

30
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:53.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, it's hard it's it's hard being in the situation and, you know, like you said, because of the outside stress that's going on.

31
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A lot of this anxiety. The stress is wants to present itself within your household dynamics.

32
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:12.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and, of course, if you don't have a proper outlet of how to communicate your frustration or the challenges, it will present itself in other ways. So what happened with your step daughter to talk about that.

33
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.750
Jerry Howard: Well, I mean, she just

34
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.340
Jerry Howard: She started doing tomorrow and

35
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.720
Jerry Howard: Joe

36
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:32.640
Jerry Howard: You got your bedroom and a instead of liking her flight back to the kitchen to display at the top, the fans, you know, there was no candy in the in the winter sale.

37
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:42.720
Jerry Howard: That are close with piled up and just, you know, like trash out everywhere. Yeah, I can spin on her for like a week now to get all that cleaned up.

38
00:04:43.170 --> 00:05:00.300
Jerry Howard: And she just keep the normal. So when I got up, you know, she was still up and she'd been up all night on the telephone with her cousin video just, you know, hey, just remind me math and she could do that, whether cousin, but now she can clean up her bedroom and started loving lunch.

39
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.980
Jerry Howard: Went off.

40
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.670
Jerry Howard: It was like I was in like in a plan, right.

41
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Alright, so

42
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: thoughts, feelings behaviors.

43
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was the thought.

44
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.070
Jerry Howard: Mad

45
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.200
Jerry Howard: Or

46
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.820
Jerry Howard: I guess she needed to clean her bedroom and Shatner was about

47
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.000
Jerry Howard: And I guess the behavior was getting mad and you know going on.

48
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:57.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was thoughts, feelings, and behaviors so fat is that she didn't have her room, if it's been very messy. I'm feelings.

49
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:07.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm curious to know if it was a disrespect because I in the past conversations you say you just don't feel like she respects your authority.

50
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:22.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm curious to know, and just kind of getting the best out of this exercise if the feeling was really anchor off is really rooted and feeling disrespected, which one. Which one do you feel like it's most

51
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relevant for you.

52
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.890
Jerry Howard: I would, I would say.

53
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.170
Jerry Howard: Probably disrespected

54
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.300
Jerry Howard: Because I've been on her for a week now and for her not to do that was very disrespectful.

55
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:57.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then prior to this prior to going into the room. What were some thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that you were experiencing as a result of things going on with you with work relationships, what were you feeling before you saw what you said.

56
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:16.530
Jerry Howard: Like I was really stressed out when I went to bed last night. And then when I woke up this morning, I was really depressed about know worrying if I was going to have enough money to my truck payment and either ran

57
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.740
Jerry Howard: And I

58
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:27.390
Jerry Howard: took a toll on my ladies relationship because I've been really stressed out, you'll

59
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.540
Jerry Howard: I've not really been I want to wait because of it.

60
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.910
Yeah.

61
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:53.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what what's going on is what we call projection. So you have certain was not necessarily projection, but your experience in these situations.

62
00:07:53.550 --> 00:08:04.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the reaction formation is to take it out on the people in your household. A lot of people do that. There's faster defense mechanism when they have anxiety.

63
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To the anxiety that your experiences natural you know people in a position where they don't know how they're going to pay bills. You know, it's Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have your basic needs being met. And if you don't feel that that that purpose.

64
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:36.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It can make you feel depressed. It can make you feel frustrated and it's not like you can process these emotions to your employer and make up your job back. So the, the natural outlet will be whoever's closest to you.

65
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:57.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's find a way to be able to communicate how we're feeling in the moment versus taking out our frustrations on others. So if given the opportunity to speak to, to your lady about what was going on. What would that conversation look like, what would you say to her.

66
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.380
Jerry Howard: Tell her no

67
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:12.180
Jerry Howard: Look, I'm feeling really depressed and stressed out because yeah I got laid off and I don't think we're gonna have enough money to cover everything

68
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.530
Jerry Howard: And then she would

69
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:20.580
Jerry Howard: Probably type. Well, you know, you need to give it to God. Understand that you know you can pray and ask help

70
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:41.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can give it to God with that response have made you have offered you comfort when it has made you more frustrating. How would that response of major

71
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.120
Jerry Howard: I wouldn't say it was a competent, but at the same time kind of frustrating.

72
00:09:53.070 --> 00:10:06.540
Jerry Howard: Because she you know we've had that question before. And she said that, you know, identifying and trying to give it to God, but you know that feeling of stress and worry was still there.

73
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

74
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The way those work on what communication skills to because the more you're able to safely communicate what you're feeling and process it in a safe environment, the less you'll see those reactions playing out

75
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:44.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a first ways in your family because I'm hearing the regret of how you reacted and so wanting to do things right. The first way so you don't have to deal with the guilt and then go back and apologize apologize later so

76
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.140
Jerry Howard: Yeah.

77
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have this this template for communication that I find so effective. And this that I feel like I understand. Fill in the blank, I need to fill in the blank.

78
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.260
Jerry Howard: What what

79
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.420
I feel

80
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then fill in the blank.

81
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand.

82
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fill in the blank.

83
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I need

84
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To let me model that example for you.

85
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Based on what you gave me with your conversation with your lady.

86
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And using that template Jerry probably would have said.

87
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you call your, your lady when you're having a conversation with her. What's her name.

88
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.100
Jerry Howard: Sarah.

89
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.970
Sarah.

90
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sarah I'm feeling really depressed right now about the situation that's going on with my job. I understand. I need to pray and need to give it to God right now. I really need you to just listen to how

91
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:05.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because in back statement, you're able to, I feel you're able to adequately explain your feelings.

92
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:19.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that to you're practicing the emotional awareness, because oftentimes we react and we have no idea why we react to that and such an extreme way because we're not in tune with our emotions and what our body is telling us

93
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:32.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the IPO gives you that opportunity to really assess what is going on with you that I understand is equally important, because it gives whoever you're communicating with

94
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:41.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The opportunity to see that you're not being selfish is communication that you kind of already figure what their position is going to be

95
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:53.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But that is tricky because you can't say I understand if you really don't understand or if you're unsure about the partners situation and the I need to partner.

96
00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:03.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Further opportunity and understanding of how they can support you. Because Sarah may not realize, saying, you just need to give it to God.

97
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like you said, it's comforting. But at the same time it's frustrating because it's almost like brushing brushing off my situation and not really acknowledging that this is stressful.

98
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:22.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's why use the I feel that I understand, and I

99
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Want to practice that for

100
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:33.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All know. Tell me what you would say to Sarah, you know, in the situation. If you want to discuss this.

101
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:45.030
Jerry Howard: I would I would start by saying, No, I don't need to talk because I'm

102
00:13:47.040 --> 00:14:00.870
Jerry Howard: Feeling really depressed stressed out about this situation. Yeah, I've got laid off and have undergone deployment and now you know she got laid off yesterday and has an appointment.

103
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.010
Jerry Howard: And she would probably say, you know,

104
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.700
Jerry Howard: Just need to give it to God and not worry about it and trust that he's gonna take care of it.

105
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.890
Jerry Howard: And I would probably say back. No.

106
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:27.240
Jerry Howard: That's like a minute competent by the Worry and stress. It's still there. It's just like a temporary

107
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Temporary yeah

108
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

109
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:44.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the faith is a temporary comfort. What would be a more long standing comfort for you. What do you, what do you need from Sarah in this moment.

110
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:56.280
Jerry Howard: Probably to say, you know, we'll figure it out. It says down and go figure out how we can split the bills up

111
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.620
Jerry Howard: Get everything I

112
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.350
Jerry Howard: Share about worrying that a baker.

113
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm hearing that you need a plan.

114
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:26.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You need something on paper to kind of help you process it and you want that plan to be executed together because you you feeling like you're just carrying this burden of stress on on this by yourself, is that adequate.

115
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.330
Jerry Howard: That's exactly what I was saying.

116
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:43.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So you see how you use an i feel i understand and I need even helped me to really get what you need in this moment because some people

117
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:56.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And maybe this is sales experience. Maybe this well this has happened to her, but maybe for her. She wouldn't need a plan because it might stress her out. Seeing those numbers on paper.

118
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So maybe what she needs is

119
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.120
Jerry Howard: Just someone is

120
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:00.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going to do

121
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.090
Jerry Howard: A lot of

122
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.450
Jerry Howard: probably watched her out because she has a lot of anxiety.

123
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Exactly. So you see she's giving you a

124
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.900
Jerry Howard: Shield wiper

125
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:42.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, she's giving you. She will want in that moment, if this was her they got laid off and you were working, she would probably want you to say we'll pray about it will give it to God and that would be just fine for her, but what you need.

126
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:52.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is a plan. This is really stressing you out. You are responsible for the household. You take pride in being able to take care of your family.

127
00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:07.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now you can't. And you're also being vulnerable enough to ask for help because in that plan. That means you saying I don't have it all figured out. I need you to support help me figure this out.

128
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:27.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's good. Jerry That's really good that you can be vulnerable enough to say I'm going to need some support in this area, but but she doesn't really understand what you need in that moment she's going to continue to offer up which she would want

129
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Remember we love the way we want to be.

130
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:51.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It takes involved person to think how to help someone in their time of me if they don't know how to or they don't even know how to hook their own selves when they're in distress. So you get the opportunity to teach her Jerry, how to help you.

131
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She can only do that when you communicate effectively.

132
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:14.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I want to stick with the i feel i understand i need only because it's so critical in the basis of communication.

133
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What we can do is practice that a little more in this session. Let's practice with your God.

134
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know what to say to her about everything that happened.

135
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:38.430
Jerry Howard: I would just tell her that, you know, I'm trying to figure it all out and

136
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.130
Jerry Howard: Everything's gonna be okay.

137
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.190
Jerry Howard: I'll find a way to

138
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.940
Jerry Howard: Get everything that we need it to all way they

139
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.430
Jerry Howard: Don't need to worry about it.

140
00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:06.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that would be good to offer her that support. You know what you are communicating to her is some relief that don't worry

141
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But do you see that's exactly what you're wanting from Sarah. So that's why you're communicating that to your stepdaughter

142
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.240
Jerry Howard: You're

143
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:22.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Saying that Sarah will come in and she will communicate. It's okay. This is hard for we're gonna figure it out.

144
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:31.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But Jerry, you already have the knowledge that Sarah has anxiety to she's gonna be a little more vulnerable in this situation.

145
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If

146
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:42.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, if we had to do levels of power here. She's probably going to be still at level one, you're at level two or three

147
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:54.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That doesn't mean that she gets to stay at level one. But what that means is you might have to give her some extra support so that she can get to the next level.

148
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that extra support looks like you modeling for her.

149
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How to communicate.

150
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so

151
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:22.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe tonight. You don't bring it up. Maybe you decide you are going to, but when you do you focus on. I feel I understand. And I'm that has to be your basis because if you start rambling off on other things.

152
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then it's just going to

153
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Allow for Sarah to continue to absorb her anxiety.

154
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And she made to shut down on you.

155
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hear me

156
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:43.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You hear me.

157
00:20:49.020 --> 00:21:06.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah I froze for a second. What I was saying that I'm that I feel that I understand, and it will be important because if you start rambling off to her what that's going to do is produce more anxiety for Sarah and what she's going to do is, she's either going to shut down on you.

158
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or she's going to present and an emotional distress, and it's just going to make the situation more difficult.

159
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.550
Jerry Howard: Yeah, that's exactly why it would help.

160
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah okay so let's just focus on the I feel I understand and for her to understand it's going to be most important

161
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because people would things it wants to feel understood. They want to feel protected so that I understand is pivotal for her.

162
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:51.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because she's gonna know that you're not blaming her. She don't think it's her fault, but that you need her it's reminding her of the team that you have to go together as a friend.

163
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sarah.

164
00:21:53.070 --> 00:22:04.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I feel, I feel depressed. I feel worried about the situation, Sarah. I feel angry that this happened, you know, whatever the emotion is

165
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:15.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're going to express. But I also want to offer this support to you because sometimes we really don't even know how we're feeling. And so it's hard to communicate that

166
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm pulling up the emotions chart because

167
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Earlier you said you know you were angry with your stepdaughter, but what we talked about, you realize well me I just felt more disrespected the angry.

168
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:31.800
Jerry Howard: Yeah.

169
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:38.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when we have that accurate assessment of our emotion, we can communicate it better.

170
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what emotion, would you use, and I feel when talking to Sarah.

171
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Down here.

172
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which ones most accurate for you.

173
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:47.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

174
00:23:48.540 --> 00:24:04.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. So Sarah I feel worried and frustrated about everything that's going on. And maybe you add more stuff, you may want to be more specific, I feel worried and

175
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Overwhelmed about when. What are you so worried and overwhelmed about Jerry

176
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.140
Jerry Howard: About the veil.

177
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.130
Jerry Howard: Because I got light up and then yesterday she got lights off.

178
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:25.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's the only course. It's just the bills. There's nothing in the house. It's nothing that's going on with

179
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Grown a virus.

180
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.730
Jerry Howard: Well, what is already

181
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Coming from

182
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.840
Jerry Howard: I would say probably

183
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.120
Jerry Howard: Well, I got laid off and you know

184
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.140
Jerry Howard: stepdaughter, not what the hell.

185
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:51.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that a separate emotional your stepdaughter not picking up the house, does that make you feel worried and overwhelmed or does that make you feel a different emotion.

186
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.870
Jerry Howard: That might fill a

187
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.980
Jerry Howard: rough draft.

188
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.050
Jerry Howard: disrespected

189
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:15.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so that's a different statement then so we're only coupling up in this conversation where I worry and where are overwhelming emotions are coming from what's going on with your stepdaughter, that's going to be a whole different i feel i understand i know

190
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:17.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

191
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, and we're going to work on that one. I'll

192
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:35.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Turn. So, and the reason why separated them is we don't want to mix up all these different experiences. That's not related to an emotion, because then that's how people get defensive

193
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:50.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you bring up other stuff recite even relevant. So Sarah I feel worried and overwhelmed about the bills. I understand that faith is important thing in our family and that we need to pray about it.

194
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:58.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I need us to sit down and write down a plan of how we're going to get the bills.

195
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can you help me with that Sarah.

196
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, there you go. And now with your step daughter, you know,

197
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:17.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We want to see who are we going to have this conversation with. Is it going to be with your stepdaughter, do you want to talk to Sarah about this.

198
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.050
Jerry Howard: Would probably want to talk

199
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.450
Jerry Howard: About her daughter.

200
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:31.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. So Sarah I feel the emotion in regards to use that data.

201
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's annoyed angry. There was disrespected

202
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's also this one invisible.

203
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:21.000
Jerry Howard: Yeah, I could probably use that whatever because, you know, no matter what I thanked her. It's just like, no, I need a doctor about Sam Dekker found a white Brahma and not let her

204
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.440
Jerry Howard: Know,

205
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.330
Jerry Howard: Whatever y'all are getting back to mom somehow

206
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:39.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So Sarah I feel invisible and disrespected when it comes to whatever you set daughter's name.

207
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:41.340
Jerry Howard: Is

208
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Caitlin, okay. Sarah I feel invisible and disrespected when it comes to Peyton

209
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:54.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand, what would you say what do you understand about the situation when it comes to Peyton

210
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.330
Jerry Howard: Understand that

211
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:57.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

212
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:05.010
Jerry Howard: She's becoming a teenager. And you know, that's kind of the way they are, but now the way

213
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.840
Jerry Howard: She's living right now.

214
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.460
Jerry Howard: I've never seen a

215
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Teenager

216
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:10.350
Jerry Howard: You know,

217
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.010
Jerry Howard: Say that lazy and disrespectful respectful.

218
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Taking that part out and taking that part out. Because you see, adding that extra can make her get

219
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Offensive. So we're going to just

220
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:42.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Clean that up a bit. Sarah I feel invisible and disrespected when it comes to Kaitlyn. I understand that this is how teenagers respond. Sometimes they may not clean as much but I need, what do you need

221
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.020
Jerry Howard: I get her.

222
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.530
Jerry Howard: Avatar, whether

223
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:56.880
Jerry Howard: You know, get her to understand the responsibility that

224
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.010
Jerry Howard: She ate.

225
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:09.450
Jerry Howard: And the structure of, you know, having some type of responsibility, you know, to get her ready for the real world.

226
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good.

227
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:28.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sarah I feel invisible and disrespected when it comes to Caitlyn, I understand that teenagers go through this process where they don't clean as much and they don't have as much motivation, but I need Caitlin to be responsible.

228
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's an important skill for her to have in life.

229
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.720
Jerry Howard: Work.

230
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:45.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, because what you're doing is you're not giving much opportunity for one Sarah to get this defensive

231
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if you use this and Sarah still find a way to be defensive. You can also realize this isn't me because I communicated the best way I can. So now you don't have to live with this regret have

232
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:13.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reacted to strongly. I should have said this, I shouldn't have said that. Now you get to have guilt free communication because all you're stating is your feelings.

233
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your thoughts you're not giving too much personal examples because

234
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It gets defensive

235
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.710
Jerry Howard: Dr. Like that.

236
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.400
Jerry Howard: That go

237
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:45.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, this is going to be a new way of communicating, because how did, how did you communicate in the past.

238
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.310
Jerry Howard: I would just got

239
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.360
A lie.

240
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.470
Jerry Howard: And I need to get Caitlyn

241
00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.450
Jerry Howard: Planner bedroom up because she has already cloud when I wear

242
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:13.260
Jerry Howard: A skirt or cloud ready for go and chase to have that responsibility of, you know, doing something on our own, without you have to do it or

243
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:21.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, so in the past when you communicated about Caitlyn, it was mostly expressing

244
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The needs. That's what I hear, I hear more,

245
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:37.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Emphasis on the needs and not your feelings or what you understand about the situation. So that's for Caitlin, how have you communicated. How's it feel with Sarah in the past.

246
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.890
Jerry Howard: I would just tell her. No.

247
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.820
Jerry Howard: Concern that

248
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.630
Jerry Howard: She don't learn some responsibility.

249
00:31:51.660 --> 00:32:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, not about. It's not about Katie. Now my us Sarah if there was something that was going on with you and Sarah, how would you have communicated to Sarah in the past.

250
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.740
Jerry Howard: Um, I would just got her and

251
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:13.410
Jerry Howard: Tell her my concerns about whatever was going on and listen to you know what she had to say about it.

252
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:22.470
Jerry Howard: And try to take her boss, you know, whatever I have been going on in scope, relax.

253
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:35.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it sounds like with when it comes to Caitlyn you communicate more needs when it comes to I'm Sarah you communicate more feeling

254
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.470
Jerry Howard: Yeah.

255
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:42.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And both of those conversations. What's missing is what you understand

256
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:47.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now with Sarah, you haven't been clear and what you need.

257
00:32:48.480 --> 00:33:01.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's where that frustration is coming from. And that's why you project, a lot of that anger onto Caitlin, because since you can't really communicate to Sarah what money.

258
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How do you communicate

259
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All that you need on Caitlin

260
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:13.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so some of the stuff with Kaitlyn might be some stuff that's coming from your frustration with Sarah to

261
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.410
Jerry Howard: Know,

262
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.110
Jerry Howard: really frustrated

263
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So all of them, all of them play equal part

264
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:46.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's important to express how you feel, because you want people to see that you have emotion that not just this person that works, works, works brings a paycheck and then forget about what Jerry must be feeling

265
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The feelings is important.

266
00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:54.030
Jerry Howard: And you know that's that's kind of the way I was feeling

267
00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:13.470
Jerry Howard: Was, you know, here I provide a roof over their head and make sure I have phone and what they need. But then when it comes to mind. Nathan. Nathan concerns. I know you're just, you're just being a baby. And now, whatever the case may be.

268
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.320
Jerry Howard: stuck it out for pray about it.

269
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.370
Then

270
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:27.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think that specific just to you or do you think that's a general response when it comes to men in issues. I'm curious.

271
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.410
Jerry Howard: I want this may

272
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:43.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The way to combat that is to be more vocal and the feelings and the understanding of the means

273
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:54.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so be careful when it comes to Kaitlyn, that because of Caitlyn that's that's what you communicate all the needs to right, be careful that

274
00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:10.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It doesn't get that displaced anger from Sarah on her because if she hasn't washed her clothes for two weeks. I suspect last week, you knew those schools. We can do something about this that you couldn't take it in.

275
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nashville.

276
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:14.850
Jerry Howard: Yeah, cuz i mean

277
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:23.910
Jerry Howard: I can't tell her all wait, no, I'm good. I'm about that. And then she would just get on her phone and video chat whether doesn't

278
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:42.000
Jerry Howard: Say, up to four or five o'clock in the morning and then slate. So five or six in the afternoon, you know them, they will not time, but they're not them because when we would come in now. We were just saying, and then go to bed, and she wouldn't want to do nothing. When we went to bed.

279
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.110
Jerry Howard: And wake up.

280
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.330
Jerry Howard: It anymore.

281
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.110
Yeah.

282
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

283
00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:04.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's a natural response, Jerry. We all have those moments where we just release, but that release typically comes out on

284
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:14.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People that we feel that we can get away with with a listener in Iran, and then to it comes when we've been holding the emotions and for so long.

285
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So Sarah gets the opportunity to support you and

286
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feeling understanding and needs.

287
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:43.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and Caitlin's wanted me to understand more how you feel about the situation and what you understand, too, because as a teenager that that stage of development is about finding their identity.

288
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:53.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About when finding your identity, how important it is to feel understood during that exploration

289
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.360
Jerry Howard: Okay, and be you know like

290
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:05.220
Jerry Howard: Any kind of interest does is academic like when I get mad at you know I got a really bad.

291
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.850
Jerry Howard: My anger issue.

292
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:22.350
Jerry Howard: This morning when I lashed out, you know, broke play and I can went way too far. And I'm really a shame. Now, and I had to go back and apologize.

293
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.360
Jerry Howard: You know, because

294
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.370
Jerry Howard: I was really name.

295
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:40.050
Jerry Howard: And asked about everything. But, you know, they have to understand too that I've been asked and I said, and no issue with your finger clause in there. I would watch him.

296
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.400
Jerry Howard: My you know there was

297
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:56.340
Jerry Howard: Like I don't have the bandwidth code in it and I'm in her room smelled like a land field. Yeah, she just got to understand that $100 a month and ran. I don't want to live in, Phil.

298
00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

299
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:10.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, you're right. And you say that you know you have a right to be upset. Um, but the way you respond to that is what's most important. So

300
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're only one man. I'm going to pull up another activity that you're talking about. Because what's important in those moments, Jerry is people with anger management.

301
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:29.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just doesn't go from zero to 100 the way people think there is a process your body gets you in a queue that you are upset.

302
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:42.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you ignore the cues and then before you know it. There's just like this bubbling over and you just you just rage. Think about a pot of boiling water.

303
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:52.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, you have that pot of boiling water. But the minute you take it off the burner and you push it to the bat. What happens to that one wire.

304
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:54.450
Jerry Howard: For

305
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It starts boiling because you're able to take it off the heat.

306
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the same shot to bring the scale up as I like to give the visual

307
00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:09.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sorry.

308
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:11.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

309
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:27.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what you do is you keep track of one doing a communication because if you were able to adequately communicate, you know, you wouldn't have all this built up emotion anyway.

310
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:41.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But another thing is this subject, subject to the unit of distress scale. So the numbers are good because it helps you to identify outside of yourself. What is really going on.

311
00:39:42.390 --> 00:40:02.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, you know, if you do this, check in with yourself. You say, Jerry, you're upset about the situation on a scale of zero to 100 what's my number. So, for instance, everything that was going on this morning before you walk into that room. What number are you at

312
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.020
Jerry Howard: I was probably

313
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.750
Jerry Howard: Like a 90

314
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So before you walk into the room, you were already at a 90

315
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.440
Jerry Howard: Yeah.

316
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:37.740
Jerry Howard: I've been. I've been. You know, for over a week and she's out of school for the risk for a year now because of the corolla

317
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.370
Jerry Howard: And she still just flies on the phone lines in the bed, you know,

318
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.860
Jerry Howard: It's really frustrating.

319
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:55.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You think of a time that you were upset with Kaitlyn that you weren't out of 90 that you were at a lower number

320
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.020
Jerry Howard: Yeah, like a

321
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 2020

322
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:09.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was going on and you were at 20. What was the difference between what was happening right at 20 versus what was happening right and

323
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:12.450
Jerry Howard: She was

324
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:23.310
Jerry Howard: Talking to her dad, and he's trying to talk her into moving back to Tennessee with him and I only reason why I want to go back is because

325
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:33.630
Jerry Howard: I really big point is about 300 pounds and he wanted to go back to get back on math to lose weight and

326
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.310
Jerry Howard: She just kept on

327
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.970
Jerry Howard: Telling him now that she wasn't gone

328
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.200
Jerry Howard: And he just jumped know I kinda

329
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:50.400
Jerry Howard: Like the situation and microfilm. That's where she would go, I just kept telling you know

330
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.740
Jerry Howard: Takes them all together.

331
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No.

332
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.890
Jerry Howard: No. Don't get upset about it. I'm worried that it

333
00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.040
Jerry Howard: Is good to watch this number.

334
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:02.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

335
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:14.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For this situation. We're going to stay on what happened this morning being at the 90 shows that you already came into what extremely anxious and extremely distressed.

336
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:27.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what you would do is you said you wanted some practical stuff want to focus on the i feel i understand i need statements. But Jerry still there, because you're frozen.

337
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:55.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. So like I was saying that you know that you already came in at a 90 when it came to

338
00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:07.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our Caitlin, so a practical way is I'm at a 90 right now I need to take myself off the burner. I need to allow myself to not

339
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:20.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To not play right think about imagery of that pot on that stone. If you're in a 90 Jerry, you already know I'm boiling right your body problems already telling you

340
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where did. Where do you usually feel that anger in your mind when you're at a 90

341
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:27.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our

342
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.620
Jerry Howard: Dialogue imma fight because my blood pressure goes up.

343
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:40.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you feel that that is your first sign of telling you that you need to take yourself off the stove.

344
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:47.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what you may need to practice is separation, you feel yourself on my end.

345
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You feel your cheeks are flushed, you're going to

346
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:58.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Take some time to separate you're going to do some self talk, you probably don't have to say, I feel disrespected in this moment.

347
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:07.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, what if you don't have any understanding, you might say, I don't understand anything at this point. I don't understand why they're not doing it.

348
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:18.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But this is you talking to yourself, I need in this moment to relax. I need in this moment to calm down whatever it is you need in that moment, do it.

349
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then come back, come back when you're not at a 90

350
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You may, you may come back at 60 that's okay.

351
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you're not at a 90 and you're not going to be throwing plates, this time.

352
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Period and it throws plates.

353
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:45.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Jerry at a 6060 probably just does some talking, you know, and expresses some I need statements.

354
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To this number is good, Jerry.

355
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:53.820
Jerry Howard: Do your email make

Jo Delgadillo: My bed.

417
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:59.850
Jo Delgadillo: And I had it. We had to tie it to the top of the truck and my brother went with me.

418
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:05.940
Jo Delgadillo: He wouldn't even go he didn't even want to get us off the game, which is driving me nuts because it's only wants to play video games.

419
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:17.760
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't say nothing. I was just sick whatever me my brother ago. And then I get I wore out there. We went to go get the bed and the lady had you know those fold up like that to put away and then they open

Jo Delgadillo: She had one of those. I bought it. It was only 20 bucks and it in the back of my truck and I told him.

421
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:30.870
Jo Delgadillo: Me and my brother were carrying a big bed in and I was like, can you grab the bed from the back end, he wouldn't. Grab it because he said it won't fit in the house.

422
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.390
Jo Delgadillo: So I had to come back out of here after doing all that stuff in there, put into bed together for my drum on there.

423
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:41.490
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't get the other bed and it's frustrating. And then I asked her, do the homework with daily

424
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.710
Jo Delgadillo: He was supposed to do. That was gone, and he didn't do that with her and we left at like 323 and we just barely got back, and he couldn't do it with her.

425
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:58.740
Jo Delgadillo: And now I have her do it sitting down doing it. And I told him she supposed to be practicing her writing her first and last name right now because she's doing it pretty sloppy.

426
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:08.070
Jo Delgadillo: And I was like, you have to do with her and he was he was being a smartass when I was walking out the door because I told him, he's going to do with her because she's been doing a sloppy.

427
00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:20.190
Jo Delgadillo: And needs to be a little bit neater. That's why we're the whole reason why she's doing it practicing your name. And he was like, oh, you made a squiggly line on your jay oh you didn't thought the I thought

428
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.220
Jo Delgadillo: It's just little things she keeps picking

429
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:30.300
Jo Delgadillo: Picking yesterday I clean the whole house and I leave, I come outside. What was I doing

430
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.390
Jo Delgadillo: I don't remember what I was doing, but I left for some reason I come in in the whole floor. There's trash everywhere.

431
00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:38.760
Jo Delgadillo: And he's just sitting there playing the game.

432
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.100
Jo Delgadillo: It's

433
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.420
Jo Delgadillo: It's so frustrating.

434
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:43.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I

435
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:49.770
Jo Delgadillo: pulled him aside last week and ask them, can you stop playing the game so much like help me just a little bit.

436
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:59.370
Jo Delgadillo: Take a few hours out of the day just to help me asked me what I need done because I go crazy trying to keep up with. We're all in here together. It's not just you. It's not just me. It's not just

437
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:17.760
Jo Delgadillo: Well, I feel like I'm the only one that's everybody's, do this, do that and they are everybody comes through. You like my grandma, with it, the dresser i mean the the bed. I had to go yesterday, my brother picking him up from edge would like it's annoying. Like, I just want to sit down to

438
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See you, your stress.

439
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.780
Jo Delgadillo: Stress was obsessed

440
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.860
Jo Delgadillo: My favorite shirt. It's big, but I love the shirt.

441
00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:33.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that all sounds very stressful.

442
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:44.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To take on so much, but I know in our last session. It's been a while. But I know we've been talking about the common theme of everyone goes to because they can't

443
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:44.970
Do it.

444
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:47.220
Jo Delgadillo: And because I do it.

445
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:54.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Has there been anything that you've applied to kind of release some of this this distress.

446
00:53:55.020 --> 00:54:01.050
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, we're doing stuff for myself, but it always has to be like a two or three o'clock in the morning.

447
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:03.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because

448
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:11.970
Jo Delgadillo: The baby if like, I'll get her to sleep in showing up hurting or get a baby away and chew on a cup, but she doesn't watch. It's just

449
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:18.090
Jo Delgadillo: It's just little things here and there. Her knees hurting her wanted to take a shower because our needs are and

450
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:30.750
Jo Delgadillo: It's hard, but I wouldn't painting for myself. I painted a picture and we've been doing wrong. We're doing stuff with them to this. So they will sit down, so I can actually sit down and do something.

451
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:37.230
Jo Delgadillo: Or he's just like, give them the computer even a phone. I'm like, I don't want them sitting on phones and computers all day long.

452
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:51.720
Jo Delgadillo: I don't, and she's already getting used to it. You should see her throw a fit when I tell her no show support hair, you should try to scratch yourself. That's what I used to do when I was a kid, I would hurt myself when I would get mad and now she doesn't

453
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She's the one that's doing it.

454
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:14.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm curious. It's interesting that you brought up childhood, because I was going to ask how this this experience of always being needed, and how does it connect to your childhood. Do you see any connection. Yeah.

455
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:27.510
Jo Delgadillo: That's how it was because my mom was always drunk and when she had friends. They were either drug addicts or drugs, but I didn't know what drugs weren't back then when I was little, but I knew what drinking was because as soon as I hear what hear

456
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:33.270
Jo Delgadillo: Like I would go into, I don't even know how to explain it like scared.

457
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:40.590
Jo Delgadillo: When I tiptoe around my mom I'd be careful what I'd say with all her friends that used to come around. They had kids and I took care of them.

458
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:57.750
Jo Delgadillo: I wasn't, I remember being three or four years old, changing diapers. My mom's friend, Dorian, had a set of twins and then she had a three three year old. He was like a year younger than me. But he didn't talk at all like didn't say a word. He went home, he

459
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:05.070
Jo Delgadillo: Didn't talk at all. So I was like a lot smarter than him. And everybody would tell me that in front of him. Oh, you're so much harder than

460
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:10.170
Jo Delgadillo: You do this for the girls. I was taking care of newborns. There were three weeks old.

461
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how are you

462
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.740
Jo Delgadillo: Three, three to four years old.

463
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:22.740
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, really little, but I took care of my little brother to. So that's how I knew, and they would leave me with them and they would leave

464
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:37.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: redeploy you still remember like the sound of the beer or whatever that was opening up and, you know, to, to not mess up to just feel your best behavior. Wow.

465
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:40.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wow.

466
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:57.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That needs to please. So whenever there's like a parent or someone a family member that is an added there's different roles that people take off. So there's the added which know your childhood and was your mom with your father involved.

467
00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.600
Jo Delgadillo: They don't remember my dad is

468
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:10.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so your mom was the addict. So that was your mom's role in the family. There's, there's five other roles. So there's the enabler.

469
00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:15.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's okay. He's the one that denies everything doesn't see any issue.

470
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:20.490
Jo Delgadillo: For us, you'll make excuses for us, you know,

471
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.210
Jo Delgadillo: She was my neighbor and she's my neighbor or she's my cousins and they are now.

472
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Huh.

473
00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:32.070
Jo Delgadillo: And I love it. And I'm like, that's, that's part of it. We ended, and I'll have it.

474
00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:34.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In doing what she and

475
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:45.810
Jo Delgadillo: I think he's doing drugs. And every time I asked her, and she's just like, no, he's probably doing that he's tired. He's probably doing this for those are excuses. You did it with me.

476
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:56.520
Jo Delgadillo: I remember you me wanting to tell the truth that I had a drug problem because I wanted to, but you would say no. Let's just tell them it's this and that. I'm like what I want help, like

477
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.710
Jo Delgadillo: She didn't know how to help me.

478
00:57:59.130 --> 00:57:59.490
Yeah.

479
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:14.880
Jo Delgadillo: I'm telling her when you're an addict. Is it scary to say you want to help, but the search engine on Google, when I pulled it up on the computer. It says I'm addiction opiate addiction.

480
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:20.340
Jo Delgadillo: And the President's been looking it up, but he doesn't want to tell me. So I was in the hall for him.

481
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:26.880
Jo Delgadillo: To tell him like, you know, even, even though we're cousins will make sure they don't put us in the same group, nothing like

482
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:27.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

483
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:35.190
Jo Delgadillo: You can have your own thing I want to tell them I want to, I mentioned it down about right, or else I'm scared to like push it.

484
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:36.810
Jo Delgadillo: When I think I should, because

485
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:42.570
Jo Delgadillo: I even thought about drug testing his feet, because when it goes up in the morning in the toilet flush.

486
00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.220
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, that's how

487
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:45.450
Jo Delgadillo: That's how worried. I am

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.790
Jo Delgadillo: My gramma things is to control them like

489
00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:52.050
Jo Delgadillo: No, like I could care less about controlling he can die.

490
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.670
Jo Delgadillo: You drinks like

491
00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:57.150
Jo Delgadillo: If he's taking pills and he's drinking. He can dine asleep.

492
00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:02.670
Jo Delgadillo: I heard his friend, his mom died and supposedly HIS FRIEND. DRINK morphine.

493
00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:09.600
Jo Delgadillo: So my typical obviously has access to morphine function, you know,

494
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:23.940
Jo Delgadillo: In my case, I was like me when we did drugs. We didn't know our limit and we're like, all we could take it. We can do this, do that and and he's like that. And he's been carrying around one of those bottles of liquor or recall it.

495
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:25.200

Jo Delgadillo: And I'm like that's he's got a problem.

498
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:42.750
Jo Delgadillo: And and it's kind of sad because my end, when I had cancer passed away, three years ago and he washes her clothes like she born numb or something and having some backup.

Jo Delgadillo: That's like you can you tell he's

503
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.190
Jo Delgadillo: He's holding on her. I think that makes it easier. But he knows in the back of his mind.

504
00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.810
Jo Delgadillo: That's where the drugs come in.

505

Jo Delgadillo: started a fight with me a week over week last weekend. He started to fight with me and I went off.

508
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:21.930
Jo Delgadillo: Because I was like I do everything for everyone in this House, and you want to pitch about my dogs. I take care of all your guys's dogs dog food. I do everything, even when I'm not here.

509
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.540

510
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:36.870
Jo Delgadillo: And he's like, well, your dog's gonna do this get called them and tell them to come take them away. And I'm like, Oh man, that was and he was like, you know what I mean. And I'm like, No, I'm not. I'm like,

511
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:45.000
Jo Delgadillo: I gave him the white dog he has. And I was like, did you get him a shots. No. Did you get him registered know I'm like, So how you can talk about my dog.

Jo Delgadillo: My dogs. I've been to the bed faithfully there they're registered there. They got all their shots and he hasn't done nothing sauce. And then he started crying.

513
01:00:53.310 --> 01:01:01.350
Jo Delgadillo: And so I went outside and I called Jake because he wasn't here and I was had to use my computer because my phone updated all by itself. So I couldn't use it at all.

514
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.370
Jo Delgadillo: So I was on a computer outside the door. I was bawling my eyes out because I was mad.

515
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:11.970
Jo Delgadillo: And I didn't want to keep yelling, because the girls were getting scared and they've never seen me do that before they don't know the violent part

516
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.740
Jo Delgadillo: Of life because I put that away from them. So they were getting here and I was talking to my boss, and he's like,

517
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:25.890
Jo Delgadillo: What is just problem. And I don't know, all of a sudden my cousin comes out the door. Knees bawling. His eyes out like hyperventilating, and I was like, I gotta go and

518
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:36.960
Jo Delgadillo: Close the computer. And he's like, like, try not to cry like I can hear you breathing and I'm like dude was this for me, or is this caused by something else.

519
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:47.580
Jo Delgadillo: I'm like, because your argument made no sense, honestly, and he's like, I know, I'm sorry, don't leave. And I was like, Jeff. Something's going on with you. I was like, Just tell me. I was like, I can help you.

520
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:58.650
Jo Delgadillo: I have resources to help you like what I'm doing it. If it wasn't for that are probably lose my mind and kill everybody when I get to talk and hear your point of view, it helps

521
01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:15.210
Jo Delgadillo: Like for you telling me and you don't have to beat around the bush. That's your job. That's what I try telling him, he's just like, No, everything's fine and nothing's fine. It's the lead was crying. His bully. He had a lot going on inside here, he just he won't talk about it.

522
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

523
01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:25.980
Jo Delgadillo: I tried. I told him. If you want to talk no matter what it is I'm here like you can talk to me this manual used to be really close. And now I see, I see how her to use

524
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.890
Jo Delgadillo: More gross just she doesn't want to see it.

525
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She told a blue so

526
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I wonder, I, I'm thinking you're the

527
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:45.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hero because that's another role, you tell me if I'm right because the hero is the hard working person the perfection is put lots of pride and achievements.

528
01:02:46.770 --> 01:03:00.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And try to bring the family together to make it appear that it's a normal functioning family, even though they see the distress. And so what they try to do is they try to give hope to the rest of the family.

529
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:09.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By doing good being available being present. They represent the hero. And so now, people don't have to focus on that.

530
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:12.930
Jo Delgadillo: That's exactly it.

531
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:15.030
Jo Delgadillo: Stressful.

532
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:23.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yeah, because this person is trying to make the families seem as though. Everything's okay.

533
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:24.870
Yeah.

534
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a scapegoat. That's the person that

535
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They get blamed for all the problems in the family.

536
01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:38.760
Jo Delgadillo: Would be me.

537
01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You think you're the hero and people

538
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:54.990
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, like everybody. It's not in this House in this around us, like my aunts, uncles, cousins, my girl. My sisters and all that they blame me for everything that's wrong in my life.

539
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.260
Jo Delgadillo: Because I will leave her like

540
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.310
Jo Delgadillo: Where are they, they want to say how horrible. I am. But where are they

541
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:05.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are they

542
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Doing horrible.

543
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What anything that you're doing. That's horrible.

544
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.140
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, they still think I'm on drugs.

545
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:23.550
Jo Delgadillo: And and I just found out about this like four or five days ago about my son, my oldest son is 19 or 20 he turned 20 yesterday, but

546
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:26.220
Jo Delgadillo: He's a product of rape.

547
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.830
Jo Delgadillo: And back then. I didn't talk about it.

548
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:40.620
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't say anything about it at all. Nobody knew I couldn't remember nothing to tell anybody. I just put myself in a position. I shouldn't have. So I by myself for years. I blame myself and I was ashamed of it.

549
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:45.330
Jo Delgadillo: Lots of therapy got me to where I don't need to be ashamed. I didn't break myself.

550
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.340
Jo Delgadillo: It is my body, no one has the right to do things to it, unless I want them to

551
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.100
Jo Delgadillo: So I had to get that in my head. And now that is there nobody in my family knows that he he came from. Right.

552
01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:02.550
Jo Delgadillo: Criminals. And my grandma says you're trying to tell my uncles and all them when they had like some reunion thing out there in Texas.

553
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:17.760
Jo Delgadillo: Last year, and they were all talking and I was a slight I was a whole like all this stuff. And she was defending you know like know why defend me to people like that. Let them believe what they want to believe I'm tired of defending myself to them.

554
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:24.450
Jo Delgadillo: Like believe what you want to leave because if you're not going to take the chance to get to know the person I am now, then I don't want you

555
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:38.820
Jo Delgadillo: And if they were they made me cry. And she kept trying to defend me. I was like, if they can see that you're crying and emotional over the way they were talking about me and they didn't care. They don't care about you and they don't because I had to go pick her up.

556
01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:46.170
Jo Delgadillo: When a month later, I had to go pick a we had to rent a U Haul truck go pick her up and go back to that go to Mexico.

557
01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:53.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that dynamic because I'm curious that you identify as the hero and the scapegoat.

558
01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:00.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When do you feel that night hero role comes up and when the scapegoat comes up.

559
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:07.710
Jo Delgadillo: Hero part is when I'm with my family, the one that's in this House right now. That's our bubble

560
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:08.490
Yeah.

561
01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.190
Jo Delgadillo: It's always been like this.

562
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.180
Jo Delgadillo: And escape, though, is when the other part of the family comes around.

563
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.930
Jo Delgadillo: Because I kind of like whatever

564
01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:23.220
Jo Delgadillo: The if

565
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:31.770
Jo Delgadillo: If it's my fault. It's my fault. It's better meet her to be my fault in my grandma's like I rather take the full than her. Yeah.

566
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:43.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in your household, your, your bubble is there someone cuz you're on Suboxone is there someone that's added in your bubble

567
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm sorry.

568
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My cousin cousin.

569
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My husband.

570
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:57.060
Jo Delgadillo: He will he used to, but she doesn't. It doesn't. Nothing. He hasn't done since you gave me ultimatum or seven years ago.

571
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:06.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that that complex of having two identities, is where that stress comes up.

572
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:21.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you're taking the blame for everyone in situation for the family. But at the same time, the hero thrives on being the perfection. They thrive on their achievements.

573
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:32.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I hear whenever mostly I think of the hero when it comes to talk about your bubble, like you said, because whenever you talk about your kids will say things like they've never seen me that

574
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:45.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I try to make sure that they're on task. My husband doesn't do ABC. You're very structure. You know, when it comes to the children take lots of pride and being a good responsible mom.

575
01:07:46.890 --> 01:08:04.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then the outside influences they pull from you. They just pull from you. They want so much from you, you help out with so much. It makes me wonder if to the outside. Are you the hero, or are you in an enabler.

576
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.350
Jo Delgadillo: Both. Well, I could see the enabler Part two

577
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.140
Jo Delgadillo: Just to make people happy. Yeah.

578
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:14.160
Yeah.

579
01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:16.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

580
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A lot of these identities that you're trying to balance.

581
01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:24.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: enabler hero Skakel

582
01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:42.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's two other roles to there's the mascot. And the last last child, but in you trying to balance two different households, because there's your mom and all the family that comes up with your childhood in which your grandma represents. And then there's your bubble

583
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When these two worlds merged together.

584
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Who is Joe Is she the hero has she been made or she escaped through

585
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:01.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

586
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:19.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And because you don't know is why an issue presents itself you deal with it stress over it. Take on everybody else's burden little next problem comes deal with it because you haven't establish your own

587
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Purpose what you want for yourself.

588
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:30.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're very focused on what's going on with everyone else and helping everyone else. Yeah.

589
01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:35.310
Jo Delgadillo: That's, that's exactly why I sat down this morning and started making dinner every little thing.

590
01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:45.210
Jo Delgadillo: Like a, like a chart of everything needs to be done from the morning to one. The girls go to sleep. So I'll be able to schedule time for myself.

591
01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.180
Jo Delgadillo: Because I need it.

592
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:52.680
Jo Delgadillo: I can feel myself like look

593
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.290
Jo Delgadillo: I don't want you coming

594
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:05.100
Jo Delgadillo: I'm still wearing the monitor thing, but they they said they might have me send it in early because the whole coronavirus thing.

595
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.020
Jo Delgadillo: I feel like kind of pointless.

596
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

597
01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:12.480
Jo Delgadillo: No, I can't even get a doctor because I called around and they said, nobody's taking new patients right now.

598
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.520
Jo Delgadillo: Not until after the quarantine tumor.

599
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:22.050
Jo Delgadillo: So it's going to all be put on pause, I guess, for who knows how long. But at least I did it. And it's being monitored.

600
01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.850
Jo Delgadillo: And it's because I have to push this little button.

601
01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.620
Jo Delgadillo: I've been carrying my pocket.

602
01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:40.110
Jo Delgadillo: Push the button. Every time I feel a little like a chest pain.

603
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.990
Jo Delgadillo: It makes me more aware of it now.

604
01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:43.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

605
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:55.200
Jo Delgadillo: I wasn't aware of how much I have chest pain and I every time they call me because whatever time you're supposed to call me and ask me my symptoms and it's always. It sounds like exciting to me.

606
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.980
Jo Delgadillo: And they're just like, oh, we don't know because and I'll

607
01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:15.510
Jo Delgadillo: Tell me anything. I swear it's anxiety. Yeah, I can be sitting there doing nothing, or just watching TV and like mall have part like like I can't breathe like someone sitting on my chest and it hurts like underneath my blue over here. Like, I don't want my hardest and

608
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.570
Jo Delgadillo: airy. Sorry, I've been telling myself. It's just anxiety, so I don't get scared.

609
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.380
Yeah.

610
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:30.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm gonna pull up the scale for you. I want you to take a look at it. I'm gonna go turn on my light, but I'm going to

611
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:40.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Give you time to look at the numbers, while I go on. Turn on the light

612
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:31.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what I have for you here is the subject unit of distress scale.

613
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:41.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I use this for patients that have any high distress tolerance, whether it be anger management, anxiety, depression,

614
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:54.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This thermometer is helpful because it gives a number two, what you're feeling and it may be difficult to really explain your emotions because what I hear in our conversations

615
01:12:55.290 --> 01:13:07.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is the conflict between responsibility self care between being a good mom but taking care of me as a woman.

616
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:28.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I hear that constant conflict and then in the midst of that conflict because there's really no true sense of what's most important. The environment presents itself. So even just now, like I mentioned, the three roles scapegoat hero and enabler.

617
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:36.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When do you put that on windy. Take that paper. It's hard. So think about the last time that you felt

618
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:41.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anxiety. What day was it what was going on.

619
01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:42.930
Jo Delgadillo: Today,

620
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:50.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Today, and was it what you shared with you know your husband with the school and getting

621
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.600
Jo Delgadillo: All the stuff. It started as soon as I woke up to you.

622
01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:00.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really. Okay. Where were you when you first of all. What number would you give yourself.

623
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.700
Jo Delgadillo: When I first woke up.

624
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:08.400
Jo Delgadillo: 40

625
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:13.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. First up, you have 40 mild to moderate anxiety distress.

626
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When we feel it raining.

627
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.020
Jo Delgadillo: Like when I was almost done making the chart for hit daily

628
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:35.340
Jo Delgadillo: Okay, that's when my grandma was like, are you going to go to bed for me or you can do this so you can adapt. I was like, yeah, let me try and hurry up and make this one and then my little clarity level like a shill it raising because he was just playing again.

629
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:42.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Do you read a 40 and when you said you could feel it. Where did you feel it in your body.

630
01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:44.880
Jo Delgadillo: My chest

631
01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:46.470
Jo Delgadillo: Like

632
01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.110
Jo Delgadillo: Excitedly like shaky.

633
01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:53.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you went from a 42 what number

634
01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:10.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 7075 distress interfere with your functioning some physiological signs present at chest pain, the shaping

635
01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:13.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is interfering with your function.

636
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:18.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What did that mean for you. Was it hard for you to focus on the schedule now.

637
01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:18.660
Yeah.

638
01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:25.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We started thinking about what instead of a schedule. Where did you go boating

639
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:27.210
Jo Delgadillo: Just leaving

640
01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Gotta get out the door.

641
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.930
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I just, I just got to get out. Let me get in the truck, go get this bed and

642
01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.150
Jo Delgadillo: Chill out a little it worked because my brother was Israel, we talk

643
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:51.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you were at a comfortable, you know, will not forget that we're comfortable, but considering that you already having it to wake up a year out of 40. That's good.

644
01:15:52.440 --> 01:16:07.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But, and now you're focusing on one thing you're able to just focus on the structure that is your hero Kate that's on because the hero is a type A personality, they're structured they're organized we able to do that.

645
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:15.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now someone needs you to get something so now you can't just focus on this thing for your daughter. Now you're at a 70

646
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:21.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're at a 70, you still have on your here okay because you're like out fix it.

647
01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:29.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you put on any of the case in that moment, just like you were enabling or the escape goat.

648
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.780
Jo Delgadillo: Know, or just

649
01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, you just met. He was still

650
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nice. So, did it ever get higher than a 70

651
01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:43.290
Jo Delgadillo: Today, no. Oh, wait.

652
01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:46.380
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, when he wouldn't bring the bed and

653
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where did you go

654
01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To battle 9090 extremely anxious and

655
01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: High and that look for you at a 90

656
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.020
Jo Delgadillo: It comes out as anger.

657
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how do you, how do you show getting

658
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:04.740
Jo Delgadillo: Our yo

659
01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.180
Jo Delgadillo: Mainly, yo. That's all I do.

660
01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.190
Jo Delgadillo: And then they go to my face over you're yelling, but nobody heard me before, and now when I yo you throw it in my face. Now, yo.

661
01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:24.330
Jo Delgadillo: It's all the time to no one listens to me until I yell and then when I yell. They're like, you're yelling

662
01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:28.560
Jo Delgadillo: Did you hear me the 20,000 times I asked you to do something like

663
01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:30.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

664
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.200
Jo Delgadillo: I do everything for everybody, but I can ask, no one to do anything for me.

665
01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:51.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you jump to that 90 you're here. Okay. It was no longer on because now you became the scapegoat cuz you said people are now focused on yelling and not focus on what you did for them. Their focus on this Blue Angel for her reaction.

666
01:17:53.850 --> 01:18:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what role, if you had to choose what role would you choose. Be yourself hero Keiko or enabling

667
01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:07.230
Jo Delgadillo: Sure. Okay.

668
01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:14.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how do you still keep on that hero, Kate, even though she went from 70 to 90

669
01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just to manage her anger better

670
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:40.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so no one has grown to brain Jill for her response. So I'm going to give you a template that I use to help people in communicating when there's conflict when they need to express themselves. It's i feel i understand i need

671
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:52.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So do I feel fill in the blank or whatever that feeling. I understand. So in the blank of whatever that is. And I mean, fill in the blank.

672
01:18:54.300 --> 01:19:08.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That template is critical because the I feel gives you an opportunity to check in with what's really going on with yourself. Because sometimes what you reacting to isn't always anger.

673
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:16.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe you're disappointed that your husband is it helping you, the way you want. Maybe you're frustrated because you're doing a lot

674
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:27.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's probably not even anger, but because you're so accustomed to my needs. Don't get met I'm yelling, you immediately say, I have anger issues.

675
01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:40.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really is probably not even that it's probably just a process is series of you being misunderstood. You're not effectively communicating your feelings. So then you say that you have anger problem.

676
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:50.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really is Joker work on communicating back. So let's go back to you. Be and

677
01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would you say I feel fill in the blank.

678
01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.660
Jo Delgadillo: Like when I was talking about.

679
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:04.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Uh huh.

680
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:06.000
I feel

681
01:20:09.330 --> 01:20:09.660
Jo Delgadillo: Word.

682
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.030
Jo Delgadillo: What's the word that you said Dan.

683
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Disappointed.

684
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:18.810
Jo Delgadillo: Disappointed. There we go.

685
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.930
Jo Delgadillo: It's a lot of disappointment, honestly.

686
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:26.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some of the emotions that might even leave for you.

687
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why now.

688
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes. Okay. Okay.

689
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.220
Jo Delgadillo: It's mostly disappointed and more out because

690
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:44.820
Jo Delgadillo: We're doing it right. Like I'll think about. I'm like, oh, maybe, since we talked to start helping know

691
01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:46.380
Jo Delgadillo: When again.

692
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:55.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's, I feel more now and disappointed.

693
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you couldn't help me put this bed in the trunk.

694
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:05.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand what do you understand about the situation.

695
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.010
Jo Delgadillo: That he likes to play games.

696
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand that you need your alone time too.

697
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I need fill in the blank.

698
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.090
Oh,

699
01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:36.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the I feel I understand, and I need is important because I feel like this, it gives you an opportunity to check in, what, what's really going on with Joe to not just use the emotions of anxiety and anger as the picture of what's going on with you.

700
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:52.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it makes it seem as though you're always the blame. So in a sense you willing to take on the role of scapegoat because you said in the pants I yell people get mad at me. So that's become your normal process.

701
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And over time, you probably got comfortable with.

702
01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:06.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, well, I'm a yo, they don't get mad. Whatever I got anger issues I mentioned but know if you really put on. I'm wondering now and I'm disappointed.

703
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That doesn't give anybody an opportunity to make you the scapegoat.

704
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:16.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand.

705
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:22.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Gives the other person an opportunity to realize Jones trying to be compassionate here.

706
01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:35.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can't blame Joe for this because she she's considering me to win this moment, and that I need gives you an opportunity to be very clear.

707
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:52.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In what you want what you need and what your expectations are. And for someone who so accustomed to being an enabler and helping people. You probably don't communicate your needs much because everybody else is telling you what they need. Yeah.

708
01:22:54.540 --> 01:23:04.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I want you to try this as a form of practice to help build your communication and importance for these two, it's critical because that that measuring scale that I told you.

709
01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:20.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is your opportunity to see a number. So you can really pinpoint when you're getting to that high level of distress and that you're going to react in a way that's not going and that gives people the opportunity to throw that scapegoat cape on

710
01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:38.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But the i feel i understand i need gives you that emotional checking so that you can really get in tune with what is going on. Why am I stressed. Why am I feeling overwhelmed.

711
01:23:41.130 --> 01:24:01.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even if you were to say this to your husband and he still doesn't put the bed in the trunk you walk away knowing that nobody can blame me for how I reacted because I communicated so calmly. So effectively, I am not the state go in this situation, this person needs to work on.

712
01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:17.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because the way finding earlier gives your husband, the opportunity to come back and say, you're always yelling, you always doing this and dismiss what the real issues you need help.

713
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.690
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

714
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:28.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But he can hide behind your scapegoat flow if you pop up and you be angry because now he could just point the finger at us at the problem.

715
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.730
Jo Delgadillo: And I guess.

716
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:43.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's practice that give me another situation where you could model but i feel i understand i mean

717
01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.340
Jo Delgadillo: Yesterday when I was making spaghetti micro doesn't make spaghetti.

718
01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:54.210
Jo Delgadillo: And she told me I usually take noodles out and put it to the side and take lead out before, but the sauce and

719
01:24:54.570 --> 01:25:03.570
Jo Delgadillo: So she can have it. I did the noodles, but yesterday I was going to clean Justin's house. That's a friend of ours. If you started cancer.

720
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:04.710
Jo Delgadillo: And he

721
01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:11.640
Jo Delgadillo: doesn't have much energy. So we can't get around. So I clean his house a rule of law for him. Well, yesterday was one of those days.

722
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:29.130
Jo Delgadillo: And I was like trying to hurry because I didn't want to be out too late and I knew I didn't have that much to do over there. So I forgot to take the hamburger meat out all my gramma walks in and wait till she was triggered a mumbling. So I was like, oh, she's like, where's

723
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:46.740
Jo Delgadillo: The hamburger meat and I was like I was like, I didn't notice when I sorry I totally forgot to take out the hamburger meat. I'm sorry. I'll cookie some more because this one's already mix. I should have known that you would do that. It's so it's so expected and I was like, what

724
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.540
Jo Delgadillo: And she was like, I shouldn't know and I was like why she's like cars.

725
01:25:52.710 --> 01:26:01.710
Jo Delgadillo: Because I do it all the time. She's like, Yeah. And I was like, really. So I do it all the time. And she was just like, yeah, no, no, I don't ever like is the first time I've ever done it.

726
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:09.930
Jo Delgadillo: Sure is just like whatever, and I was just like, what, what is that supposed to mean she's like, take it however you want. I was just like,

727
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:21.810
Jo Delgadillo: Okay, I'm trying to hurry to go and she she was like, Oh, that'd be a good idea to go help him. So I was like, Oh, no. Do it. And plus, I get to get out of the house for a little bit with no kids, I was totally

728
01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:22.050
Jo Delgadillo: On

729
01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:24.270
Jo Delgadillo: I was totally on board to get out of the house.

730
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:35.130
Jo Delgadillo: We feel bad because I was trying to rush and I forgot the hamburger me, but I still offer to cook her some more before I left, even though I was in a rush. She just she made me feel like I was at me.

731
01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:36.540
Jo Delgadillo: Like I can write

732
01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:45.510
Jo Delgadillo: And it's about everything. If I sweep. If I clean the living room. Oh, you didn't do this right, and do that right you but you didn't center it like I'm just like,

733
01:26:45.900 --> 01:27:00.660
Jo Delgadillo: That's why I go crazy trying to make sure I do everything perfect is she's always in my head and I try to tell her that it isn't perfect. I'm like, What do you mean it has to be perfect. You're constantly on top of me telling me if I don't do things right. Don't do it at all.

734
01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:01.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wow.

735
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:12.240
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, that's tomato. It's like a little girl. It was always like that. If you're not gonna do it right, do it at all. Got to be perfect and my poor babies, they are like that to know

736
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.960
Jo Delgadillo: Trying to make everything perfect

737
01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:34.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Great this pattern and this cycle of this perfectionism, where there's no room for mistakes or error because you don't want your children to have this hero scapegoat enabler complex that you're jumping

738
01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.220
Jo Delgadillo: I learned from our mistakes because things are good.

739
01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:42.120
Jo Delgadillo: That's how you learn. She doesn't like it.

740
01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:43.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I'm grandma.

741
01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:52.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Grandma. So let's talk about the situation. Give me your ideal. I understand. And I need sleep.

742
01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.660
Jo Delgadillo: I feel hurt.

743
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.970
Jo Delgadillo: And

744
01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.190
Jo Delgadillo: I guess.

745
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.370
Jo Delgadillo: Hurts and

746
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:07.560
Jo Delgadillo: Appreciate it. There's the word

747
01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.290
Jo Delgadillo: What's the next one. I understand.

748
01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:12.930
Jo Delgadillo: That she wanted to meet

749
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:17.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me.

750
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.470
Jo Delgadillo: And then I need

751
01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:20.790
Jo Delgadillo: To

752
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.700
Jo Delgadillo: Understand that I was in a rush, and I'm sorry.

753
01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:29.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Oh, good. I feel

754
01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:31.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: unappreciated

755
01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:37.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And hurt. I understand you're hungry and you'd like to spaghetti with the meat.

756
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:40.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I need some understanding

757
01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:52.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can you give that to me and she still goes off, guess what, that's all her because you were still able to keep

758
01:28:53.670 --> 01:29:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your position you were able to effectively communicate your emotion and even if she does not respond the way you want.

759
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nobody gives opportunity to respond. Good. Your body because now instead of your body feeling the anxiety. It gets to release really motion that that the body in the brain is process.

760
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:34.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But because you are internalizing the emotions of anxiety and anger. It really doesn't give your body a good way to respond back so it continues to activate that cortisol to get you frustrated, to get you into that fight.

761
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:50.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if you can activate that calmness that parasympathetic process in your brain to say, wow, because feeling unappreciated and feels a lot different than anger.

762
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:51.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

763
01:29:52.710 --> 01:30:11.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It gives your body, the opportunity to really adequately process, the emotion and so over time you'll notice I might have. I might not have to push the button as much for chest pain because I realize I'm not really angry. I'm just a little unappreciated

764
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:18.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm actually more disappointed with my husband than angry.

765
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:26.730
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, even get frustrated when I push the button.

766
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.050
Jo Delgadillo: Because it makes a noise, it goes

767
01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:39.720
Jo Delgadillo: for like a minute. And they're like, oh, no, it's not the standard cover it. So nobody complains about it. It's annoying.

768
01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:51.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But do you see and just doing this exercise that this is a household with this is a family dynamic of being unable to really process very motion.

769
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:54.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Effectively, because

770
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.710
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

771
01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:56.340
Jo Delgadillo: And we don't

772
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:57.660
Jo Delgadillo: Like we don't

773
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:10.530
Jo Delgadillo: We'll talk like we do. We look like a really, really close family. We are. But when it comes to like real emotions and I'm talking about really emotions and letting it out there. We don't do that we used to. We don't do that anymore.

774
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:11.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

775
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:19.650
Jo Delgadillo: And then I noticed a difference between the time that we did talk and we did let all the emotions out even cry together and all that.

776
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:30.210
Jo Delgadillo: I noticed the difference. Everybody was happier than we communicated. For now, it's nothing even my grandma gets frustrating raises your voice and she does not raise your voice.

777
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:37.110
Jo Delgadillo: In the past few years, it's just it's sucks because I remember a time when we communicate it

778
01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:44.880
Jo Delgadillo: I think it would help everybody if we just sat down and talk to each other and and not say hurtful things just because you want to hurt each other.

779
01:31:45.150 --> 01:31:45.540
Yeah.

780
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.660
Jo Delgadillo: It does when I try to sit down and talk with her.

781
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:50.310
Jo Delgadillo: And tell her how I feel.

782
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:58.350
Jo Delgadillo: I'll say something, how I feel. And she doesn't like what I say. Because it's because something she's done or said to me, we feel that way.

783
01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:05.880
Jo Delgadillo: She'll say things early and I'm just like, See, that's what I'm talking about. Fine. I won't do this. You don't want me to talk like she gets like that. I'm just like, see.

784
01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:12.450
Jo Delgadillo: Now you're getting frustrated because you didn't like what I said that's not fair to say thanks to me that I'm not going to want to hear.

785
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.070
Jo Delgadillo: And I'm just gonna have to hear it.

786
01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:18.210
Jo Delgadillo: Like I have to take it. That's the way you feel. I can't tell someone else out of feel

787
01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.310
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, she just she doesn't like it.

788
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:25.350
Jo Delgadillo: But I'm going to ask everybody wants to sit down and talk

789
01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:26.820
Jo Delgadillo: Through

790
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:44.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, it would, and even, even if they say no, you get to be that model for what effective communication looks like you get to, to demonstrate how I noticed a change in Joe. She's not yelling as much

791
01:32:45.450 --> 01:33:01.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She's saying that I feel. She's saying the. I understand that. I understand is so important, too, because it gives the other person the opportunity to see how you view them to see that you still love them, even if you're frustrated or disappointed.

792
01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because even if you were to say to your husband and

793
01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:11.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm disappointed that you didn't help me put the bed in the Trump. I understand we draw a long time.

794
01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:21.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because men are thinking Joe is asking you for a DMC she's always nagging, the way you say I just say you need your own time. He makes it. Oh, wow.

795
01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:36.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She's recognizing that I need to relax, too. But I mean, and that gives them the opportunity to really hear from your voice. What you need versus seeing a reaction.

796
01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:51.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To what you're not getting so that's what he's been seeing your reaction to what you're not getting you see your anger, the same your irritability is not really feeling that there must be some disappointment.

797
01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And he probably doesn't feel understood

798
01:33:57.150 --> 01:33:59.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What areas do you feel Miss understood

799
01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:03.240
Jo Delgadillo: Everything basically

800
01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.250
Jo Delgadillo: Because the way everybody reacts to kind of don't care what the average adult they're

801
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:11.550
Jo Delgadillo: Actually, I don't see that they care.

802
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:17.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, would you need to see to know that they here.

803
01:34:20.850 --> 01:34:29.670
Jo Delgadillo: Just tear a little bit at least show it like, I don't know, like, just a minute ago and I've spent together. We just sat there and watch me do it.

804
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:46.110
Jo Delgadillo: I moved to hear twin size beds to have them to box springs to thing is, and then two Queen beds all by myself, like, help me. Let's show that you care. I do everything for you guys. Just, just a little bit.

805
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:51.480
Jo Delgadillo: My I hate that I have to cost them, they'll see me Karen arms full of groceries.

806
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:54.180
Jo Delgadillo: Coming in and out and everybody just sit there watching me.

807
01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:04.620
Jo Delgadillo: And if I say, Can anybody help me once you got it. Yeah, but a little bit of help with just a little because I started to stand here and put all of it away.

808
01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:14.730
Jo Delgadillo: Like we bought we bought like for the grocery store today and I had to put all of it away what everybody else just did their thing, wandering around the house and hanging out and I'm just like,

809
01:35:15.450 --> 01:35:28.410
Jo Delgadillo: The babies both babies are crying that they were hungry and I'm like no one fed them. I've been gone go shopping for almost four hours and then come back and hit Enter atmospheric there's nothing to feed them. What is this fruit up there. They don't have to have a full meal all the

810
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:31.620
Jo Delgadillo: Excuses all the time.

811
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:37.920
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, maybe not a chore. It's give her a frickin banana, apple. It's that simple.

812
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:45.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so we're going to see his message if you ask me for health, while you're already actively doing the work.

813
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:58.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because if you're dragging the beds in and you're already halfway through the door and you ask for help. I've been there. I know that is not clear. It's what speaking is your irritability, it's not really the me

814
01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:06.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So probably comes up you struggling with the bed. Can somebody help me. That's what what they're seeing. But what if

815
01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:18.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You got out the car. You came through the door empty hand and you say, I'm feeling really overwhelmed or I have a lot of groceries in the car.

816
01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:26.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Understand, you guys got some stuff going on. But I'm really need some help, can, can I have to leave three you come out and help me with the girl sweets.

817
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:34.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you stand there, you don't move until somebody gets up to help you bring it back. But if you're already bringing the bags in

818
01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:41.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It gives them their go show again she built it all last year she already halfway through the door. Yeah.

819
01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:48.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the communication doesn't even come in. Good. Because you're already irritated. I've been there, I've gone grocery shopping

820
01:36:49.050 --> 01:37:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have come in with the bags and my boys are sitting on the couch and I'm like nobody's gonna help me with the bag but the times that I have walked through the door with one bag.

821
01:37:02.010 --> 01:37:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can tell you my voice. I said, You want more back to the car and I'll say yes. And they go out and they get the banks.

822
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:14.310
Jo Delgadillo: Are so that is I came in with one bag like like a week ago.

823
01:37:14.610 --> 01:37:16.590
Jo Delgadillo: Now I go grocery shopping twice a week.

824
01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:18.960
Jo Delgadillo: And I came in with one because that was

825
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:20.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For the babies and they were

826
01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:24.450
Jo Delgadillo: Like, Oh, do you need help. It's true was one when I carried one back. They did.

827
01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:26.910
Jo Delgadillo: They have to say anything.

828
01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, yes.

829
01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:30.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Imagery

830
01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:32.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you been able to do it all.

831
01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:46.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your independent woman you have lots of accomplishments. You're a go getter, you get things done it all the imagery, they see is, you're always getting things done.

832
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:49.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They don't feel needed

833
01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:50.910
Jo Delgadillo: Here.

834
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:56.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you come in and with that one bag that imagery is changing because then I oh

835
01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now there's this curiosity about what she has one back. Wonder if

836
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:11.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we're working on the communication and the imagery, they're so used to seeing you busy doing it all and Always in a rush.

837
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're gonna have to change that up.

838
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:17.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, not rushing in. Or like, what are you doing

839
01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:18.690
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, like

840
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:22.500
Jo Delgadillo: Taking a break. Why you're free to do like

841
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:24.300
You see,

842
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:27.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

843
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Change the imagery for them. Next time somebody says, Hey, I need you to do A, B and C. Okay, I'll get to it.

844
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't let them see even if you feel it here in your body that oh my gosh, I need to get out this door. I need to hurry up. Slow it down purposely slow it down so that these people will continue to

845
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Use you to get their needs met.

846
01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:10.110
Jo Delgadillo: Like this morning when she asked me to do that. I was thinking in my head. It doesn't need to be done now, but I can't like that way of thinking. It's not me anymore.

847
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:16.710
Jo Delgadillo: It's always rush, rush, rush. Do it now make them happy and just be done with it. And that's how I got to thinking that way.

848
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:27.420
Jo Delgadillo: I'm constantly in a rush, everybody tells me what do you drive faster, like I just always feel like I'm in a rush, like all the time and it sucks. Eat it.

849
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Purposely slow yourself down.

850
01:39:32.370 --> 01:39:50.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By slowing yourself down, you also give yourself an opportunity to really connect with what you're feeling. There's been several times in this session of that. Well, how would you know someone's pair. I don't know you haven't slowed down enough to really figure out what you need. Yeah.

851
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So all that's presenting is your irritability or anger. That's all this scene. Yeah.

852
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:59.850
Jo Delgadillo: It's crazy how I know what everybody else needs about myself.

853
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:00.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

854
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:02.190
Jo Delgadillo: I never thought about that.

855
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have on this enabler cake.

856
01:40:06.150 --> 01:40:06.450
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

857
01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:15.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if you take off that Kate, you take off the scapegoat Kate you focus on you, said the KP one where it's just hero. Yeah.

858
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:33.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We focus on that you can be able to focus on what Joe really means in this moment slow things down and be more aware with what's going on with you so that the outside environment doesn't get the opportunity to throw whatever cakes. They want to give you

859
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:35.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

860
01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:51.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's work on that. I want you to work on this week I feel I understand, and I need and using that as a form of communication will never, you need to process and emotion.

861
01:40:52.680 --> 01:41:04.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even if you don't feel like there's a safe person in your family that you can process that with have to sit by yourself efforts, just to really get into what's going on with you.

862
01:41:05.730 --> 01:41:06.060
Okay.

863
01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.100
Jo Delgadillo: You

864
01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.270
Jo Delgadillo: I'm sure you remember my step son Aiden. The 13 year old.

865
01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:22.740
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I don't remember if I've told you or somebody else but he drops little hints. He's been drawing boys kissing like

866
01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:25.320
Jo Delgadillo: Gameboy and you'll give them to me and smile.

867
01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.080
Jo Delgadillo: What do I say I

868
01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.800
Jo Delgadillo: Just say, cool. That's a good picture and he'll have rainbows on them, you draw a whole book with boys kissing

869
01:41:35.130 --> 01:41:37.740
Jo Delgadillo: Like boy. A boy is holding hands like

870
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:38.430
Jo Delgadillo: They're all gay

871
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.710
Jo Delgadillo: Everybody in the book and it's all boy.

872
01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:49.980
Jo Delgadillo: And he's been printing pictures out online and he's if they're girls. He makes them look like boys and puts another boy next door. So they're gay. Is he trying to tell me something.

873
01:41:50.400 --> 01:42:04.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It seems like it. So, give him an opportunity to use this is communication skills, you get to model that for him. So the next one. He gives, gives you a picture. So this is nice. What do you, what are you trying to tell me

874
01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:06.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What did you say

875
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:09.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To me for you, you know, what does this picture mean for you.

876
01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:20.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And show curiosity and non judgmental way because then that gives them opportunity to really tell you what he's feeling because

877
01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:31.020
Jo Delgadillo: No one else. Yeah. If somebody mentioned it. He acts like they didn't even say anything. But when I say yes, it's like I'm going to move over here and talk to her about it.

878
01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.720
Jo Delgadillo: But he won't actually like say it's him.

879
01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:44.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, he's wanting someone to give them an invitation to speak when he gives you the picture. Oh, this is nice.

880
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:47.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What more do you want to tell me about this picture.

881
01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:53.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

882
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:57.420
Jo Delgadillo: Cuz he's scared, his mom is gonna freak out. She's like she

883
01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.460
Jo Delgadillo: Wanted to kill him.

884
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:04.560
Jo Delgadillo: Okay, what a small things if he's coming he's coming to me not to smoke.

885
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:06.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

886
01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.670
Jo Delgadillo: Myself until he's ready for no

887
01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.040
Jo Delgadillo: Not my thing to do.

888
01:43:11.370 --> 01:43:18.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. And so the way he responds important because he sees you. He sees that hero cape on you.

889
01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:28.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But remember, if he does go into detail about why he showed you. That's not your responsibility to tell his mom.

890
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because what happens now is now the family. Once again, gets the put the scapegoat cape on you because what are they going to say

891
01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:46.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're going to find some way to make him tell you an issue you already see this pattern with your family, you're going to find some way

892
01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:59.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To make it about you versus what's really going on with this child, then you're going to get triggered and then you're probably going to act out in a way that you're accustomed to the anger the frustration or the irritability.

893
01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:06.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So he tells you you know all this is a nice picture. What are you trying to tell me what is this picture me for you.

894
01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:16.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He says something like not being curious. Okay. Okay. Well, whenever you feel safe to tell your parents.

895
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:18.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell them.

896
01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:27.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or leave it at that. Don't push him to tell them, don't ask why haven't you told mom and dad just listening.

897
01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:29.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Remember, what's

898
01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:33.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going things down. You're not going to respond to the issue. You're just gonna listen

899
01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:36.030
Okay.

900
01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:37.680
