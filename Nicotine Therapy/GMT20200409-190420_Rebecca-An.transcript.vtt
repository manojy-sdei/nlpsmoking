32
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.270

33
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.300
Joshua Ward: And like you got to where I was using so much. I was using a lot

34

Joshua Ward: I've used I've used heroin since I was 21

40
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.250

41
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.940

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.040
Yeah.

122
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.860
Joshua Ward: So that isn't really

123

Joshua Ward: And then I have an ankle monitor so I can, I have, I have to be home by six and afternoon so like, and I have stuff. I have to do for that too. So like I have to work around so much schedules to like getting a job is gonna be like, really hard.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

125
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:23.970

126
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe it's just an idea, but maybe it'd be a good time to check into getting some kind of

127
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: pursuing education online.

128
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Might be a good time to check that out. That's

129
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.190
That's

130
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:47.250
Joshua Ward: Like I was gonna check into that, but I don't know if I can go down to the college and sign up for that now with everything going on because they will shut down.

131
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you can do it online.

132
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.010

133
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.420
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

134
00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just go, you just check out you know the college that you are wanting to go to and see what they offer online. You can probably talk to somebody to and find out what options are available for you, you know, okay. But everything's online now. You know what I mean look at we're online.

135
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything's online right now because of the you know the sickness widget. It's really was gearing towards that way. Anyways, but it was kind of a push this whole whole flu, you know, to get everybody in this format.

136
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:41.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What, tell me, Josh. What are some of the things that you would like to work on while you're engaged with bright heart while you're in treatment that you didn't feel that you got while you were in treatment before

137
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:53.100
Joshua Ward: I would just like to keep whenever, whenever it's gonna take to keep to stay sober. Like what, like I'm willing to do whatever is in those days.

138
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:05.040
Joshua Ward: There is talking to somebody like you have somebody else like whatever's gonna take for me to do good, like I'm going to do it like

139
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

140
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:14.520
Joshua Ward: Well, it sounds like what it's going to take. And I'm not sure I could right now. I'm taking one day at a time like I'm doing great. So

141
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what we gotta do is take one day at a time. You know, it's a lot on your plate. When you

142
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.750
Joshua Ward: Haven't had no one, sir.

143
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:23.760
Good.

144
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you got to get acclimated into this new life of yours too, you know. So that's going to be a little bit of an adjustment as well.

145
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you thought about going to any kind of self help groups.

146
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Support groups.

147
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.280
Joshua Ward: Like na na

148
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, or smart recovery or depends on your belief system.

149
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.630
Joshua Ward: I think there's some kind of group that I have to do on Fridays with with with this program. Yeah.

150
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, that's one

151
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's one day a week.

152
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:14.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And so what and this again is is just a suggestion, you know, it's not anything your recovery is yours to create the way that you it works for you, whatever that looks like. So know that piece. Okay.

153
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, but you because everything is geared online, you can go to meetings online. A na

154
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: smart recovery takes out the spiritual aspect of of Na, na, so they focus more on you know the cognitive approach on what you're thinking.

155
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how to change that and how to make decisions that are healthy for you, versus, you know, na, na say that mind, body, and spirit or connect connected, which you know mind body feelings are definitely connected

156
00:14:49.680 --> 00:15:00.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it just really is up to you and you just got to if you're interested in doing that, then I encourage you to explore them online because a lot of them are closed down from face to face.

157
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, you know, definitely building some kind of support system for yourself is going to be a vital piece, you know, of being able to stay sober. So letting you know that. Okay.

158
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:26.520
Joshua Ward: Like what I like what I what I have to go to another doctor to like get on something for anxiety or when I just go through the you guys to

159
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you talked about

160
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.110
Joshua Ward: Like sometimes I get like really really overwhelmed them like a

161
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:35.490
Joshua Ward: Yeah.

162
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:43.830
Joshua Ward: Like, I don't know. I don't know if it's because I've been locked up and like, like I wasn't in like a minimum security that goes is no higher security level prison.

163
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:58.200
Joshua Ward: And I went from being in a sale and being around already anybody to be in around four kids, and three adults all at once. Yeah, I mean, it's like even even like messing with the phone like I get anxiety real bad. I mean,

164
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's a lot, it's a lot to take on as soon as you get out of, out of such a controlled environment. So you know what I would encourage you to do is talk to the doctor that you're working with, with bright heart and who what Dr. Are you working with

165
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:21.870
Joshua Ward: I'm not sure if his name. I don't know papers in the other room, I'm

166
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your group on Friday, is it 11 o'clock.

167
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.330
Joshua Ward: I believe so, yes.

168
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's Dr. PACHTER

169
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dr. David PACHTER is his name. And on Friday, he'll do because I'm in group with you on Friday.

170
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you

171
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:49.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you want to do is you want to, when you do it, you'll do what's called a medical check in and the beginning of group.

172
00:16:50.730 --> 00:17:01.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he'll ask if you're having any side effects from your the medication that you're on and you tell him about your anxiety and you tell him you know the struggles that you're having

173
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And asked him what your options are to help with that. Okay.

174
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And so between him and working with me, we should be able to build up your coping skill toolbox.

175
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:22.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to work on controlling your anxiety helping with your anxiety.

180
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on.

204
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:10.200

205
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And and for group and every week. That number will change. So it'll be a different one. Every time you check in. But you always want to go through the clinic. It's called the virtual clinic. So you always want to go through the clinic before checking in.
