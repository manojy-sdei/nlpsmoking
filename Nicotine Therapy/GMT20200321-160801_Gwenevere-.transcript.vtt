00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:04.710
Cindy.

2
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.980
Hi.

3
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Greetings.

4
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have

5
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.560
We have Starbucks.

6
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So that means I have an uncompensated couple on my hands.

7
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.330
Yep.

8
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you want to, um,

9
00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you also have I've got a really short little share. Let me see how many items. This is 1234 678-910-1112 1314 1516 1718 1919 item little sort of like art scale thing. If you can each have piece of paper.

10
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we're in that

11
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: place for us to start if it turns out you guys already have something really pressing aside from the obvious.

12
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We can start, we can start, start somewhere else.

13
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.970
Cynthia We: Okay, I don't think we do.

14
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I'm gonna start a note, while everybody kind of settles in,

15
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Might need us.

16
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.880
Cynthia We: Already got his paper.

17
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.410
Right.

18
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.100
And you stand up.

19
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.580
Cynthia We: Oh, that's nice. Now I can see. Oh, yeah.

20
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Whose birthday was it recently.

21
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She nine. How old is she,

22
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.410
Yes.

23
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that he was

24
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.820
Cynthia We: Heartbroken because she couldn't have her friend over her birthday, and then she was supposed to have a sleep over once school got back in session.

25
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.760
Cynthia We: Yeah, it can happen so

26
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Celebrated another time.

27
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.320
Cynthia We: Yeah, you know,

28
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We're all going through this. I got you. I got us some similar. A lot of people are well first, good morning. Scott, how are you

29
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.570
Cynthia We: Morning.

30
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.080
Cynthia We: How are you

31
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good. Just, it kind of

32
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Waking up. You guys are waking up. Yep. Okay. Cool. All right. Very nice. So let me open up a note here.

33
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you already sort of have

34
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A place that you want to start with, or do you want me to take the lead today.

35
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.620
Yo,

36
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo,

37
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.940
Cynthia We: Yo, yo.

38
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.050
Cynthia We: You may take me

39
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I never have a problem with that.

40
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: never shy about it. Alright, so let me see. No, not 19. We're going to do a new one. Let's go here in just a sec.

41
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'll do is I'm going to share the screen. And I think what I say there were 19 they're not listed, they're not

42
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Numbered but maybe you can number them and we'll just do like card scale of zero to 10. Let's just have this be a nice neutral point of discussion.

43
00:03:44.580 --> 00:04:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But I will say, Let's not look at one another's page I think kind of doing this a bit independently maybe turning away from one another, while you're doing this quick little inventory might be more productive than being tempted to want to have something

44
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The same

45
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why we get the real deal.

46
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so still working on opening up a note here. So maybe maybe on the left hand side right numbers one through 19 okay and I can talk. I'm not great at it multitasking, but I'll try this is coming from a model. I've mentioned it before.

47
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Horrible Hendrix model of the Moto relationship there. This comes from that that model.

48
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you want to do some looking into it, you can

49
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you guys decide to continue to sort of work with me in this kind of way, then they'll be more and more of this integration of this type of philosophy and the basic premise is oftentimes

50
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We bring

51
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: An unconscious expectation of our sort of caregivers from our childhood both all the positive

52
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All the negative

53
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And we bring into our life.

54
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone that resembles all the positive and negative or a Margot

55
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: As ourselves, we end up taking our childhood that image. Some of the positive and negative and a lot of ways. It's the piece of the negative that ends up being the stuff that's in the marital discord.

56
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's that is the model when you hear me say it. Oh, you guys are in a Mongo match or something like that, you know,

57
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll go, Okay, what are you talking about, so that's kind of what I'm saying. I'm saying it's this imagery this unconscious imprint that happens. This is what was familiar

58
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: In my childhood. Oh, I can't believe it. Here it is again my marriage. How can this be I, why would I do this. Why, why would I pick someone that was the opposite of

59
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative attributes of a caregiver from childhood. Why would I pull into my life someone that doesn't matter, we end up doing that we end up having that motto image we bring into our life.

60
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically the piece from our childhood about, oh, I didn't like that they were this. How can this be in my spouse to you think I would have been drawn to someone, the opposite.

61
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work like that we end up. It's the same. It's just wild. So when you hear me say that, then that's kind of what I'm referring to. So

62
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: See I'm no good at multitasking. That means

63
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do it. I can't do that if they didn't open this note of almost there. I need to get you guys have your that you could be doing while I'm stalling.

64
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.190
Cynthia We: Zero is not at all 10 is a lot

65
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And this is going to be our relationship vision. You can title it our relationship vision.

66
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

67
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so obviously this is not comprehensive. It's only 19 items.

68
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a place to start.

69
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I think I'm ready to share the screen and I can talk a little bit. So if you could resist the urge to see what other people are doing resist the urge

70
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To edit yourself. Try to catch that first response. There's no way to do it wrong. Might as well. Share the truth. Try not to censor

71
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just put your number down, put your number down, put your number down. So we've got at the top of the page, our relationship vision.

72
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you might say my relationship vision and you've got in case you want to reference this in the future, you may want to put the scale zero is not important at all.

73
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then all the way to 10 it's imperative. It's important. It's urgent. This is

74
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a critical piece. This has got to be in there. This is a

75
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I draw the line here, kind of thing. I've got to have this

76
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so I'm going to share the screen and then if you want to write the words out. Go for it. You can also do a print screen if you want, however you want to do it, but really try not to look at each other's pages because again.

77
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: These might bring up some emotional response. Okay, see if we can just sort of be honest with ourselves and write down zero to 10 and we'll have a chance in here to be able to kind of go over those

78
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have fun together.

79
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Important to be in this co creative vision of our relationship. If we were to write that together. How important would it be that that be a part of the Vision Zero to 10. See if you can write a number down

80
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the second one we settle our differences peacefully. Hmm, how important is it that our relationship.

81
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If we were to co create. So that's what

82
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.020
Cynthia We: This is what we want to create. Right. Yeah.

83
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly how important is it. Oh.

84
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to write a number. Okay, see what's happening inside

85
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're running through it doesn't exist. Will it exists. That's not what this is resist it, put the number down of what it is important to you.

86
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Not what you think is possible, how important it is to you 10 is imperative zero is. I don't care.

87
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Sky. You need more clarification.

88
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:36.420
Cynthia We: I'm well. I'm just wondering why wouldn't just say tend to almost all these because they really, really want all these, um, then

89
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're yours is defined refinement, then it's about attending that we we may like all the ice cream flavors. They're all before us. There's more than 31 flavors and indeed.

90
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We still have to pick one. So we're still going to need to focus somewhere. So maybe your register is going to be around.

91
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That difference between maybe a nine and a 10 maybe yours is going to be 9.2 maybe yours is going to be 9.5 maybe it's right in there. Maybe 10 is

92
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Without this, I walk out the door. So you see where your refinement might be. So you just tuned into that space. If they're all okay fine. Maybe not, but just really tune in to precision for yourself, then

93
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, they're not numbered I'll get I'll get to that at some point.

94
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be typing, I think, while you're doing that. I'll put it in a Word document.

95
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.480
Then I can actually have it numbered for you.

96
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.010
You

97
00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys are so cute.

98
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.650
Strictly of

99
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Course not. Oh.

100
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure. Well, well, we can pick that up later. Just pay attention to your first response to it. So you notice you have a question. Well, then that contributes to how important it is just go with your first response will work that nuance out later.

101
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.630
All right, I'm gonna do one

102
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it big enough for me. You guys see these or is it super tiny.

103
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. All right. Okay. Yes.

104
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.090
Cynthia We: Old can't see as well.

105
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Something

106
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.320
Cynthia We: No good.

107
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.250
Worship. You and I see down

108
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:33.750
Cynthia We: 10 because I didn't confuse

109
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'm typing it up. Also, so that I can make it easier as well. I'm on. Number eight.

110
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is

111
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.320
Cynthia We: Your fast.

112
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you should see if I was dictating and I'd be done a long time ago. But if I mess with the microphone while I'm dictating I might lose this video conference with you my computer goes Excuse me three things at once. Can't do it.

113
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it off at me.

114
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Some good ones in here.

115
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know when you're done.

116
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

117
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.320
Cynthia We: Let's go back and edit.

118
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

119
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:57.270
I know

120
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

121
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.590
So,

122
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I only have it up to 13 but I'll be able to type

123
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.190
As I'm going so

124
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.140
Cynthia We: Yeah.

125
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.100
So,

126
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So how many are there. So if we

127
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Share 1314 1516 1718 or 19. Is that what you have

128
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.640
Yeah.

129
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.160
Cynthia We: Okay, stop share

130
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Copy. Did you copy. No cheating.

131
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.830
Cynthia We: Just kicking

132
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.070
Our

133
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um, let's take a peek. Is everybody has sip of coffee. Mm hmm.

134
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's start with

135
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What this was like for you. Scott to do this activity so far. What's this, like, what are you going through right now.

136
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:08.190
Cynthia We: I'm probably over analyzing it, trying to figure out the perfect answers and um

137
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.070
Cynthia We: I don't know, I'm a little bit

138
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.970
Cynthia We: Yeah, I don't know, um,

139
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

140
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:27.540
Cynthia We: If it's good enough. It's just that most of the things are things everybody wants in a relationship. I don't think

141
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:29.220
Cynthia We: So,

142
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see. Is it the perfect answer to what a therapist would want to hear perfect answers. So you could defend a position to your spouse. Perfect answer to your

143
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your soul, where you don't betray what's right for you. How does perfect get measured

144
00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.560
Cynthia We: Oh well, I think it should be what's in your soul in yours, not mine. Yeah, and

145
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What it sound like I wanted to mark these true and honest to myself.

146
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.380
Cynthia We: Uh, yeah, yeah, that I mean

147
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.590
Cynthia We: I think that's the right way to do things, I think. Yeah, true and honest to yourself, I think there's a

148
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:21.960
Cynthia We: Little bit of a

149
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.120
Cynthia We: Bad, but I don't know. I was just thinking, Yeah, I'm trying to answer, I'm sure. And I asked myself, but also

150
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:40.110
Cynthia We: If it's for our survival. If it's before I'm out the door, kind of thing. Well then, I guess I was thinking back to what have we lived with and

151
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:48.690
Cynthia We: So, so maybe I don't need a 10 on this because I know I can survive with less but i don't i'm i guess i'm not

152
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.970
Cynthia We: 100% sure

153
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.560
Cynthia We: If I should be looking at it that way, or just what I

154
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sit and notice what's happening. Notice that it's

155
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.270
Cynthia We: Too much. I don't know.

156
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we're both noticing.

157
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So go back to that, there's, you don't have to second guess your list that even if

158
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It was impulsive, even if it turns out when we really look at this, you say, wow, it's not something. Look at that number. I gave it

159
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what I was thinking at the time, I wonder, I wonder if that was my first instinct and look at that number. I wrote

160
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I invite you to know that it's okay in here. There's, there's no wrong. Okay, it's no judgment on yourself for not matching it up to some ledger where you're going to end up feeling bad. It's not going to be that that's not the destiny here.

161
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just the first one.

162
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I give myself permission this morning.

163
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To really want what I want

164
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To give myself permission to want what I want

165
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then rushed in, so quickly. Am I allowed to do that. Well, now I am putting it up to what I've tolerated and whatever. And what will you know

166
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like it was hard for you to even do that first part just pure and simple. This is what I want.

167
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how important it is to me.

168
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:22.890
Yeah.

169
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:34.710
Cynthia We: It's a little hard. I'm there's too many things I'm thinking about about each one. And also, you know, I have a hard time sometimes between the difference between, you know, eight, nine and 10 you know

170
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:46.260
Cynthia We: Do I want you know is financial security 10 for me, generally. Yeah, but I guess it

171
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.690
Cynthia We: DOESN'T MEAN I'M OUT THE DOOR FOR NOT 100% financially secure know

172
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.280
Cynthia We: So,

173
00:19:53.850 --> 00:20:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why for you this space of eight 910 was important, this was important. So, so I've got a really respect it. When you make a decision to put something at a nine. It was no small feat.

174
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why I was saying for for you. And both of you, the functions in between. And there are some skills that I might say, Well, why don't we do it right from zero to 100 now that gets more room.

175
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

176
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that would be more comfortable and I liked those

177
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.270
Cynthia We: I'm not sure if that was more comfortable or one to three would be more comfortable.

178
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:35.400
Cynthia We: Um,

179
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But you haven't already. Here's where you have it eight 910. Those are your three numbers.

180
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:44.880
Cynthia We: Well,

181
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's probably where they're all important to you came here.

182
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:58.830
Cynthia We: There, there, there are a couple that that there were like two or three of them that were low that didn't matter as much. Okay.

183
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.080
Cynthia We: But they seem to be more practical type things like living close to your parents, things like that. Okay.

184
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, the eight 910 like this. That was the area where

185
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: nuance was difficult.

186
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.200
Cynthia We: I guess I do have some lower ones there, but it's mostly it's mostly

187
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:32.040
Cynthia We: When I read something and I'm like, oh, that I definitely like that. I definitely want that in a relationship. Why wouldn't anybody not want that and their relationship. So yeah, then it's it's hard to decide eight 910 yeah

188
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so I'm noticing you you have. Now again I don't work with you on a regular basis. But you reference standard it to, well, wouldn't anybody you've done it just a moment ago, and you just did it again.

189
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You referenced what's acceptable with the self to why wouldn't isn't it logical that anybody would you do it real fast.

190
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not right not wrong just that's I'm the therapist. Those are the things I noticed right

191
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm keeping that in mind.

192
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm interested in what's important to you. Really interested

193
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And sitting with that might be uncomfortable and you may want to go to. Isn't this just logical wouldn't anybody. And I know that might be habitual but what I'm interested in is truly

194
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That space between eight, nine and 10 for you. I want to really understand it.

195
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, sure. All right, so hold that

196
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: City.

197
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What has this been like for you sitting over there having to give it a number

198
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.650
Cynthia We: I had the same in the same reaction that most of them were time

199
00:22:47.250 --> 00:23:05.940
Cynthia We: But you can't do that. But then I gave the instruction to Scott and I'm like, oh, okay. Well, so, maybe, maybe. Yeah. And then I started playing all the things that well I have lived with sense. So, and it's not so intolerable. So maybe it's not really 1010

200
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, let's do this.

201
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.950
Cynthia We: Let's dig in the eight 910 minutes well

202
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, does anybody have anything below and eight.

203
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.670
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, two or three things.

204
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.870
So,

205
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:27.150
Cynthia We: So we have a couple below I have more things than I thought. Yeah, I've got two to seven, a couple times, then

206
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.280
Cynthia We: When there are three of them that are low. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

207
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just let me check in on on on the on the body and on the emotion level. Let me just see what's happening for each of you, we just do a little check in. So Cindy. How are you, how's your body doing. Are you breathing. How's the chest. How's the gut. How you doing, yeah.

208
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling grounded. Yes, you can feel your butt on the bed.

209
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.660
Cynthia We: They can, and I am breathing.

210
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.570
Cynthia We: Like what is on the bed. We are on chairs.

211
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it. I was like, y'all need to be sitting in chairs, this time.

212
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. And and for you. Scott, that might not be the same, right. She has a lot more time with me some, I don't know, something else might be coming up. Are you feeling any emotion in particular, you're noticing.

213
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.430
Cynthia We: No, I'm pretty comfortable slate anxiousness

214
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.160
Cynthia We: Up and going right in therapy.

215
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, wake up. How do you feel

216
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel good today. Okay. Like, anxious, though, right.

217
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And how's the body. Sometimes it registers something before we can label it like with those fancy words like the nuance of anxious versus nervous versus edgy or tense, you know,

218
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your body feeling any kind of tension anywhere, any tight muscles any aches.

219
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.400
Cynthia We: Know you have an easy flow of breath.

220
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So what I'd like to do is have your turn, turn your chairs not directly, face to face, but just slightly off just ever so slightly.

221
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a chance would probably be something like this. You won't be sitting directly, but you'll be just sort of off the angle so that if you needed to break I count on to contact you cut so many alternative break towards me. That's fine. Okay, cool. All right, now

222
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. And

223
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How we feeling now.

224
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.180
Fine.

225
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. All right, so

226
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to start with the things that surprised you that Cindy, maybe, maybe something you noticed about your list that is like out. This is a. These are my low numbers. And then I want you to share them with with Scott like some of the ones that are kind of on the low blow.

227
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.070
Cynthia We: Oh, and just

228
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You. So we're going to use. We're going to use a structured. We already know this is from the same all this, believe it or not, the I feel and mirroring is from the Mongo piece to let's keep that in there.

229
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So that we don't go too much into storytelling, we can really contain and hold space for

230
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: For something that right. We might be kind of vulnerable and so we don't want to be flippant, we don't want to be judgmental. We don't want to minimize so we can just say, Hey, oh, so it was you're you're feeling. It's the vision for us is important to you in about a three.

231
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. So we're not going to really go into arguing or debating the importance of that or wouldn't someone else right thinking with something else. We're just this is this is special. This is our own private

232
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of experience here. So Cindy, do you feel confident that you can share some things about lower numbers. Okay. So Scott, you're going to kind of tune in.

233
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: For her without judgment.

234
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing that it feels good to be known understood and feel safe without judgment.

235
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We're all going to do that.

236
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.410
Cynthia We: Would you like me to go over

237
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.370
Cynthia We: To them, or three of them or what

238
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell tell your husband what turns out it's not that. Oh.

239
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.050
Cynthia We: So I was surprised that

240
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.110
Cynthia We: I found

241
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:28.890
Cynthia We: Three of them. Um, we're not all that important to me.

242
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.190
Cynthia We: I'm the worship together.

243
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.700
Cynthia We: Loser. That is number six.

244
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:45.030
Cynthia We: Yep, I call these 00 not at all important. So you're talking about. I was talking about church really

245
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.560
Cynthia We: Um,

246
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.020
Cynthia We: And I'm my supposed to me or something, yet.

247
00:27:53.400 --> 00:28:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You basically it's like a. So, so it's it's for you. It's going to church together is a zero. So you might say,

248
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.710
Cynthia We: Yeah, going to church together is this year.

249
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:13.530
Cynthia We: That we both have satisfying careers was a was a five. That was pretty low for me. Um,

250
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:20.160
Cynthia We: I don't think I ever would have said that earlier in my life, but

251
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:33.900
Cynthia We: Yeah, I don't really know what else to say about it, and also that that we live close to our parents to the team number 18 that was a three for me.

252
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.170
Cynthia We: Um, it probably might have been even one or zero, because as you can.

253
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:53.760
Cynthia We: Okay that's giving you some like some some leeway. Like if you want it to look close with your parents. I would be I would be open to it, but it's not at all for me to the parents.

254
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that was

255
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's important that you remember what I was doing with Scott is little minute ago.

256
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.530
Each of you do your own

257
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's your real number.

258
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.430
Cynthia We: Oh, we don't think of me.

259
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.360
Cynthia We: Oh, I don't

260
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.880
Cynthia We: Think of you at all. Okay, so I'll just make it a zero.

261
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now if what was on there, how important it is to make sure my partner gets to express their core values. Why then you might put in a high number. See, it's there. Okay. This just isn't asked on this list.

262
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It's some other kind of list but not this one.

263
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so zero. So we see a little bit of

264
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Not quite, sitting with your experience. So that might want

265
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.070
Cynthia We: I think, um,

266
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:58.470
Cynthia We: When march was here I felt that it was more important that the kids were closer

267
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell him that I'm

268
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.280
To have a grandparent close by, I felt

269
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When

270
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.370
Cynthia We: I love yeah I loved that. Good day advert ready

271
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.530
Cynthia We: And I think that

272
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.680
Cynthia We: That was something that was important to

273
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What number would it have been back then, then

Cynthia We: This number 11 was a seven.

365
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.870
Cynthia We: Careers

366
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It is we both have

367
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.870
Cynthia We: Years. Yeah, important but not

368
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.270
Cynthia We: Not one of the most important for us, for our relationship or personal relationship. I don't believe

369
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.140
Cynthia We: But it was higher. I think because then

370
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:27.780
Cynthia We: Say, I was thinking of YouTube because I want. Yeah, I felt you hadn't been satisfied with your career.

371
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:37.470
Cynthia We: And. And for me, it's like, yeah, I want to like my job, but I'm no longer going to be a baseball player or a rock star. So,

372
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.010

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.800
Cynthia We: Of course, when I hear your stuff and I'm like was important, but I'm

378
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:10.680
Cynthia We: I'm assuming I just thought of it as more practical sense of family.

379
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

380
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.830

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:21.060
Cynthia We: 18 living close to our parents. I put a five somewhere in the middle.

382
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.830
Cynthia We: And then my first reaction was, it's not really important for our relationship.

383
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:32.100
Cynthia We: But

384
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.960
Cynthia We: Obviously it was important to my mom was around

385
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.120
Cynthia We: Political views I put a four. Wow. I don't know.

386
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.420
Cynthia We: I think it's cool when people can get along without exact political views, but

387
00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:50.310
Cynthia We: It's not

388
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.590
Cynthia We: It's not a deal breaker for me.

389
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's hear

390
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:57.210

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.860
Cynthia We: To feel like we're best friends, just as a foundation

397
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.410
Cynthia We: Number eight, was a 10 to have secure happy children.

398
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.190
Cynthia We: Number nine was 10 trust.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.360

400
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.590

401
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.050

404
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.520
Cynthia We: Um, and those are all my friends, I have a lot of nines, but those are my friends.

405
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any in between that was kind of giving you that space.

406
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.820
Cynthia We: Oh no, um, well I put them as nine but

407
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.390
Cynthia We: I nine. So I guess.

408
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:09.390
Cynthia We: I mean, yes, I put having fun together as a nine number one and

409
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.060
Cynthia We: Our differences peacefully. Number two, because I think that's a

410
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:23.430
Cynthia We: One of our weakest spots from one of my weakest spots. I guess I'm our communication.

411
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:28.920
Cynthia We: Is handed him hand with that are weak spot and that's nine

412
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Number five, nine hi nine

413
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:33.240
Um,

414
00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:35.010
Cynthia We: What is

415
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we work well together as parent

416
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:40.620
Cynthia We: That was a nine.

417
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.450
Cynthia We: Seems to all be connected to communicating

418
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.920
Cynthia We: Being on the same team being peaceful enough

419
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.650
Cynthia We: butting heads all the time.

420
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:58.380
Cynthia We: I'm feeling safe was a nine, um,

421
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:07.200
Cynthia We: That's 1618 and number 17 was a nine surprisingly wasn't a 10 i guess i'm not caught off because because

422
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.650
Cynthia We: We've survived this long not being financially.

423
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:23.580
Cynthia We: Um, so I might may not be a total deal breaker, but um yeah it's a high nine it's it's at the that's the one that's probably the forefront of my head in my stress every day. Yeah.

424
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:40.380
Cynthia We: And if you love be a different person. Not if I was rich are had money to solve my problems. That's stupid. But I feel like I would walk and talk and communicate differently if you're financially secure, I believe.

425
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.710
Cynthia We: Everything I did would be a little different.

426
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:45.570
Okay.

427
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.060
You

428
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Could not have said a more important thing here today.

429
00:42:53.910 --> 00:43:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Really explained the foundation with which you make, how you walk through your life and how you talk

430
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.340
Cynthia We: This is big.

431
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, really respect that. That's a profound statement you have that self awareness, you know, it's the undercurrent going on almost all the time. Yeah. Okay, so we got to respect that and

432
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I really do.

433
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's pull back from that and let's take a look at some other areas we've we've definitely spent some time around that topic. Let's see what else

434
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We can come out to this this relationship. Let's take a look at some things I happen to circle here which is um

435
00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed

436
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed

437
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one.

438
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like for you to hear that, Cindy.

439
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a high nine I'm having fun.

440
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:57.900
Yeah.

441
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Why don't you

442
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.390
Cynthia We: Do. Yes. Then we feel

443
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.330
Cynthia We: Like

444
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.920
Cynthia We: Guess I know that this is a priority for you. Hmm. Well,

445
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.010
Cynthia We: You might be more surprised to see that. I thought it was a priority.

446
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

447
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we'll go the other way down. Um, so what Scott. Why don't you tell tell Cindy how you're surprised and Cindy, let's have you do some nearing are really

448
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I actually more than mirroring. I'm going to help you, Cindy with validation and validate is using story and context of really knowing this man in front of you, why he would be surprised. So we're going to get to that, but I'm here. If you falter. So once you tell her why you're suppressed.

449
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.910
Cynthia We: Well, I'm not like blown away surprised because I think that's

450
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.250
Cynthia We: What he said what most people would want to have fun in their relationship.

451
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:02.850
Because

452
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.260
Cynthia We: It doesn't seem like a priority, no like

453
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stop.

454
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Only because it's a lot. Go ahead, send me and see

455
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:23.010
Cynthia We: The products you're surprised that it was a 10 for me because

456
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.850
Cynthia We: Us. Like it doesn't seem like it's a priority.

457
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's mirroring. Now you're going to validate this is harder, you're going to use

458
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Context of your life to see how it came to that conclusion of being surprised if you can do it. I

459
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.790
Can see how

460
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.740
Cynthia We: I can see how you would think that

461
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:48.750
Cynthia We: No that's not it.

462
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes it is just

463
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:52.080
Cynthia We: Say something else.

464
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.900
Cynthia We: I could see how this one.

465
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:06.000
Cynthia We: Might be a viewer would lead you to believe that it's not that much of a priority for me.

466
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's validation is where you say it, you say the behavior that he is seeing, we've got a name.

467
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: For cranky to tell them

468
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.290
And

469
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.230
Cynthia We: That I am always busy.

470
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.440
Cynthia We: And don't always take you and the kids up on having fun.

471
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:28.500
Oh,

472
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I see him nodding. I didn't even know that.

473
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: always busy and I don't take you up on the offer so so Scott are you inviting to go to the park or go kind of do some hike or walk or something sledding or something.

474
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.630
Cynthia We: Yeah, that's pretty much exactly it. Yeah, um,

475
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's our chance. That was beautiful. I guess I'm just excited. I'm like, I just learned something brand new like

476
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.420
I don't matter.

477
00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

478
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, you say, Did I get that right, and then followed up with. Is there more so turn to you so

479
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.100
Cynthia We: Did I get that right.

480
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.640
Cynthia We: Yeah, and is there more

481
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.000
Cynthia We: To the fun is more is it

482
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:25.410
Cynthia We: Oh, there was, but I think you kind of set it all. Um, yeah, it's just

483
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.260
Cynthia We: I

484
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess more. See if you can find in I feel it's in there.

485
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.690
Cynthia We: Yeah, I feel, um,

486
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.650
Cynthia We: Yes, we've invited you to

487
00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:45.180
Cynthia We: walk around the block to go on hikes to go do something today.

488
00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.760
Cynthia We: And yes, it's turned down a lot and some

489
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.910
Cynthia We: It's a, it's frustrating because I want

490
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:05.280
Cynthia We: I think it'll help us and I think for the family. And I think would make you happier. So sometimes I'm

491
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.670
Cynthia We: A little baffled why you don't ever want to

492
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there only because it's hard to remember all that. See if you can validate that start with mirroring melody kind of combine the two.

493
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:25.350
Cynthia We: Um, so yes, there's been invitations to go on walks around heights or

494
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can look at him.

495
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.680
I'm

496
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:44.130
Cynthia We: Likes and on and I turned them down in your little frustrated by that because

497
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little you

498
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.640
Cynthia We: Would have been feeling

499
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.390
Cynthia We: Frustrated by that because you think that it would really help us and

500
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.600
Cynthia We: Be good for the kids.

501
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.370
Really enjoy. He's also baffled yes and

502
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now he did the meringue and I want you to. I know this is hard. See if you can

503
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Give a little story about why this is baffling.

504
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.200
To him.

505
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: As he's not crazy. You're not crazy. So we can let our spouse know you're not insane makes sense that you would be baffled by mine not going make sense to me that you

506
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Got

507
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.710
Cynthia We: That going because I put this as a TED.

508
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.280
Cynthia We: That was very important to me.

509
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about your whole personality and now the years you've been together. See if you've got a little story to go with that.

510
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:53.640
Cynthia We: And I used to be so fun.

511
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at

512
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.960
Cynthia We: I used to be so fun and

513
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:02.970
Then probably not this event. So am I doing this right.

514
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.200
Cynthia We: Now I'm not as up for everything.

515
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.900
I understand that's totally back

516
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:13.260
Yeah.

517
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So did I get that right. Is there more. I think there might be

518
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.110
Cynthia We: Two, they get that right. Yeah, there's there.

519
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.460
Cynthia We: Can be yeah okay

520
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:28.140
Cynthia We: Um,

521
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:38.580
Cynthia We: So yeah, the baffling is yes, because I know we always used to have fun. I guess everybody did when they're younger, but

522
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:44.370
Cynthia We: Um, it was part of our relationship and and

523
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.950
Cynthia We: So it's a little baffling. Yeah, because I

524
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.590
Cynthia We: It's an easy formula that it would make us happier. It's something that I know somewhere inside you, because I know you

525
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.110
Cynthia We: And so it's baffling as to why

526
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.080
Cynthia We: You know, and so, so

527
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:07.950
Cynthia We: A couple things.

528
00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:09.630
Cynthia We: So there's a

529
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:13.170
Cynthia We: When it

530
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:19.590
Cynthia We: When it's happened so much of being turned down to go do things. There's a

531
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:24.840
Cynthia We: Rejection comes in a little bit.

532
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel rejected.

533
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.040
Cynthia We: Like, you don't want to hang out with me on

534
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:32.820
Cynthia We: And probably after a while.

535
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.230
Cynthia We: I still ask but I probably asked less

536
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.610
Cynthia We: And I don't like that that direction.

537
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:54.810
Cynthia We: That I'll become complacent with you, just not wanting to do things and then I'll stop asking, and then we'll just be more support.

538
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Let's stop there.

539
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's refine it just tighten it with the I feel upfront.

540
00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel rejected somewhere in there when

541
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn not right that turned down keeps happening. And your prediction about the future. And I don't want to be complacency. If you can put that together. One more time. This is where you really listen, Cindy.

542
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.540
Cynthia We: When it comes I I feel a

543
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.390
Cynthia We: Certain amount of rejection.

544
00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:33.000
Cynthia We: I'm sadness that you might not want to hang out with me.

545
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.910
Cynthia We: And I'm afraid for that leaves, I'm afraid.

546
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.270
Cynthia We: The more that happens more that becomes normal

547
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.620
Cynthia We: So,

548
00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:58.140
Cynthia We: I'm you feel rejected when I'm declined go places with you.

549
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.330
Cynthia We: Here.

550
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.610
Cynthia We: And you're sad that maybe I don't want to hang out with you.

551
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.120
Cynthia We: And you're afraid of where that is.

552
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:13.470
Cynthia We: And I get that right.

553
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.360
Cynthia We: Yes, and I don't want to come normal afraid it's becoming

554
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.650
Cynthia We: Okay, great. That's because

555
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:28.020
Cynthia We: They get that right. Yeah. And isn't it covers the

556
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Last piece that you see if you can use your experience to validate him that's different than just mirroring. You did a great job. Let's see if you can do it with story.

557
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes sense to me that you would feel a certain rejection sadness and afraid that this is going to become you know you'll be complacent after turned down after turned down because you can pull a story.

558
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.030
Cynthia We: Make sense to me.

559
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking at him as much as you can.

560
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:09.090
Cynthia We: I noticed my notes. And then I look at it.

561
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.620
Cynthia We: It makes sense to me that you would feel rejected.

562
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.680
Cynthia We: And sad about

563
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:24.270
Cynthia We: This about me turning you down when you've asked me to go places.

564
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.040
Cynthia We: I'm

565
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:48.870
Cynthia We: Afraid that's becoming or will be normal becoming normal afraid that that's heading in that direction of normalcy that we just don't ever do anything together because I have turned you down a lot. I have decided not to do a lot of activities.

566
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.940
Cynthia We: For many reasons, but

567
00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

568
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: At the end, we're gonna right so pretty quickly, we run into. There's other pieces of this right we bumped into there's probably some reasons. And then we just did, they are. And so we decided to talk and we don't

569
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to pay attention to time a little bit to that a little bit of time left.

570
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's been sort of lopsided. So Cindy, why don't you

571
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you share if you can with Scott what today. Let me share with Scott what today has been like for you because you did the lion's share right of of this containing mirroring and validating what you share with them what this has been like not to whatever but to Scott

572
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:49.620
Cynthia We: And this has been nice. I feel actually

573
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:58.050
Cynthia We: That we are very aligned off in a lot of ways. I feel like we want the same things in a relationship.

574
00:55:59.460 --> 00:55:59.730
And

575
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.050
Cynthia We: I feel hopeful that we can

576
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.050
Cynthia We: I feel hopeful that we're not so far.

577
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And one more piece and Scott, it's hard to look at you.

578
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:30.060
Cynthia We: It's got it's hard to look at you. I'm sorry.

579
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

580
00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.350
Cynthia We: I'm not sure why it's hard to look at you.

581
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sorry for something you don't know why you're doing

582
00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Something going on. There's something

583
00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:46.170
Cynthia We: Oh, oh, oh, well, I feel. Yeah. Obviously.

584
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:47.130
Okay.

585
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not going to notice it's just what do I have to do. What do we have to do. We got to pick a flavor. We've got all these things that we could talk about all these things to do.

586
00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And we pick one and we write. We got to start somewhere. And so we started today. You let me take the lead and we did relationship vision. And you know what you guys have a lot in common.

587
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a lot in common.

588
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think Scott, can you tell Cindy, what this was like to hear her her

589
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell her.

590
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.180
Cynthia We: I

591
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.760
Cynthia We: Don't know if I'm surprised that we lined up.

592
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:37.860
Cynthia We: I'm

593
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.690
Cynthia We: It's good to recognize that we lined up.

594
00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:49.290
Cynthia We: A lot and that we're closer together on the spectrum. Maybe than we thought. Um,

595
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.650
Cynthia We: I'm glad that

596
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.680
Cynthia We: It makes me

597
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.980
Cynthia We: Hopeful to a degree.

598
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.330
Cynthia We: I don't know. I just hope we can

599
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.600
Cynthia We: Talk about more and apply it to our life. I don't know.

600
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:27.300
Cynthia We: Rather than just apply it to our therapy session. Yeah.

601
00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:28.860
Alright.

602
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice

603
00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott for you. Also, when you were sharing

604
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This you are having a hard time looking at her and Cindy, you are able to look at him and his cases down, you are looking right

605
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you know Scott that she was looking right at you when you were talking

606
00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.140
Cynthia We: A little bit, but I didn't notice that I wasn't

607
00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I get to, I'm a little fly on the wall right I'm staring at you. So I get to see that stuff.

608
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So Scott for you, maybe saying, and we can both and sort of in that same way. Cindy. It was hard for me. It's hard for me to look at you when I'm talking about these things because he maybe you know why. See if you can look at her and see if you can say that to her.

609
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:23.130
Cynthia We: I guess it's a little hard or uncomfortable look right at, you know, talking about this. I'm not sure why.

610
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:26.790
Cynthia We: I'm

611
00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure why. Both of you are not sure. Yeah. Okay. All right. And we had a little bit of arm crossing to there was a little bit of right even

612
00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, if you were aware of it, but you had you had a moment we kind of crossed over a little bit here. That's not our body kind of does that it's just sort of something important is going on.

613
00:59:49.200 --> 01:00:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um, let's step back and let's just sort of maybe what's next. What do you both maybe talk amongst yourselves. And I'll just stay quiet and maybe talk about what you want to do moving forward. We want to

614
01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:11.850
Cynthia We: Oh well, I want to keep trying to work on saying us when they

615
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.730
Do. Thank you.

616
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.030
Cynthia We: Except for asking.

617
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:24.510
Cynthia We: Um,

618
01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.440
Cynthia We: Can I ask why.

619
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.350
Cynthia We: Why you think it's hard to do.

620
01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:35.760
Cynthia We: Why

621
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:37.620
Cynthia We: Why do you think

622
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.740
Cynthia We: There's always

623
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:46.860
Cynthia We: Something more pressing

624
01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:04.350
Cynthia We: I have prioritized my kit ship Douglas because I'm I feel like I can never get anything done and I feel so

625
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:15.810
Cynthia We: discombobulated and off kilter because I have such a hard time completing things that the fun

626
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.790
Cynthia We: takes a backseat to get things done.

627
01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:24.690
Yeah.

628
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so my next clients here but listen to what you guys are doing. You guys are naturally continuing I would invite that why

629
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, that word, the concept of it is lovely. The word can create defensiveness, where we have to defend our position, I would invite open ended like

630
01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy act like a little therapist with each other. You know what makes it difficult for you to go skiing. What makes it difficult, what is the challenge. What's the barrier. That's kind of what us therapists use instead of why

631
01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's more open ended. And that's a lovely one for for for kind of thing. Okay, I can share, you know, Sydney went for it. Anyway, so

632
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.370
Hope you can hear.

633
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I i

634
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what y'all know about each other. But also, I'll just say it to you, Cindy. I'm impressed because you're protecting your need to you've got this fragile sense of organization accountability. You're finally getting the hang of it, you're like, oh,

635
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go. Right. If you, if anyone has any. If there's anything even close to those you know diagnoses have attention deficit.

636
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Disorder. If we have a deficit in the ability to attend that one flavor of ice cream.

637
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very difficult to hold on to it. And so with tenacity were like, I've got to protect this I finally said I was going to do this thing.

638
01:02:55.050 --> 01:03:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a hard thing to hold on to is to say, I'm going to stick with this this work this organization I finally did it so it's a hard thing for anyone who identifies with an add any, any kind of deficit around attention.

639
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Though, that's the piece I'm hearing right now is you're protecting your boundary. So it's not. I don't want to spend time with you it's

640
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Really got this commitment to myself and and there are some competing priorities. So, what I see is you really making sure you're protecting

641
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know some of your goals. Indeed, and and it does have an effect. But if you talk about that you keep this if I you guys log out and you keep this and you go to don't fall apart. Cindy, but instead, what you do is you talk about how important it is, it's so important to me.

642
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And really going into it. Because Scott, if you really mean that that you want her to open up and tell you why.

643
01:03:53.190 --> 01:04:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't be a setup for a slam that she doesn't have good reasoning. It has to be she's about to talk about something important to her. If you really want to know it's not to find the flaw in her feelings.

644
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You have yours. I want to play with her, she is she's fun mean who wouldn't want around

645
01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But and you maybe you know you miss hurt your feelings are real to they're not at the exclusion.

646
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what she's going through. They can coexist. They can be look really different. Two people can want really different things at the same time they're not bad. They're not wrong.

647
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We sort of lovingly do that because you both have this capacity to do that thing in here. I saw

648
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I want for you. Well, I happen to know to you value this. That's the one. It's not on this list but You both did it in various little items in here. You went well.

649
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I know she wants this thing about career. Whatever you did it. Scott, each of you did this thing where I want for the other

650
01:04:48.960 --> 01:05:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Use that skill right now hold space for each other and just talk about that tenderness of it. Hey, Cindy, you know, yours is i wanna i want to stick with what I said I was going to do. It's feeling good. I'm getting in my sense of agency.

651
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And Scott you're having one around.

652
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling rejected and you know there's no wrong. There's just this tender space, you guys.

653
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognize it if you if you don't go to that. There's no right way to do that. It's a loving containment, just listen and say, I get it. And there's no behavior change after that you just just this just, I get it, and then

654
01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Later later when they have. And there's this. It's the first we go. It's okay. I got you. It's just containment.

655
01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we feel like, okay, there is space for me to exist when I am different than my sweetheart, there's space for me here.

656
01:05:50.970 --> 01:06:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me guess what, like, Oh, you mean I have freedom. I have space. Well, maybe I could do some change but give it a little bit of time. Give it some days at least hours to let it just sit without asking for someone to change.

657
01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Okay. Text me. We want to meet again.

658
01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.790
Cynthia We: Okay, thank you. Quinn, which will

659
01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Be good to you right
