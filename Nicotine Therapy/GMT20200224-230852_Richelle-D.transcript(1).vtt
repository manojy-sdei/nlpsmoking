141
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:56.850
Brandon Haught: Yeah, it's a seasonal thing was me. So I have to just, I kept it on my own a document recommended I just told him seasonally, I might as the spring of us if it's all good. I'll probably go back down at 10 maybe just up it during the winter. So you might some early get real bad depression.

142
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.650
Brandon Haught: But now I'm going ok now the increase kind of helped

144
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.260

Brandon Haught: Because they added on demand so depressing years ago and I Manto depressant prescription ran out. So I was just taking the Abilify. And I said, well this works is fine by itself. So that's what they switched it to

149
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.830
Brandon Haught: These to do the antidepressant with it as a combination

150
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.990
Richelle Direny: Did you did talk therapy in the past.

151
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.940
Brandon Haught: Yeah, I still I've done counseling for a lot of different off and on throughout the years for 15 or since I was about

152
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:38.460
Brandon Haught: I want to say 2223 so about last 17 years of an offer on the counseling for a long time. I do see a counselor at Qwest where was receiving the Suboxone because I had to switch over from you guys to quest calm question caller now in Canton, Ohio, and

153
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:49.470
Brandon Haught: I liked your things better is is seem to be easier to do it from home, you have a group session where they didn't really have that you just had to go in and talk to the doctor. Now is it

154
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.290
Brandon Haught: For 10 minutes, you know,

155
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.690
Brandon Haught: Highlighted good idea how other people are doing on us of auction as well.

156
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:04.080
Brandon Haught: So I like the group. I'm not huge on talking during the group, but I like to see how other people are doing.

157
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.200
Richelle Direny: What is so there's a fear factor surrounded on having

158
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:12.510
Info

159
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:23.760
Brandon Haught: Not fear. Exactly. Is this not a big talker and is I'm short and brief another like good socialiser I'm not a social butterfly, you know,

160
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.760
Richelle Direny: Well, what's the difference in terms of

161
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:40.740
Richelle Direny: Socializing one in this case, you're in your own home, you're on a camera comparison to being sitting in a in a group setting where there's other people

162
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.450
Around you where you stand.

163
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:59.010
Brandon Haught: Well guess what, I got this way if I'd rather sit one on one with you in a room like a same room is where this be one on one. But when a group session. I like how it is on the camera thing. I like that better because you're not crowded and all of those people in the one room.

164
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:07.890
Richelle Direny: I know, I know. So, so looking for a person with social anxiety, they'll do a little bit better, one on one.

165
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:17.790
Richelle Direny: Um, they have a little bit more control as to what's going on. They're not having to focus on everybody else they're just focusing on the person in front of them. But then there's a

166
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:24.270
Richelle Direny: We have I'm comfortable to have to to be comfortable with just the

167
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:36.570
Richelle Direny: Person one on Lauren some wanting to you to be able to identify for you personally because for everyone who has some degree of social anxiety anxiety in general.

168
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:55.470
Richelle Direny: Hear what triggers their anxiety or what puts them in an uncomfortable uncomfortable spot. It's them. So I'm trying to establish what is unique to you that makes you uncomfortable, even in

169
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.470
Richelle Direny: A group setting, even if we're on

170
00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.250
Just

171
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.510
Brandon Haught: Just speaking, you know, I just always feel

172
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:11.910
Brandon Haught: I just know I just speak in front of people like public speaking of things I've done it before. I'm really good at. I have a real

173
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:25.290
Brandon Haught: baritone and and clear voice when I speak loudly or thoroughly and clearly people can hear me robot. I've always got a good report that I've read like Bible verses and shirts and stuff. And then all kinds of different things, but

174
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.820
Brandon Haught: I don't like to do it. It just makes you

175
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.230
You can't speak to a crowd.

176
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.520
Brandon Haught: I have I'm effective at it, but it is don't like to do it.

177
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:56.400
Richelle Direny: So, that's what. So I want you to think for a moment because to work through your anxiety to put you back in a social setting. Um, it's understanding what brings on that anxiety, understanding what brings on that level of whether it's is it

178
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.160
Richelle Direny: That discomfort.

179
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.600
Brandon Haught: Um,

180
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:06.630
Richelle Direny: And being able to put a name to it. Is it fear and what is the fear is it I'm

181
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.930
Richelle Direny: Sorry self doubt and what what what is making you doubt yourself in your ability

182
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.700
Richelle Direny: Is it

183
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:23.220
Richelle Direny: What what is, what is it just, I want you to think for a moment. Like, what is it, because until you're able to put a name and identify it.

184
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.540
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's something that you will always kind of struggling

185
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.580
Brandon Haught: Well,

186
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:40.110
Brandon Haught: It's just I always think people misinterpret me or don't understand, you know, because when I really speak I speak loud. You know, I'm really not like outspoken but um

187
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.780
Brandon Haught: I don't know how to explain it. I have a nice voice It carries a long way.

188
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:53.340
Brandon Haught: So you had a series, but it makes me nervous that I come off the wrong way to people like I'm I'm loud and boisterous or

189
00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:07.230
Brandon Haught: Over opinionated fairly intelligent I'm short and brief of things. And some people don't understand what I'm saying, or me, you know, I'm saying in certain settings but i don't i don't want to come across as arrogant or you know anything

190
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.760
Brandon Haught: You get straight suitable

191
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.910
Richelle Direny: You're very clear cut. Yeah, I'm now.

192
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.650
Brandon Haught: And I don't worry about people interpreting me wrong.

193
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.620
Richelle Direny: Now, I often like to kind of scale back a little bit. I often like to

194
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:29.820
Richelle Direny: Go back, way back kind of conscious like what we bury without realizing that we buried it, but

195
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:38.610
Richelle Direny: Excuse me, the things that's buried oftentimes is what affects our current position our state of mind our behavior.

196
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.080
Richelle Direny: When you were you did you have siblings.

197
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.280
Brandon Haught: Yeah, one brother is younger. He does very well from so

198
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.870
Brandon Haught: Okay. Yes, my two nephews. The boys I call

199
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.110
Richelle Direny: Oh, that's right, that's right. You did say that you have your, your young nephews that you'll go to their games or what have you.

200
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:10.260
Brandon Haught: Play it. Yeah, we can see them. The other day, we were we were we were all my parents were finishing moving out of their home, they've been in for 37 years in my brother and his family. Whoa, gets last bit of stuff Friday.

201
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.200
Richelle Direny: Now, when you think about when you were growing up, what was it like

202
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.310
Brandon Haught: Like

203
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.630
Richelle Direny: It was it where

204
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:29.850
Brandon Haught: It was it was torture, not for my parents were at school. I was, I'd be trembling in my shoes, thinking about having to read a line in a book that we're going around a circle reading, you know,

205
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.080
Brandon Haught: On a basketball game. I think I want to miss a shot, I'm gonna drop the ball. I want to screw up always nervous.

206
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:43.560
Richelle Direny: And what what what brought about that, even when you were younger. Is it that

207
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.640
Brandon Haught: I mean, I can't say what brought about naturally was nervous.

208
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.410
Richelle Direny: Now think about today as well.

209
00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:03.120
Brandon Haught: As we're kind of demanding somewhat they were there very good parents that they were demanding because they knew I could Excel said brains and athletic ability and they were they pushed me pretty hard.

210
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.890
Brandon Haught: So I was scared to fail for them to. I don't want to fail for them. And I was on my back to, you know,

211
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.500
Richelle Direny: You. They have great expectations for you.

212
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.060
Brandon Haught: Yes, it is. And once a failed miserably would have failed pretty good.

213
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.430
Richelle Direny: Now would you say that they were one who

214
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:33.870
Richelle Direny: They put a lot of pressure to some degree, about how you presented yourself how you spoke

215
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.980
Richelle Direny: Yes, where they overly critical to some

216
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.630
Brandon Haught: Yes.

217
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.280
Richelle Direny: About

218
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.080
Brandon Haught: Structured

219
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.940
Richelle Direny: You're very structured

220
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.350
Brandon Haught: Yes. And there's always things you described. I went through with them. Yes.

221
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.670
Richelle Direny: With your parents.

222
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:59.610
Richelle Direny: At home, and then did you go through that school as well. Whether it's the teachers because remember how you grew up, it's a

223
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:09.870
Brandon Haught: Fast different know my teachers love me. My teacher love me because I got I got usually got A's and B's I read. Listen to what I was taught it and misbehaving class.

224
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.450
Brandon Haught: I responded well to their authority or whatnot, and

225
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:17.790
Brandon Haught: I

226
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:30.660
Brandon Haught: Don't know. It's like, I want a teacher's pet. But I was a good student Jesus weren't critical of me. That is what I mean they try to bring out to me, my voice and try to get me to participate more negative way but in a positive way.

227
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:38.160
Richelle Direny: Now, when you were in school. So, so you're saying that, how, how it was for you in school.

228
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:53.640
Richelle Direny: Your teachers when you do so when you're dealing with people in authority, your teachers more supportive. They were more nurturing nurturing, they kind of pushed you to your true potential

229
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.040
Brandon Haught: Right. Yes.

230
00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:07.770
Richelle Direny: And home was it where you said this, your parents have a little bit more structure was it. Mom or Dad, that was more strict in your structure and

231
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.670
Brandon Haught: Kind of

232
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.740
Richelle Direny: Okay and so

233
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.390
Brandon Haught: They were good parents. They were Christian people what they were so structured with

234
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.620
Brandon Haught: Religion and

235
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:30.120
Brandon Haught: The discipline of how you do things in a structured and how you're supposed you do it this way, not you can't do. It's how you do it this way, like working and doing it this way or that way or whatever you want to do it. You know what I mean.

236
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:40.470
Richelle Direny: That now I want you to walk me through maybe something that stood out in your mind that you can remember walking me through that. Now again, and you telling me this.

237
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:50.820
Richelle Direny: Doesn't mean that they were bad parents, it doesn't mean that you know they were just, you know, emotionally abusive. It doesn't mean any of that.

238
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.930
Richelle Direny: I'm just saying. For me, your perspective in your mind.

239
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:18.480
Richelle Direny: Just walk me through something that stuck out in your mind to this day that you can remember in terms of their structure that may be converted into how critical. They were and just kind of their expectation of you, and even how you speak, how you presented yourself.

240
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.770
Brandon Haught: Just walk me through a moment.

241
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.530
Richelle Direny: That example. Yeah.

242
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:36.960
Brandon Haught: Like they'd always really like me to speak up, you need to, you know, look, being so quiet. You know, people talk to you. Don't just stand there, you know, go up to guys shake their hand be presentable.

243
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:47.340
Brandon Haught: I was just really backwards. I mean, they just encouraged me but if sometimes it was a little overwhelming. Some of me was like, you know, I'll do it. However, I wanted to try in the back of my mind.

244
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:55.080
Brandon Haught: You know, as a kid like Why keep telling me how to do something I want to do it my way. I don't want to talk. Well, why do I have to talk

245
00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.150
Brandon Haught: That's how I saw it.

246
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:04.350
Richelle Direny: So naturally, would you say would you describe yourself to be somewhat of a

247
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.920
Richelle Direny: shy, reserved person.

248
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.300
Brandon Haught: Yes, very much.

249
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.130
Richelle Direny: So you were naturally you were just always kind of shy, reserved person.

250
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:20.190
Richelle Direny: They kind of somewhat forced you to be opposite of that.

251
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:26.160
Brandon Haught: Yes. Well, they are successful, what they tried to

252
00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.400
Brandon Haught: Now around good I look at it back at it was for my own good, because they knew in the future would cause me problems.

253
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:43.350
Brandon Haught: And what I mean. They weren't like terrible was a dangerous. We're a little bit overly encouraging of it. But then the right to the exam so backwards. That is looked odd.

254
00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:57.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, it's one thing to be shy. It's one thing to be served. You know, everyone doesn't have the same personality. Everyone is not as outspoken arm full, they don't have a bold personality.

255
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:05.460
Richelle Direny: They don't have one talk to everyone. There's some people, that's a little bit more reserved, they're more they're more observant, um,

256
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:12.840
Brandon Haught: Yeah, my watch your I'm a people watcher more so I'll sit back and a food court and watch everybody winter going oh yes

257
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:26.130
Richelle Direny: Yes Oh everybody again everybody naturally has their own gifts and like I said, it's more outspoken more but like I'm a more bold outspoken friendly person, but that

258
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:41.400
Richelle Direny: Money, whereas your personality, more like you said you sit back, you're more observant, you know, you're not necessarily a talker, you'll probably listen to a little bit more

259
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.630
Richelle Direny: That's just your personality doesn't mean that it's a bad thing.

260
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:58.290
Richelle Direny: But often times just because we are the way we are. When we have children. We tried to make them.

261
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:14.100
Richelle Direny: Have the same personality as us without something to try to understand that child is uniquely them all we have to do is mold them into what who they are.

262
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.260
Richelle Direny: Just moment that that

263
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.580
Brandon Haught: Is not

264
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.060
Brandon Haught: Your best work. Yeah, they did their best. I guess for what

265
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.370
Brandon Haught: The skills they had in their skill set and

266
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.920
Brandon Haught: When they were never abusive or anything, you know, great.

267
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.900
Brandon Haught: We're not trolling though.

268
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.640
Richelle Direny: They were controlling

269
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:43.470
Richelle Direny: So for you, you do you think that because of your personality and who you were a more reserved quiet kind of

270
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.640
Brandon Haught: Off in the con

271
00:26:44.730 --> 00:27:00.750
Richelle Direny: Was kind of watching listening type of individual where your parents were a little bit different because you're talking about. I'm sure back in the 50s and the 60s, just kind of their style of parenting how they dealt with people how they did things was very different.

272
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.190
Brandon Haught: Shows. Yeah.

273
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.030
Richelle Direny: To be a little bit more respectful your. Yes, ma'am. You're sorry you say

274
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:13.800
Richelle Direny: Hello. Good afternoon. Yeah, you're and so when a child is not necessarily a representation of what they know.

275
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.350
Richelle Direny: Without trying to

276
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.740
Richelle Direny: Train the child without

277
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.360
Richelle Direny: forcing it up one then

278
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.830
Richelle Direny: The child becomes more and more reserved

279
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.130
Richelle Direny: And become more anxious and afraid to be around people simply

280
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.280
Brandon Haught: Afraid to make a mistake.

281
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:43.170
Richelle Direny: You're afraid to make a mistake, you are afraid if I speak, I might say the wrong thing, simply because of your

282
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.330
Richelle Direny: Just, just not being comfortable, not knowing how to speak.

283
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.040
Richelle Direny: So,

284
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:58.350
Richelle Direny: So in giving that example about trying to connect it back to your youth and kind of how

285
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:14.490
Richelle Direny: Kind of had some what sounded like a lot of the anxiety started from there and how you became so afraid of being around a lot of people, because being around people came with a lot of expectations.

286
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.870
Brandon Haught: Yes, yes.

287
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.060
Richelle Direny: What yourself and how you presented yourself.

Mm hmm.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.110
Richelle Direny: Do you think that it may

290
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.820
Richelle Direny: Did you think that it

291
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.970
Richelle Direny: For you more anxious

292
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.530
No.

293
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.240
Brandon Haught: That's okay.

294
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.780
Richelle Direny: I'm trying to put it in the right words in

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.270
Brandon Haught: A PC.

299
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.370
You became

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:04.200
Brandon Haught: Well, I was so reserve and it's never came to social I even like if I go out to parties, I drank and enjoy myself. I didn't say hardly ordered

302
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.800
Brandon Haught: Also backwards.

303
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.720
Brandon Haught: Lot of girls that were like to say things to colleges and and have the guts to do it.

304
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.600
Richelle Direny: Um, when, when did you start, what was your drug of choice.

305
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:46.560
Brandon Haught: I am I right in order and when alcohol to weed to loose genetics to cocaine pills to crack to heroin no esta

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.420
Richelle Direny: What was your introduction any

308
00:29:53.970 --> 00:30:01.620
Brandon Haught: Drinking his body had a sleep over and we were all going to drink, we're all excited. That would be cool thing is right at the end of my freshman year.

309
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:13.440
Brandon Haught: And I said, Okay, I'll man. And I remember I couldn't even open the bottle. They all popped him off. They're sitting there laughing at me. I'm like, you guys have a bottle opener and it goes a twist top twisted off.

310
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:23.850
Brandon Haught: So I didn't know any better. So I said there was mine on open for a minute. Then I know twist one off. But I absolutely love it. I was talking loving it.

311
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.680
Richelle Direny: So,

312
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.980
Richelle Direny: Oh, so the alcohol helps you to

313
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.590
Richelle Direny: Decrease the social anxiety and make you be

314
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:43.410
Brandon Haught: More ever the party. Yeah, I mean I didn't directly go to school or anything. I mean, no, no, guys. Did that I didn't know

315
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.010
Richelle Direny: You did it more. It started off as a

316
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.990
Brandon Haught: weekend warrior. I call it, I guess.

317
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.120
Brandon Haught: I went out every weekend.

318
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.920
Richelle Direny: Well, you did it to kind of help you out of your shell.

319
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:14.310
Brandon Haught: Yes. Yes, and I enjoyed and loved it because I could talk to girls. I could have fun. I was laughing having a blast the net to know everybody well to talk. I was outspoken my drink. Not bad. I mean, all of them noxious I just like olafur I like to laugh.

320
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:22.230
Richelle Direny: And so that one thing led to the next to the next. And next, and so

321
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.920
Brandon Haught: The other drugs weren't due to socialization, though.

322
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:30.750
Brandon Haught: It was the feeling they gave me mostly marijuana. I didn't like to still to this day.

323
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:42.420
Brandon Haught: It does take marijuana. I wouldn't want to take it by itself. I like to drink and then smoke because it gives you that Laughing You know, have the paranoia. You know what I mean.

324
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:51.360
Brandon Haught: Cocaine and when I first started, I was a social butterfly. At first, and then get kicked into the paranoia and the bad stuff and

325
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.260
Richelle Direny: Care for the cocaine by itself is

326
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:11.370
Brandon Haught: A I prefer to mix it mostly but I was instantly. I love that drug in sleep. My brain love that super high. I've always chased a super high where I took acid. It was just like I was on top of the world, like, wow, I mean,

327
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:21.480
Richelle Direny: So, you know, you just notice how you just connected all of the different drugs and what do you based on everything you just explain what is it on link back to

328
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.960
Brandon Haught: Back Your not wanting to be myself.

329
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.350
Richelle Direny: At all. In fact, two years of your anxiety.

330
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:29.970
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

331
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:36.300
Richelle Direny: You didn't feel anxious, then you were able to socialize, you were able to speak, you're able to laugh. You are able to come out of your shell.

332
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:43.350
Brandon Haught: That's what I mean when I didn't, I didn't, I didn't want to be myself without the drugs. I wouldn't just do that without using

333
00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:52.380
Brandon Haught: When using I could talk and have fun, like you're saying, but we're now using I didn't want to be myself. I'm scared. I was scared and myself, you're scared because you didn't

334
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.300
Richelle Direny: Know how to say it sounds. If you never really learned how to

335
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.550
Richelle Direny: Be an accept yourself and love yourself from

336
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.030
Yeah.

337
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.500
Richelle Direny: Sounds like you were always somewhat

338
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:15.510
Richelle Direny: Talk to live up to someone else's idea of what fun should be or what socialize. Enjoy.

339
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:20.970
Brandon Haught: Yeah. And the problem was I live with my parents, off and on, all the way up until about

340
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.540
Brandon Haught: Three years ago, four years ago.

341
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:33.990
Brandon Haught: So up until like 36 hours offered on their home, they always open the doors to me and me. My dad had argument that turned into could have ended up

342
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:41.520
Brandon Haught: Domestic violence because he had that you might have the cops and scare me. And he couldn't drop the charges state picked it up because of some I said he didn't like

343
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:52.560
Brandon Haught: And it became a verbal threat. I was in jail for a week on that and ended up this going down to a misdemeanor for disrupting the piece but

344
00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.060
Brandon Haught: Then finally, it was a good to bottom thought I just wish it didn't fall the way it did.

345
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.240
Brandon Haught: unforced error on good terms now but

346
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.350
Brandon Haught: I mean, he was discussing with me for a while.

347
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:15.540
Brandon Haught: But I mean, he had to write to me. I was under his roof going whatever I wanted. When I was never totally disrespectful.

348
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:24.300
Brandon Haught: Towards the end I was because I was just like, look, I could have been a lot of people in a small town and drug addicts as well lived at home with their parents and

349
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:30.750
Brandon Haught: They were just crazy silly moms cars credit cards do all kinds of stuff disrespect to home.

350
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:44.070
Brandon Haught: Just curse curse and swear to her mom, I never did that stuff. And then at the end, I kind of did it on purpose. A little bit like, look what I could have done. And again, I should be looking at. You could have kicked me out years ago I was being selfish.

351
00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.650
Brandon Haught: Kind of justify. Well, look, I could behave myself and do drugs, but

352
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:58.170
Brandon Haught: I still do drugs and didn't get enough for my own to live on. I always had a job and stuff, but at least I spent on drugs.

353
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.990
Richelle Direny: So do you. Um, did you

354
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.900
Richelle Direny: Like what you had become with the drugs.

355
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:19.440
Brandon Haught: No, I hated myself about late when I told you about 20 years old right for turned 21 you got to do you I was stuck in the house.

356
00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:30.210
Brandon Haught: I began to hate myself for what I created I created a legend a monster, a guy you know he's depart seem to the party, he's Mr party and

357
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.310
Brandon Haught: I didn't really well so young, as an age where you're in college and you're supposed to pre party and

358
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:45.780
Brandon Haught: Like pretty much harder to myself out by 20 years old, I had been at the bars already and stuff I snuck into them drink and there was nothing new to me and

359
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:59.190
Brandon Haught: All my friends were party and our time and I would shy away. Let it come back for a couple parties and you're shutting me, you know. So I felt I had no friends because I wasn't around enough a consider me an outcast. I was too good for them.

360
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.470
Brandon Haught: Because I was actually doing the right thing.

361
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:09.120
Richelle Direny: So do you think that you were only accepted by the group of friends, you had

362
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.810
Richelle Direny: Only when you were

363
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.450
Richelle Direny: High or you were under the influence of some type of

364
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.850
Brandon Haught: Moshe more time, please. I said,

365
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.060
Richelle Direny: Where are you only accepted by your peer group at the time.

366
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.200
Brandon Haught: Because, oh no no it wasn't because of that they

367
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:52.560
Brandon Haught: They showed me a moment there's actually like I wasn't skits. Oh, and I was a nut know wacko anyone else to do with the actual like talk behind my back some of the better friends told me that they're all just like trash mouth and me for whatever reason they

368
00:36:54.390 --> 00:37:03.810
Brandon Haught: kind of hit my peak at 20th and I went down slope fast and then they all fail fell off with all my so called friends. They weren't friends without the drugs now ball.

369
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it goes back to the questions they weren't really your friends without the drugs and alcohol.

370
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.620
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

371
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.680
Richelle Direny: With the drugs and alcohol you guys were cool

372
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.270
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

373
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:23.220
Richelle Direny: Because you are, you're, you're, you fat you fit into the what they thought was cool. And normally

374
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:29.190
Brandon Haught: I'm saying even shun me out of their group of using drugs and alcohol. I'd go to the party. And it was treated like an all cash.

375
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:40.830
Brandon Haught: Or you get a new guy or some, but there was guys didn't party in high school that were party. And then in college or treat me like I'm a new guy like I did a separate is 13 years old. This is not new to me.

376
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.190
Richelle Direny: Was it no longer wanted to be a part of that lifestyle but just wanted to maintain

377
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:58.350
Brandon Haught: Yeah, I didn't, I didn't agree with their points of us. I was in a small town. There's a lot of racism. There's a lot of bad stuff in part of yours and jokes and things that I didn't agree with

378
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:08.010
Brandon Haught: And guys, is denying we didn't see it at all. And I didn't fit, but had nowhere else to go to. And I wanted to party. So I don't know what to do so.

379
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:20.970
Brandon Haught: My mind has got Bram sacked with just plus I was out of my mind a little bit from all the drugs. I did like 60 hits acid. I'm legally insane seven times over more

380
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:29.370
Brandon Haught: Back in the 60s called legally insane. He did six to 10 has acid will push me seven times over the lemon

381
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.430
Brandon Haught: So now you're saying

382
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:43.290
Richelle Direny: We go on Saturday. So now you so after you kind of lost that group of friends you so what retreated into kind of just being by yourself.

383
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:53.190
Brandon Haught: Well, I had girlfriends and stuff. So I just would stay with them mostly would they want to change me like you're not supposed to party at all. And I wanted to have both.

384
00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.120
Brandon Haught: You know, I mean, I wanted to girlfriend and I want a party to so I always did.

385
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.410
Richelle Direny: So you became addicted to

386
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:14.940
Brandon Haught: Alter Ego. I guess I was due to the alter ego. I was addicted to the persona that I created at the party or get together.

387
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.610
Brandon Haught: And then I was addicted to that.

388
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:24.450
Richelle Direny: we're addicted to that and the drugs help you with that addiction to this persona this ultra

389
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:25.740
Brandon Haught: Oh, yeah.

390
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.920
Brandon Haught: Yeah, sure. Managers made it worse.

391
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.420
Richelle Direny: It made it worse.

392
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:45.810
Brandon Haught: The reggae you know cycle goes you use anything you numb yourself or your dollar pay and you remember you forget however you do it. And next thing you know you found 10 times worse when I hang on. We're comes in or the withdrawal.

393
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:53.700
Richelle Direny: So then, so then the real you have to come back at some point. So it's kind of like I pause the real me for a moment. I know the real need for a

394
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.250
Richelle Direny: Moment kind of Sir come to an answer to this alter ego to this other

395
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:11.220
Richelle Direny: This other person that I think I want to be that my mind has created which the reality is this other person doesn't tell me you're going to have a hard fall after this hi wears off.

396
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.870
And you're going, right, yeah.

397
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:19.440
Brandon Haught: Yeah, it's a depression, anxiety and does not feeling well by yourself.

398
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:30.510
Brandon Haught: But ever since 20 I haven't had a real sense of person. I'm starting to get a better sense of person, the last few years. They had no sense of being a person. I mean,

399
00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.390
Richelle Direny: So in

400
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.980
Brandon Haught: My personal

401
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:43.500
Brandon Haught: My personal you know that my synchronization of myself. So I took psychology is a minor and I psychoanalyze myself to death.

402
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.130
Brandon Haught: So I did. I sit around I psychoanalyze myself.

403
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:48.990
Brandon Haught: Would you destroy myself.

404
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.150
Richelle Direny: No, not a good thing you

405
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.800
Brandon Haught: Know,

406
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:57.570
Richelle Direny: They always tell you not to do that, we often do that once you start learning. Yeah.

407
00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:04.950
Brandon Haught: I'm gonna I'm my own worst enemy. I realized that a long time ago now starting to try to be my own best friend. Again, try and do that.

408
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.290
Richelle Direny: And how do you try to do that.

409
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.850
Brandon Haught: Just focus and try to find a positive and each day is I'm good, rather than something negative.

410
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:16.590
Richelle Direny: You love yourself.

411
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.830
Brandon Haught: Not as much as I should.

412
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:32.910
Brandon Haught: So you know I people and girlfriends and friends and families here. GOOD guy You're a nice looking guy, what's wrong. Well, like myself, I don't know why. To me, I'm a monster. What else I'm a nice guy.

413
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.020
Richelle Direny: Did you love yourself well for the drugs.

414
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:49.050
Brandon Haught: Now as always second guess myself and I'm not good enough. I'm not, I'll do some wrong perfectionist. Do it one things out of place the whole things out of place.

415
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:50.580
Oh, your

416
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.110
Personality

417
00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:04.920
Brandon Haught: No, I wouldn't say that it's just perfectionist. I'm not the type to open a door shut the door 10 times or do something 20 times you think

418
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.290
Richelle Direny: There's a personality piece to the OCD.

419
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.960
Brandon Haught: Okay, and the

420
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.510
Richelle Direny: Personality piece, the P is for the perfection.

421
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.140
Richelle Direny: It's a personality trait.

422
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.160
Brandon Haught: Okay, well, yeah, that way I could agree with that.

423
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's a personality trait not

424
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.780
Brandon Haught: Not SAS was perfection. I guess I would say

425
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.530
Richelle Direny: Everything has to be a certain way and you kind of

426
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:38.490
Richelle Direny: Crazy. If it's not like it has to be perfect. And if it's in the end, no matter what anybody else tell you know it's not perfect and I gotta do it this way. And so you start obsessing

427
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.600
Richelle Direny: Over whatever it is that you're doing. So you need it to be.

428
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:51.720
Brandon Haught: Yeah, and oftentimes I can't figure out what it is, is if someone goes past me and I'm like, what did it, what went wrong why this, why don't I feel right. Why is this this way.

429
00:42:52.110 --> 00:43:00.450
Brandon Haught: Why can I get it right and I'm lazy to I'm a sleeper. So my excuses. Oh, lay in bed all day and expect to wake up to be happy. It's not going to happen.

430
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:02.490
Richelle Direny: Um,

431
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.780
Richelle Direny: He likes to have a sense of control at all times.

432
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:20.970
Brandon Haught: To some degree, I've learned a lot, just let things go and not worry so much as to worry about every little thing. And then I got as I got older and kind of just let a lot of things like this is the way it goes, I don't know what else to do.

433
00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:35.610
Richelle Direny: But have you know your thing. Have you allowed yourself to let things go and understand that there's some things you have no control over.

434
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:47.430
Brandon Haught: Yeah, I've learned the jet better to let things. There's like the Serenity Prayer have learned a lot. It was driven in my head. A and I really appreciate that prayer.

435
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:58.740
Richelle Direny: So for you, what do you identify that is something that can help you with. So I think one of the things that

436
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:05.700
Richelle Direny: We can work on in terms of identifying and we can share your

437
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.630
Richelle Direny: Depression and anxiety because, you know, same kind of

438
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:22.110
Richelle Direny: Well, I think we can work on learning how to accept who you are right now.

439
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.060
Brandon Haught: Yeah, I got to

440
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:33.090
Richelle Direny: But what are some things that you can do to learn how to what is one thing that we can that you can work on

441
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.940
Richelle Direny: To make it a daily habit. What is one thing that you can

442
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:53.190
Brandon Haught: Just wake up and try and go search a day off and try to find one positive thing after another, at least one positive thing and come up with at the moment, any more time and you know it in time.

443
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.610
Richelle Direny: That's it. That's it. That's all you need to work on right now.

444
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:02.130
Richelle Direny: And then, and then you see just how successful or unsuccessful, you are

445
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:08.580
Brandon Haught: Yeah, for any of those moments. Yeah, you're finding those things or whatever you want to call it.

446
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:21.240
Richelle Direny: Because basically why I kind of asked you a lot of those those series of questions, leading from childhood to now, a lot of that stems. It sounds like a lot of that stems from trauma, because oftentimes

447
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah, like you said,

448
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:31.620
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes we parent or we do things based on how our parents do

449
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:38.880
Richelle Direny: And it's not to say that they had, they just, they kind of learn as they went

450
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:52.620
Brandon Haught: Well, see, I tried to stray away from their way of doing things, they're more republican patriotic and different style, you know, and I'm more democratic, more educated style and

451
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.800
Richelle Direny: What do it, but then you know what that's that's what we

452
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.790
Brandon Haught: And I was in their home does I'm trying to tell you I was in their home so I couldn't

453
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:08.550
Brandon Haught: This is how I'm going to do it and their home so many times I went back there to that and I couldn't never break free to just do it how I wanted to

454
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:29.700
Richelle Direny: But they see this is the NC. That's where kind of a lot of us we run into issues. And that's not being were dissatisfied with our own self. And then we get into this super and then we're Frozen stuff, to some degree, and we become depressed because we're trying so hard to do it the opposite.

455
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.660
Of yeah

456
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:37.920
Richelle Direny: But this is the reality of it and tell me if I'm wrong. Um, but

457
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.470
Richelle Direny: As you you said every time you talks about them. You always

458
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.310
Brandon Haught: In this

459
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.660
Brandon Haught: But they were good parents

460
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:45.870
Brandon Haught: And

461
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.190
Richelle Direny: You know they did it the best

462
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:48.150
Brandon Haught: Way they knew how to

463
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.800
Richelle Direny: So there's a part of you.

464
00:46:50.310 --> 00:47:05.100
Richelle Direny: That have come to accept and appreciate a lot of their parenting style. There are things along the way that you can tweak or you would say, you know what I would do this a little bit different.

465
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.360
Brandon Haught: Because I

466
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.610
Richelle Direny: Was forced to do something that I was uncomfortable with based on my personality.

467
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:12.780
Yes.

468
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:26.550
Richelle Direny: So identifying that those things. It's not to completely do the complete opposite of them but identify those individual character traits.

469
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.070
Brandon Haught: That that's pretty much what I'm trying to do.

470
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:38.400
Brandon Haught: Because they give me a lot of good morals and values being Christian people and my dad was a recovering alcoholic since I was three. He stopped drinking. I was three years old. My brother was born.

471
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:44.520
Brandon Haught: So he set a good example. With that, especially for me trying to get into sobriety. He's set a great example with that.

472
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.500
Brandon Haught: And what did he do things, but

473
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:48.090
Brandon Haught: Huh.

474
00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.080
Richelle Direny: What did he

475
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.630
Brandon Haught: He went from the bottle to Christ.

476
00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.700
Richelle Direny: And how did he do that.

477
00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:07.830
Brandon Haught: He got into Christianity. You didn't go the wrong he got a guy worked at witness to him an older guy kind of mentored him and short time about Christianity and he fell into that route never went back

478
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.050
Richelle Direny: And how did he lived his life daily

479
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:17.640
Brandon Haught: Well, he's a hard worker. He worked and worked and worked, he go to work, work, come home and do work.

480
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:20.100
Brandon Haught: They work. They work himself.

481
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.180
Brandon Haught: To death, one day.

482
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:24.150
Richelle Direny: Praying and reading his Bible part of

483
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:30.660
Brandon Haught: He does that in the morning and at night. Yeah, he does. He does journal or not devotions journals and stuff.

484
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.350
Brandon Haught: And did he study different interpretations of the Bible and things

485
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:41.370
Richelle Direny: And did he kind of incorporated that into the family into that. Like it was an expectation of everyone in the home.

486
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:50.550
Brandon Haught: Yes, I wasn't forced to be a Christian. I chose it when I was about 10 or 11 I was conscious of what I was doing. I look at it as

487
00:48:51.120 --> 00:49:00.240
Brandon Haught: And then I was going to school. I was so happy I felt a feeling of accepting Christ I was young, I was a little young to be doing it, but

488
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:08.880
Brandon Haught: I knew what I was doing and I was happy about it. Once the school was telling people that they all made fun of me. So, next thing you know, I go the opposite route from the teenage years.

489
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:17.160
Brandon Haught: And I'm rebelling against all things Christianity and that's what I'm drinking and using rebellion was a lot of my problem.

490
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:18.360
So,

491
00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:25.290
Richelle Direny: That's that's natural and the reason why I'm asking that Brandon, because when it's all said and done,

492
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.050
Richelle Direny: When you look at

493
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.800
You look at your father's life and

494
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:38.640
Richelle Direny: My father went from the bottle on one minister to him. Someone disciple to

495
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:53.220
Richelle Direny: Someone I mean granted the, the core of a it's Christianity. If you really read it and if you follow it and what the path that is taking that's the core of it, it's biblical.

496
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:54.960
Brandon Haught: Hmm.

497
00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:00.750
Richelle Direny: I mean, over the years, and people have tweaked it and they kind of put their own spin and twist to it, but that's the core of

498
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:01.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but

499
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.850
Richelle Direny: But you're saying that your father went from

500
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.820
Richelle Direny: being addicted to alcohol.

501
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.440
Richelle Direny: Because of his own life experiences and crisis.

502
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.820
Brandon Haught: Here went through.

503
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.650
Richelle Direny: At some point in time.

504
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.090
Richelle Direny: Someone disciple team each homes.

505
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:39.030
Richelle Direny: Will Savior and he kind of follow that rep throughout his life he brought that home to his family without forcing you guys to be a part of that. But he kind of set the path of a where, that's where your morals and values came from.

506
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:49.140
Richelle Direny: Huge live this life based on what was being modeled in your home based on what they were your parents were learning throughout life.

507
00:50:50.070 --> 00:51:09.570
Richelle Direny: You tried to model that but without necessarily one what I'm hearing you say without necessarily getting the true foundation on your own and having the boldness of spirit to go out there and stand on your end, having a fun foundation for yourself.

508
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:10.800
Richelle Direny: Yes minutes

509
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:22.650
Brandon Haught: In here. Yeah, I didn't hit rock bottom and do it. I just found it as a kid I wanted, I felt the feelings went back to the back of the church it Vacation Bible School and adult except Christ.

510
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:31.710
Richelle Direny: So then what you needed is after accepting Christ was just like your dad someone to disciple useful out

511
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:43.710
Brandon Haught: Oftentimes we tried. He tried to disciple me very much. So it was not without over pushing it, you know, but it was church was mandatory whether I said no, or not, but

512
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:56.790
Brandon Haught: He the disciple leads by example was and he tried to teach me anything could about Christ anytime I would listen but I chose to reject it, doesn't my teenagers. What I'm saying I just rejected it. Yeah.

513
00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:02.910
Richelle Direny: You get rejected as a teenager when you now go out there and you try to share your faith with other people.

514
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:06.720
Brandon Haught: But remember why I totally denied it almost by teenage years.

515
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.980
Richelle Direny: After you were made fun of is what you said. After you

516
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.060
Richelle Direny: What, then, we had before.

517
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:22.560
Brandon Haught: Going, I was like a Peter during the Peter and the buy in the New Testament, they denied Christ three times. Right.

518
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.150
Richelle Direny: But remember, you're not remember Peter had a years of being disciples

519
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:34.650
Richelle Direny: Yes, started Peter only denied Christ when he felt his life was going to be

520
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.420
Brandon Haught: Here for his wife. Yeah. Yes.

521
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:36.930
Richelle Direny: That was

522
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:40.410
Brandon Haught: That was scared of my popularity being taken out.

523
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.510
Richelle Direny: We're afraid of your popularity

524
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:43.860
Brandon Haught: So then

525
00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.450
Richelle Direny: For you it's

526
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.570
Richelle Direny: Now you're recognizing, listen, everything is all about being aware

527
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.480
Richelle Direny: Everything is all about me.

528
00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.820
Richelle Direny: So with the able to identify that

529
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.170
Brandon Haught: Sure it's talking my kid.

530
00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:08.490
Richelle Direny: But I'm being able to identify all of that. Where do you stand now you

531
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:09.750
Richelle Direny: Are

532
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:14.430
Brandon Haught: A lot more spiritual, especially in the last probably three or four years.

533
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:29.370
Brandon Haught: And I just got to where I actually created Christ this year, not long ago for Old Testament star, I believe there was a creator wasn't sure if Christ is the high priest or not.

534
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:37.590
Brandon Haught: Read Hebrews and looked at him as the High Priest version and it made sense to me. He's the judge. He's the jury and executioner.

535
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:49.710
Brandon Haught: Whether he people say it's the Trinity. He's the same as God. Well, I don't know what he thought of and his life already predicted it exactly how it happened when God created the world.

536
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:59.280
Brandon Haught: They try to say he was just a I think he was a piece of God's DNA. We know inject injected into Mary. However, they did it with

537
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:05.850
Richelle Direny: When you get caught up into those fine. I think when you get caught up, then you get

538
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.650
Brandon Haught: Your big thinker on it. Yeah.

539
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:13.320
Richelle Direny: But you get lots of there. Sometimes we get so distracted and you get lost.

540
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:18.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because you're trying to find out the little girls.

541
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:29.190
Richelle Direny: Yeah, well, then if I was created, how was he able to create me like this and then if he did create me like this, then what did he do, and then if he did that. Okay, well, you're missing the whole

542
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:29.700
Brandon Haught: Yes.

543
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:35.520
Richelle Direny: Now you're trying to go. Our minds are not capable of understanding the vast

544
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.410
Brandon Haught: Yes, no, no.

545
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:42.330
Richelle Direny: You're not and we get so caught up in trying to understand

546
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.240
Brandon Haught: Yes, yeah.

547
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:54.540
Brandon Haught: Is this a try to win it. That's right. I don't, I don't believe in religion. I believe in spirituality. I don't like going to church and say this is how it is because so and so, interpreted this way.

548
00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:05.910
Brandon Haught: That doesn't mean that I can turn it in a totally different way and still believe the same thing that Christ is going to be one day, God would create deserve and Holy Spirit protect me. I can believe that without having to do anything.

549
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.790
Richelle Direny: But, but for you. It's

550
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.510
Richelle Direny: Already starting with, I think, you know,

551
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.220
Richelle Direny: Again, when you look at what

552
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:26.970
Richelle Direny: What what became the catalyst of change for your dad and kind of following that path.

553
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.340
Brandon Haught: It's just identifying those

554
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:39.810
Richelle Direny: Little things that you would say, you know what, well, maybe the way my parents did this, maybe I would tweak just that, that instead of trying to tweak the whole thing.

555
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.180
Richelle Direny: It's just a one thing

556
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:43.800
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

557
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:51.180
Richelle Direny: That's all we don't need to go reinventing the wheel. We just need to just one little, that's all. It's just one little

558
00:55:51.240 --> 00:56:00.870
Brandon Haught: I know I have a problem. Sometimes it is day of trying to get a free again just to reinvent the whole wheel and I shouldn't like you're saying, I'm really shouldn't take it too far.

559
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:07.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah, don't, don't reinvent the wheel, because when it's all said and done, you still have a whole lot of positive things to say about your parents.

560
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.660
Richelle Direny: You said that your use it. They were loving, they did the things the best you

561
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:12.960
Brandon Haught: Name it

562
00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:13.710
Out.

563
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:36.510
Richelle Direny: And you said, you know, dope. It was an optional for me not to go to church. It was a half to what I also wasn't forced into believing God in this higher power. I came to that on my own. Because of that, saying, hey, listen, you'll have to accept God but you gotta go church.

564
00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.520
Brandon Haught: Yeah, and

565
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:44.400
Richelle Direny: You continuously attending you started saying, Oh, okay. Well, it's kind of like, listen.

566
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.100
Richelle Direny: You gotta go to school.

567
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.810
Richelle Direny: Because guess what can we being there eventually you're gonna learn something eventually

568
00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:52.830
Brandon Haught: You learn something.

569
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.710
Richelle Direny: Yeah, eventually you're going to buy into something

570
00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:57.330
And that's kind of what yeah

571
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.400
Richelle Direny: Instead of reinventing the wheel. It's identifying

572
00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.110
Richelle Direny: You know,

573
00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:07.200
Richelle Direny: Little things that you would change.

574
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:11.220
Richelle Direny: And and really, really.

575
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.920
Richelle Direny: Being said I'm going to change shouldn't really be changed, am I

576
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:17.790
Brandon Haught: Overlooking it

577
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:21.450
Richelle Direny: Looking at it way too deep, that I really need to be looking at

578
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.920
Brandon Haught: Yeah, I do that I am a deep thinker very philosophical very spiritual

579
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:34.470
Brandon Haught: I think overthink things I think into deep like you're saying I going too deep.

580
00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.180
Brandon Haught: Into this

581
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:49.410
Richelle Direny: But I think starting off with, like you said, like we talked about in the group every day. Start off with what do you appreciate and what are you thankful about you.

582
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.050
Richelle Direny: What do you like about

583
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:57.600
Brandon Haught: I appreciate it. I'm on my own, or not a burden to my parents anymore.

584
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.150
Richelle Direny: Are they still alive.

585
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:09.060
Brandon Haught: Yes. Yeah, brother, his mood member I was trying to, they, they just moved from the house had been at 37 years ago to my uncle's for the moment.

586
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:17.430
Brandon Haught: They're looking into a new house. They sold it very high nice price may sold close parents house dollars so they're going to have another nice home in a big account.

587
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:30.120
Brandon Haught: They did well for retirement and he invested in a lot of things in a retirement accounts and so security plus stuff yet at the river plus stuff is high. Oh, state.

588
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:36.690
Brandon Haught: Tax stuff. I mean, he's they're going to be very well have a nice retirement.

589
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:44.610
Brandon Haught: But they're so I understand. Try to be on my own and not bother them too much of them enjoying life. Don't be a burden.

590
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.840
Richelle Direny: So then, so today you're grateful for living on your own.

591
00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:50.790
Brandon Haught: For being able to me. Listen.

592
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:59.280
Brandon Haught: I'm grateful to my spirituality I denied Christ and God for a long time, and it wasn't a Satanist or anti christ fan, but I was

593
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.890
Brandon Haught: I don't know, I just

594
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:02.580
Richelle Direny: Figure it out.

595
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:06.060
Brandon Haught: We existed in the back of my mind I knew he was still there, but at the same time.

596
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:07.710
Brandon Haught: I live as if he didn't exist.

597
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.370
Richelle Direny: And then you got to the point where you're like, Oh, well, you guys.

598
00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:17.100
Brandon Haught: Yes. I mean, unfortunately methamphetamines brought me to that point when I was using those

599
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:18.840
Brandon Haught: They

600
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:23.430
Brandon Haught: It's just my mind was asleep for like 10 years

601
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:38.700
Brandon Haught: And then I woke up one day for 15 years or whatever about 40 Africa amount of years because I was addicted to ecstasy and many things that veteran and back then, which is what they make shake and bake with today with the user Sudafed for a veteran.

602
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:55.020
Brandon Haught: evergreen. I think they call it. So I was addicted. I went office that my brain went to sleep for like 14 years and I one day I woke up and I was like, wow, but so lean towards the devil, a shot and pursued so many years. I went towards the Christ said I left behind.

603
00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:09.180
Brandon Haught: And I'm not giving credit to drugs to find God again. But I just, I'm so happy I found them again and I just need to start being more praying and I start praying and praying so Lord I pray now and

604
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.150
Brandon Haught: It's just amazing.

605
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.550
Richelle Direny: Well, so let's just on, you know, like you said, just on I'm

606
01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.090
Richelle Direny: Just being able to identify

607
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:27.210
Brandon Haught: Yeah, you

608
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:30.060
Richelle Direny: Appreciate about yourself, loving yourself.

609
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:31.200
Brandon Haught: That's what's

610
01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:33.300
Important

611
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:38.280
Richelle Direny: Just start there. And then, you know,

612
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.120
Yeah.

613
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:49.590
Richelle Direny: Like you said, You are not necessarily you're not religious but you're more spiritual where it's more about learning

614
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.470
Richelle Direny: Well, God is for yourself. Right.

615
01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.320
Brandon Haught: Yeah, that's exactly, yeah.

616
01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.310
Richelle Direny: So continue on that path and but I think through

617
01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:01.800
Richelle Direny: First loving yourself.

618
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.630
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

619
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.590
Brandon Haught: I got to

620
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:09.900
Richelle Direny: Identifying the things that you each day. One thing at least one thing

621
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:11.640
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

622
01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:12.720
Crime

623
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:18.360
Richelle Direny: That you like about yourself and then we can talk about it during our next session.

624
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.160
Brandon Haught: Okay, let me write that down. Like every day, write something down

625
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:23.910
Yeah.

626
01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.880
Brandon Haught: We got a little journal. I keep you guys and stuff in this little thing.

627
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.450
Richelle Direny: So,

628
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:43.950
Richelle Direny: There's, there's that scripture that says that we must love others as we love ourselves.

629
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:46.110
Brandon Haught: Yeah.

630
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.100
But then

631
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:58.530
Richelle Direny: The question that, how can you love someone else if you don't really, how can I love someone that's how I love myself when I really don't like myself. I love myself.

632
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:05.640
Brandon Haught: As a writer. You can can have any good relationships either racing goes right window every so often line.

633
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:15.570
Richelle Direny: If you have like if you have your girlfriend, your parents who brought up. Okay. Um, I love you as I love myself but then I really don't love myself. So how am I really gonna love you.

634
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:21.420
Brandon Haught: Right, you're exactly right. I suffer with that I've thought about it that way before to a lot

635
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.090
Richelle Direny: So maybe that's another thing. So two things, identify each something that you're

636
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.800
Brandon Haught: You're you

637
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:31.650
Richelle Direny: Like about yourself, where you appreciate for the day.

638
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:40.770
Richelle Direny: And between now and once again it's understanding that love others as you love yourself.

639
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.820
Brandon Haught: What does that mean,

640
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:50.160
Richelle Direny: What does that look like for you because then I think the depth of that will come from you doing now self, you're going to do.

641
01:02:50.880 --> 01:03:02.580
Richelle Direny: Go internally and search yourself and ask your question why I love myself and why don't I love myself and kind of all those things now. And when we meet again, we'll talk about

642
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:14.490
Brandon Haught: Funny thing is a habit I might my restroom that other verses says love us. Love one another as I have loved you. The other one, the opposite. I had a Bible verse same similar but

643
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:19.020
Richelle Direny: You what then you understand how much God loves

644
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:27.510
Brandon Haught: I understand here. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Then I understand that he's he's gonna forgive me if I ask for forgiveness of our sins have ever done.

645
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.040
Brandon Haught: What you want to love.

646
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.640
Richelle Direny: What

647
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:36.930
Richelle Direny: Is the statement you made love yourself as I have loved you love others as I have loved you.

648
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:38.310
Brandon Haught: You under

649
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.870
Richelle Direny: How much He loves you.

650
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.080
Brandon Haught: Yeah, I understand. His where I need to find that love and endorsed anyway so

651
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:50.400
Richelle Direny: So the both of them are gonna work hand in hand.

652
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.260
Brandon Haught: If you understand how much

653
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.330
Richelle Direny: You how much

654
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:58.920
Brandon Haught: About diverse. You just told me that's what really but they were similar versa. I thought I'd bring that up.

655
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:05.370
Brandon Haught: And I hadn't thought of it the way you presented it love myself love others about myself.

656
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:06.630
Yeah.

657
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:14.220
Richelle Direny: There were three things love others as you love yourself believe in God.

658
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.020
Richelle Direny: I'm

659
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:20.910
Richelle Direny: Believe in God, as I can't think of it, all right now. But you know when you start to think

660
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:33.240
Richelle Direny: But then, but that one about love others as you love yourself, but do you love yourself. And if you don't love yourself, it's going to be hard for you to love someone

661
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.800
Brandon Haught: Else. Right.

662
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.560
Richelle Direny: But if you understand how much he loves you.

663
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:47.190
Richelle Direny: You now say if you love me this much. Why can't I love myself so that I can turn around and love others.

664
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.330
The same way, man.

665
01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:54.600
Brandon Haught: You're right. That makes sense, where you're putting in for presenting it are you presenting it

666
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.930
Richelle Direny: That's definitely something to think about into process.

667
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:04.920
Richelle Direny: And as you say your analytical thinker. I want you to think about and process all of that until we meet again what's

668
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:07.980
Brandon Haught: OK, next one.

669
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:11.970
Brandon Haught: Okay.

670
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:22.350
Richelle Direny: Let's do the 16th at six o'clock.

671
01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:24.900
Brandon Haught: Okay.

672
01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:26.970
Richelle Direny: Giving you

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:28.350
Brandon Haught: That another Monday.

674
01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:38.760
Brandon Haught: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I like to start out to leave with something to do, especially because I'm a one day zero days off. So I like to have something to do on Mondays. I'm very lazy on Mondays.

675
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:42.780
Brandon Haught: I lay in bed. Lot of my day in bed all day to day till three o'clock.

676
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:51.180
Richelle Direny: I think because my schedule is getting filled up really quickly. I'm starting, I noticed that I'm making all my point. And so far out and I would like to really follow up.

677
01:05:51.540 --> 01:06:01.140
Richelle Direny: A little quicker than that, but I'm going to learn how to work this calendar so I can automatically plug everybody in every other week, or for what how I want them to login

678
01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:01.980
Brandon Haught: Okay.

679
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.690
Richelle Direny: Let's not push that so far. Well, we'll see each other on Thursday. Okay.

680
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:13.770

774
01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.760
Abdikes: I'm sorry. Go ahead, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Well, we

775
01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.440

Abdikes: Like 1516

777
01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.340
Richelle Direny: And what brought you to this point where you said you wanted to

778
01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.750
Richelle Direny: You just want to get sober and kind of start your journey.

779
01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:37.770
Abdikes: And like, probably, like, a year ago, it was just like, it was just and someone, someone else that I knew was also boxes told me about it.

780
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:55.200
Abdikes: And then and I and I went somewhere else and they will the prescription, but it was hard like maintaining the job and then go to the groups and face. Thank you. And that my license suspended, so it's hard to get the places. And so I just thought this would be the best route for me.

781
01:26:59.550 --> 01:27:03.450
Richelle Direny: So am I understanding what you're saying is that you've been sober for the last year.

01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:12.780
Abdikes: And no, like, No, I haven't been sober for there is. Yeah. I lost you there. But then, and what's actually got introduced to the selves.

783
01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:25.590
Abdikes: And like, it was like, like, at first I will get it from a doctor and then I will like literally like our find like people who want to sell it and stuff like that. I buy from them. I the best collect self medicating myself like the past year.

784
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.950
Abdikes: Yeah.

785
01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:30.780
Richelle Direny: Okay, and

786
01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.500
Richelle Direny: When you were when you were drinking. How often would you

787
01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.040
Abdikes: And I would drink like and

788
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:44.820
Abdikes: At first it was like once in a while and then it turned into like almost every day.

789
01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.340
Richelle Direny: What about

790
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.630
Abdikes: The opioids. Yeah. Did you do

791
01:27:53.820 --> 01:28:01.560
Abdikes: And and I've never like I've never actually done heroin but and and I've tried fitting all before

792
01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:08.160
Abdikes: And and like

793
01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:19.260
Abdikes: First, it was like Percocet and stuff like that. And then I'll stick my press release and those were the ones that was taken a lot because to me, like, like

794
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.350
Abdikes: 30 words wasn't like a dirty joke to me. So I was just taking it and I think nothing of it. It was very expensive.

795
01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:36.960
Abdikes: And it was the part of the lifestyle. I was just, it was my autistic and a lot of it and then and I finally got help to a doctor and then like, first, I was thinking like

796
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:46.080
Abdikes: Like one or one a day, once a box in a day. And then he didn't then they then it wasn't enough wasn't helping that it was like two a day.

797
01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:57.420
Abdikes: And and then and then whenever I couldn't get it on my show. I don't have a short enough to like that I fell off and I will relapse and then I would

798
01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:06.360
Abdikes: I would just like it got so bad. It was like, if, if, at that time. Luckily I never got my hands on heroin, probably, if it was around. I probably would have tried it.

799
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:14.010
Richelle Direny: Was kind of just the main thing you were doing anything, just the main thing.

1159
02:02:48.870 --> 02:03:00.360

1160
02:03:01.530 --> 02:03:01.920

02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:43.950
Leah Stover: It would really like devastate me frame by saying that I would that says, Follow me worse is because the baby. If I was pregnant. I like, Oh, well, you know, maybe I'll walk in my friend's house smell good or something. I wouldn't even care but

1168

02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:42.570
Leah Stover: Her and you know cuz he makes $800 a month. And it's just not

1263
02:13:43.650 --> 02:13:45.240
Leah Stover: It's just, it's just not getting it.

1264
02:13:46.890 --> 02:13:52.590
Leah Stover: It, it pays the bills and keeps a river of our head, but it doesn't so

1265
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.600
Leah Stover: Basically

1266
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.720
Richelle Direny: All because if

1267
02:13:59.310 --> 02:14:02.010
Richelle Direny: You don't pay a whole lot for your trailer fee. Right.

1268
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:12.420
Leah Stover: Now know that we we actually assess the reason why we, you know, it's more or less like you know we we get the smallest

1269
02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:26.070
Leah Stover: Cheapest living arrangement that we can think of, I mean, I was joking around my baby shower. I was like, man, before I got pregnant. I would add four sticks in the tar, I can make a whole lot of it and

1270
02:14:27.330 --> 02:14:30.120
Leah Stover: It is different. I gotta have a home, you know, but

1271
02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:39.870
Leah Stover: It, it's, it's about the smaller form of living that you can get and still be legitimately living you know i mean

1272
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.200
Richelle Direny: I don't think you can get any smaller than a tiny house.

1273
02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:50.610
Leah Stover: Yeah. Yes. Basically what it is. I've got a little tiny room for Kirkland.

1274
02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:59.490
Leah Stover: It's just like a square, but I've got all our stuff hung up. I've been working my butt off on and then we got this room back here.

1275
02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:09.030
Leah Stover: We can't really like transform and around because this is bad is attached to Thor.

1276
02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:19.620
Leah Stover: Is it is it all style it. I've got it, I've got some pretty good. And here we model that they have painted

1277
02:15:21.210 --> 02:15:23.820
Leah Stover: Painted everything in the kitchen in the living room.

1278
02:15:26.370 --> 02:15:31.470
Richelle Direny: Hmm. So you guys are gonna but you said that this is your first child, right.

1279
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:43.650
Leah Stover: Yeah, this is my first kid. She's a miracle. I didn't think I could have kids, they were going to send me to Ohio University.

1280
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:50.220
Leah Stover: College Hospital, or whatever because they could not figure out why.

1281
02:15:51.240 --> 02:16:01.080
Leah Stover: I couldn't have kids, why my periods were messed up. They could not figure out what was wrong with me. Yes, three or four doctors could not figure out

1282
02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:13.290
Leah Stover: And I just thought, well, maybe it's just a fully Bly photo and I thought I couldn't get pregnant and Nolan years old. I'm 33 so I got pregnant when I was

1283
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:17.190
Leah Stover: 32 or something like that and

1284
02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:27.420
Leah Stover: All the mirrors and never to get pregnant. I had younger, younger boyfriend's mother and 49 years old and I'm 33

1285
02:16:28.890 --> 02:16:30.870
Leah Stover: So it's a miracle within itself.

1286
02:16:32.370 --> 02:16:50.880
Leah Stover: He has three other kids from his first marriage, where he was married for 24 years to the same woman. So he's very faithful man. I mean, as far as like staying in a relationship, take care of family, but his youngest daughter is 23 four

1287
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:59.130
Leah Stover: So Kirkland is like 23 years younger than his younger sister.

1288
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:04.290
Richelle Direny: Hmm. So this is his second daughter, daughter.

1289
02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:24.630
Leah Stover: This is his fourth kid. He has a boy who is 27 ish a girl who's 26 and then a 23 year old, they're like stair steps he started when he was like 18 having kids picture loving me, looks like a kid holding a kid.

1290
02:17:27.510 --> 02:17:30.540
Leah Stover: He's over now. It's a sporting are now is

1291
02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.330
Leah Stover: A really good father. I mean, these kids love him. He's a really good for

1292
02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:39.210
Leah Stover: You

1293
02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.490
Richelle Direny: I thought he wouldn't have another time.

1294
02:17:43.470 --> 02:17:57.630
Leah Stover: Now, no, no. He talked about it because he's in love with me and Stephen. You know how when you want to be with a man you're loving talk about like it was just talk like as far as dreamers. Are you pregnant, he could get me.

1295
02:17:58.710 --> 02:18:00.390
Leah Stover: Wrong it all over.

1296
02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:08.760
Leah Stover: So I know God did it for a reason, is our I thought that it was done, I don't settle for that never would.

1297
02:18:10.590 --> 02:18:12.030
Leah Stover: That I guess.

1298
02:18:16.290 --> 02:18:17.190
I mean everything hit

1299
02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:19.620
Richelle Direny: Its own time.

1300
02:18:21.510 --> 02:18:21.960
Leah Stover: Yeah.

Leah Stover: He is girls are totally psyched about this. They are so happy about this.

1302
02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:37.620
Leah Stover: And his youngest one she acted a little weird. And I think it's where she's kind of

1303
02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:45.030
Leah Stover: Like Daddy's Girl sore saying like, I'm the youngest and now I'm not anymore or whatever.

1304
02:18:45.390 --> 02:18:46.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah, she's no longer the baby.

02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:23.670
Richelle Direny: She went shopping. You said for the baby.

02:21:04.530 --> 02:21:04.950
Leah Stover: That

1327
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:18.090
Richelle Direny: So, um, I mean, it sounds like you know what after you have the baby. Are you gonna have a lot of support to help you.

1328
02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:20.850
Leah Stover: What

1329
02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.340
Richelle Direny: after you have the baby.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:38.310
Leah Stover: Oh, yeah, yeah. No doubt me, I got my mom, which is always been a, you know, very pious thing first for me.

1331
02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:45.330
Leah Stover: And my husband, which he, I know that he will do everything he can

1332
02:21:46.500 --> 02:21:58.590
Leah Stover: To make sure that they're not taking care of and maybe taking care of. We're going to see, he's a very good husband and he's a good man and he gets a little stressed out overwhelmed.

1333
02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:07.800
Leah Stover: And he gets overly upset about things, but he is just as he loves to start my day and he scared scared, basically.

1334
02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:12.630
Leah Stover: But yeah, I got tons of support.

1335
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:14.940

1337
02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:29.490
Richelle Direny: That's good. So you're. I mean, it's a smaller place or your mom or your sister won't be able to come to the house, your house, too.

1338
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:37.470
Leah Stover: Well yeah, I mean they can't like spend the night with taking like visit during the day.

1339
02:22:40.170 --> 02:22:53.250
Leah Stover: Me and Chuck are our goal. One of our goals in this in this might be down the road a little bit because of the money factor is to build a ring on this thing.

1340
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:58.020
Leah Stover: Because we have this this is ours. So

1341
02:22:58.170 --> 02:22:59.130
Leah Stover: In my mind, that

1342
02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:02.670
Richelle Direny: It's a movable um it's on mobile, where it can move

1343
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.530
Leah Stover: Right.

1344
02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:06.720
Richelle Direny: It's

1345
02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:09.840
Leah Stover: Yeah yeah

1346
02:23:12.570 --> 02:23:16.800
Leah Stover: It has to front doors and saying about it's kind of old style.

1347
02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:18.270
Leah Stover: But

1348
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:23.610
Leah Stover: Our goal is to build a ring.

1349
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:29.580
Leah Stover: Out one of these front doors. So he ain't got care no walls out or nothing.

1350
02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:32.490
Leah Stover: And make them bigger home.

1351
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:34.680
Leah Stover: Out of this because

1352
02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:40.290
Leah Stover: We have this we bought this is ours and

1353
02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:48.150
Leah Stover: I just saying it would be crazy to doing the same thing. I mean, pay rent and do our whenever we have something at our

1354
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:50.520
Leah Stover: Know,

1355
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:54.510
Leah Stover: That's what we're that's our plan.

1356
02:23:57.300 --> 02:24:00.210
Leah Stover: At where our i mean you get

1357
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:04.470
Leah Stover: A box of a belt. The word

1358
02:24:05.850 --> 02:24:06.660
Leah Stover: Out about them.

1359
02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:25.410
Richelle Direny: I mean hey, you're making it work. I mean, it's cost effective. It's just a matter of now it's now it's always just been it's just been you and your husband. So now I was just trying to figure out, how's it going to be with you and I'm

1360
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:27.900
Richelle Direny: With the three of you.

1361
02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:36.960
Leah Stover: Yeah. Yeah, basically. And, and it's a good thing, really, you know, we've kind of cut out all the cancer.

1362
02:24:38.730 --> 02:24:41.190
Leah Stover: Bars like anything that could have been like

1363
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:48.660
Leah Stover: Bad for us or call us and say can travel, we pretty much cut down our lives, little by little, because

1364
02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:51.300
Richelle Direny: What do you mean that causes can. What do you mean the cancer.

1365
02:24:52.770 --> 02:24:53.100
Leah Stover: Like

1366
02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:58.470
Leah Stover: The bad people bad influences people, it was still for

1367
02:24:59.850 --> 02:25:00.360
Leah Stover: People

1368
02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.670
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, just bad influences like that's what you call cancer, anything that's a bad influence

1369
02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:08.610
Leah Stover: Well, yeah. Yeah, just

1370
02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:11.910
Leah Stover: Just talk through my head.

1371
02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:24.000
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen. That's a great if you think of it that way, it can definitely you know keep you from, you know, going taking 10 steps backward having a relaxing. You think of

1372
02:25:24.450 --> 02:25:36.570
Richelle Direny: You know, people in your lives and sort situation places as it being a cancer. And when you look at what cancer is or any kind of major illness like this and what it does to your body, or to your life.

1373
02:25:37.050 --> 02:25:51.240
Richelle Direny: If you look at, you know, the people who are not uplifting you, the people who are not helping you to move forward in life and helping you get to that next step where that next level. If you think of them like that it's easier for you to not

1374
02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:53.880
Richelle Direny: Really associate yourself with

1375
02:25:54.330 --> 02:25:55.410
Leah Stover: So that's a good right

1376
02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:03.030
Richelle Direny: It's a good analogy. And if that's what works for you, then keep it don't don't disown it. Don't let anybody make you this owner. Just keep it.

1377
02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:08.460
Leah Stover: As the way I feel about it. I mean, like,

1378
02:26:09.870 --> 02:26:18.300
Leah Stover: My husband agrees with me about it. You know, it's like if they're not here to to be

1379
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:30.480
Leah Stover: A true friend or true family or, you know, I don't even care if they're not, I don't care if they're here to give me something or not. Give me something is always

1380
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:42.750
Leah Stover: There. Here we care about Me and love Me and not try to hurt me in any way. If they're not doing that. And then I'm getting to where it was me, you know, that's

1381
02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.570
Richelle Direny: That's what's important, because now the difference now.

1382
02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:58.830
Richelle Direny: What you're faced with is that now it's not just about you. It's about a little life. And this is a little innocent child and you if you allow the cancer, as you say,

1383
02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:13.170
Richelle Direny: To consume you or to metastasized which means that spread throughout your life. It can ultimately the consequence that you can suffer is losing this child that you never thought you can have

1384
02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:16.740
Leah Stover: Right, right. That's exactly our film.

1385
02:27:17.370 --> 02:27:22.710
Richelle Direny: And if you look at it that way it will definitely make you think twice about

1386
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:24.570
Richelle Direny: Will not

1387
02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:28.260
Richelle Direny: Come back in your life.

1388
02:27:29.310 --> 02:27:53.970
Leah Stover: Yes, definitely. Definitely. Definitely and and you have so many large will just lie and each slide or destroy kill still destroy the Bible golden and and they just lie jealous or bad or whatever the reason that they can ruin your life and

1389
02:27:55.170 --> 02:27:55.860
Leah Stover: And I just

1390
02:27:59.340 --> 02:27:59.820
Leah Stover: Mm hmm.

1391
02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:01.290
Richelle Direny: And that's

1392
02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:12.090
Richelle Direny: What we talked about in terms of our coping skills. What is your, what is in your toolbox of skills that is one of your. It's like if you find a way

1393
02:28:12.270 --> 02:28:15.210
Richelle Direny: To associate a certain

1394
02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:16.710
Leah Stover: Group of people or

1395
02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:20.700
Richelle Direny: Friends that you've had in my everyone in your life is not necessarily your friends.

1396
02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:25.980
Leah Stover: Now, yeah. Yeah, not even like yeah

1397
02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:39.510
Leah Stover: Do you find out quicker than others, you know, drag out and hurt your, you know, but yeah, they're definitely not

1398
02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:46.020
Leah Stover: The past year right

1399
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:50.310
Leah Stover: Friends, I thought I had a need this.

1400
02:28:51.360 --> 02:29:01.500
Leah Stover: There wasn't they weren't friends and just deliberately do something to turn around me or no reason because it's up. Well, that's nothing new as me. Yeah.

1401
02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:07.800
Leah Stover: He want help law, then they do some blue like

1402
02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:20.730
Richelle Direny: But, but, you know, but there's the same. There's a saying that says misery loves company.

1403
02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:24.600
Leah Stover: And yeah.

1404
02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:26.130
Leah Stover: That's true.

1405
02:29:29.310 --> 02:29:35.670
Richelle Direny: If you look at it, if you think about what that means, like, okay, what, what do you get from that.

1406
02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:45.180
Leah Stover: They get to somebody miserable at their life stops like they don't want to be alone in it.

1407
02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:46.860
Leah Stover: You can actually

1408
02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:56.730
Richelle Direny: Tell you the consequences and all of that they're going through, and how much it's causing havoc in or they're going to tell you that part.

1409
02:29:58.050 --> 02:29:58.650
Leah Stover: Yeah.

1410
02:30:00.330 --> 02:30:00.930
Leah Stover: He just wants to

1411
02:30:01.950 --> 02:30:02.100
Leah Stover: Be

1412
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:06.510
Leah Stover: There should just be selfish basically that's it.

1413
02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:08.940
Richelle Direny: That's it. And so

1414
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:11.700
Leah Stover: We bought understand that way.

1415
02:30:12.420 --> 02:30:30.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, and we blindly join that not and it's not that you want to be a horrible friend and you want to say, oh, I don't want you to stand alone, but not if I'm helping you to come out of your misery. I'm not trying to join.

1416
02:30:30.570 --> 02:30:35.490
Richelle Direny: The misery. I'm helping you get out of it, but it's going to be a tug of war.

1417
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:37.170
Richelle Direny: Where you're going to put

1418
02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:42.570
Richelle Direny: Me in your misery. What do you do with that that role that you're playing tug of war with what do you do

1419
02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:45.930
Leah Stover: Goes back to

1420
02:30:46.350 --> 02:30:47.010
Richelle Direny: Let it go.

1421
02:30:48.510 --> 02:31:00.240
Richelle Direny: Just let it go. If you want to walk down this road of ultimate destruction, nothing's really happening for you, um, things is not going as you would like it to go.

1422
02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:09.540
Richelle Direny: You've lost everything. You can't really get a sense of stability or anything like that. Not affirm put to stand on.

1423
02:31:10.860 --> 02:31:22.530
Richelle Direny: And if I, if you see that and I noticed that. And I'm trying to help you. The best way I know how. With the resources that I have. If I'm helping you to attain that

1424
02:31:23.010 --> 02:31:29.100
Richelle Direny: And you're fighting meat and you're pulling me down with you. The only thing left for me to do is to say

1425
02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:43.800
Richelle Direny: I love you, but I'm going to love you from afar, because I cannot allow myself to go down this road, I work too hard to get where I'm at right now, so I will love you and I would love you from afar. When you're ready for that help you can join

1426
02:31:45.480 --> 02:32:00.750
Leah Stover: Yeah, that's just church and sat there. The sad part about feminist is, as I understand it and understand it from the other side because I did it.

1427
02:32:01.290 --> 02:32:12.060
Leah Stover: And it's hard for me to say that not a problem but never said it before, but hey, I get it. Thank you so much fun. When I was on heroin.

1428
02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:25.770
Leah Stover: And I was the gold time if I could bring somebody down there with me, I would have down there with me because I didn't want be alone sick. Yeah, or to get money when I could or whatever the case.

1429
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:32.190
Leah Stover: So I understand it from both ends, and I don't

1430
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:38.730
Leah Stover: I don't want being the person that is it me, I just don't want to be that person anymore.

1431
02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:53.550
Richelle Direny: This is the thing. And I like that you pointed that out. You say you understand it from both ends you mastered it, and you really understand it from one end, you're still trying to understand it from this

1432
02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:55.080
Leah Stover: Right.

1433
02:32:55.800 --> 02:33:06.450
Richelle Direny: And the reason why you're trying to understand it because while you are, you're still, you're not necessarily up here, you've kind of the person who is right here that's struggling

1434
02:33:07.050 --> 02:33:16.230
Richelle Direny: You'll have kind of gotten your cell phone. So it's like there's a song you fall in what you've gotten back up. This person has fallen but they're staying down

1435
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:28.440
Richelle Direny: You found the strength and the courage to get back up through whatever resources from whatever angle from whatever situation from whatever experiences you somehow got yourself up and you are, where you are.

1436
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:37.710
Richelle Direny: You know what you've gotten a taste of what life is like being without the drugs, right, or

1437
02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:41.100
Richelle Direny: Just where you work at some point in life.

1438
02:33:43.170 --> 02:33:56.670
Richelle Direny: We want to reach down and you want to help this person, but the question is have you gotten to a place where you're strong enough that if this person where you know where you once was.

1439
02:33:58.050 --> 02:34:06.540
Richelle Direny: It down to help that. Are you strong enough that if they pull you down, you're not going to go down with. That's the question.

1440
02:34:07.770 --> 02:34:11.850
Leah Stover: Yeah, that is, and I had a test on that.

1441
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:15.000
Leah Stover: Bow, a week ago.

1442
02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:27.540
Leah Stover: My husband drop me off at my mom's to talk to her for a little bit and him and his body went to go sell some antiques. They had their friends or their

1443
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:34.740
Leah Stover: Well, being a driver. So they had has no stuff and lives of all over there but ever

1444
02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:36.180
Leah Stover: And

1445
02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:45.360
Leah Stover: His friend comes on the back room with with to share with with heroin, you know, and

1446
02:34:46.470 --> 02:34:59.130
Leah Stover: My husband's a little bit past is he, he does guitar, right, because he knows why went through with that shit. He didn't do we got off of it together, which is very rare but

1447
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:03.420
Leah Stover: I was in a truck with them. They came back to me.

1448
02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:05.490
Leah Stover: And

1449
02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:18.930
Leah Stover: It, it didn't bother me. I get didn't. There was no thought like, oh, I'm gonna find way to get some of that nothing. It was just like

1450
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:26.760
Leah Stover: I saw my mom was hell no. I'm never doing that so

1451
02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:31.380
Leah Stover: Every test for me and I'll pass it.

1452
02:35:32.490 --> 02:35:35.700
Leah Stover: You know, I don't know, hopefully, you know,

1453
02:35:37.110 --> 02:35:57.000
Leah Stover: Hopefully if he wasn't there. I could do it. You know, I guess that would be the ultimate test, you know, but I think good, pretty good just deny what you know we're thinking about that at all like he didn't even wind come back home with us that he had it. He made him leave.

1454
02:35:58.140 --> 02:36:01.980
Leah Stover: And Tony better. So get rid of whatever is going to do to my ear.

1455
02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:03.540
Leah Stover: So,

1456
02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:05.010
Mm hmm.

1457
02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:16.500
Richelle Direny: So it's, it's, you have to be at a place because okay so you. How long have you been on your road of recovery.

1458
02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:21.600
Leah Stover: Said, on and off about

1459
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:29.820
Leah Stover: Two and a half years. Okay. That first that first year on it will dabble on this whatever

1460
02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:43.680
Richelle Direny: You have three people. So I'm going to give you an advantage you have three people. You have the one person who is still struggling, right, the one person who is that the other person who has about two

1461
02:36:45.330 --> 02:36:51.600
Richelle Direny: You have the other person who has about two to three years of sobriety under their belt.

1462
02:36:52.110 --> 02:37:04.860
Richelle Direny: They've had a few snippets here and there, but they understand like, hey, you know what, even though I have a few snips. I was still able to to kind of come up and because remember every slip up the clock starts over right

1463
02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:06.270
Leah Stover: Yeah.

1464
02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:10.350
Richelle Direny: This person who's had now 20 years of sobriety under their belt.

1465
02:37:12.390 --> 02:37:23.310
Richelle Direny: And this person has maintained they pretty much they have a solid footing on the ground. It's pretty much cement that has gotten them down on the ground, they're doing what they're doing.

1466
02:37:23.370 --> 02:37:23.700
Or

1467
02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:31.830
Richelle Direny: Out of the two people will do you think is in a better position to help this person that's down here.

1468
02:37:33.090 --> 02:37:35.970
Leah Stover: That, that one is knowledge.

1469
02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:48.390
Richelle Direny: Exactly. Now how out of these two people who understands what this person is struggling within knowing that they need that help well out of the two people will understand

1470
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:51.450
Leah Stover: I said,

1471
02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:58.770
Richelle Direny: You're right. Both of them understands what this person is going through both of them wants to help this person.

1472
02:37:59.070 --> 02:38:17.550
Richelle Direny: Both of them knows that, hey, I'm reaching a hand. And I want to pull you up, but you're pulling me down and I'm trying to get you from where you are, but don't both of them understand this person. Which one is in the better position to help this individual.

1473
02:38:18.810 --> 02:38:23.640
Leah Stover: That the one that's more stable and they're surviving

1474
02:38:24.390 --> 02:38:32.970
Richelle Direny: The one that is still, you're still young, you're still a baby in your sobriety this person isn't isn't adults.

1475
02:38:34.050 --> 02:38:34.410
Leah Stover: He's not

1476
02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:41.130
Richelle Direny: He's an adult, but this one is still a baby can have baby help a person who is still struggling

1477
02:38:43.650 --> 02:38:47.520
Leah Stover: Thank you, if they got to involve

1478
02:38:48.750 --> 02:38:49.830
Leah Stover: That probably but

1479
02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:52.860
Leah Stover: And yeah.

1480
02:38:53.400 --> 02:39:01.890
Richelle Direny: That's what I'm trying to so when you said that you've been on you. You understand, but you've mastered you know exactly what the person who's still down is going

1481
02:39:02.250 --> 02:39:08.850
Richelle Direny: Your heart still goes out to that person because hey, I just got up, I'm trying to get you up, but you're pulling me down.

1482
02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:23.460
Richelle Direny: And if you keep pulling me. I don't have a strong grip on life yet. So guess what you keep pulling me. What are you going to do, because your heart is there with that person, then you don't have a strong grip online for the person who's down was eventually going to happen to you.

1483
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:26.790
Leah Stover: Will be down with them.

1484
02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:28.320
Richelle Direny: You're going to be down there with them.

1485
02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:36.330
Richelle Direny: That's the reason why I said you're still learning how to master the art of saying

1486
02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:46.140
Richelle Direny: I want to help you but I'm unable to help you because I haven't fully mastered I can give you the tools and I can give you the encouragement.

1487
02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:50.640
Richelle Direny: But right now, you keep pulling me down and I don't want to go down there because

1488
02:39:51.120 --> 02:40:04.170
Richelle Direny: I have a husband that I can lose. I have a home that I can lose. I have a baby that I never thought I would have I can lose. I have family that's there. I have so much that I can lose and I have seen and I have tasted.

1489
02:40:04.590 --> 02:40:22.770
Richelle Direny: What it's like to be up here. I can help you. But if you refuse. I can't, I can't continue because I don't want to lose what I have. I will love for you to join me. But if you are not going to join me and if you keep pulling me. I'm going to have to let go.

1490
02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:25.020
Leah Stover: Right.

1491
02:40:25.410 --> 02:40:39.330
Richelle Direny: I'm going to have to let go. And so you're at that place where you're still trying to master, you're still trying to hold on, you're still trying to find your grip, you're still, you're still trying to do that. And it's okay.

1492
02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:51.990
Richelle Direny: To be there. Your. Are you still going to have the mixed emotions are you going to still have this feeling of guilt. Are you still going to feel bad that you're turning away and walking away from that person that's down there.

1493
02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:54.690
Richelle Direny: Are you still going to feel those ways

1494
02:40:56.340 --> 02:40:57.120
Leah Stover: Oh boy.

1495
02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:11.730
Richelle Direny: Hands down. It's not a problem. It isn't I, hands down, you are going to feel that way and it's okay to feel that way because like you said you were there, you were that person.

1496
02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:33.990
Richelle Direny: Yeah, know what it is, like, but now some way somewhere in life. You just, you said, Okay, enough is enough. I want what that person who walked away from me. I want to see, feel, and taste and now I am I felt it and I've tasted, and I'm liking what life is over here.

1497
02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:38.610
Richelle Direny: I can for not only for me. But for this.

1498
02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:45.360
Richelle Direny: unborn child that's about to come into this world. I don't want to lose that life and I don't want to lose her

1499
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:48.000
Leah Stover: Because

1500
02:41:48.330 --> 02:41:52.380
Richelle Direny: I'm so focused on trying to help someone else in order for

1501
02:41:53.190 --> 02:42:03.510

Richelle Direny: You have. Yeah. Wait, where are you, you are, where you you have that sobriety under your belt. You can tell a person, hey you know what you can, but then if they don't want to. And they insist, then, now that you look at, listen, you're almost a cancer to me and I don't want that cancer.

1507
02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:35.070
I want

1508
02:42:36.270 --> 02:42:41.790
Richelle Direny: And that's just how you have to, so it's okay to own it into it's okay to say

1509
02:42:43.350 --> 02:42:44.730
Richelle Direny: It's okay to

1510
02:42:46.080 --> 02:43:01.770
Richelle Direny: Feel how this person feels it's okay to know what this person is going through. It's okay to understand the struggle that that person. It only tells you in confirm that you are human and your heart goes out to this person.

1511
02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:03.300
Leah Stover: Right.

Leah Stover: Like a it's like addiction is always in it. Is it always in my mom, whether it be something else. I don't know. Like it's

1521
02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:54.750
Leah Stover: It's always going to be there.

1522
02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:59.760
Richelle Direny: But guess what, it's there because you're still working through

1523
02:44:01.710 --> 02:44:02.280
Richelle Direny: Your

1524
02:44:04.350 --> 02:44:11.190
Richelle Direny: You lose self control. That's what it is. You lose self control and so you become addicted.

1525
02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:21.300
Richelle Direny: To those things and substance or whatever it is that you use to cope with your stressors, you

1526
02:44:22.140 --> 02:44:22.980
Leah Stover: Need to cope

1527
02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:40.770
Richelle Direny: You have lost the ability to process and to know how to process it until to know that it's okay to feel and even though it feels and it hurts like hell right now, but it will pass. I don't need to get something to numb. This feeling so I don't have to feel you've gotten addicted.

1528
02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:47.100
Richelle Direny: For those suppressants THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ADDICTED TO YOU'RE ADDICTED TO NOT FEELING

1529
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:55.230
Richelle Direny: I don't want to feel and I don't want to experience all of that. So I'm going to find anything that stops it and that's where your addiction comes from

1530
02:44:55.710 --> 02:45:09.480
Richelle Direny: But it's through therapy. And over time, you learned that if I cut and it hurts for a while. It's okay. That's the natural part of life. It's going to hurt, but guess what, it can't hurt forever. It is going to stop.

1531
02:45:10.890 --> 02:45:29.070
Richelle Direny: And I, both in order for me to understand the pain. I have to go through the pain in order for me to know and in help other people. I have to go through it. I have to understand. You know what I felt ping it hurt like hell but I know, eventually, it's fine.

1532
02:45:30.690 --> 02:45:41.100
Leah Stover: Yeah, that is the moment. So I told somebody the other day, friend of mine was you're talking to me and she was on drugs, a lot too. And on Suboxone to

1533
02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:54.990
Leah Stover: I was explained to her. What was like when I was full fledged thing on heroin. It was like I had a glass box around me. It's like, I could see through here through it.

1534
02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:16.410
Leah Stover: And people could see me. They knew they could touch me, but it was like God couldn't nothing to touch me. So I got that the heroin glass box around me and nothing to nothing. Nothing could get to me.

1535
02:46:17.490 --> 02:46:23.040
Leah Stover: And little by little, whenever I started getting off of that glass box or come down and

1536
02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:24.720
Leah Stover: Stop.

1537
02:46:26.730 --> 02:46:28.530
Richelle Direny: My video is going to stop, but I'm gonna

1538
02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:34.830
Leah Stover: Okay.

1539
02:46:36.570 --> 02:46:36.930
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1540
02:46:38.850 --> 02:46:39.450
Richelle Direny: You see me.

1541
02:46:41.610 --> 02:46:41.910
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1542
02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:45.450
No, no.

1543
02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:48.000
Richelle Direny: I can hear you.

1544
02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:52.020
Leah Stover: Okay, I'm still hear me right

1545
02:46:52.470 --> 02:46:58.680
Richelle Direny: I can still hear you. Yeah, I was talking to you on a different thing. And that just shut down so

1546
02:46:58.770 --> 02:46:59.280
Yeah.

1547
02:47:00.390 --> 02:47:01.830
Richelle Direny: Go ahead and finish what you were saying.

1548
02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:06.960
Leah Stover: But we're not glass ball or countdown does come

1549
02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:08.310
Leah Stover: Started

1550
02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:18.900
Leah Stover: Me like memories I started realizing you know what really happened being molested can

1551
02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:28.530
Leah Stover: bang out and I started realizing that that stuff really happened. It wasn't just a

1552
02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:35.850
Leah Stover: Watch, or was it a movie or a story really happened and

1553
02:47:37.290 --> 02:47:39.300
Leah Stover: Then I had to figure out how to deal with it.

1554
02:47:40.350 --> 02:47:40.620
Richelle Direny: And

1555
02:47:40.890 --> 02:47:43.080
Leah Stover: I'm still kind of dealing with it, but

1556
02:47:44.730 --> 02:47:45.210
Richelle Direny: God's

1557
02:47:45.690 --> 02:47:46.170
Law.

1558
02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:49.500
Leah Stover: I prayed that

1559
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:55.800
Leah Stover: That he would make it work did half and and I prayed that prayer that he's one day.

1560
02:47:56.850 --> 02:48:00.870
Leah Stover: I can't make it work. Didn't happen, but I can make you feel happy.

1561
02:48:03.810 --> 02:48:06.720
Leah Stover: Man, and he did eventually have

1562
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:15.030
Leah Stover: Like LA or soon to it and I can see him, and it does crush wide so

1563
02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:16.410
Leah Stover: Like

1564
02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:18.270
Leah Stover: Basically

1565
02:48:20.370 --> 02:48:33.210
Richelle Direny: Yes, I can. And what what you said, what's important. It's that it's that you tried to suppress through the drugs and through everything that you did what you got addicted to stopping numbing the pain.

1566
02:48:33.630 --> 02:48:42.930
Richelle Direny: I'm somewhat trying to wipe away the memories of what occurred. It's coming to that it didn't happen. How do I

1567
02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:51.660
Richelle Direny: Work through it, how do I, I know that it happened. How do I, how do I begin the process of healing.

1568
02:48:52.560 --> 02:49:12.450
Richelle Direny: How do I begin the process of forgiving because forgiving doesn't belong necessarily to you're the person who did this against you. It belongs to you for giving the person belongs to you so that you can release them and so that you can begin the healing process and working

1569
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:22.590
Richelle Direny: And that's what it is. And like you said you have your faith in God and God helps you through it. You have your husband and you have that team of support around you.

1570
02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:30.150
Richelle Direny: And that is all part of the support system that is going to help you to to to heal and to go through it.

1571
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:43.830
Richelle Direny: And to end to be when one day to be able to help someone but you are not you're unable to help someone right now because you're still your wound is still open. It's still wrong. And it needs to begin the healing process.

1572
02:49:45.630 --> 02:49:56.970
Leah Stover: Yeah, it definitely is a long process. You know, I always saw. Well, it's been here a long time, but it don't have no time frame on it and

1573
02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:04.710
Leah Stover: It doesn't take the first step could be 10 years now, how you processes.

1574
02:50:05.850 --> 02:50:19.530
Richelle Direny: Exactly. Think about whenever you go to like if you have a cut or you have a wound and you know how when you go to the doctor when the wound is there is fresh. It's kind of a band aid they put something over it right to kind of protect it.

1575
02:50:19.650 --> 02:50:23.940
Richelle Direny: Yeah elements. Right. But then after a while. What do they do.

1576
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.520
Leah Stover: And

1577
02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:29.370
Leah Stover: He'll basically

1578
02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:30.600
Richelle Direny: They remove it.

1579
02:50:31.110 --> 02:50:38.310
Richelle Direny: They remove it as it but the when you first get the wound. It's fresh and they need to protect it from all this element. So it could start

1580
02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:43.920
Richelle Direny: Under the bandage it could start that process. But eventually, you have to remove that band aid.

1581
02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:51.690
Richelle Direny: And because it needs the air, it needs the finished it's healing process. So you need to remove that band that you need to remove all of it.

1582
02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:57.870
Richelle Direny: To continue with that healing process. And that's kind of where you are right now. So it's kind of like

1583
02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:04.380
Richelle Direny: Now you're at that point where you know what it's wrong while you're in therapy, while you're in this program.

1584
02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:11.520
Richelle Direny: You're still now you've gotten to that point where you like you're leading I'm hurting. I need to. So under the protection

1585
02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:22.680
Richelle Direny: Or kind of the guidance. I shouldn't say protection guidance under the direction of being in a program or working through it, we're processing. A lot of the past hurt and pain that you've gone through

1586
02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:41.040
Richelle Direny: It doesn't get rid of it. It doesn't on do it. It doesn't say it never happened. It did. It's how do you start today to work through it. You're not going to get you will never not remembering, but how do I start to move on and not allow

1587
02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:45.780
Richelle Direny: What happened to me in the past to continue to control me

1588
02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:47.460
Where I

1589
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:54.870
Richelle Direny: How do I if I hurt. I go through it in a healthy way instead of an unhealthy.

1590
02:51:57.330 --> 02:51:57.810
Leah Stover: Right.

1591
02:51:58.920 --> 02:51:59.310
Leah Stover: Well,

1592
02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:06.930
Leah Stover: I have to be then babies like oh my bladder. So I guess I'll

1593
02:52:08.010 --> 02:52:09.540
Leah Stover: Schedule another appointment with you guys.

1594
02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:11.610
