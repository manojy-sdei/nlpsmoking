Gwenevere Abriel: And are you noticing that it gets to you can get to your point, faster.

31
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to the heart of what's going on for you a little faster or there's still some some trouble.

32
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:16.380
Ateeq Dean: Some to the last couple weeks here that we really haven't been arguments much. Okay. Yes. I read. It's been a lot better.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, your ability to mirror because mirroring is a hard thing to do.

34
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're listening to someone else. Um, have you noticed that that part's harder listening to someone else without arguing back yeah yeah

35
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Amen. And that is hard.

36
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I know we want to put our own opinion in there.

37
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:51.570

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm just so you know what you set for yourself with your, your plan was to be you'd be at point five right now.

40
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying that's what you guys do you think, Oh, I'm just gonna, I'm just going to do one milligram every, every two weeks. And I'm like, well, you can

41
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what, that's where you would have been if you were doing, um, let me see.

42
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you want you what the treatment plan had looked like one milligram at a time. Now you're seeing that what you prefer what your body seems to register a little bit more comfortably is a half a milligram. Is that right,

43
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

44
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:59.220

62
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:43.140
Ateeq Dean: I would do is, you know, I would do a whole one here and here and there. And then I started cutting it down to half, like I would do have their their their there, but I've never done any being less than that. And I'm scared of going below that.

63
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:51.930

91
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can find a place for that phone. I'm starting to get a little nauseous from it moving around.

95
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To see vulnerability in your father, your hero right to see he does, it's like all children by the way we all do that we

96
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Our parents are a god they're right. They're all powerful. That's exactly how we start course we learn more and we say, Oh, they're flood to just like us. That's a big developmental milestone for people and not only

97
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Was your father flawed like me like you, because we're human, but he had this condition. Tell me a little bit about what that was like for you to come to that.

98
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.040
Ateeq Dean: I just remember

99
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.590
Ateeq Dean: The morning that

100
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:18.300
Ateeq Dean: The situation happened it was the beginning so we didn't even though he was bipolar. At the time I was in

101
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:29.250
Ateeq Dean: I was a senior in high school, when it happened now 17 out the youngest one out of my graduating class. But, uh, I just remember my mom yelling

102
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.670
Ateeq Dean: And we woke up to her yelling

103
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:48.480
Ateeq Dean: At my little sisters that were really young at the time and I have a sister that's older than me too. We all were trying to look for my dad and I went in the garage, because my dad is to lift weights and stuff like that.

104
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:55.590
Ateeq Dean: Rod. So when I went in there. My dad was passed out on the floor and I just remember that.

105
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.060
Ateeq Dean: He was passed out on the farm. I thought to himself on the head with the way

106
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:10.230
Ateeq Dean: But that wasn't that wasn't the case like often he started throwing up he was out of it and he started throwing up but blood started coming out of his mouth and he started smelling like bleach.

107
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.630
Ateeq Dean: Yeah. So my dad was trying to commit suicide. So I saw bad at 17

108
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:32.010
Ateeq Dean: You know, so I was, Oh, they're calling nine one. And I was older, watching my sister's yelling, screaming their heads off. And it was a big mess that A and I just remember moms losing their mind and

109
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.520
Ateeq Dean: didn't heal after that.

110
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you feel when you saw it.

111
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.690
Ateeq Dean: I thought my dad would just die that day that I was gonna die.

112
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a thought. See if you can find the emotion that went with that.

113
00:11:51.630 --> 00:12:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Scared. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. And who did you talk to about feeling scared, who could listen to

114
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.780
Ateeq Dean: Really talk to anybody about it.

115
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.570
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, that's like

116
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.450
Ateeq Dean: I didn't really have friends and stuff like that that I couldn't really talk to

117
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.850
About any of that.

118
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you mean by blocked those feelings. The scared feeling so the ones that got sort of pushed down pushed away.

119
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of a time later on, let's say,

120
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Where that came up where you had that kind of degree of scared to run for another time.

121
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.680
Ateeq Dean: When I got arrested and when

122
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:57.690
Ateeq Dean: It's hot in here. I'm gonna sorry I know I shouldn't be moving this I have the heater on and I'm just gonna turn on the fan, because it's so hot now.

123
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.180
Ateeq Dean: I'm not trying to make any

124
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.120
Ateeq Dean: Difference, are you, I'm gonna show

125
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.210
Ateeq Dean: Okay, I'm back.

126
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To start seeing, seeing your father, maybe and and being arrested. Do you see anything in common between those two those two stories.

127
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.300
Ateeq Dean: I was good at both times.

128
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, both. Yeah. What was the thought.

129
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.890
Ateeq Dean: I didn't know what was going to happen. And that's what scares me.

130
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncertainty about the future.

131
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.270
Yeah.

132
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm kind of looking at your life. Now, where does that show up. Where does that fear of uncertainty about the future. Where does it show up these days.

133
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.970
Ateeq Dean: Well, right now.

134
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.560
Ateeq Dean: My girlfriend, she's a stay at home mom and I'm the only one working

135
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.990
Ateeq Dean: And I feel like

136
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:18.600
Ateeq Dean: I could lose my job and everything can just, you know, two, three paychecks away from being homeless myself, you know, so that's where the uncertainty come from. And that's where this kid I get scared thinking of that and just things like that.

137
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And

138
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you can hear rationally.

139
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people are in are living paycheck to paycheck.

140
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you can hear that.

141
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

142
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: How much time of the day. How many hours. How much time is spent worrying about that uncertainty.

143
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.610
Ateeq Dean: It used to be a lot more than it is now, I've kind of

144
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.650
Ateeq Dean: stopped thinking about that because when I started thinking about bills and stuff I

145
00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:09.780
Ateeq Dean: A while back I had, I had a little extra money with me. But then I went to the casino and blew it all. You know, so that it's not that I have a gambling addiction. I feel like, okay, I'm going to go win.

146
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:20.220
Ateeq Dean: $300,000 and then pay everything off and then be this hero, you know, but then I told myself like stop being this hero that you're not

147
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.920
Ateeq Dean: That realization to stop just stop. Yeah.

148
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think you've mentioned that gambling was a part of a more regular activity. How frequently do you go in a given month

149
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.130
Ateeq Dean: I used to go every day. Uh huh.

150
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And so over the last, let's say last month. How many times did you go

151
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.520
Ateeq Dean: I went three times last month.

152
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And

153
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.360
How much money was 120 400

154
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And how much was lost over that same month period.

155
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Ateeq Dean: Three 200 what 3200

156
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And you lost 3200 yeah 124 yeah okay

157
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.680
Ateeq Dean: Good. Then I put more back so 3200

158
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You lost 3200 you won 2400

159
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're down at 100

160
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you look at

161
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether because see no will always win.

162
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.270
Yeah.

163
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The odds are against you.

164
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:42.840
Yeah.

165
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.690
Yeah.

166
00:16:48.210 --> 00:17:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would it be like to give that up completely that it turns out that hard work and turning all your energy into, you know, business venture or honing a new

167
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: A new skill or a new training or going into business with some of what would it be like to let go of a lottery mentality that they'll be this windfall and it's locked in chance and done it.

168
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like to never do it again. What would life be like DC

169
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.500
Ateeq Dean: Prior to me going. Last month I didn't go for a year.

170
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

171
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.460
Ateeq Dean: So, I mean, I did really good. I didn't go at all and then

172
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.470
Ateeq Dean: I just had my internet connection was lost.

173
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Your good

174
00:17:40.470 --> 00:18:03.090
Ateeq Dean: Um, yeah, I didn't go for a year. I mean, I did. I went in January, I did. I went a couple times in January, and I should have word I did go and I, what I did was I mentally told myself, I'm just going to bury what was lost and start fresh and I came to realization that I'm not going to be

175
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: One.

176
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.420
Ateeq Dean: That I'm not going to be your hero.

177
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You are a hero.

178
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.450
Ateeq Dean: Your hero. Yeah, but

179
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.480
Ateeq Dean: Not like that like I was trying to be a hero in a whole different way.

180
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fast money that's that whole other life that's that fast money not not looking at the moral implications. That's an old life.

181
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really letting go of that. And typically, one way to register whether one is and you know they've got a gambling problem. Maybe you don't identify as as as an addict. But one way to find out is

182
00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: an addict. Interestingly won't stop until they've lost everything. Yeah, it's weird. You think

183
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, no. No one's going to do that all when if I get this know because they will keep them. They'll bet that no gamble that until they won't stop until it's all come

184
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.050
Ateeq Dean: To realize that up. Don't stop till it's all gone. Gone.

185
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.230
Ateeq Dean: Didn't even matter. I'm gonna try one.

186
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.940
Ateeq Dean: Didn't matter to me it's it's crazy. But you're right. Yeah.

187
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's ironic because most people will say, Well, that doesn't make any sense. Well, a gambler wants to be the hero wants to have all this, but the mentality is it i'll just but i can i will i can i can bet again and again and unconsciously it's until it's all gone.

188
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.150
Ateeq Dean: Over

189
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:55.050
Ateeq Dean: Something hard to even bring up to care about light Intel or any of this. She thought I was because I told her, I'm going to be at work late

190
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.640
Ateeq Dean: Late I was lying to her. She was more concerned that I was lying to her.

191
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:08.820
Ateeq Dean: Like, I should have been more honest with her about it, but we had a discussion about because she was like, where's all this money going to God. Oh no, I don't know.

192
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.970
Ateeq Dean: So she has no idea. You know, I did. We talked about it. This was about a good week ago.

193
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you prepared. What that ruptured, you have some force.

194
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:30.780
Ateeq Dean: That I need to tell you something today and just and I talked to her. She doesn't believe in gambling. She's, she's never believed in that like gambling or any of that.

195
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.090
Ateeq Dean: You know she

196
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.780
Ateeq Dean: She told me. Yeah.

197
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.670
Ateeq Dean: And what started

198
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:55.020
Ateeq Dean: Me. Well, my dad would take off and you know back when I was at home, I would watch him, so I would always my mom would tell me go with him and my mom, she has arthritis can really go so I would go to watch my dad.

199
00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:07.740
Ateeq Dean: And my dad would go to these places casinos and stuff like that. And that's me after watching for hours and hours and hours at a time. Guess what got me like I'm turning into my

200
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.370
Ateeq Dean: In ways. Okay.

201
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But, you know, you also you could see the point of abstaining from gambling for a year.

202
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, you're being able to talk to care of is an important part of it. That means that you're holding yourself accountable. You're not hiding in shame and you're talking with her. I think that's really smart. Yeah.

203
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:48.990
Ateeq Dean: And me talking to her about it. Actually, I pay all my bills from good now. I made sure I got paid on the seventh. I didn't go and using that could have went but I I told myself, I'm not going to go anymore in my gas bill paid at all.

204
00:21:51.720 --> 00:22:02.070
Ateeq Dean: So myself. I'm just going to start paying I started feeling bad, because you know we have a baby. I could have bought her stuff could have bought me baby stuff and just things like that and

205
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.590
Ateeq Dean: I didn't realize it at the time.

206
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here, where you're holding yourself responsible for what happened. You are the one that gambled you are the one that believed that there'll be this windfall and you are the one that didn't have this money to pay this bill.

207
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all it takes is that that amount of of ownership and responsibility. Now, how far behind. Are you on bills right now or are you all caught up.

208
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.150
Richard to catch up.

209
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Gambling

210
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's about it. Gambling brought you down 1800 hello hard work and following through and not having this lottery sort of windfall wishful thinking mentality.

211
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You are able to stay on top of your bills.

212
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but when I first met you. You didn't want it. You didn't you want to contact the gas company, you didn't want. He didn't want to talk to him.

213
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a difference. You're now talking with care about the gambling you're finding out how much bills are your, your growing up, man.

214
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.470
Yeah.

215
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:21.960
Ateeq Dean: Well to yes

216
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We do I know it's uncomfortable.

217
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But isn't as bad as you thought it would be.

218
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:45.570
Ateeq Dean: I, I just realized. Too bad you know I have a lot of my life that I do take for granted. You know, there's people that don't have anybody. There's out here, the homeless rate is high.

219
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:58.110
Ateeq Dean: And you know even even up somewhere to be even this with all that Tricity are now gas or even all food to someone that's homeless is more than enough.

220
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:06.600
Ateeq Dean: You know, so I just realized, you know, I've taken a lot for granted. I have a good woman. I shouldn't take that for granted because there's

221
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:17.070
Ateeq Dean: You know by work with guys that are single, and they wish they had a good woman in their life they they're single don't have anybody they make good money, but they have no one to share that with their alone.

222
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.040
Ateeq Dean: So, you know, I realized that

223
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:37.800
Ateeq Dean: That and I don't want to start my year off bad either. And I don't want to drag her in a hole that she shouldn't be in. It's not just me. My daughter and Cara and grow fitness. You know, I'm responsible for them.

224
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The uncertainty that comes with

225
00:24:43.560 --> 00:25:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Gambling right you're uncomfortable with someone certainty. But for someone who is relying so Cara's relying on you and you might be risking because gambling. It's not 100% no one right if the casinos gonna win.

226
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Imagine the discomfort in the distress over that.

227
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.690
Ateeq Dean: It's breached just folio

228
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. I'd like to continue to explore some goals with you that you had said, and let's just see where you are with them. Okay. How do you think you're doing as far as your tapering you think you're progressing the way you'd like talk to me.

229
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.630
Ateeq Dean: Oh, I feel

230
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:48.990
Ateeq Dean: I'm doing pretty good where I'm at now. I don't want to taper too fast. Okay, I get five Mark, I just don't want to go back to opiates. I don't want to get on another addiction i mean i don't i'm fine here out six. What I get to five is rare.

231
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because why is that a magic number for you. Tell me.

232
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.770
Ateeq Dean: I just remember

233
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.020
Ateeq Dean: After that,

234
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.890
Ateeq Dean: When I was buying subs.

235
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:24.510
Ateeq Dean: When I came down to the last of them yeah I broke good at half that I did have, and then after that I went back to pills and I don't want to entertain myself like I am now but I just remember how fast I went back to build it. I'm scared of that. I don't want to go back to that.

236
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, hold on, half course. I don't know how you saying half of an eight milligram strip

237
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.330
Ateeq Dean: Mm hmm.

238
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on what you did was go eight eight or zero. When have you ever done that here and bright heart.

239
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so don't let your irrational addiction voice telling you that's what we're doing.

240
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:51.780
Ateeq Dean: Is telling me.

241
00:26:53.430 --> 00:27:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing it we're reviewing it, because that's what that's what the attic does is it says it's going to be that bad and accurate.

242
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do you could do even less than a half a milligram reduction at a time.

243
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the whole point is slowly you have this reinforcement, you have this success and you say, Oh, look at that. And I had someone in my family get sick and I

244
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Used social medicine. I talked with my sweetheart I exercised. I did my breathing. I got into my hobbies. I did the things that are healthy, you have that memory and then something else happens, you lose a child, something changes and you have another stress.

245
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The rest of your life, there will be challenges they're not going anywhere. I have them you will have them.

246
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No. No one likes to hear that we don't like to hear that.

247
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's the truth. I can almost promise it

248
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.770
Yeah.

249
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right

250
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Things break. They were down there's miscommunications those jobs shortages, the demand isn't as high as the supply things change. It has to do with your ability to meet that distress with new and improved skills, what you used before.

251
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Was reaching for a substance and what you need to be able to do now is probably to talk to your sweetheart. Right. And to also regulate in the moment to do that breathing.

252
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And other hobbies to

253
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch what you didn't do. Before was make changes in your behaviors you weren't making those changes and you were you weren't really tapering what you were doing was

254
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Stopping this and starting this and stopping and starting this. That was not a brain. Yeah. So I hear you on the fear. And so, but I we I was using a very specific word. Let's listen very closely to the word I've chosen

255
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you assess your progress.

256
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to quit my drug use and Suboxone it's February 11 you are at five, six, sorry, six milligrams. Once you to tell me

257
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you assess your progress as what would be a word to encapsulate that

258
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.080
Ateeq Dean: I feel like my practice is good.

259
00:29:50.760 --> 00:30:02.640
Ateeq Dean: I do like I'm doing good, because I haven't touched. I know Suboxone is yes, it is an opiate but I haven't touched oxycodone opiate

260
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you taken more than what you're prescribed

261
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There. And do you know that what you were doing before was your abruptly take remove hurrying up I want to all right now and you were taking more you were

262
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Not following your doctor's orders so progress for you, his fault doing the prescribed amount

263
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So good feel pride in that

264
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't doing that before.

265
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:41.700
Ateeq Dean: I'm all what I was trying to say is that stuff is called methadone is what they wanted me to get on

266
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.940
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, and I didn't want to do that.

267
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, let's go to the next one. Just checking in on spirituality

268
00:30:53.670 --> 00:31:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: How much does that play a part, when there's been moments for some people they meet a new stress someone sick in your family. Right. Something happens like that. And some people go to a higher power for you. I take do you go there as a sense of refuge and support as

269
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.010
Ateeq Dean: Well, because

270
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:28.350
Ateeq Dean: I don't go there because my family is from two different religions and they're two different religions that really don't get along with one another and I stay out of the religion circle and

271
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We've touched on the specifics of this, but that doesn't actually make sense to me. Let me tell you why I could have parents that are Catholic and Jewish and, like, just don't quite get what you're saying, why is it you would deprive yourself from whatever you want to do.

272
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.500
Ateeq Dean: Yeah.

273
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's your parents did this tell me more about how you wouldn't see because we have a unique. I hadn't heard your, your specific sort of worldview about how to live.

274
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:05.370
Ateeq Dean: Well, I've you I've worked with people that are very spiritual also

275
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:16.020
Ateeq Dean: And I see that the hell they are towards other people, they're rude and mean but there's this spiritual person and

276
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.840
Ateeq Dean: I don't want to be that person.

277
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but why would you think you why, why, if I said well I

278
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:33.690
Ateeq Dean: Like okay, it's my own mind. I feel like they've limited themselves being this spiritual person. I believe in universal law. I don't believe in all that

279
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Take universal law and

280
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.250
Cancel.

281
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

282
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe in universal law and when my sisters. I think it was her sister cousin was sick. I

283
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I made that connection and I used it as a resource and sanctuary for universal lot. I don't care whether you call it the Easter Bunny.

284
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay matter to me what I'm asking you is whether you have access to it for sanctuary support.

285
00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you access it and support for yourself. I don't care what your family doesn't care about you. Okay.

286
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.550
I

287
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:35.070
Ateeq Dean: I watch YouTube videos on universal law and stuff like that and positive vibrations and what you put out there in the universe. I watched, stuff like that. And that's my way of having my support system through it.

288
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you do it, tell me a story. When was the last time you saw it as a as a sort of a coping skill, something came up and you went to it to feel better. Tell me a story.

289
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The answer might be. I never do.

290
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.390
Ateeq Dean: And yeah, I don't really. I mean, I think about it. I go to sleep.

291
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So my invitation to you is to play with that, just like you would the hobby, just like you would for some people it's a coloring book it's going for a walk. Yeah, reading a book, picking up the baby or sewing or knitting, whatever.

292
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, you may want to play with that a little bit. When you say for you, your trigger might be up uncertainty about the future.

293
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.770
Ateeq Dean: Let me. Am I making you nosy

294
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: No, sorry, I just read some coffee and maybe Burke.

295
00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have your condition that makes me. Whatever. Let's move on. So what I'm suggesting to you is that when you have one of those those negative thoughts of low

296
00:34:53.790 --> 00:35:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can't control the future, what if something catastrophic happens that you catch it and that you go and do hobby.

297
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Or see what happens if you actually go watch one of those videos. See if you like it, see if 10 minutes passes. See if you're like oh my gosh, an hour has passed, and I'm not even thinking about a craving. I'm not even worried anymore about trying to control my future.

298
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To see what I'm trying to get at. Use it as a coping skill as because for some people, we would be saying, Okay, let's do a meditation. Let's do a prayer.

299
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right or not. Some people have no spiritual connection at all. And they call a friend, um, you know what I mean, that's fine. I don't care. I'm not hung up on what you do.

300
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:51.180
Ateeq Dean: Oh, I know. I know. Well, what I've been doing to is, yeah, I do have my word job that I go to to work and and all that.

301
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Work.

302
00:35:54.990 --> 00:36:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're off duty. You can't go into work. You've got to have other ones. That's what I'm getting at. I

303
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.120
Ateeq Dean: I started this other projects.

304
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:10.410
Ateeq Dean: I didn't get to finish it. But yeah, I started. I'm doing shelves at a smoke shop.

305
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:18.900
Ateeq Dean: Right, there's like 30 of them. I'm doing I'm doing this. I'm doing le for them. I'm doing LED lighting up a cases.

306
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.050
Ateeq Dean: So I started just started Saturday nine

307
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that project at home so that you could be doing it at home if you needed to

308
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:35.940
Ateeq Dean: Know, I go to the shop and they start there. I do it there because their display shelves are there so

309
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That takes getting in a car getting ready. I want you to have something that takes two seconds to do

310
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.430
Two seconds to do two seconds.

311
00:36:48.750 --> 00:37:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can't get in between, let's say you have a catastrophic thought, Oh my gosh, I worry about the future. You've got to be able to have access to resources, taking a bath. Miss massaging with yummy smelling lotion.

312
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you see, we've got to have stuff that's not only long term love the project idea totally love it, but we also have to have right that that diet for Malik breathing is a good one. When we can self regulate we need things that can happen, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Yeah, but

313
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.100
Ateeq Dean: When I was doing opiates.

314
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.500
Ateeq Dean: roxy's

315
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:34.890
Ateeq Dean: coping mechanism was I blocked off so much my best coping mechanism was to sleep.

316
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then that's

317
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be to go to. That's not it, then, that is not it.

318
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

319
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you got it. Because what that says to the psyche is I can't be in my solution that's escape.

320
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.150
Ateeq Dean: Now see, that's what I

321
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the same. That's the same know what what I'm introducing to you has to do with getting into things that you're passionate about things that remind you, I can stay alert excited enthusiastic inspired. I like who I am. I'm in my solution sleep says I can't solve this

322
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:29.370
Ateeq Dean: And I know of course we do need our sleep, but I don't don't sleep like more

323
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:39.090
Ateeq Dean: When I was depressed. I mean, I sleep. Yes, of course. I sleep and then I will go to work. But, you know, we all need our sleep, but I don't see

324
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Was. Let's start over. Okay.

325
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.070
Ateeq Dean: I'm hard to talk to

326
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.330
Now,

327
00:38:49.830 --> 00:39:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just keep it nice and simple what we're talking about right now are coping skills. I want to have a nice long list for you. I want you to have it. And once you have it posted everywhere so that if the thought comes to mind.

328
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to use or you start to romanticize something that you catch it quickly and you go do this list.

329
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care if sleep is one of them. But it can't be your only one work can't be your only one because you're not on shift project, you might be snowed in I need stuff that you can get to

330
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Set in a second and a YouTube video might be something. So what I'm inviting is that he remember it when you start to worry about the future maybe not going to food salt, sugar, but going instead to let me feed the soul.

331
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean nourish if I'm afraid because that's what concern is a worry, it's actually fear I can't control the future, what's going to happen. Well, of course, you're afraid you're

332
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No one can we don't know what's going to happen in the future. I don't have only getting hit by a bus later on today.

333
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, well, I don't have a lot of buses down my street so it's pretty low statistical likelihood

334
00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do know if a stress happens what I have to do and I want that for you to

335
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we're building right now. Would you be willing to add a few more. What can you do right in your house quickly.

336
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To distract you, and to get in to your passions and things you enjoy what could you do

337
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.010
Ateeq Dean: Take shower shower.

338
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Shower. Nice. Nice. Nice.

339
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.750
Ateeq Dean: That's up to me.

340
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. So before you sit there and feed the neural network because what will happen is you'll have

341
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The neural network all the history and memories and thoughts, the senses the smells the taste all of that you have lots and lots of wiring in your brain that has to do with that history of all that drug use. There's, there was a lot. There were years of it right

342
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So the second case, you have a certain smell smell smells a really strong one.

343
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It can get you into that neural network and you might start to feed it with. Well, I could just do one or I could just get away and you said, Oh that was so great. It was so great.

344
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're spending time seconds, even in that neural network. What we want you to do is immediately.

345
00:41:44.070 --> 00:42:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go there. You cannot entertain it. The longer you spend in that thought process not neural network it increase the length of your rationalize it and that's when the scary stuff happens. So my point is, as quickly as you possibly can. You want to get into doing something healthy

346
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.790
Ateeq Dean: I see. Okay.

347
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.610
Ateeq Dean: So yeah that's that's

348
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.650
Ateeq Dean: A good way for me to do is to take a nice hot shower.

349
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's all.

350
00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:20.100
Ateeq Dean: I roll into it because it happens, it happens. I've had thoughts, you know, a lot of them come from.

351
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.960
Ateeq Dean: You know, watching my dad at the casino to does that just happened.

352
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:47.670
Ateeq Dean: I just remember, you know, there was good times we had there because my mom and dad, we all used to go there was times where she could go to and I just remember you know now that they don't really do much a stay at home all day so I don't really get to take my mom out like I used to.

353
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:58.380
Ateeq Dean: Add. She doesn't believe in, like, getting out of her room. So my mind will take me off. I remember when I used to take your mom and dad at the casino.

354
00:42:59.070 --> 00:42:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

355
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.060
Ateeq Dean: And the crazy thing was to I was on the oxy cotton when I was taking them to the casino. So that's like

356
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: A double whammy.

357
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Places. It is a is probably going to have a connection to that that substance use on neural network and I really recommend you don't know there

358
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

359
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:33.990
Ateeq Dean: That's what happened. It took me to those thoughts to remember used to bring a mom and dad here and then oh, like, yeah, maybe I should go for a little bit.

360
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.290
Yes.

361
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:38.220
Ateeq Dean: What do you

362
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.000
Ateeq Dean: Do anything. I didn't take a nice hot shower.

363
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:44.130
Ateeq Dean: Think about it.

364
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What I remember is I lost 1800 dollars. How did my wife feel, how do I feel that's not what I believe and I don't believe

365
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: In in adding more uncertainty to my family. You need to force yourself. I know it, it seems like so what I'm trying to tell you is it's so big that all those visits to the casino and substance use and family if you stay over there. The only thing you need to think about is the good stuff.

366
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to seem reasonable and logical that you go, you've got a force and everybody thinks, Oh, it's just going to be so easy. No, you have to turn it on. You have to turn your attention. Oh my gosh.

367
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: As if it was a hot coal someone just put in your hand. Oh my gosh, I can't have that thought. Take a hot shower.

368
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.310
Ateeq Dean: Why does that happen. That's crazy. But yeah, that happens to me. That's right.

369
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's so many neural connections. There's so much wiring and the brain. It doesn't have a moral opinion. It basically says all of this.

370
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get a dopamine hit. And because we're wired to survive and we are reinforced by that tiny bit of

371
00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Positive. I don't mean it's saying, yeah, go do those things that make you feel good because it wants you to live. It's just an organic thing, but you have a more evolved part of your brain. This part the frontal cortex.

372
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you go, that's just ridiculous. I'm more than just an animal that only you know is is is focused on a dopamine receptor till I'm in. I'm in a family and I, this is what I believe in. And I can feel good. I can, I can be patient. I value patience and forethought I'm not just an animal.

373
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we, we are. I mean, we've got that part. Our reptilian part of our brain, but it's the least evolved part of our brain.

374
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We also have this really beautiful part up front. That's it hasn't been around quite as long

375
00:45:50.520 --> 00:46:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Which was okay. You're being ridiculous. Don't even spend time in that thought. Let me just go to the next right thing and guess what you know what you have, you have the next day. Well, you don't have to go to your wife and say,

376
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I just lost 1800 dollars.

377
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a whole day. We don't have to do that anymore. Now you have an open, honest relationship you have nothing to hide.

378
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:21.150
Ateeq Dean: The part that touched me the most was that she wasn't out about. I mean, of course, she is upset about the last two

379
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:34.800
Ateeq Dean: What upset her was I didn't tell her I was honest with her and I told her what it will. What am I one and she said it didn't even matter if you want to do you lie to me. And that's what matters to me, you know,

380
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: For a lot of people. It has to do with I'm your best friend. I'm the one person of all the people in the world.

381
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we trust each other. It is a precious thing that that lovers have that these spouses, that these partners have that we say

382
00:46:53.550 --> 00:47:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll treat everybody like this but you know you're the one I will, I will, I will share all that is vulnerable about me and I will trust you with it.

383
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And she wants that she wants to be that person and I imagine you want to be there for her to that's what is so intimate about two people they hold

384
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All that warm, fuzzy underbelly stuff, all that stuff that's that they could hurt you. With but they don't they love you. She wants that feeling. And when you don't share with her what's going on, she's not that person.

385
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.030
Right, yeah.

386
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

Ateeq Dean: Eight o'clock. Yeah, the 25th.

391
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This way, you're just coming off work right.

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. Let's see.

Ateeq Dean: I'm more awake at this time.

394
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.280
Ateeq Dean: But luck is where I'm out of it. I can we

395
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Consider homework. Consider homework fatigue is you

Gwenevere Abriel: And going and watching a video just see what happens. Let that be a little invitation for homework for you.

398
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's read a little universal law. See how you feel. After that, see where your mind goes, because there's no connection to that neural network over here that negative stuff. I'm thinking like there is

399
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my dear. I will see you on Monday. I hope you
