00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.000
Mike: Jessica.

2
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.200
Mike: Oh, it's been a

3
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.970
Mike: It's been a wild week

4
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:34.170
Mike: It's been so crazy. I don't know my my hours have got an alternative around. I mean, ever since I've been like under this core and being, being a I'm like everything's all messed up. I missed meeting on Monday.

5
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.220
Mike: And I ended up

6
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.500
Mike: Sleeping all afternoon.

7
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:49.980
Mike: I'm like my hours are just totally, totally shot right now and it's like starting to affect me. You know, because I wasn't able to, like, I'm not able to get to sleep on

8
00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:10.140
Mike: What normal time is I'm not burning off any of the energy I normally do at work and it's just it's just getting all mixed up. You know, like I've lost track. And I didn't snap, what day it was for a minute, and then I did, and I fell asleep, and it's just been it's been ridiculous.

9
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you showing any sentence.

10
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.970
Mike: Um, yeah, just

11
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.190
Mike: Like uneasy, my stomach has been a little icky, um,

12
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:40.740
Mike: I haven't shown any like fever or anything like that. My stomach's a little bit jacked. But I think that might be because I've been taking a because I missed a meeting, I didn't get a prescription. So I

13
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.800
Mike: Kind of with what I had last trip just been taking whatever I can just to get by tiger my prescription, which I think there might be one there now.

14
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.360
Mike: But

15
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.040
Mike: So it's just been crazy

16
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:03.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I was wondering where you were on my name. And I thought, well, I wonder if the symptoms started to present itself.

17
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I'm when I'm going to hear from you about that coming I sell my gosh, I hope, as well. So thanks for reaching out on my

18
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.580
Mike: Feeling was like

19
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.220
Mike: Starting to get a little bit icky, um,

20
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:27.630
Mike: And I thought that that might have been a related symptom, and in which, in case it kind of is. But I think what mine was was just from everything that's going on.

21
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, with less medication. Yeah.

22
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I

23
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.950
Mike: And I was intending fully to be there because I need it.

24
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.760
Mike: You know, and it is so bad that um yeah

25
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.210
Mike: It just been horrible, but I got in touch with everybody that I think I need to so far. And we'll be

26
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.050
Mike: Doing a group as soon as possible.

27
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, anyway, thoughts, what's been coming up for you.

28
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.060
Mike: Um,

29
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.770
Mike: I don't know, it's been

30
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.410
Mike: A lot of

31
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.220
Mike: Just trying to resist the, you know, trying to find stuff to pass the time.

32
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.530
Mike: Has been really difficult.

33
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.740
Mike: Constant.

34
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.720
Mike: Thought of like going and going to the normal spot that I would use on is

35
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.290
Mike: Been presenting itself real frequently

36
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.760
Mike: Just

37
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:44.820
Mike: Trying to rationalize you know both I catch both my addictive mind and my sober mind all working

38
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I

39
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.380
Mike: Catch my addictive mind trying to rationalize

40
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.660
Mike: A reason to use. And so I am catching that and and

41
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.070
Mike: You know, getting a dose of reality that that's not actually

42
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.050
Mike: Something to do

43
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.720
Mike: You know, and that's what got me here in the first place. Team causing problems for

44
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.740
Mike: As long as

45
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Challenging those thoughts because

46
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:35.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The red side thoughts, but definitely present itself convince you that you know there's going to be okay. You just use months and we feel so much better. Nobody has to know different things to give us a sense of temporary comfort in the midst of everything that you're experiencing.

47
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's so much uncertainty right now, but one thing you can be certain to is that if you use. It's only a temporary fix. It's not only to make you feel better, any of these thoughts are coming up for you throughout the week.

48
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.160
Mike: On gap probably

49
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.540
Mike: All of them at one point or another, um, I like I said

50
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:15.150
Mike: I've tried to rationalize like my catch my addictive mind trying to rationalize it to myself, I'm in is I've gone through probably every single one of those thoughts at one point or another, during this last week.

51
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.850
Mike: At least once a day.

52
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.840
Mike: There's, there's probably a few of them that

53
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.940
Mike: I've told myself.

54
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.150
Mike: If more than once, you know,

55
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.220
Mike: I'm

56
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.140
Mike: Like I said, I usually will try to do something different. I find that like

57
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.290
Mike: I was snacking and eating a bit more

58
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.070
Mike: Probably smoking more cigarettes just

59
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.940
Mike: Trying to pass and I'm mostly, I guess.

60
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:12.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I wanted to share a video with you and see which which characteristic you identify with most but before I do that, is there anything that you want to discuss that I can help you with in this moment.

61
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:25.230
Mike: That's not right at this particular moment. Um, are we going to be able to see each other again next week, or is that

62
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, you can.

63
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.870
Mike: Okay, cool. Um, yeah. What I think I'd like to do is maybe

64
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:38.070
Mike: Write down the things and and then kind of be a little bit better prepared for

65
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.740
Mike: That appointment like this, you know,

66
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.590
Mike: I'm, as I said, you know, it's just

67
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:55.200
Mike: There's been a few issues and in this week. And so it wasn't quite prepared as much as I wanted to be. And I think would be able to be come on next meeting.

68
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.880
Mike: So,

69
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.250
Mike: That would be awesome if we could

70
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.020
Mike: At some point, next week.

71
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:09.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, well, do you want to keep it is easier to just keep the same time in the same day.

72
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.760
Mike: Yeah, that would be fine. That would work.

73
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.070
Mike: Well with me for my schedule.

74
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Today is 16

75
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How about Thursday the 23rd at six o'clock.

76
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.180
What works great.

77
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: April know that you showed up.

78
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For the session as well.

79
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

80
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.670
Mike: And I did my week we bomb.

81
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What we're. Yes, I saw it. I saw that you did your survey. So we were expecting you, um,

82
00:09:50.580 --> 00:10:04.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I can, I can understand because I'm still doing my structure. It looks just a little different and I lost track of these so I can imagine all of that being taken away and you have into self isolate

83
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like how you would lose track of the days is

84
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.640
Mike: Where I'm like

85
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.760
Mike: Totally discombobulated with the outside world right now.

86
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.240
It's kinda

87
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.940
Mike: I'm ready to to get out.

88
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: when when when this field, the field.

89
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.880
Mike: I will be

90
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.470
Mike: Gone on

91
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.800
Mike: I believe it's Monday of this next week.

92
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:32.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

93
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.170
Mike: Bye. How like

94
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.650
Mike: Seven days look a little less than seven days away. But

95
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.350
Mike: So far, so good.

96
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:53.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm going to share my screen with you and I've had sessions, back to back. So I'm going to stand up. I hope it doesn't distract you, but

97
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.550
Yeah.

98
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:16.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Understand how conflict arises between people, often in dramatic or intense relationships or interactions theory. Okay. And it was

99
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.270
Mike: conceived by a guy.

100
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Called Stephen Cartman in 1968

101
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:29.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it involves three different roles one that's kind of cold, a one down role and two that are called one approach.

102
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.170
Is three roles. The victim, the rescuer

103
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.030
persecutor

104
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:46.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I think understanding how these roles work can really help us to identify how we could be resolving potentially destructive interactions that are quite

105
00:11:47.550 --> 00:12:00.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Draining on our energy. So let's start with the victim role. I think the victim role is quite self explanatory. It's the person who feels helpless and powerless, like they can never cut a break.

106
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or they can never get ahead in life. They often think things like, you know, this always happens to me.

107
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:16.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another role in this drama triangle is the rescuer and this person is someone who takes responsibility for other people's problems.

108
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:25.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they kind of make it their own problems. But at the same time, they don't really look at their own life, which could in fact be a complete mess.

109
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they'll say people who might be going through a difficult time and think, oh look at that person you know they need help. I'm nice so I'll help them or maybe something a bit more parental like if that person did what I said they'd be happy.

110
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.840
And I think the dynamic that we often say play out between the victim.

111
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:58.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the rescuer is something that we see in movies and, you know, romantic comedies all the time. It's something that we almost think is normal.

112
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:11.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it really is an unhealthy interaction. So the third row on this triangle is a persecutor. This is a person who is frustrated. They kind of self righteous and a bit of a bullied.

113
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, and they might think things like you know they're wrong. And I'm right may need to do what I say.

114
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:25.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or that person will get what's coming to them. Another thing that's really important to recognize it at this triangle is that each of these roles move between each other.

115
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:36.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, you know, the rescuer can become a prostitute or or the prosecutor can become the victim, the victim can become a persecutor so they all kind of move around.

116
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:48.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another concept that's really important to understand when talking about the drama triangle is this idea of the starting gate, we tend to have this one role that we most naturally sort of entry into

117
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:55.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So for instance, you know one person might often go straight to the victim law where someone else might jump into the rescue.

118
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:07.620
The other thing that's really interesting about this is that starting get role, sort of, is part of what we see other an identity and like I said before, we shift from one role to the other.

119
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:21.000
Inevitably, we all end up in the victim role feeling powerless and helpless and then I able to do anything. And that's why it's really important to work out strategies for how to get out of this triangle.

120
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.130
So I guess that brings me to the next question. How do we get out of this drama triangle.

121
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:36.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's take it by looking at each role again. So in the one down victim role, we need to become a survivor. In order to do this.

122
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:49.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We need to think like a problem solver and ask ourselves questions like what do I want and what steps can I take to get what I want another useful thing to do is to reflect on the good things that are going away.

123
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.000
So we can make a note of it in a calendar or diary.

124
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.280
You know, ask ourselves questions like What are three things that I'm grateful for today.

125
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.280
Or at the end of each week we could ask ourselves, what did I change this week.

126
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:16.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's move on to the rescue role. Again, if this is where you tend to find yourself sitting, you need to think of yourself as a teacher or a coach.

127
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Rather than as a rescuer you need to remember the golden rule that teaching a man to fish.

128
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:28.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you need to support and encourage the person in ways to identify and solve their problems rather than rushing into solve it for them.

129
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:36.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can also things like, what is it that you want to say happen in a situation or what do you think you can do to changes.

130
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Also, you need to make sure that you set boundaries setting boundaries around the time that you're able to listen to the place and and letting them know that is really important.

131
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:53.550
In some ways it's a similar situation with the starting gate persecutor who like the rescue up but some cells in the sort of one not power powerful position.

132
00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:01.290
The difference is with this role is that you need to become a challenge, need to be firm but fair in your approach to people.

133
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:14.940
And to help the person recognize how you're feeling, you need to sort of address the consequences of their actions and set boundaries. So for instance, you could say something like, if you if you keep your side of the agreement, I can Kate long

134
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.830
As we're the rescuer. It's important to remember to set these boundaries and recognize that this isn't your problem to solve.

135
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:37.440
By freeing ourselves from this drama triangle, we are able to have happier, healthier relationships with people. We won't feel so drained and powerless and will also be able to identify toxic relationships that we may in fact be better off without

136
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is a model to help us understand how

137
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We thought

138
00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:09.780
Mike: I was crazy. I could recognize myself in each of the positions and like some of the other people in their positions and I was glad to see that it does interchange because it does interchange like totally I

139
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.330
Mike: It's crazy. Um,

140
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:19.170
Mike: I was kind of almost thinking at times like there was like some bipolar illness or something going on but

141
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.380
Mike: I think it's sometimes you get operating in that circle or triangle rather

142
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:26.370
And

143
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.680
Mike: It's not like

144
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.270
Mike: It's real easy to get to stay in that kind of

145
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.650
Mike: Where that pocket.

146
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.460
Yeah.

147
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:43.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they see that as a starting gate. So there's one that you kind of naturally I'm aligned to

148
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:57.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Probably depending on the circumstances or the individual you're around, you may operate or reshipped what your role is, has that been your experience. Yeah. I would definitely agree, um,

149
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.820
Mike: Because I think typically I jumped into like the rescuer role.

150
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.730
Mike: A lot of times, you know, and

151
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:18.360
Mike: It's exactly correct. A lot of times I'll focus on the problems that other maybe others have rather than my own and I do it in my head I'm doing it like selfless me but

152
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I Steve.

153
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:32.760
Mike: Were at times. It's probably better for me selfishly focus on myself for a while yet my backyard clean so to speak first before I you know anything about anybody else's

154
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

155
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said that sometimes you identify with other roles to

156
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When do you typically take on the other rooms as persecutor and victim what's going on.

157
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.980
Mike: Um, I went like pump billing gown arm.

158
00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:00.270
Mike: Or whatever, I think, at times like I've taken on the victim role, maybe I'm

159
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:07.470
Mike: Or like if I'm feeling defensive defensive maybe

160
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.690
Mike: Being good times.

161
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:32.610
Mike: That could take place. It's not typical that I mean like it's more predominant that I go I think into the other role, but I can recognize times that I have gone into the other role and as well as like when I'm talking to my small youngest brother, I'm

162
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:41.760
Mike: I'm whom had substance abuse problems. I was more the persecutor type of role, you know,

163
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that before your addiction started or during the course of your I did.

164
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.830
Mike: Um, before and during both

165
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.400
Mike: Mean

166
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:03.810
Mike: I mean, I guess it was back when I was only taking pain medication.

167
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.990
Mike: That I was being prescribed on

168
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:15.240
Mike: And I, there was a period of time where I may where I felt like I had everything under control still

169
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In so

170
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:25.350
Mike: That was kind of the place. I was at. And that was right around the time that my mother had passed away.

171
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.740
Mike: About a year and a half ago or longer.

172
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.390
Mike: Oh, yeah.

173
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.730
Mike: Almost two years ago.

174
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:47.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it just said the addiction, kind of just snuck up on you ever really would imagine that this would be you know your fate and so

175
00:20:49.620 --> 00:21:00.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then all of a sudden, this happens. So a lot of people tend to take on the persecutor roles when they have or they know someone that is an active addiction.

176
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:11.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In this, especially if it's hardcore drugs, then it takes on that persecutor role because you think in your purse security role that you're helping and you're going to commit

177
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:20.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The person to stop. So in a sense, you have that rescuer and persecutor role that you're using interchangeably.

178
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:29.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because the goal is, I'm going to rescue you, and I'm going to get you out of visited the state. This is the tactic component to you.

179
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can see more. So how the rescuer and the persecutor role could be used interchangeably. Because in at the core of the rescue of natural starting gate, you may use a persecutor role as a tactic. When you are tips to rescue aren't being, you know,

180
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.210
Mike: I here to her right

181
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.020
One.

182
00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:05.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And in the victim state. Have you been been like that. Has that been your current situation, what will you identify most with in this current state.

183
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.180
Mike: I'm probably bar for the last

184
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.970
Mike: Little while the last three weeks, probably are so I'm

185
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:22.410
Mike: Just kind of overwhelmed with some sensations. I'm there.

186
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:35.280
Mike: You know that. And then, you know, some insomnia and then of course you know doing their cyber self isolation feel is definitely compound, get it.

187
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:36.930
Mike: So,

188
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's been

189
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:47.160
Mike: I would say a lot recently. You know that particular role, I would say as being as a more lately than

190
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.080
Than usual before

191
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One small victories.

192
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Celebrate for this past week.

193
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.900
Mike: My red flag thought

194
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:32.880
Mike: Finding ways to find encouragement. I'm to push myself further and not look back

195
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The fact that even in this isolation.

196
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That is where the red flag. That's a brand because you got nothing but time

197
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:53.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's only so many distractions. You can do and spite that you still able

198
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:55.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To be

199
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.000
Mike: Back and the

200
00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:06.600
Mike: Good. So is it probably helped me that over this week I'm not allowed to leave. Um, because it may have

201
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.360
Mike: I may have been able to talk myself into going maybe some place to gotten something

202
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:23.670
Mike: You know, or had been out and said, Hey, well, you know, I can just gold. Maybe over here. So you probably help I can maybe during a couple of days.

203
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.440
Mike: After that,

204
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.000
Mike: You know happening.

205
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.990
Mike: There were there were a couple of days that

206
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:37.440
Mike: That I could tell it was like pretty heavy heavier than normal. Yeah.

207
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's talk about your

208
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:50.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your current environment. So you live with your girlfriend, but with everything that's going on to she's still there, are you

209
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.730
Mike: Pitching yeah yeah I'm just gonna hold different room.

210
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.020
Mike: I'm thankfully it's a good size home and

211
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.990
Mike: We, you know, there's not a lot of us, you know, so there's room I'm

212
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.560
Mike: Like throughout the house so

213
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.510
Mike: You know, we're able to

214
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:17.220
Mike: Be able to be, you know, to talk, but I'm not. I'm able to isolate off and it doesn't really affect a whole lot of the house like

215
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:18.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You would

216
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.310
Mike: Want to be

217
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.030
Mike: Which is good because I never probably be a problem to

218
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:31.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know about phone conversations will have you been able to contact in the necklace.

219
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.510
Mike: Um, you know, like

220
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.040
Mike: I think I've probably talked to more people recently and it will be them before.

221
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.320
Mike: In previous

222
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.880
Weeks, just because

223
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:54.480
Mike: I think subconsciously I'm wanting to get out so bad. And so I find myself like reaching out more than normal.

224
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:05.130
Mike: And maybe talking more than I normally would, you know, and where normally I'm just like, whoa, they don't need to know or whatever, you know, and I'll

225
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.610
Mike: Kind of

226
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.350
Mike: Oh man, certain conversations, maybe at times where I find myself.

227
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.810
Mike: In, you know, divulging

228
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.420
Mike: And going into those conversations

229
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when we met last week you gave me a lot of history about

230
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:29.790
Family

231
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:41.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And your course of addiction and just what brought you to the program. Now, any family relationships that you want to discuss

232
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.080
Mike: Um,

233
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.560
Mike: I was thinking maybe that stuff that we could get on next week.

234
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.370
Mike: Because I do have some stuff. But I want to be a little bit more prepared to write down like whatever thing that I kind of wanted to

235
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.540
Mike: Discuss within that

236
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.190
Mike: Little bit more.

237
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:06.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or even right now. Did you get enough rest. Do you want to make it a 30 minute session. That would be nice. I mean, I've

238
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:12.120
Mike: Been getting like drowsy around this time and then like all fall asleep for a couple hours and I'll wake up.

239
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.750
Mike: And then

240
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.760
Mike: It's just an ongoing fight.

241
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.060
Mike: For the time being, I think, you know, until I kind of get some regularity kind of working for me again.

242
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:31.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand. I understand. Thanks for showing up, um, despite how you're feeling that's honorable thing to do. I'm firm.

243
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sure.

244
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.770
Mike: So that would be next.

245
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.440
Mike: Thursday at 2PM

246
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:47.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then you can whatever feels like a stressor current just my past dressing that you want to discuss. We can talk about it in the next session.

247
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.660
Mike: Okay, perfect.

248
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.860
Mike: That would work great.

249
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, okay.

250
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.170
Mike: Thank you.

251
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.920
Mike: Have a good one, you too. Bye bye.
