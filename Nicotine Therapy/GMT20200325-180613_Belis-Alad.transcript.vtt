00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.930
Galaxy S8: Oh, good.

15
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:36.840
Belis Aladag: And so I will be your physician here at bright heart health, taking care of you. Regarding your the opioid use disorder and and I believe you. It started with some pain problems. Is that right,

16
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:55.710
Galaxy S8: Yeah. So, what it is is about seven years ago I was in a motorcycle accident and had neck injury back injury and thought that seven years ago from 50 to seven years ago, I thought I could just, you know, I'm

17
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:07.500
Galaxy S8: Traditionally a tough guy and I just thought, you know, I'm going to snap out of this, and it's no problem. After about four years, I realized that a Jen other factors.

18
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.920
Galaxy S8: That wasn't going to happen. So I was in extreme appreciating pain went through physical therapy and did a whole lot of

19
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.220
Galaxy S8: Stuff to try to

20
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:32.130
Galaxy S8: Have comfort. In the meantime, I became diabetic. I'm not like this, I guess I'm a serious diabetes, a serious. So, um, anyway.

21
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.260
Galaxy S8: So I had

22
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.060
Galaxy S8: I was on oxycodone for about a year and a half, and it became to the point where was not working for me period at all.

23
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.490
Galaxy S8: So I ended up stopping it on my arm. I just when one day decided, I'm not going to take it anymore because I wasn't really working. And so I quit taking it.

24
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.010
Galaxy S8: DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

25
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.080
Galaxy S8: How I was dealing with pain, but just toughing it out kind of sorta and then I ended up getting becoming a diabetic and and then

26
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.300
Galaxy S8: Ended up having diabetic foot pain I run a nonprofit.

27
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:35.520
Galaxy S8: Basically, I am a boss. So I was worried about losing my job at the problem was within two or three hours, I'd be in so much pain that have to come home and literally lay on my bed. That was the only thing that made the pain, where I could could handle it.

28
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.880
Galaxy S8: Basically

29
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:51.960
Galaxy S8: That nonprofit started suffering because I was delegating and, you know, not being hands on it. It was starting to affect performance and everything good about the nonprofit and

30
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.150
Galaxy S8: So,

31
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.020
Galaxy S8: Kind of had to figure out what to do in the process. I've been in a lot of pain.

32
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.450
Galaxy S8: Neck pain and back pain, lower back pain, as has been excruciating.

33
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.270
Galaxy S8: In the process,

34
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.530
Galaxy S8: I tried Suboxone and

35
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:26.640
Galaxy S8: Yet, I'm on Suboxone right now. I'm not prescribed, unfortunately. But I tried it and it was the only thing that relieved from my pain.

36
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.250
Galaxy S8: So once a day, I would do it.

37
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.170
Galaxy S8: Two strips and that

38
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:52.680
Galaxy S8: Would make it all day. I could work, come home, take a shower. Go to bed, and I'd be good till the next day I'm. Did you say to take a few. Yeah.

39
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.910
Galaxy S8: Well, I tried one at first one was was fine and and then it would start

40
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:12.840
Galaxy S8: Wearing out through about halfway through the day. So okay, so yeah, I was taking two strips a day is what I was taking. That's what I take now, but I'm I'm pretty much out now.

41
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.070
Galaxy S8: I think I have enough for today. And that's it.

42
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.960
Galaxy S8: So I

43
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.190
Galaxy S8: I know other people on the Suboxone program and

44
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:32.610
Galaxy S8: It's really been a lifesaver for me and it's allowed me to be able to work full days and everything.

45
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.900
Galaxy S8: That's basically what I know. I don't have a lot of side effects with that.

46
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.000
Galaxy S8: And it gives me the pain relief that I need for all day.

47
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.670
Galaxy S8: Thank God you know

48
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.780
Belis Aladag: Thank God for that.

49
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.220
Galaxy S8: That's good. Okay, so you

50
00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:05.430
Belis Aladag: You found a solution that works for you. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I'm happy that to say we should continue it. Yeah. Let us do this and get you your two films a day.

51
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:15.420
Belis Aladag: So some insurances cover the film some cover the tablets. Regardless, they're the same thing. It's just, you know, generic version, whatever.

52
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:24.840
Belis Aladag: I'm going to try to order the film, since you're used to that. And, see, see what happens with that. Okay. Just so you know, make it substituted. If you want them to whatever

53
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.720
Galaxy S8: Right. And, you know, and the thing of it is is

54
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:36.180
Galaxy S8: I tried crowd them in the past and, you know, got bombing that stuff was caught my throat. One time I could no longer

55
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:45.210
Galaxy S8: Like I would almost vomit. And the same thing was happening with the strips as well. So I'm not so sure that the tablets wouldn't be a better thing.

56
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:56.550
Galaxy S8: Because the taste of it and all that. I'm more used to it. Now, I will tell you, I don't like bomb and I can do strips or tablet. So either way, it wouldn't matter to me.

57
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.040
Galaxy S8: I don't like to

58
00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.700
Belis Aladag: Look, the

59
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.610
Galaxy S8: East and stuff. When I go to rinse my mouth out

60
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.160
Galaxy S8: Sometimes I would like dry heave. But I never actually physically puked but

61
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.840
Galaxy S8: Um, so I don't like the taste of a lot of things like that. Like crowd and was like, I could never do it again afterwards but

62
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:29.490
Galaxy S8: My dosage for crowd them in order for it to be effective eight I got that the gel Cap thing, the machine to make my arm was 28 capsules. That was my daily dose. And so that was on

63
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:38.670
Galaxy S8: You know, I didn't know what that was doing to my body either so so and Suboxone seems to be easier on my body as well.

64
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:53.280
Belis Aladag: Yes. So here's what I will tell you create them is available online and stuff. And people kind of say, oh, you know, it's the safer thing, whatever, but actually it's actually an opiate it's an opioid so you

65
00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:07.380
Belis Aladag: Can consider it very, very similar to Oxycodone and hydrocodone whatever so and and it's problematic because people don't really realize that they think it's like oh it's natural. It is natural, but it is an opioid so

66
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.690
Belis Aladag: Okay, so I've actually had patients addicted.

67
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.830
Belis Aladag: To create them unable to get off and then we have to put them on Suboxone to get

68
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:22.140
Galaxy S8: Gotcha. So yeah, I just got Suboxone works for my pain. I've never, I just can't even begin to tell you it's like

69
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:38.070
Galaxy S8: It's like the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I, and I say that with the fact that I get to work and my my nonprofit isn't suffering and and I'm very, very pleased with with that.

70
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:46.890
Belis Aladag: Thank God. Okay, so we'll continue with that you have diabetes type two. Tell me what medications do you take for that.

71
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:55.200
Galaxy S8: Just metformin and they were given me another tablet that kind of help were taken at night.

72
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:04.680
Galaxy S8: Yeah Nortriptyline I would take and and that worked for a little bit, but then stopped working.

73
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:16.470
Galaxy S8: Also has taken a marks marks or cam line. Yeah, I was taking that that helped in the beginning to but then they quit working Suboxone throwley. The only thing

74
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:25.080
Galaxy S8: That hasn't, you know, other than the one strip what going to two. I haven't needed any more than two strips and it's been

75
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:39.690
Galaxy S8: You know, it seems to work for the full amount until I get home and getting bad. And that's really what I need in order to continue. I'm only 52 I probably are going to be the guy that works. Until the day it falls over, that'll be my retirement, unfortunately.

76
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:47.100
Galaxy S8: Unless we start our rehab center. We're working on doing that 30 bed rehab center and

77
00:09:48.240 --> 00:10:01.440
Galaxy S8: But that's going to be quite a while, down the road before I can get that established California certified rehab center and that is in order to make the golden arrows maybe possibly actually golden that would be good. Right.

78
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.280
Belis Aladag: I like that idea. You should do that.

79
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.710
Galaxy S8: Right. Yeah, that's what we're working towards

80
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:08.970
Man.

81
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.460
Belis Aladag: Is your nonprofit related with substance use as well.

82
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:22.410
Galaxy S8: Um, it, it's, it's all the our clients that we deal with. We have a rescue mission right now and all the clients that we deal with.

83
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.960
Galaxy S8: Have the childhood traumas. The addictions. Rather, it's

84
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:41.250
Galaxy S8: You know it all based on after 15 years of doing it. It's all based on how we raise our kids is the outcome. And this is what we deal with in and literally

85
00:10:42.030 --> 00:11:03.750
Galaxy S8: I think I did the math is 130 30 bed facility would be $105,000 a month, pretty much the programs we run now for the last 15 years have been all free programs to help people for free. And with that in mind, my salary started out 1200 dollars a month.

86
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:14.610
Galaxy S8: For the first five years. Nobody got paid. We I had a business and I closed it to pursue the nonprofit and we went five years from

87
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:27.480
Galaxy S8: I was making about back then. Way back in the day was about 5700 a month and my cleaning company I had and I had to close that down and go from that income to

88
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.690
Galaxy S8: We were on welfare caches food stamps medical had

89
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:57.000
Galaxy S8: And we would go get food boxes and stuff for our family of five and so nobody got paid for five years and then once I did get paid. And it was 12 I was 300 a week so 1200 a month and that salary has remained the same, even through all the windfalls and things that we accomplished.

90
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.290
Galaxy S8: You know 15 years later, we've been in in that building this place for 15 years so

91
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.810
Belis Aladag: labor of love.

92
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:20.760
Galaxy S8: Wow. Yeah. It's a Labor Day long and but you know in in the sense that never was. Hey, let's do this. And it's going to become this great salary package or income. It was lets me to need and Crescent City.

93
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:29.520
Galaxy S8: And and i have one of the best wife's in the world. Anyway, so she's been my big support system through it all, and

94
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:40.140
Galaxy S8: We've been able to get this far. And we just last year and this virus thing is affected us in a negative way, we just

95
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:48.180
Galaxy S8: WERE SCHEDULED TO DO $300,000 worth of work to our building in April, May and June, where we're going to be shut down.

96
00:12:48.690 --> 00:13:02.220
Galaxy S8: To do all these upgrades to become a 52 bed rescue mission and because of this outbreak and when they do the stimulus package to everybody. All non a central grants are going to be suspended.

97
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:11.340
Galaxy S8: until further notice. So everything that we had contractors and all that has been put on hold, from the planet.

98
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:25.860
Galaxy S8: But hopefully we recover and that goes on. I mean, we're gonna remain hopeful and and, believe, believe for the best and just wait and see what happens. But yeah, we started another nonprofit called Mission Possible.

99
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.020
Galaxy S8: So was a

100
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:35.280
Galaxy S8: Faith Based 501 c three organization partnering with a secular

101
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.060
Galaxy S8: Mission Possible don't County.

102
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:59.070
Galaxy S8: To nonprofits sharing the same space with the vision. Ultimately, the five year plan was to build a brand new facility from the ground up. And we were well on the way to doing that and then taking our old facility and turning that into the rehab center.

103
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.390
Galaxy S8: Is me my wife graduating, she's

104
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:15.720
Galaxy S8: Doing her addiction studies and and and so we still got a window and a little bit of play room. We don't never we don't get goals and set them and then

105
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:30.720
Galaxy S8: You know, throw them away and start over. We just I guess we're going to be waiting just like everybody else's waiting to see what happens with the virus thing. But in the midst of all of it that that is the goal at this point we want to secure our family and

106
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.370
Galaxy S8: Make sure that you know the golden years are golden, so to speak.

107
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.030
Yeah.

108
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.530
Galaxy S8: Wow.

109
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:43.770
Belis Aladag: What a story, I commend you. What a story, you have a lot of commitment. Thank you.

110
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:51.030
Galaxy S8: Oh, and I was just 22 year IV drug user, she said they didn't know that I was

111
00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:06.870
Galaxy S8: Yes, I was on methamphetamines for 722 years I was addicted and I did 17 years of my life locked up in and out of prison.

112
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:21.810
Galaxy S8: When I started daily web ministries, I still have four months of Pearl left to do, to, to be off of it and be done and I celebrated my 21 years of off of math.

113
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:30.240
Galaxy S8: Last year, so it's going on 22 years I don't stay clean and sober because I did drink a little bit and

114
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:43.050
Galaxy S8: When I was in pain, that was another thing. And I just be honest, because I and the honest business and I'm very forthcoming I was drinking for a while to offset pain.

115
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:56.580
Galaxy S8: But I, but I haven't edited drinking over a year or so I don't have the same tendencies that I used to have when I get it, you know, like one shot of mass. I was named me drug user one shot of math and

116
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:04.410
Galaxy S8: I was on one and the only thing that really saved me was when I would never stop until they arrested me so

117
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:12.480
Galaxy S8: It was really a triumphant thing to be able to have control over, you know,

118
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:23.880
Galaxy S8: To be able to have a drink a glass of wine and not like it doesn't take over me so. But even though I haven't had a drink in over a year now. So because

119
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:32.070
Galaxy S8: Well, I'm a diabetic can be. And you know, I want to live. I have a six year old daughter to I have five kids all together.

120
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:48.150
Galaxy S8: Three girls and two boys and and one step son and. And the whole point, as is I want to live to, you know, marry my daughter, you know, see are married off and maybe get a grand get or two before I go meet my Maker, you know, so that's

121
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.360
Belis Aladag: It. That's so great are all the five things with you right now.

122
00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:06.030
Galaxy S8: Well, I have three adult kids. And then I have a six year old daughter Eliana, and I have a son that's just turned 14 Jacob.

123
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:18.840
Galaxy S8: Jacob. Okay. And they're all they're all with us. And then my step son Skylar still with us, but he's getting ready to turn 18 on the 31st and he'll be moving out like right about that time to as well so

124
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:29.880
Galaxy S8: So yeah, I have a lot to live for. I don't really, you know, like I said I to be able to have the ability to say, No, I don't want any

125
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:38.520
Galaxy S8: And then versus the old me was, you know, oh no, not only do I gotta have it. I want to have it and drink uncontrollably.

126
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:49.290
Galaxy S8: Have your first drink at seven in the morning to start your day. And, you know, of course, my life reflected all that lifestyle changes, but to have the ability

127
00:17:49.800 --> 00:18:00.600
Galaxy S8: To be able to control any kind of addiction, nothing has or nor would I ever allow anything to have control over me that way ever again. It's just, to me,

128
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.660
Galaxy S8: That's pretty special to be able to have that power to say, No, I'm good, you know,

129
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.210
Galaxy S8: Yes, that is huge that yeah

130
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:21.570
Belis Aladag: Absolutely, yeah. Okay, so I'm just putting in everything as we go along. I put in your diabetic.

131
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:38.880
Belis Aladag: Your type two diabetes. I also put type two diabetes with neuropathy. Because you mentioned on the foot pain. So that's from neuropathy. Okay. Um, I noted that are you are you also being given medication for blood pressure.

132
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.610
Belis Aladag: Acid reflux.

133
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:49.440
Belis Aladag: Yes. Um, let's see, what else do I see here, blood pressure, acid reflux. I think that's what I

134
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.170
Belis Aladag: See, yeah. Oprah law. Listen, a pro members all and then the metformin

135
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.770
Galaxy S8: Yeah, and I'm not taking that haven't been taking

136
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.900
Galaxy S8: The stuff for the diabetic foot pain at night. I don't take them to the longer

137
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.240
Belis Aladag: Nortriptyline thing I

138
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.700
Galaxy S8: Don't take that more but

139
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:17.250
Belis Aladag: OK. OK. So wow okay and then tell me about nicotine. Do you smoke or vapor, anything like that.

140
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.630
Galaxy S8: I do, baby.

141
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:28.200
Belis Aladag: Okay, um, remember that it can be dangerous to. I mean, I don't know if you've heard about them pneumonias and things

142
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:40.110
Belis Aladag: So, so just be careful with that. And if you feel when you got a lot on your plate. But if you feel like that's something you want to work on. We can always use nicotine replacement so

143
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:52.290
Belis Aladag: We could use like a patch and depending on how much you be if you want to patch throughout the day. And then if you still feel like they being you. We can use like laws and just little candies, or God

144
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.150
Galaxy S8: You know, just let me know.

145
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:54.900
I want

146
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:02.880
Belis Aladag: Okay, let's see. So the eight dash shoe. So, so okay if I give you the tablets on

147
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.870
Belis Aladag: See, are you medical by chance.

148
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.470
Galaxy S8: Yes.

149
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:17.070
Belis Aladag: You know what medical coverage is really weird, but they only covered the brand name is what I heard. So you know what I'm going to go there. I'm just going to do Suboxone film for you.

150
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:24.360
Galaxy S8: Okay, that's fine. I prefer that I'm, I'm, I've been doing the film's how I can make that work that that's that sounds better.

151
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:35.460
Belis Aladag: I think, I think we should do that now the tablets. If you had changed it. If something happens and we have to switch or something. Just so you know, they're not chewable they're just, just like the film, you have to melt them under your tongue.

152
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.790
Belis Aladag: Drink some water before you use film or

153
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.270
Galaxy S8: Have

154
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:53.520
Belis Aladag: They put it under your tongue and then melt it gets into your bloodstream from that section and then you can swallow leftover but yeah really you wanted to. If you swallow it, or chew it bypasses the system.

155
00:20:54.060 --> 00:21:03.060
Galaxy S8: Okay, I usually always spit it out. That's what works. I keep it in for what is it 1520 minutes and spit it out, usually tend not to swallow because

156
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:12.870
Galaxy S8: Yeah, makes you yeah yeah just kind of gross, it's gross. Taste the least to me, it is like it I guess no.

157
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.680
Belis Aladag: Yeah, but I'm okay.

158
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.740
Galaxy S8: Oh, I know it works great for pain and I

159
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.260
Galaxy S8: That's, that's all that's important really

160
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:23.610
Yeah.

161
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.440
Galaxy S8: So,

162
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.180
Okay.

163
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:36.660
Belis Aladag: And then in terms of the opioids. It was like the cradle them you're trying again, it was all in an attempt to cover the pain.

164
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.550
Belis Aladag: Always with that accident, seven years ago with the neck and back injury.

165
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.470
Galaxy S8: Yes. Yeah, okay.

166
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:52.350
Galaxy S8: And then the pain added to it was little, I was allowing the neuropathy was allowing me about four hours was all I could do

167
00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:02.820
Galaxy S8: That's what the, you know, trying to find expensive shoes and and solos and still could not get more than four hours, and it was, it was really

168
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:15.930
Galaxy S8: Making the ministry suffer behind it. And so when I discovered the Suboxone it allowed me till I was done. Like, I will say around 530 or six

169
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:31.290
Galaxy S8: At night, usually it starts to come back. But by then I'm in my I we have, you know, I bought my first house at 50 tail and last year and then paying the mortgage for a year and

170
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:43.410
Galaxy S8: But I did invest in from tax returns and one Superbad and I got a purple cow King mattress and then I just bought

171
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.070
Galaxy S8: My pillow sleeper top or for it.

172
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:57.480
Galaxy S8: And then I have my pillow pillows. And so, you know, that's important. And then I get a super good night's sleep and so that helps through

173
00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.160
You know, with the until

174
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.690
Belis Aladag: You have a

175
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.350
Belis Aladag: Plan.

176
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.440
Belis Aladag: How to get through. You have your things

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:18.150

179
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.400

189
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.010
Galaxy S8: And parents

190
00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:09.750
Galaxy S8: Oh yeah, yeah, our whole family were in the oil business unit oil and when I started to have my drug problems. I was 15 when I started doing chemical drugs.

191
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:28.140
Galaxy S8: My family was, you know, everything was poison and drugs. But alcohol was a vitamin, and you are encouraged to use it. So, hey yeah so that. And then, of course, they never watched us as kids so I was like molested as a child and

192
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:38.430
Galaxy S8: So I had to go through all that to childhood traumas and and I actually went through similar programs to the one that I started and and and

193
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:59.040
Galaxy S8: Basically saved my life and learned out a deal with all my route rejections and childhood traumas and and now we teach that. So it's really, it's the result of how we were raised in our parents were too busy partying and you know they socialized and entertained.

194
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:08.340
Galaxy S8: And drank massive amounts of alcohol was tough to wall and our family to be an alcoholic was cool.

195
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.950
Belis Aladag: Whoa.

196
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.440

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.580
Belis Aladag: Matt. Matt Oh, that was the math.

206
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.570
Okay, yeah.

207
00:25:49.650 --> 00:26:04.920
Galaxy S8: I was supposed to be in a wedding and I got to dunk to be performing my one of my cousins said here do this and first time I did the line I knew I was going to be addicted to that. And it was a long, long

208
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:10.110
Galaxy S8: Journey love affair with math for many years afterwards.

209
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:20.400
Belis Aladag: And you mentioned, unfortunately, I'm so sorry you had to go through that as a child, the molestation what happened, who was it

210
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:34.110
Galaxy S8: It was you know that you know my wife when I told her about it, she started bawling and said, Honey molested as a molestation, I was molested by one of my mom and dad's friends NAVY AND WHAT'S HER NAME AND

211
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.500
Galaxy S8: They just come over and play cards and it was a few years that it went on and

212
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.960
Galaxy S8: I think God every day because then what I tell my wife, as you know, I'm definitely

213
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:56.640
Galaxy S8: I'm thinking, I think that every day. It was a woman because I'm totally not, you know, never was like heterosexual so

214
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:05.310
Galaxy S8: But my wife actually literally start crying. She said Michael doesn't matter if you're a girl or a boy, you are a young kid. I was seven years old.

215
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.380
Galaxy S8: And seven to about nine that went on and

216
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.090
Galaxy S8: And, you know, either way it was, you know, molestation and so

217
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:27.360
Galaxy S8: You know, again, my mom and dad entertaining playing cards and not watching the kids and stuff like that. So, but I think that that made me a really good father because

218
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:39.180
Galaxy S8: None of my kids have been molested, and I always I'm always very hyper vigilant about who's around my kids and stuff and plus in ministry that we're in.

219
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.890
Galaxy S8: We, we, the new housing.

220
00:27:45.810 --> 00:28:02.580
Galaxy S8: Thing that we're going to go after housing first is what it's called the program. We won't be allowed to allow sex offenders, but the feeding program that we have where we feed people. We have a lot of sex offenders come through. They get food on a daily basis. So

221
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:18.180
Galaxy S8: You know, I mean, they said, you know, I send us then in the Bible and whatnot. And it's all bad, but to me that's the worst thing because you know I was went through that. So to me,

222
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:25.230
Galaxy S8: I still think everybody. These are. I'm a humanitarian to the degree that I think that everybody deserves to eat three times where there

223
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:38.820
Galaxy S8: Are no matter what they did not that I like it. Not that I support it. I just think you know us as human beings need to make sure that everybody has, you know, three meals a day is very important.

224
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.370
Belis Aladag: God bless you. Yeah.

225
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:53.370
Galaxy S8: Even though I don't like that that you know to me if I looked at it. Yeah, I was a drug in a thief and did all my my damage, but I wasn't a child molester. I wasn't

226
00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:09.870
Galaxy S8: a pedophile of any sort, but the same time a human being, no matter what. I think we're any kind of human and we care. Everybody deserves, three meals a day, no matter what they did. So, you know,

227
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:19.830
Galaxy S8: I just that's, I guess, a good part of me because I don't really even though I don't like it. Don't want to know about it. Stay away from my kids.

228
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.890
Galaxy S8: Yeah. You know, I think people still deserve to eat three times a day. This is something about how I feel.

229
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.420
Galaxy S8: Yeah.

230
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.070
Belis Aladag: Um, any surgical history. We need to put down

231
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:46.260
Galaxy S8: You know, no, I've had a broken one broken on and be on my left arm only broken bone and I've never ever had a procedure of any sort. When I got in the motorcycle accident.

232
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.040
Galaxy S8: I was working three days later.

233
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:58.860
Galaxy S8: We had a thrift store at that point in time and we money was like we needed money every day so

234
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:12.450
Galaxy S8: At that point, I didn't have any choice but to work for somebody, and we didn't have employees at that time. And so, yeah, I had to work. And like I said, then

235
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.880
Galaxy S8: You have three days later I was working, and then

236
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:26.940
Galaxy S8: In order to that depending that's I had to go through the physical therapy and stuff like that. And that physical therapy does help to a certain amount

237
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:29.940
Galaxy S8: But

238
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:40.560
Galaxy S8: The damage. Should I get definitely I feel today, you know, the neck specific to think of a pillow, there's a lot of factors that can

239
00:30:41.520 --> 00:31:00.600
Galaxy S8: Produce worse. So if I have really thin pillows and if I sleep too much or if I don't if I worked like lifting too much weight for long periods of times. Well, I will pay a price for that I see, but have to be careful. Yeah.

240
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.160
Galaxy S8: Have to try to keep it.

241
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.140
Galaxy S8: I'm not, I'm not a

242
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.230
Galaxy S8: A young kid in the hunger and I don't mess snapback is resilient as I used to. I know that.

243
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:19.590
Belis Aladag: Yeah, um, any, any danger of suicide suicidal thoughts or anything like that.

Galaxy S8: No, I can't. Not that I can think of. Other than that, I'm fairly healthy. I never had chest pains or, you know, I should probably

251
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.720
Galaxy S8: You know, considering my lifestyle for all those years. But so far, so good.

252
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.790
Galaxy S8: I'm I didn't get to pneumonia shot. The first one I got to get another one. When I turned 55

253
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.150
Galaxy S8: Pretty good breathing.

254
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:44.490
Galaxy S8: I used to smoke regular cigarettes few packs a day and beeping dead really took away all the

255
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:53.670
Galaxy S8: You know, because, and I got mad at my wife. One time I bought a pack of cigarettes. About eight years ago. And before I even got through that pack had my smoker, Scott.

256
00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:12.270
Galaxy S8: Oh no, from BABYING IT has given me my breathing and ability to work without getting short winded. So that's something that did work for me on a positive level. Was it gave me my breath back and was able to breathe and don't really have any congestion problems.

257
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:27.060
Belis Aladag: Oh, good. I'm so glad. Okay, so at least we got that out of it. That's very, very good. Yeah, I'm okay. Okay, Michael. So, so for from now on. We're going to meet in a group setting. If you're okay with that. Yeah.

258
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:35.580
Belis Aladag: Um, and there's, I have some options I have a men's group that meets Mondays at 9am

259
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:43.230
Belis Aladag: Does that work for you, or there is a Thursday 4pm group mixed group.

260
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.930
Galaxy S8: I'd say Thursday's okay at 4pm

261
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.940
Galaxy S8: Okay, and what does that group. What do you do

262
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:02.940
Belis Aladag: So what happens is, um, it's an hour long and I start with check ins.

263
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:17.280
Belis Aladag: With each patient. So like with you, I'd say, okay, Michael. How's it going, How's your dose of two a day of the film, did you have any problems do you just need a refill is all well and you just tell me

264
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.180
Belis Aladag: And we

265
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.270
Belis Aladag: Do your medication management real quick and then I

266
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.730
Belis Aladag: Do that with every now and then.

267
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.930
Belis Aladag: And then once everyone's

268
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:32.580
Belis Aladag: Kind of settled into that and I can start typing away and sending my prescriptions that there's a therapist that runs the rest of it.

269
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:45.810
Belis Aladag: And the focus is usually some recovery related topic like how to stay clear of whatever temptations, or you know how to continue on your medication and blah blah blah for you.

270
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.200
Galaxy S8: Okay, you

271
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:54.300
Belis Aladag: Have a very strong I'm strong stronghold. It sounds like on your recovery, especially from methamphetamine so

272
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.440
Galaxy S8: That's that was very

273
00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:02.490
Belis Aladag: Inspiring. And I think it'll be it'll be a great contribution to the group just to have your stability.

274
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:17.790
Belis Aladag: Because some of these people are just starting that recovery journey getting on the Suboxone because of heroin or other opioids and some people have pain as well and others are just simply just opioid use disorder.

275
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.170
Galaxy S8: Because we can't call them anymore. There's

276
00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.020
Galaxy S8: That's the word. Are you familiar with that. I was like, when

277
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.480
Galaxy S8: We were getting stuffy give people that overdose.

278
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.910
Galaxy S8: On our links right now for some

279
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.040
Galaxy S8: r&r and anyway.

280
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:52.050
Galaxy S8: Just the word addicts and this is you cannot call them attics any longer. And I said, what do you call them and they go, people who listen I go Oh cool, because I am an addict.

281
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:59.430
Galaxy S8: And anyway, we're getting. What do they call that that stuff that snap over does

282
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:00.960
Belis Aladag: Not

283
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.950
Galaxy S8: Normal

284
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:12.960
Galaxy S8: And so I was getting nor Kim and and the test strips from this group and they told me. Don't ever call Maddox anymore. And I'm like, I guess that's part of the LTV killer thing.

285
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.810
Galaxy S8: And I said, Well, it's funny to me because

286
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:22.560
Galaxy S8: I'm an addict. But anyway, yeah, just, I don't know if you're aware of that or not that's

287
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.110
Galaxy S8: A boy, you're aware that

288
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:36.210
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I am. You know, we try trying to change the lingo. So it's feels less. Um, what's the word profiling and

289
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.980
Galaxy S8: Negative but

290
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:48.750
Belis Aladag: For so many years for so many people, especially in the 12 step programs, that's how people identify and they almost take pride in it. So I don't want to take it away from you, but

291
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.970
Belis Aladag: Yeah, it's time

292
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.370
Belis Aladag: It's an interesting time in society. Right.

293
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:58.050
Galaxy S8: Yeah, that's funny to me. I was like, but I am an addict.

294
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.630
Galaxy S8: I don't want to

295
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.260
Belis Aladag: Say, that's who I am, yeah.

296
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:15.300
Galaxy S8: But anyway, it was just funny and Lady didn't really get a kick out of it like I did. I thought it was kind of funny.

297
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:23.160
Galaxy S8: Same time, I have to, you know, I have to kind of be in that field where I want to respect people yeah on all levels.

298
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.570
Belis Aladag: Sure. Of course. Well, thank you, thank you for taking this time and
