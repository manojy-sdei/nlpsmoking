00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:24.150
Galaxy A10e: At the whole courthouse shut down. You have to have this nice damp by clerk and I couldn't even see anybody when you go in there, it just as you know put documents in this you know envelope 31 or box 24 or whatever. So

106
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.420
Okay.

107
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.980
Galaxy A10e: The circles for sleeping or something, I guess.

108
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: at nighttime Seroquel circles. Actually it's a dual used medication. So it can be used for for sleeping, but it depending on the mental health diagnosis and can also be used for mental health stuff.

109
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes part of the issue with sleeping. Is that our, our brain cannot turn off. It just, it just goes and goes and goes and goes and goes

110
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.290
Galaxy A10e: Hey, I wasn't

111
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.150

113
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Circle does help with that, just shut off the brain enough so that you can get into that realm sleep and get a true amount of sleep.

114
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:40.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that

115
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be 100% true

116
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.230
Okay.

117
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the, it can be used. You know, for mental health stuff, but it can also be used for sleeping. If she's not getting

118
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, getting into that realm, sleep, which can affect everything. I mean, it can make you look like you're you know that you're hallucinating. It can make you. You know what I mean.

120
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:21.660

122
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.690

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whether it be a drink, whether it be smoking weed, whether it be one hit off of, you know, the math, five, whatever it might be, you know, you're doing all of this work, and I know your heart is about getting your kids back but your addiction is getting in the way a little bit.

144
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:20.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

145
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't

146
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell you these things.

147
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:40.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I don't point these out to you and tell you these things I'm going to it's doing you a great disservice. So you need to know that when you get stressed out. Don't go towards something like that you've got coping skills start using those coping skills.

148
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:42.570
Galaxy A10e: Right.

149
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

150
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.330
Right.

151
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to remember that.

152
00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:03.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, especially when you want to veer towards that, you know, do everything in your power to do something different because it just the end result is going to be, you know what I mean, it's going to continue being

153
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:12.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're not putting everything into it because you keep doing these things and you know if the end result will be not what you wanted. And so

154
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's got to be 100% balls to the wall. This way.

155
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see what I'm saying.

156
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.300
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

157
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

158
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'd rather you hear it from me than hear from somebody in somebody else.

159
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't

160
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.500
Galaxy A10e: Appreciate

161
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Important

162
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm on your side here.

163
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.860
Hey, I know.

164
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:54.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if I don't want him out to you, then you're going to get it in a manner that you know you're not going to like or want to hear and it be devastating. And so in order to be up front and present and to be able to do what you need to do, be 100% 100% all the way. All right.

165
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:54.780
Yeah.

166
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You work on that for me.

167
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.320
Galaxy A10e: Yes, I will promise. Okay.

168
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:07.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know right now is it stressful and you've got, you know, two baby girls that are dying for their mama.

169
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:20.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that your heart is ripped out and it hurts. And this is the hardest thing that you're that you probably have ever experienced. And what I can tell you is that if you don't do it 100%

170
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They won't be able to get you back. I know that to be true.

171
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

172
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:33.780
Right.

173
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I want you to think about that whenever you're, you know, addiction starts telling you, I am so stressed right now I need to have, I need a shot. I need a drink. I need

174
00:14:47.910 --> 00:15:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need a couple hits a weed. I need you know I need this, I need that if it's telling you if your brains telling you to go for a substance back away run the opposite direction, do everything you can to get to the other side of that.

175
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. You know what I mean.

176
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:13.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's the that's called self sabotaging behaviors and you're getting ready to go and have a conversation with the court evaluator.

177
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:21.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Accord evaluator can smell bullshit a mile away a quarter evaluator rose knows I mean they've been doing it for a long time.

178
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if she picks up even for a minute that you're doing, you know that these this is how you're coping with the stressful things with your kids. It's going to come into question.

179
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

180
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.430
Galaxy A10e: Right.

181
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm telling you that for my own past experience and my mentor was a court evaluator so

182
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:46.650
Galaxy A10e: I asked.

183
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.940
Galaxy A10e: My worker. I said, Um, can you please on my kids back and

184
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.740
Galaxy A10e: Are there.

185
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:53.700
Yeah.

186
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you hear me.

187
00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:05.010
Galaxy A10e: Oh, and she said, yeah, she said. The only way that I'm getting my kids back is if we go back to court and the judge gives me my reunification back

188
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.420
Galaxy A10e: She said she can my kids back so I'm like,

189
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.060
Galaxy A10e: I know

190
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:12.960
Galaxy A10e: A ball with

191
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:22.290
Galaxy A10e: We don't go to court till June. But yeah, everything shut down. I'm like, I'm I could you know I could turn myself in right now and go do a you know 60 or 90 day program.

192
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.220
Galaxy A10e: Somewhere, but you can't go anywhere right now.

193
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:26.850
Yeah.

194
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:36.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything's on hold and so for them to not give you, you know, take this opportunity to see what you're going to do and keep everything in a stalemate stance.

195
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doesn't make sense. But now that they pulled in a court evaluator. That's not a bad thing. It can actually work on your side. If you're 100%

196
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.000
Galaxy A10e: Okay.

197
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, right. That's what I know to be true.

198
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you think you can do it.

199
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.000
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

200
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, I'm asking a lot

201
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.540
Galaxy A10e: No.

202
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it is for people like you and me. It is asking a lot but

203
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can tell you that it's doable. And the end result, you're going to be so so glad you did.

204
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can, I can promise you that.

205
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I can promise you.

206
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever the outcome is you would have done 100 per 110%

207
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:37.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With no derails no side rails. No, you know. No, but as limbo bullshit, but really just kind of giving them you know the true factual information, they'll be able to see it on your face.

208
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:49.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They can eat corn evaluators can tell when people are lying. They're trained in that as well. So, you know, all of these things you you've got to really take into account and take into play.

209
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

210
00:17:52.050 --> 00:18:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you get stressed out and your first thought is to have a dream board out of shot to help calm your nerves know first thought wrong.

211
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:02.790
Okay.

212
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is definitely something you know to learn as first that wrong.

213
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it's actually, you should be picking up the phone and you should be calling people and you should be communicating with other people getting other people's advice. You know what I mean, getting a lawyer doing those things that you know that you're doing.

214
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.490
You know,

215
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.140
Galaxy A10e: Right.

216
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Picking up your book doing the hard stuff which is looking at a book, rather than ruminating in your head and your thoughts and your worries you know

217
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.530
Yeah.

218
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Praying to your higher power, whatever that looks like for you.

219
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

220
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.200
Galaxy A10e: I've been going to church every Sunday with my daughter.

221
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.030
Galaxy A10e: Online.

222
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:56.670

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. And don't miss in your appointments

225
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.170
Galaxy A10e: If you're in the car and I've been

226
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:15.330
Galaxy A10e: For like it's been like, I don't know, six or seven months I've made sure or four or five months I made sure, you know, but the day before or

227
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:24.300
Galaxy A10e: The morning that I made sure I called or, you know, checked in, or something. No matter what, I don't want to have that good on one has a good recommendation. Want to get in there.

228
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And what they do is they pull up your pull up your account. And there's this part in your

229
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Chart that says tended miss and that's what they base that later on. So you want to make sure that you know that you check into virtual clinic because that's how they they mark that that you're there, they put that in your chart that you're there. Okay.

230
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:47.790
The virtual

231
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

232
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, beginning document, document, document. You know what I mean, if, if it's not documented it didn't happen. So if you come straight to zoom. They have no idea that you've made it

233
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:00.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

234
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and that's why it's really important that you check in with with virtual clinic before you come to zoom. Okay.

235
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.210
Galaxy A10e: Okay.

236
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense. Okay.

237
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Okay. All right. So you've got, you know, I'm asking a lot of you today.

238
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.290
Galaxy A10e: No kidding.

239
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.880
Galaxy A10e: I've been thinking about for days.

240
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:42.420

00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:00.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so you keep that in the forefront of your mind and realize and know and understand that self, self sabotaging behaviors.

244
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you take that shot when you. We, you know, when you're looking for that quick fix to a long term problem, you know, that is your addiction that's trying to keep a hold of, you know, take everything from you.

245
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

246
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, what do I always tell you guys, you know, your addiction, has one job and that's to take you out.
