12
00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:05.640
Rhianna Roark: Yeah I transferred from Columbus. I was seeing a doctor for about seven years, but it's real pricey. He wouldn't accept it state insurance and stuff. It became really really pricey so

13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.440
Natalie Austin: Okay.

14
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.650
Natalie Austin: So you've been clean for probably seven years, then

15
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.570
Rhianna Roark: Yeah, and I had, I had one. My son is like this is a really today's his birthday, and he passed away four years ago.

16
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.160

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.200
Rhianna Roark: Yeah, okay, good.

20
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.130
Because I'll probably join

21
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:49.410
Rhianna Roark: But, um, it was, it was before he passed. I got pregnant with my youngest son, and then I decided I was, you know, strung out on pills and

22
00:01:50.760 --> 00:02:03.690
Rhianna Roark: I decided, I've ever get my ass clean. I didn't want to have a baby that was addicted and then somebody introduced me to Suboxone doctor, which the suppliers and of course I couldn't take because it I was pertinent so they gave me the Savvy tech

23
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.520
Rhianna Roark: Right then, after, after I had Kingston, which is might notice on

24
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.200
Rhianna Roark: It was up in the air. If they want to put me on savvy tech or Suboxone to see if you know I would.

25
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:32.280
Rhianna Roark: Relapse or whatever sins Tottenham kind of like the bigger Bachar than subpar Suboxone but ended up keeping me on savvy tech and then when I transferred doctors from there to the guy that I just left for years.

26
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.720
Rhianna Roark: He tried it and maybe profusely tech. So we just stuck with what we knew you know i mean

27
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.660
Rhianna Roark: in Beijing didn't knock it when so I've been doing it ever since. It's just, it became very pricey.

28
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.970
Rhianna Roark: You know, nowadays.

29
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.540
God

30
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.250
Rhianna Roark: And then he tried to accept some state insurance, but I don't know what happened is either

31
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.570
Rhianna Roark: His company didn't like whatever the state insurance is, you know, there's always stipulations or

32
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.690
Rhianna Roark: They didn't accept what he was doing. I don't know. So I ended up having to pay, not only for the visit. And then I had to pay for all the medication.

33
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.290
Rhianna Roark: The entire time. So like a 500 and some dollars visit

34
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.280
Rhianna Roark: Oh, wow. Yeah. So, but

35
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.730
Rhianna Roark: I see your guys's commercial and I was super. And I thought, There's no way and then
