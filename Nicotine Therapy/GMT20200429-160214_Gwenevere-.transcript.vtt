00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.170
Samantha Scott: Hello.

2
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to work together this morning.

3
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.980
Yeah.

4
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any leftover stuff from group that you want to sort of segue into today.

5
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.950
I

6
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.140
Samantha Scott: Think it

7
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be. It could be whatever you want. Just thought I'd ask

8
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:50.100
Samantha Scott: No, not, not so much. I mean, I'm getting something as a group. I mean, it's definitely interesting to hear from different people in different parts of the process.

9
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Truly, yeah. So what have been your sort of observations about yourself over this last week.

10
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe something you'd like to

11
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Work on

12
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:11.640
Samantha Scott: I mean, I think that the last time we talked the just between us.

13
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:23.490
Samantha Scott: The, there was this thing where I I have felt this image of like reaching out for my mom and I definitely have thought about that this week.

14
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:42.060
Samantha Scott: And just thought about, like, maybe there's more of this stuff that I don't necessarily know on the surface that I might be able to find. I've been thinking a lot about just trying to pay attention to being in my body instead of in my mind.

15
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.870
Uh huh.

16
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.260
Samantha Scott: And I mean, in general, I mean, in general, I'm doing really well.

17
00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:11.310
Samantha Scott: But I mean, again, it's like the pandemic. I'm in my house everything taken care of. Within this like larger things. So, I mean, obviously, my goal is when this is all over. We're going to be going back to reality. And I want to be able to cope better

18
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just saw a note of mine and I'm really glad this notes in there. I would love to teach you belly breathing, nice and

19
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

20
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.220
Samantha Scott: We talked about

21
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.160
Samantha Scott: I feel like I try

22
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.780
Samantha Scott: But like, I mean, I guess it's just a felt sense thing where, like, I need practice and it feels weird.

23
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me teach it to you. Just the follicular. I'm just going to give the whole deal. And let's take it from there.

24
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.990
Okay.

25
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm gonna have to flip my head a few times today my ear my left ear is gonna be a hard time

26
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.530
Okay.

27
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

28
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to tell you

29
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The basics. I'll go into the science in in just a second. It will all be tied in. So basically, I'll go over it. I'll teach it. I'll go into the science behind it. I'll also

30
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be teaching while demonstrating and then I'm going to guide you. So there's no rush. Okay, so don't feel like, oh, she's only going to do this, this one part and then I'm on my own.

31
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so specific to the belly.

32
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to, I want to be really precise. So I'm going to be standing here and you're going to see me and we're going to do this together.

33
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's that important.

34
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let me just go over the basics basic structure when I do teach it is going to be. I used to call it box breathing, because I have this screen. And it's really easy to go you know you'll be inhaling through the nose.

35
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: For four seconds slowly and you'll be mindful, you'll be paying attention to the temperature to sort of the nose hairs moving and as it goes in, you'll be paying attention that the air.

36
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Go into the lower long, which is very odd feeling because we adults don't do that anymore. We breathe up here.

37
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this feeling of having the air on the inhale come expand to the point that our hands. If our hands are on our tummy.

38
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That they put

39
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Out that our hands, expand out on the inhale is just super weird.

40
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.260
Samantha Scott: Yeah, never been able to get that. I think that's where I've never been able to get

41
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.620
Samantha Scott: Something

42
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll go over that today, and you're not alone. A lot of people

43
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll know they're not getting it because they're doing this.

44
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now shoulders are going up and down there, rising up and down.

45
00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we can catch it there. It's a good little indicator that we haven't quite isolated it down to that lower part of the long. Okay, so the first piece where is going to be. I'm still teaching first part. Welcome to do it or not, but it's just this inhale perform

46
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, strangely enough, we're going to hold that breath, which means

47
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're holding it this big belly breath and you're going to be holding for 4321 and then it's going to be an exhale, very on purpose intentional.

48
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And with sensation. For now, we're going to do it this way. I'm not saying this is how you do it when you're standing in line at Costco, but in here. We're going to do it very intentionally with an exhale, and it's going to be for four seconds.

49
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding all the air out for 4321. Now that's a hard thing for a lot of people to do is that last part we're holding the air out mean you have no air, you know, pressed compressed.

50
00:05:50.280 --> 00:06:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That long flat and then we get a stomach probably pulled in a little bit. And it's a hard thing to do. So I teach it this way, and then I realize of course

51
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For example, I can't do it. I can't really hold my breath out for four seconds I feel really uncomfortable.

52
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I ended up doing it for two. I also noticed that my exhale is a lot longer. And that has very positive emotional regulation benefits to it. So don't give yourself a hard time as soon as I say, is four seconds. Inhale, four seconds. Hold your breath.

53
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Exhale.

54
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Four seconds of holding the breath out. Even though I'm saying it like that, you're

55
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're going to find your own

56
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.420
Samantha Scott: Right. Okay. Yeah, that's just a part of the wind to do it right. Yeah.

57
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay.

58
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, that's going to be of service to you yet right will actually be in

59
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Service and we're going to call that if we can doing it with fidelity, which means the way when taught it

60
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm going to tell you why.

61
00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not because it's right. I didn't invent this I don't know right from wrong, whatever. What, ah, you didn't make a mistake when you do it differently.

62
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But the reason why fidelity's really useful is because of what it does for the monkey mind for the mind that wants to wander the one that wants to worry

63
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What this doing it the way you're supposed to kind of thing with fidelity does is it takes effort and concentration

64
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.860
Samantha Scott: Right.

65
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We want that in order to have the positive mechanism of change, which is a relaxed body.

66
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

67
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.900
Samantha Scott: So that's one piece of it so

68
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What I

69
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Want is

70
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: When we do it with fidelity, it means that it takes our attention. It happens to also be something brand new. And so it's it's going to work better.

71
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Our mind loves novelty. It's always like, Hey, what's that never seen one. What's that, so he's like oh I didn't recognize that our mind wants to go look at that and think about it that's new.

72
00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right or mindful of those things which is a whole thing, which means we get to learn new things. And that is, yeah, that's cool. So, this

73
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.380
Samantha Scott: One, we want to practice, we have to practice.

74
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it will be new anymore.

75
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So then number two were out

76
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But some of these pieces that I'm going to go into now, which is the sort of psycho biology of it. That doesn't change.

77
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So one thing that doesn't change. This is, this does take effort because you're doing it with the accounting and because it is so difficult to do because you're doing with mindfulness, it will still take

78
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: focused attention on the brain. So will still work, what I call a top down intervention which means up here in the noggin down regulating the body. The other way is a bottom up. It has a bottom up mechanism of change. Now I'm going to describe that to you and that is

79
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Through the poly they go theory. I'm going to tell you a little bit about this Vegas nerve that we all have and

80
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's also called the wandering nerve and it's called the wandering nerve, because it's connected to like our facial muscles our eyes, this loose little ear bonus in our ear larynx and ferentz to our, our heart. What's wrong side to our heart.

81
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: To our lungs.

82
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.280
Samantha Scott: To our

83
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach and to our various organs.

84
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.330
Okay.

85
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:31.500
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I think I remember you saying something about that, about, like, that's why it's important to be able to see a certain part of a person on this right

86
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.790
Samantha Scott: Yeah, okay.

87
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh this Vegas nerve will become relevant much, much, much later you'll you'll catch you go there's that word. She said she was going to talk about that again.

88
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually a poly legal theory. I'll get more into the social medicine that is the ventral Vegas nerve, which is attached. That's this the facial stuff.

89
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, which I'll get into that theory. A little later it'll, it'll sort of obfuscate the point around the the breathing, but I may come back to it. So for now, I just want you to think about this nerve that is connected to the stomach.

90
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That when

91
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You do this belly breath with fidelity. If you do the belly breath, meaning it expands.

92
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: On inhale, you're pushing that diaphragm down and guess what you're pressing on those organs and they have that Vegas nerve all wrapped around those organs and it sends a message up from the guts like down way down below and it sends a message up to the brain that says

93
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

94
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, we're fine. You know how I know refine this body doesn't need to be tight muscles because look at how she's breathing.

95
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I know she did okay because there's no way

96
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If there was someone threatening in the room that was threatening her life. There's no way she would have a big belly breath there.

97
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:56.640
Samantha Scott: Right.

98
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Can do it. She'd be up there.

99
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.770
Samantha Scott: Right hyperventilating, yeah.

100
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what it does is that message goes up because you do the diaphragm and breathing that that diaphragm presses down on all those organs, it sends a message up to the brain that says

101
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We're okay. And watch what it is when it comes up and says we're okay and the mind was busy saying, Will I ever get another job. Again, it is in complete contradiction from here's the fine saying you should be freaking out.

102
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You should work now and the body is saying we're okay and

103
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Contradiction. So then the body wins.

104
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The body wins that argument, it comes down the muscles relax the heart rate goes down the demand for oxygen goes down, you don't need it.

105
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't gotta punch, nobody

106
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.650
Right.

107
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

108
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the biology of it, you

109
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:05.700
Samantha Scott: Interesting, it's very interesting because I've all I've thought about, I guess I've never really thought about like how how deep breathing works. You know, like, it's like

110
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.420
It's good.

111
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it happens to be one of these autonomic nervous system. We don't have to think about breathing, but it's wonderful Oregon's we get to also be volitional with

112
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.620
Samantha Scott: Right.

113
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How cool is that can't do

114
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That part. I can't say okay summer.

115
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Start the

116
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.830
Samantha Scott: Fast start pumping right

117
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: go slower. We can't do that. Yeah. So, really cool.

118
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot of spiritual beliefs. A lot of sort of mystic ideas have mentioned and you know there's a yoga breath.

119
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I talk about the breath. But now us folks like a behaviorist we can finally have some science to say that's why it works.

120
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we knew it worked.

121
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But

122
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know how to explain why. Yeah.

123
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm excited now explain it.

124
00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.640
Samantha Scott: Yeah, totally.

125
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you know the cognitive way it works. You know, the biological a way that it works. And I want to talk a little bit about the actual breath.

126
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And okay

127
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to let me just close this note over here. Susan just

128
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to

129
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: First, we're going to just get don't have to get

130
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get fancy just getting that breath to go

131
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.440
Samantha Scott: All the way down.

132
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So that your hands. So put your hands right on your tummy.

133
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All your all your air out and all you're going to do. You don't have to be fancy.

134
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Time. It is just have those hands come out and they'll probably only move out like

135
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Only a little bit because all that air is filling up the top and it's going down, you won't get more motion, whereas there's this big effort up here with her shoulders in the upper chest, you're going to barely feel that tummy expand won't go

136
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll

137
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.290
Samantha Scott: feel something.

138
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel awkward and it'll feel

139
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.020
Samantha Scott: Really

140
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Good and take

141
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

142
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm dying. You're right.

143
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right you feel bad. That's good. Okay, so we're gonna get all the air out.

144
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now inhale through the nose. See if you can expand that air to get that stomach like a balloon is expanding.

145
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice your hands go

146
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.170
Samantha Scott: Yeah, a little bit.

147
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.010
Samantha Scott: You do it again. Little bit of a surprise.

148
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it firsthand. So, have them on the tummy.

149
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And picture that you're trying to create this sort of a balloon experience with that belly.

150
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture a tiny little

151
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Baby and how it's little tummy rises and falls, we knew how to do that when we were little.

152
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: We would do full long breathing.

153
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep those press those hands on your tummy.

154
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we just, we don't want our shoulders going up. And now let's do it again. Get all the air out.

155
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going to have those hands. Yep, there we go. All of it out and then on the inhale, just push the hands out with by expanding the lower abdomen.

156
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking something else is going on. So this is what

157
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.850
Samantha Scott: You let me let me pull. Let me push it back a little bit, maybe

158
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But

159
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.590
Samantha Scott: So you can see more of me.

160
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. So I did notice something. So let me show you what you look like, just now.

161
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When you did your inhale went like this.

162
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You got big appear

163
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I went, Whoa. If all that air is doing all this work up here. What's going on down here. So now I want you, it's okay. Take your time you do and

164
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you're really, I want you to take your shoulders, lift him up, lift him up high and then drop them down.

165
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to how gravity is already consistently pulling them down. They're already down and you feel that

166
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.950
Samantha Scott: Yeah, okay.

167
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, your hands are on your tummy.

168
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you're going to do, you're going to keep as if there was perhaps I was there having gotten consent from you. I put my hands on your shoulders and I was holding them down.

169
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, they're not they're not going to move, just so we can do an experiment.

170
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: They will not move your statue up here.

171
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Only things going to happen is we're going to make a balloon down there in our belly it all the air out.

172
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: out out out EXHALE EXHALE

173
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And now here we go into the nose expand that balloon down low at the bottom of that long.

174
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it again.

175
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.550
Samantha Scott: Let me try that again. I got distracted.

176
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.060
Okay.

177
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all of it out and now just the hands press those hands on your tummy and then they're going to come out with the inhale.

178
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to check in on you.

179
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you feel the air go down low to the tummy.

180
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.040
Samantha Scott: Green I it sort of is like

181
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.910
Samantha Scott: That only

182
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:48.720
Samantha Scott: I can feel my hand move, but like, you know, I could feel the expansion against that but I still feel like

183
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.700
Samantha Scott: It's not

184
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.540
Great.

185
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

186
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: There's still this this thing, this rise and fall happening up top, take

187
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.100
Yeah.

188
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: We're on your viewer and go to, once you go to speaker view. So you can see yourself and let's watch you. Let's watch.

189
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.090
Samantha Scott: To the

190
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.880
Samantha Scott: Speaker view I see ya.

191
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.300
Samantha Scott: Got it.

192
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. And now there's you. Okay, so we've got off the shoulders here. Now do you see yourself.

193
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.580
Samantha Scott: Yeah, let me. I'm trying to get a better like where I could see my stomach.

194
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.890
Samantha Scott: Nice. Okay, so now. First, let's get it. Get in touch with with with gravity.

195
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: First, find it so that we're not holding it. So find it by lifting up

196
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm dropping down all the way down.

197
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.800
Samantha Scott: I think so.

198
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.150
Samantha Scott: Okay.

199
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So, right. So, right there. Do you see how they're like almost exactly level with the top of the couch.

200
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.570
Samantha Scott: Do you see that right. Yeah.

201
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now my hands are on my tummy. And now, watch your shoulders and don't let him move your just press your hands on your tummy press in and now you're gonna expand that belly on the inhale to be all the air out.

202
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.040
Samantha Scott: Of my students rising. Okay.

203
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to do. Let's do it again. You're doing great.

204
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.780
Let's do it again.

205
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it all out. Let's get that tummy. Get that deflate that balloon all the way, get it all out.

206
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We go. There we go. There we go. Good and bring it into the nose.

207
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay.

208
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.620
Samantha Scott: Feels

209
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.180
Samantha Scott: More full

210
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Going on there. So notice, did your mind wander to anything else except trying to get this right.

211
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:54.840
Samantha Scott: No.

212
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's the way it is. I'm telling you. Okay. So pull the screen up just a little bit so I can see

213
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Your face right there, right there. Perfect.

214
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I'm going to guide you through it. I'm going to do my best to do the counting. I can't. I think it's

215
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the holding of the breath and I you won't hear me, you're just going to see me kind of doing this because I can't talk and hold my breath with the same

216
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.460
Right.

217
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can start in whenever you're ready. But I'm going to start. So first I'm going to exhale and you're going to see me doing this, you know, up here. And then I'm going to be

218
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this and then it'll be exhale down here.

219
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of the mouth.

220
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And remember that the key pieces are to feel

221
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel feel the texture of the of the fabric of your, of your blouse on your tummy. Right. You're going to feel you'll feel just whole body right experience. Yeah.

222
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you.

223
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say, make sure you have those hands on the tummy because

224
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That upper part of your body wants to keep rise and fall

225
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:02.910
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

226
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the concentration is going to

227
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll notice it. Oh, I noticed they moved and then you go up the next time we'll have another opportunity to get that air. I'm not going to move my shoulders might be my hands won't move much

228
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:16.680
Samantha Scott: And you

229
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Just feel a little right might just go in a little bit. Tell me, my just barely amount

230
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay.

231
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That means that it got down there. Okay, so all the exhale out all of it out.

232
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Good all of it out. And now, inhale for 4321 and hold 321 exhale out the mouth deflate that balloon or 321 hold all the air out for 321 inhale through the nose.

233
00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold, hold, hold. Exhale out of that mouth deflate that balloon all the time and hold it out 321 inhale through the nose.

234
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale out.

235
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out 4321 inhale through the nose extend that belly.

236
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 excellent out

237
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: it all out for 321 inhale through the nose.

238
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 excellent mouth.

239
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: 321 inhale through the nose.

240
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale out.

241
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it all out.

242
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, inhale through the nose.

243
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, on your own count on your own time you run these breathing cycles through your own quiet space.

244
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:21.870
Good.

245
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Okay, open eyes and tell me what this has been like for you.

246
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.540
Samantha Scott: Oh wow, I've never braised like of or

247
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.400
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

248
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:17.790
Samantha Scott: He feels I feel calmer. I feel like there's like more oxygen in my brain or so.

249
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.240
Samantha Scott: You know, I just, I feel peaceful

250
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:33.780
Samantha Scott: So it's not. I mean, I think I've gotten hung up on like the performance of it all and like getting frustrated with myself and like, I'm not feeling that, and it's not right, but

251
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:42.000
Samantha Scott: You're right. It's gonna be a little bit different for everyone. Like, I might get closer to it with practice because like there's this whole protective

252
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:54.660
Samantha Scott: I feel like especially with my shoulders or that shoulder pain and horrible and stuff like that. And I feel like a lot of that is like me, my body protecting protective mode, you know,

253
00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, absolutely, really smart of you to pay attention to. Maybe some symbolism and what the message, how it might

254
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Still be on guard and that you're going to meet that resistance in there but meeting with compassion because

255
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I knew this far right back. Did you and so we don't want to let go of something until we're kind of replacing it right with with a sense of protection with other things. So there's that there was that body awareness. Did you notice that

256
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You work hard at this and it took your attention.

257
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yeah.

258
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.850
Samantha Scott: Definitely. I mean, I think body things take like

259
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:48.480
Samantha Scott: Almost like my full attention. A lot of times, you know what I mean, like it's sometimes it's just anxiety about performing something right or be

260
00:25:48.900 --> 00:26:00.000
Samantha Scott: Mirroring right you know and then sometimes its actual frustration. I'm trying to be compassionate with myself. I'm really trying to do that, especially in terms of my thoughts.

261
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the neat things about this. Number one, what I just talked to you with the belly breathing the count. Obviously, that's not a natural breath.

262
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.000
Samantha Scott: Right.

263
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't do that. So it takes actual effort, it can become a ritual of routine where the moment you reach consciousness in the morning, you do a few

264
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.420
Samantha Scott: Right, and you

265
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.930
Samantha Scott: Bring out the day that way. Yeah, that's amazing.

266
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want to talk to you about why that's going to be convenient down the line. So you set it in motion. I'm going to do that soon as consciousness hits your eyes aren't even open. You're like, oh, shoot, I'm awake now. Oh boy, I'm awake. I'm so excited for the day.

267
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there it is. And then you go

268
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's different when you're laying down there's different weight pressures and you'll notice that

269
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Partner to do. So what, then, you're an observer. And then, you know, it'll, it'll, it'll inform okay my breath will feel different. When I'm laying down

270
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.120
Right.

271
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're standing, let's say, and then you do it every time you have lunch. Maybe you'll do the lazy boy position and you'll have your hands up here. When you're doing it once you get the hang of it. You don't need those hands down there anymore.

272
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe when you're seated and you're watching TV. You'll tuck your hands and they'll go underneath your size and you'll sit down like this, but the

273
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Point is, you're not gonna, you're not going to have success if you're hunched over, like right

274
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.900
Samantha Scott: Now it's so hard. I mean posture. I know it's important and like

275
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:46.590
Samantha Scott: It's weird because like all these protective things have to do with our posture to right. It's like, I've noticed, like when I'm feeling the more uncomfortable. I'm feeling like I'll do stuff like that or like

276
00:27:46.980 --> 00:28:01.230
Samantha Scott: You know, like that or like lean over it. Obviously this is not the key reading position to be in. Right. But, but it feels right, you know, but just because something feels right, doesn't necessarily mean it's right.

277
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.910
Samantha Scott: Well, familiar

278
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. That's the word

279
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what we'll do is, you and I, through language will depart from right and wrong. And we'll go probably all and be inviting you on a regular basis to go to

280
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it doing for you right

281
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And how is it adaptive. And how old is this, and how do you on an emotional level. What's your experience as you're doing it, I noticed I feel you feel safer now.

282
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, versus this.

283
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Where right where we're open like this and our chynna. Oh, I hate it. I want to scroll back up and call back into the turtle. I want to get back in this position right away.

284
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, won't be. I won't be going to right and wrong. I will land there. I won't be inviting our language to do that I'll be

285
00:28:50.910 --> 00:29:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We're moving more like let's persistently be compassionate, even where the habit was to judge, as if somehow you weren't doing something right. None enough

286
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body has wisdom. It has an intuitive nature to it. Let's, let's stop ignoring what it knows what to do.

287
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

288
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:30.990
Samantha Scott: I feel like I have been ignoring it and like trying to, like, you know, with drugs or whatever, you know, it's like I'm trying to prime it or make it ready or something. But like nothing's gonna prime it except for actually getting to know it probably right.

289
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

290
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.200
Samantha Scott: I want to get in. I was, I do still focus on from that. That's amazing. Like,

291
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

292
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.420
Samantha Scott: Here is you know how many times I've tried to do that on my own.

293
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

294
00:29:46.770 --> 00:30:05.580
Samantha Scott: A lot. I mean, I've tried to breathe. I've tried to deep breathe and stuff like that. But I think I'd get hung up of, like, whatever, like, oh, this is a right. This can be right you know and like, I'm not doing it, but having somebody to help me. I think this inner personal thing is big for me.

295
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:21.570
Samantha Scott: Because like I can read and read and read and no matter how much I understand something, it doesn't or quote unquote understand it. It's a totally different thing within myself so I really appreciate that. Thank you.

296
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're very welcome. And that's it's neat that you you recognize that

297
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I touched on that probably in a group with a lot of humor like

298
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's all there was to it, we wouldn't need therapists.

299
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

300
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.020
Samantha Scott: No, yeah, totally.

301
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we would just have books.

302
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:52.380
Samantha Scott: Right and books are great, you know, but this is, I mean, this is I think what I've been missing, you know, yeah, for sure.

303
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is what I call the social medicine. So, earlier you heard me mentioned how the

304
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this Pauline bagel theory.

305
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where the, the science now explains what attachment theory taught people very early on about why is the primary caregiver and the and the infant that

306
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That attunement throughout childhood so critical to later attachments in Adult Attachment formation. Why are they so important we could see it.

307
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Through sort of looking at the net effect is that attachment wasn't there. If it was ruptured at a particular age, we can pretty reliably predict the attachment formation of what they're going to look like with romantic partners.

308
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We couldn't

309
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, say, the science and i i love

310
00:31:49.050 --> 00:32:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That now I've got my hands on. I already have the theory. I'm already doing the therapeutic interventions. And now I also have the science and that's where the ventral Vegas nerve comes in because remember I mentioned that it's attached to

311
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.420
Samantha Scott: My facial muscles.

312
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.380
Samantha Scott: And it's a direct

313
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To my eyes like

314
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Why, why would it be attached to my face and that ear that that loose, Pete. Why so neat things are coming out with this particular theory that has to do with

315
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This

316
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: They go attunement. This is what social medicine is. So for example, you know how you said it's this talking to you. Whenever it's this that seems to be doing something. I don't know what that is that a book can't quite do

317
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This explains it. This explains why and we're actually wired for this. And so when you hear me say we're wired for connection. This is what I'm talking about.

318
00:32:46.860 --> 00:33:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We as a species aren't meant to pop out prance around and go look for water on our own and start a fire. We're not. We're not made that way. We're made completely vulnerable were born just mush. We're just this little cutie blob right

319
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We are hundred percent dependent on a caregiver. Now, what that sets up is this constant attunement that's necessary back and forth and baby turns do I break away or do I make demand that baby. Look at me, there's constant

320
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now baby has no distinction between the self and other when it's little. And so whenever I do it absorbs into it as its

321
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: As its identity, you see.

322
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.050
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no, I mean, it totally makes sense, it totally makes sense.

323
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So if something gets ruptured where I don't

324
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just here, you know, and I'm not a tuning to the baby, even when it wants to break away from intensity of looking at me, or it wants to just sort of be its little self and then come back in a tune

325
00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be a break to it's invasive so that happens that has a different effect throughout different parts of the child element.

326
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then you can say, okay, well, and you'll see some of that in the work we do, I'll say, well, how old were you and what was going on then. And we can kind of look at that and it might sort of inform

327
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Why you might have a particular dynamic still happening in your adult life.

328
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:33.900
Samantha Scott: Totally. I mean, I feel, I feel like I'm thinking about all this stuff, especially since the baby thing and like I feel like a woman, the way you explain it, it's like, Okay, I'm with my mom.

329
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:44.250
Samantha Scott: And and whatever she's feeling I'm trying to, you know, it's part of me. Right. And she's you know i mean i don't know obviously I'm

330
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:53.310
Samantha Scott: I'm speculating, to a certain degree, but she's angry. You know she's sad, she's disappointed. She's all these things.

331
00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:04.710
Samantha Scott: And I mean, I realized now what I do. And one of the reasons why I'm good with people, as I look at them and I see their face right and I'm marrying and all that stuff. But, uh, I feel like

332
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:15.660
Samantha Scott: I feel like I'm to tuned us but not like maybe when I'm like in a work mode or whatever, that's needed but like when I'm sitting here with my husband.

333
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:37.380
Samantha Scott: And I need him to respond to the movie that I'm watching you know what I mean, like, the same way that I'm responding and if he doesn't, then I'm upset about that. I mean, it's or you know what I mean, any kind of variation on that theme. Like, I guess like autonomy.

334
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's stay there, let's not give any more labels. Let's now.

335
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Take theory.

336
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You already have a really powerful skill and I highly recommend

337
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I highly recommend just back up.

338
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To this belly breathing.

339
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I recommend no less than three times a day. Yeah. As many as you can because here's what's going to happen.

340
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're creating new tissue in your brain. Every time you do it. You remember to do it right where once it was this little on

341
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Walked path.

342
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, difficult to remember that. But now you've been doing it. You've been doing. Now you're in a routine now you do it almost

343
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The second consciousness hits you do it. I didn't realize I was doing it. It's the first thing I thought of doing so. Then it right, it becomes that path.

344
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's a well walked half and you know it's paved

345
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's an eight, nine I wait that's literal tissue development. Those are neurological synopsis occurring. It's tissue, we sometimes get lost in in what a thought feels like it feels spiritual. It feels like something

346
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Ethereal it's tissue and chemical right now that's right there. That's the chemical thought right there. That one chose this one shows my saying this, that doesn't

347
00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't, the more you think it then the more of

348
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.520
Samantha Scott: Tissue, it is right.

349
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.090
Samantha Scott: Yeah, the less you think of it, the less of a tissue.

350
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It will prone, which means he'll go and he'll be gone forever.

351
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.860
Samantha Scott: Kind of like the opiate receptors over

352
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Time. Yeah.

353
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.620
Samantha Scott: Okay, cool. Let's

354
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back. Let's go back to my my invitation is to practice this, and we can, you're going to hear a lot about why it's so amazing for long term recovery. But let's let's go to this.

355
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This other piece.

356
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Which has to do with real world what your current life looks like.

357
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I actually want to hear that that event. I want to hear. I was sitting and I'm watching this show and I so you know I was sad or disgusted or angry and I looked to my spouse and he was like

358
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Already know yes but I will

359
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear the story.

360
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:12.570
Samantha Scott: Well, no, I mean just I'm constantly looking to him during any movie and like the weird thing is we have totally different cinematic tastes like

361
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:27.030
Samantha Scott: I tend to like things that are really intense and you know violence doesn't necessarily bother me unless it's, I mean guns bother me, but not not so much just like anybody would

362
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's zero in on an actual, believe it or not.

363
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The general stuff won't be as productive as

364
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, in time down just what I did just now. I was watching movie. And as soon as I saw this, I was like, oh,

365
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What did him that's I want to slow time. I just want those 20 seconds.

366
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the story I want

367
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:56.280
Samantha Scott: I don't, I don't have your right now, but I will collect it.

368
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet you do. So let's just, just give yourself. Take a look.

369
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, yeah.

370
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Take one of those breaths.

371
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: sort of pick

372
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: An intense movie that boy. I really liked this

373
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I love the direction and the script was lovely and

374
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there are development myself, like, go ahead.

375
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.250
Samantha Scott: I got it, I got

376
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:39.510
Samantha Scott: Amores Perros as this great movie. It's about like four different. It's about 40 different people or whatever. But the main story is about people's connections with animals.

377
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:47.820
Samantha Scott: But it's also a really intense movie and like there's some dog fighting in it and there's

378
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: As I saw

379
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This I remember feeling this and I looked here. That's what I'm looking for.

380
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.430
Samantha Scott: Oh, okay.

381
00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:03.630
Samantha Scott: As when I saw the the dog fight scene in Moroz arrows were

382
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.060
Samantha Scott: Okay, it requires a little bit explanation of what it is like it is.

383
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:28.290
Samantha Scott: A man who's an assassin, who also cares for all these broken dogs and they all you know that have been the dog fights and he comes in and he comes in to his apartment. He's taking care of this new dog, and it's a dog fighting dog and all the

384
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:45.960
Samantha Scott: All the, all the other dogs that he was caring for he were killed by this new dog, not because it wanted to because it was so messed up. And I remember looking over at him and he was feeling the same thing as

385
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.790
Too fast.

386
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.360
Samantha Scott: I remember looking over at my

387
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Resume. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

388
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: ogre and I tell you that's was different. I'm only I'm slowing it way down. So I want you to get that image in your working memory.

389
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture this, this, this part of the scene and I want you to tell me what your body experienced and I want a label an emotion word

390
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: An emotion word typically is anxious sad.

391
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or happy.

392
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:26.100
Samantha Scott: I get I would say sad.

393
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.000
Okay.

394
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're looking for that in your body.

395
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:37.380
Samantha Scott: Um, it always starts with my shoulders everything always starts with my shoulders.

396
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.080
Samantha Scott: Okay, so good. Yeah, well,

397
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you want to explain you noticing that

398
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:43.860
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

399
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know me any explanation.

400
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want any you know you could you could have had any, anything you wanted to what happened is you felt sad. Yeah. That's a fact.

401
00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So just go there, go to that truth. I felt sad.

402
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt

403
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, I'm seeing this thing on TV. I'm feeling sad and I can feel it's truth so magically in my shoulders.

404
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:23.730
Samantha Scott: I feel that whenever I saw that saying I felt sadness. I felt it probably starting in my shoulders and then it kind of settles down and

405
00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.830
Samantha Scott: In that instance, he was mirroring

406
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:35.760
Samantha Scott: A similar he was he was it seemed like he was experiencing a similar feeling

407
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:36.630
Samantha Scott: But

408
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:48.900
Samantha Scott: It was more attuned through like anger of, like, oh, that they would do that. And I felt I feel like what I was feeling was more than

409
00:42:50.580 --> 00:43:08.100
Samantha Scott: More than the tenderness of that, like, you know, the person who would do that. Who would pick up somebody who's so damaged and then ruin their whole world trying to help you know one person right

410
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now hold on to that.

411
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to explain it away or use intellectual ization when I'm working with really intelligent people, it's very tempting.

412
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to catch your first response just, you can't just grab your first one and don't

413
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Say,

414
00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:36.090
Samantha Scott: Yes. Sad Tinder sad. It's like, That's sad. That's like mixed with

415
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:43.170
Samantha Scott: Just like so much like appreciation for for what somebody is okay.

416
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on. Here's the question.

417
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you having empathy for the rescue dog.

418
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The man who saved him.

419
00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And now dead animals. Hold on. It's hard to get to. Where's that sadness. What character.

420
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:14.850
Samantha Scott: Mean I think it should be the dog but the dogs. But, uh, I think it's the person, the, the owner

421
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Check with your shoulders. Find out, try and both on way I feel

422
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel sad for that rescue dog.

423
00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: He's damage to kill these other animals just go there, see what the shoulders have to say about it. Just pay attention.

424
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then dip into the other version.

425
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if it's really man.

426
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.110
Samantha Scott: Maybe it's the dog. The Bad dog.

427
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.010
Samantha Scott: You know,

428
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that killed the other ones.

429
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, rescued. He's damaged.

430
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:59.520
Samantha Scott: Right, because he's still there. He's still standing there, you know, look it up at the looking up at us. You know when they're all

431
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:01.950
Samantha Scott: And they are all

432
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay there.

433
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: For a second,

434
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that

435
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel he just did what he did. How does he feel he looks up at this new master this one that rescued him. How does he feel

436
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.560
Scared.

437
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.570
Samantha Scott: Yeah yeah just scared.

438
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.310
Samantha Scott: It's definitely not intellectualizing me

439
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

440
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that was just now that was

441
00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can let your therapist do that part. I'm here my

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.420
Samantha Scott: I'm working on them.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So go back to it.

446
00:45:53.730 --> 00:46:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're this scared animal, and I want you to look at your new master, are you looking like hey, did I do good. Did I do. Did I do what I'm supposed to do.

447
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:05.850
Right.

448
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.680
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I think it's definitely that dog.

449
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.580
Samantha Scott: I never realized it before I always thought it was the man.

450
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.020
Samantha Scott: Or the

451
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.380
Samantha Scott: Or the dead dogs, but I mean really. Yeah, he's still there.

Samantha Scott: Want somebody to say, you know,

459
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:18.960
Samantha Scott: Either it's okay or good job or something along those lines.

460
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So now when you see this if I'm that image if I'm the new master and I just saw what you did.

461
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how was my face. Look at what you just did. What's my response of what you did.

462
00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.280
Samantha Scott: Right. You're mad.

463
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.840

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So youth, you're looking for praise and and and an add a girl.

467
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and and when you see me. Ah, like that, then how do you feel

468
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.140
Samantha Scott: Crushed

469
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.240
Yeah.

470
00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come away from that.

471
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's leave that you can go to your breath. Notice that you doing that on your own. See how amazing that is it's a really cool way to come back to our body. We go into that memory. And then we get out of mine and back in our viscera get back into it.

472
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.040
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

473
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.990
Samantha Scott: I can definitely see breathing all the time. Oh my gosh, is

474
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It rocks.

475
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah. And I didn't even tell you about what it does for

476
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're in a threat response, the fact that right all the blood is in our large muscle groups. What that breath does because it sends a message. We're okay. It means that the blood can get to our fancy

477
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A parts of our grain or are thinking part of the brain when you have that thinks about thinking thinks about

478
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinks about thinking about thinking about that thought.

479
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't have any blood when you're freaking out.

480
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what

481
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.880
Samantha Scott: Good worse decisions.

482
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

483
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: They're all made right then.

484
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We gotta definitely breathe take time. Yes, it is true, first we do calm. First we do we stop squeezing our muscles because, indeed, as much as you may say, my husband, my parents.

485
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: My stories, my history. My trauma or squeezing my muscles, but

486
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really me

487
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.460
Samantha Scott: It's you.

488
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can do this breath work. And so what are you going to hear from me is

489
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you read. Did you read first. Well, did you try breathing, first you're going to be like, Oh, don't say it again.

490
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

491
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Eventually you'll get so sick and tired of it. Good to go.

492
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.700
Samantha Scott: Yes I breathe.

493
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathe.

494
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Wow. So here we are, right, we're up in our giggle. And how did the shoulders feel in a giggle. How are they doing

495
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.640
Samantha Scott: It feel pretty balanced.

496
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:18.660
Samantha Scott: Pretty, you know, lose. Like, I think the more tense. I am the more tense. The more I tend to do that, you know, or it comes up.

497
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.410
Samantha Scott: Feels really good to feel

498
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.620
Samantha Scott: To feel relaxed there.

499
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it. Oh.

500
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

501
00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to real world. Notice how all we did wasn't too fancy. It was just that we slow time down

502
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All we did was we felt a feeling. And we just thought, well, what is this feeling for where to go. And so here's what I wonder

503
00:50:50.910 --> 00:51:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm your husband I maybe I'm relating to the master and I'm mad that frickin dog just killed my other dogs.

504
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, so

505
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that he's not

506
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Connected with you in the experience he might be relating to a different character.

507
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:14.850
Samantha Scott: Right, but the same essential core beliefs kind of driving that.

508
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

509
00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:22.320
Samantha Scott: In terms of dogs. I think in terms of dogs, our beliefs are pretty similar.

510
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

511
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.850
Samantha Scott: I don't know. I

512
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.080
Samantha Scott: Would have to ask him.

513
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, but look how

514
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to be in a threat response as any perceived threat. When you see his angry face versus your sorrow and grief and the complexity of that scene, you just talked about is so complex and makes me think I've seen that movie too. Is it like in Spanish or

515
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.480
Samantha Scott: Yeah yeah so

516
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an old isn't much over yeah from it and I

517
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a heart wrenching i a transformative movie.

518
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

519
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't even know if I've seen it so I must have seen something either similar to it.

520
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But I, I, as I was going through this with you. I felt like the dog like I'm just doing what I was trying to do you guys

521
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

522
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.750
Samantha Scott: Maybe said do it. Good. You did it.

523
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Good get before I get to eat today because I did this thing. I'm not. I don't have a moral compass, you just

524
00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Get love

525
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:35.640
Samantha Scott: This yeah I

526
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it.

527
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

528
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:45.150
Samantha Scott: That's definitely something I can relate to in terms of yeah the wanting love you know

529
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:47.160
Samantha Scott: So, but masters, Mom.

530
00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let me echo back some of the things you said, and then we're going to do some processing. OK.

531
00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:53.460
OK.

532
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt scared.

533
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt hopeful. Hey, I might get kit reassurance and I might hear it's okay.

534
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And seeing that angry face instead crushed you

535
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The shock of the absolute opposite of what you anticipated and what you expected, you had every reason to believe that you were going to get reassurance and you thought reprimand

536
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting a little growler right now.

537
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.860
Samantha Scott: I know they're all going on. I don't know.

538
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.850
Samantha Scott: Hopefully you can still hear me okay I've got the headphones on.

539
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.970
Samantha Scott: That helps for me, but maybe not for you.

540
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's process if you can. I'm going to stay quiet and I'd like to hear from you. Basically what today was like, like what what just happened today it's important for you. Take your time. Just sort of run that tape through

541
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:14.400
Samantha Scott: I think I will first. We started with the idea that we were going to do the end I'm so glad we did. And I have to admit I was like, I don't want to learn breathing.

542
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:30.960
Samantha Scott: Or I don't want to try again because I was so frustrated with trying to do it on my own and not feeling like I was getting there were like, I'm just not capable of it, but obviously I am um I think though I this whole

543
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.650
Samantha Scott: I'm trying not to intellectualize a the

544
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:43.650
Samantha Scott: I feel like what happened this this session.

545
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:54.480
Samantha Scott: In addition to, I feel like we're making good progress for one like I feel like the first time we talked, I, I've been thinking about like the

546
00:54:54.750 --> 00:55:08.640
Samantha Scott: What we talked about in the imagery of seeing the baby reach up and trying to think about things from that perspective. I'm trying to be calm but I'm realizing that

547
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:17.850
Samantha Scott: And I think that's sort of what that story was about maybe bringing that up. Like the fact that sometimes

548
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:33.300
Samantha Scott: Hard emotions are really important emotions and stuff but but do I want to feel them every day and to the intensity that I'm feeling them now know, and I

549
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:45.660
Samantha Scott: Mean, now I'm thinking more about the stuff that I do my partner's, the one that I interact with the most obviously we're here together. Yeah, and I'm so like focused on

550
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:53.850
Samantha Scott: Him and so affected by if he's having a bad day, or if he's angry about something.

551
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.430
Samantha Scott: I can enjoy my day and

552
00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.440
Samantha Scott: Realizing that like

553
00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.490
Insane.

554
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.900
Samantha Scott: You know, I should be able to invoice enjoy my day.

555
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But if he's so here's here's where

556
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.920
Samantha Scott: I'm sorry, I know I'm getting off track. I'm trying to

557
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Say you're on track.

558
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't need to apologize.

559
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you didn't do anything wrong.

560
00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If you decide to take what you notice that was a little bit different about today. If you noticed something a little different today.

561
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: About how you interpreted the world around you and people's expressions.

562
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Use that as a skill.

563
00:56:46.680 --> 00:57:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I took a second and instead of going with the automatic threat response of we're not in a tournament. That's bad. I did something wrong. I have to fix that our marriage is at stake, whatever you do with that instead of that version. Whatever you did in here to sit, because you

564
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.120
Samantha Scott: Sorry.

565
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.620
Samantha Scott: Here, let me just go in the

566
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.320
Samantha Scott: Deal with these guys.

567
00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.710
Samantha Scott: I don't know where he is. Okay. But anyways,

568
00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.230
Samantha Scott: Alright, I'm here, I'm back.

569
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

570
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I can see it. OK, so the

571
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.970
Samantha Scott: The parts right by the window so glare.

572
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So the part if if you had something just sort of continued to reflect on might be that

573
00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: When

574
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at a particular interaction.

575
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: With your husband, there's a different way to look at it, it's less about registering how you're supposed to feel based on what the outside world looks like, but rather

576
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I feeling, what does this mean and just staying here lingering in your truth a little longer. That's the practice is not

577
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Finding out if how you're doing it is ok but rather stay there a little longer because all I did was say, Well who are you feeling sad for who you relating to

578
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I didn't go as it right. Was it the right character is this intellectually the right person, that the author intended didn't do any of that stuff.

579
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I just kind of wanted to you to hold on to your, your experience of it. It just sort of say, I'm I'm relating to this character here to this animal very complex situation in that scene.

580
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And watch what happens if I'm just doing this, am I threatened by someone else not responding. The same way where my kind of just wrapped up in my own moment.

581
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm guessing you're just going to be in the moment you're going to go right

582
00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:16.770
Samantha Scott: Yeah, totally.

583
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

584
00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what I am guessing will happen if you can hold on to yourself long enough to do those things. And that does take practice.

585
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right then, I think what will happen next. And we can talk about it next time is this

586
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Which character you relating to

587
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, you will choose curiosity over someone doing it the right way. It's a very specific thing. And you'll hear it a lot. Choosing curiosity over being right. I see it as a very, very distinct

588
00:59:52.800 --> 01:00:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Units of effort and skill and it's, there's no wrong way to do my truth, like, so that means there's no wrong way for him to do it either.

589
01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe this is a conversation. Maybe it's

590
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Sitting here crying really relating to this animal and how confusing almost relating to hey yeah it was rescued. But now I'm still disappointing. My master. Hey sweetheart, which character you relating to and now we have this fun conversation.

591
01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

592
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:35.700
Samantha Scott: Present actually yields knowledge versus just puts my idea of what it might be out there. Yeah.

593
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so lots to chew on.

594
01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:39.270
Yeah.

595
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm curious to see for a lot of people. This first time they learn the belly breathing. They think it's fantastic. And it's lovely. And then they forget to do it. So don't be hard on yourself. If you forget. Um, but

596
01:00:53.700 --> 01:01:01.650
Samantha Scott: I'll bring it. I'm gonna I'm gonna try to like remind myself like set a couple reminders alarms during the day.

597
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:07.140
Samantha Scott: You know cuz I might not remember and, you know, if I said it for at least like

598
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:12.060
Samantha Scott: Three times a day, then I'm at least getting it. And if I remember it more great right but

599
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I already have you in my schedule you tell me if this works. I have a Wednesday, May six at 10am for individual therapy is that what

600
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You have

601
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:28.080
Samantha Scott: Yeah, but I believe I did. Let me go back to my notebook.

602
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.140
Samantha Scott: Now they're quite as mouse's

603
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:50.220
Samantha Scott: Okay, here. Let's see. Okay, so you have Wednesday at 10 and that's pretty much our normal time for right now, I think.

604
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.630
Samantha Scott: I mean I can do other times, if you if you have, but this works for me too.

605
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stick with that.

606
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to, you have

607
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A year Dr. Aubrey yells client, right.

608
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. I'm just gonna, I don't know whether she's got any bridging nurse can tell her you were here today. Okay, we'll just

609
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.020
Samantha Scott: Okay, cool.

610
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:37.080
Samantha Scott: And then, and then I'm going to call back I got the the the urinalysis package so I haven't opened it. I talked to them, but I was like, I've got to get to therapy. So I'm going to call them back after and get all the instructions and stuff. Well,

611
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The main thing is not to open it and they can see the chain of custody where you open it in front of them. That's the main piece.

612
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't ya don't open the packaging.

613
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.880
Samantha Scott: It is closed.

614
01:02:54.450 --> 01:03:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okey dokey. Well, I will. I'll see you in group and I'm excited to hear how whether you remember but just the key is self compassion.

615
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow time down tune in to what your experiences and just be an observer, am I, oh, you're in an audit, you're going to want to look outside yourself to to get

616
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah nation validation affirmation. It's okay. It's okay, just notice it just be this sort of gentle observer of how frequently you do it and just just slowly come back to you. Wait a minute. What am I feeling

617
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:36.570
Samantha Scott: Alright.

618
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see how it goes.

619
01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.920
Samantha Scott: Okay, thank you.

620
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll talk to you later.

621
