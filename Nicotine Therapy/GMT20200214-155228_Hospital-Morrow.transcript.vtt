00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.850
Chris Alliman MD: Absolutely. So, looks like we're taking talking about Suboxone today. Are you at a stable point are you stopped.

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.260
Ryan Morrow: Yes.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.310
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good. Just want to make sure we don't cause you an accident.

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.910
Chris Alliman MD: I was looking back, and it looked like you've been in our program previously, is that correct

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.590
Ryan Morrow: Yes, I was.

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.850
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, doesn't doesn't look like it went very long. It was just for a brief amount of time.

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.650
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I was for just a few months during the summer.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:22.470
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Alright, sounds good. So I don't. I didn't go into the information very deeply. So I don't know what's happening for you or what your history is so give me some of the background. Tell me about why you want to be on Suboxone or if you're on Suboxone what the story is

17
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:35.250
Ryan Morrow: Um, yeah. So I was on it for pretty much the whole summer and I decided that I wanted to try to

18
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.780
Ryan Morrow: To stop taking it and

19
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.220
Ryan Morrow: See how I would do without it but

20
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.170
Ryan Morrow: I

21
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.290
Ryan Morrow: Didn't do. Well, I, I just, I feel like I need to be on it for a longer period of time for my sobriety. I think it would be best.

22
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.010
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so take me back a ways. Why did you need to get on Suboxone initially, when was that. How did things get started.

23
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.110
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I, I started using heroin, about a year and a half ago.

24
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.850
Ryan Morrow: Okay, and it completely took everything away from me.

25
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.840
Ryan Morrow: And that's why I

26
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.220
Ryan Morrow: What made me initially contact Briar hill.

27
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.510
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. How did you get into heroin. What was what brought you into it.

28
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.910
Ryan Morrow: I'm back in 2003 I started using hydrocodone

29
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.940
Ryan Morrow: Okay and and that

30
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:46.650
Ryan Morrow: Kind of snowball effect that I started snorting oxy cotton back in 2006 and that's when I became an addict and

31
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.600
Ryan Morrow: Then

32
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:58.350
Ryan Morrow: I when I turned 30 I started using heroin and so for the past 10 years. It's basically been often on cycle of heroin abuse.

33
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.560
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Gotcha. Why did you initially get on to the hydrocodone owns

34
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:17.460
Ryan Morrow: Um, you know I I partied in college and you know I experimented with different drugs, but never really had a problem as far as addition. It was always just the recreational thing.

35
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.040
Ryan Morrow: And the first time I took I coding it just did something to me that I was like, wow, you know, I really like this.

36
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:40.080
Ryan Morrow: And so for about six years. I use it recreationally I never got hooked on it because I didn't have access to it, I guess. But whenever I started doing oxy cotton, that's when I really, really became addicted.

37
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.330
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so I'm hearing. Basically, it was more just the party situation. It wasn't necessarily an injury that you were getting prescribed these for

38
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.290
Ryan Morrow: Oh well. Well, and also the I have to go along with that.

39
00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:06.900
Ryan Morrow: I had a truck accident when I was 13 and a message on my back. And then I have some dirt bike accident and I was prescribed, you know, mad for those as well. And so that didn't help either.

40
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.350
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah so little bit of influence. They're not the main one from what I'm hearing probably a little bit

41
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.520
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

42
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:25.500
Chris Alliman MD: Some people. Some people get into it because of depression or anxiety. Were you self medicating depression or anxiety with these also

43
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.610
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, anxiety, yeah I suffer from anxiety pretty bad.

44
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.380
Okay.

45
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
Chris Alliman MD: And how often were you using heroin. When you did get to that point.

46
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.450
Ryan Morrow: For the past year and a half.

47
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.160
Ryan Morrow: Up until I started doing a bright heart.

48
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.200
Ryan Morrow: By heart. It was an everyday habit I was using about a gram a day.

49
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.730
Ryan Morrow: Okay.

50
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.370
Chris Alliman MD: And when you got started with bright heart. How much Suboxone were you taken

51
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.890
Ryan Morrow: To task tablets today milligram tablets. Okay.

52
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.930
Chris Alliman MD: And it was the tablets, not the film's

53
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.190
Ryan Morrow: Now, actually it was the film's. I'm sorry. I actually

54
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.400
Ryan Morrow: Like

55
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.380
Ryan Morrow: Tablets better but

56
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:31.260
Chris Alliman MD: And that's fine. I mean, we don't really have an issue in terms of which one of the like the tablets better and that's easier to work with. For you, that's totally

57
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.740
Yeah.

58
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.330
Ryan Morrow: Okay.

59
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.870
Chris Alliman MD: So two of them a day.

60
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.000
Ryan Morrow: Yes, sir.

61
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.140
Chris Alliman MD: All right. Were you on Suboxone before that had you tried it when it wasn't prescribed or in other situations.

62
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.290
Ryan Morrow: Um, yeah. Whenever I turned 30 whenever I first tried heroin.

63
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.060
Ryan Morrow: I didn't have access to it at that time to heroin.

64
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.950
Ryan Morrow: And so I did go see a Suboxone doctor and Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I was on it for for a while. Okay.

65
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.710
Chris Alliman MD: So you weren't familiar with it. It wasn't something new.

66
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.680
Ryan Morrow: Right. All right.

67
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.270
Chris Alliman MD: Um,

68
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.140
Chris Alliman MD: Why, why were you wanting or why have you been wanting to get off of the short acting opiates like Carolyn.

69
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.420
Chris Alliman MD: What's your motivation.

70
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:32.430
Ryan Morrow: Because it destroyed my life, my relationships and it took everything away from me and I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and I want to change my life.

71
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.980
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, that's, I don't ever. I don't

72
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.920
Ryan Morrow: I don't ever want to have to go back to that drug again.

73
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.360
Chris Alliman MD: Gotcha, gotcha. Did you ever go through rehab.

74
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.090
Ryan Morrow: Yes sir, I did.

75
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.470
Ryan Morrow: Okay, yeah.

76
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.430
Ryan Morrow: When I went

77
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.640
Ryan Morrow: I went to a 15 month program and graduated called teen challenge.

78
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.540
Uh huh.

79
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.180
Chris Alliman MD: When was that

80
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.310

Okay.

82
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.470
Chris Alliman MD: Have you ever overdosed or had to go to the emergency room hospitalized because of this stuff.

83
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:24.780
Ryan Morrow: Um, I've, I've overdose on heroin, but I've never had to have our can or anything. I just, they brought me back by dawn water on me and stuff. So yeah, I have overdose. Okay.

84
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.100
Chris Alliman MD: That's kind of terrifying.

85
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.750
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

86
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.430

Ryan Morrow: I'm working in Lubbock right now but I live in Clovis

91
00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:04.500

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.440
Ryan Morrow: No, sir. Okay.

Chris Alliman MD: And are you seeing a psychiatrist.

104
00:08:40.500 --> 00:09:01.140
Ryan Morrow: Now I'm, I'm, I go to a meetings and I go to Celebrate Recovery. But as far as counseling. I was just going to do the group meetings through zoom with the all and then try to find psychiatrists out here in Lubbock that I can meet with and do kind of an outpatient program.

105
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:08.730
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, um, you're familiar with our program and it looked like you had met with Jessica at one point as a therapist. Does that sound right.

106
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.640
Ryan Morrow: Yes, sir. Yeah.

107
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:21.930
Chris Alliman MD: Is there. So usually we have people connected with our therapist if they don't already have a therapist outside of the program. Um, what are your thoughts on that.

108
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.920
Ryan Morrow: I'm totally for it. Okay.

109
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.890
Chris Alliman MD: Good. So we'll talk about that more as we get to the end here. Okay.

110
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.420
Ryan Morrow: Okay.

111
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.930
Chris Alliman MD: So what happened after the summer when you tried to get off the Suboxone

112
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.150
Ryan Morrow: I relapse.

113
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.350
Okay.

114
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.760
Ryan Morrow: So, so that kind of told me that mind to be on it for longer.

115
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.270
Ryan Morrow: Because it was really working well for me. I was doing really good

116
00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:02.010
Ryan Morrow: And then I tried to stop and one thing led to another and I ended up realizing

117
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.630
Chris Alliman MD: Fair enough. When was your, what did you relapse on heroin, I assume.

118
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.160
Ryan Morrow: Yes.

119
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.890
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. When was your last heroin use

120
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.520
Ryan Morrow: It's been about three months ago. Okay.

121
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.390
Chris Alliman MD: How have you been dealing with it over these three months.

122
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.960
Ryan Morrow: Um,

123
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.950
Ryan Morrow: Let's see.

124
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:41.910
Ryan Morrow: I mean just working, going to the gym, going to church.

125
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.730
Ryan Morrow: I went to a

126
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.250
Ryan Morrow: Detox rehab and that's called the turning point.

127
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:57.090
Ryan Morrow: Okay and and they detox me and put me on Suboxone for a couple of days and taper me off.

128
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:10.260
Ryan Morrow: But since then, I've been. I've been clean but like I still have that that that kind of urge and I feel like I'm still kind of withdrawing and

129
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.110
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

130
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.680
Chris Alliman MD: Okay so still some of the cravings cravings. It's there.

131
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.940
Ryan Morrow: Yeah yeah

132
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.980
Chris Alliman MD: Fair enough.

133
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.050
Chris Alliman MD: Um,

134
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.190
Chris Alliman MD: Let's see here.

135
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.920
Chris Alliman MD: What is your living situation.

Ryan Morrow: Yeah, it is. It's very unique and kind of

147
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.570

157
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.420
Chris Alliman MD: The reason I asked is, I'm sure you're aware, is that the residue from the Suboxone is enough to cause kids to stop breathing.

Chris Alliman MD: That's all right. Ryan, I imagine that you're out in the kind of distant area.

168
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.400
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. All right.

169
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.630
Chris Alliman MD: Let's continue through this

170
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.340
Chris Alliman MD: Um, I was asking you, who your support is who helps you out.

171
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.850

173
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.190
Chris Alliman MD: Good, glad to hear that. Is there any family history of addiction.

174
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.940
Ryan Morrow: To be honest with you know there's Nah, man.

175
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.590
Ryan Morrow: You know, like

176
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:25.800
Ryan Morrow: Party to in college I drank I did cocaine, ecstasy and there was never like a time where I felt like I needed to have it woke up like feeling for it.

177
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:42.660
Ryan Morrow: But whenever I did painkillers. Um, it just snowball effect in whenever I got addicted to it and was sick. That's when the addiction started, which was in 2007 gotcha, gotcha. So

178
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.950
Chris Alliman MD: You know, standing up.

179
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.170

Ryan Morrow: Now, sir,

184
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.420
Chris Alliman MD: Good and a little bit of an awkward question but were you abused as a child.

185

Chris Alliman MD: And go ask you again, there

186

Chris Alliman MD: Alright, sounds good. Um,

190
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.440

Ryan Morrow: Okay.

194
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:04.050
Chris Alliman MD: So we know that those can certainly play into addiction issues in some way also. So, good things to

276
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:33.780
Chris Alliman MD: All right, little hard to do in the car here for the next part, but I'm like for you to try it on camera push on your stomach.

277
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.660
Ryan Morrow: As best you can.

278
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.140
Chris Alliman MD: As as best you can. You don't have to get out of the car.

279
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.610
Chris Alliman MD: Yet I just need to know if there's any pain as you push all over your stomach.

280
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.410
Ryan Morrow: No, sir.

281
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.630
Chris Alliman MD: All right, very good.

282
00:22:53.070 --> 00:23:01.920
Chris Alliman MD: All right, Ryan. So now we need to figure out the medication and your group and all of that kind of stuff, like you did before.

283
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.390
Ryan Morrow: Okay, great.

284
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:22.710
Chris Alliman MD: So I've got a few groups that I've run, which would be easiest to connect with since I know you at this point and the options are, have a Monday 9am a Wednesday 7:30pm or a Friday 12 noon or Friday 1:30pm

285
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.620
Ryan Morrow: Wednesday 7:30pm sounds great.

286
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.970
Excellent.

287
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:44.130
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so you've been through this process before so you know how it works. I see you writing it down and that's great. Put reminders in your phone be there because that's when medication gets refilled.

288
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.570
Chris Alliman MD: When

289
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.910
Ryan Morrow: 7:30pm meeting.

290
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:56.550
Chris Alliman MD: 7:30pm meeting check in about 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time, it seems to be a fairly busy time for groups.

291
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:04.440
Chris Alliman MD: Surprisingly, so just make sure that you're not checking in, you know, five minutes before it's supposed to start because you won't get in in time.

292
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.340
Chris Alliman MD: So the therapists during that group is Dominique and

293
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.710
Chris Alliman MD: She's actually not taking any new clients on right now.

294
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:20.940
Ryan Morrow: Okay.

295
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.720
Chris Alliman MD: So we need to get you. But she'll be helping out with the groups, um,

296
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:30.090
Chris Alliman MD: But we need to get you connected then with someone as a therapist.

297
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.560
Chris Alliman MD: It looked like you had seen Jessica at one point was that right

298
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.730
Ryan Morrow: Yes.

299
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.880
Chris Alliman MD: How did that go, do you want to reconnect with her.

300
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.140
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, sure.

301
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.370
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so I'll put a message out to her and see if we can get that

302
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.170
Chris Alliman MD: Taken care of

303
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.200
Chris Alliman MD: I don't know if you'll have to do that initial bio psychosocial where they hit you with a bunch of questions at the beginning.

304
00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.500
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, I'm not sure where I don't know. So I'm going to leave that up to her to

305
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.830
Ryan Morrow: Figure out whole, I will not. But if I do, I do.

306
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.960
Chris Alliman MD: You do you do things kind of the way it is.

307
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.040
Now,

308
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:17.220
