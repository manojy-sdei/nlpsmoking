35
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right. And what I've done. About a year ago, is I I did some couples therapy with some clients. My heart health clients and I also did some individual therapy. It was really wild Megan. It was so weird, because what it feels like.

36
00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This is why it is. It's like meeting me for the first time and almost like you've known me forever like it's a both. It's like, I know you, but I've never met you I know you, but I've never met you. It's really weird.

37
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.650
Magan G.: Could you can come to my house.

41

42
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.770
Magan G.: Well, I can meet you halfway to or something if that helps. Yeah.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.510
Magan G.: Like it

46
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.830

48
00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:04.050
Magan G.: It's good. Yeah, and state state really monitor that road. So be careful. I've dispatched many officers on calls out there. So they really monitor I 40 south and northbound

49
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where I am, too, I think. I think I'm North and South, I take some kind of 14 then

50
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.490
Magan G.: You take the 1444 and

51
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.410
Magan G.: Then you get on I 40 in your head shelf.

52
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.330
Magan G.: Yeah yeah

53
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.980

Gwenevere Abriel: I know. So, okay, you think about that. I would love it but it will feel

60
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm dancing like

61
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Really intense to see me face to face.

62
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.130
Magan G.: Okay.

63
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.480
Magan G.: You'd have to. Okay.

64
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be like

65
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: She's real

66
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.970
Magan G.: She's, she's alive.

67
00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:09.630
Magan G.: She's a real boy. No. Okay. Well, it is a very weird to meet you in person. But I mean, maybe I the first thing that comes to my brain is. I wonder if I am Dr will feel different.

68
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: When I brought my buzzers. I brought my little buzzers.

69
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.810
Magan G.: So, that's perfect.

70
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.210
Magan G.: So I can actually do

71
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:29.040
Magan G.: And I've done it with the buzzers before where you have it in your hand. Yeah. And I just would like that's the first thing that comes to my brain is, I wonder what it would feel like.

72
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can create a whole create

73
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Session will create more time.

74
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.590
And

75
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll, we'll keep talking, trying to create time so that you have privacy.

76
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

77
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We can use because I have the headphones to so you'll have both. Not only will you have left and right stimulation, which is good and distracting if it needs to be nice and distracting, so that these other things can can emerge.

78
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you'll have the buzzers in your hand to so we'll have both. And I can also do because I remember I do

79
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the attachment, em, Dr. So if you decide, and you say, Yes, let's do this. You may know of course touches like, well, maybe you like that. I can also do right on the outside of your knees.

80
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:29.070
Magan G.: Oh, that sounds very interesting because I have an issue, you know. So I wonder what that would be like

81
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:38.010
Magan G.: You know, like that would be a very intense session from beginning to end, but I'm I'm open to doing it. I will give it a go.

82
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So play around with some ideas about when I'm

83
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.040
Magan G.: Off on Monday.

84
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.750

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now.

89
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.640
Magan G.: I can still meet you on Friday. It'll just be like, I get out of work and I can come and meet you

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.370

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay it's it really i'm open

100
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:20.100
Magan G.: To even like staying awake after work, because I know that this is like a once a one time deal so I'm really want to take advantage of it.

101
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And I'm also thinking about the weekend, too.

102
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.200
Magan G.: Because that might yeah I can meet you on the weekend as well.

103
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's. Why don't we not spend all our time doing that, we will figure it out because this is going to take a little bit of time.

104
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's

105
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your texting and through

106
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Will orchestrate something maybe even through email.

107
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, again, text you again if I text you or you text me and we don't hearing from each other. It might, because I'm in this twilight zone in here.

108
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.460
Okay.

109
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

110
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Then to how your week has been what you've liked about what you've done, who you've been kind of what it's

111
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.040
Magan G.: Like to be, um, it's been a stressful week

112
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:18.450
Magan G.: Last night, one of the girls that started. She was just having a really tough time and honest Headley just had no business being a dispatcher. She was let go. So that was pretty intense. While we were all there. And it just turned in.

113
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: She was like,

114
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.100
Magan G.: Yeah, the older lady. She was very nice, but

115
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:39.270
Magan G.: It was really sad. And it was just like everybody was like the night shift, we're pretty chill gang like we're very chill and like the day shift is all stoic and and

116
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:51.030
Magan G.: And not interpersonal don't communicate. They just hate each other the swing shift is drama like drama up the Yang and

117
00:09:51.990 --> 00:10:01.500
Magan G.: The night shift is really just chill. It's like a secret that nobody knows about but night shift is like the chilliest most easiest shift to do

118
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:13.950
Magan G.: But nobody knows it because it's physically hard, but it's not. It's, it's, yeah. But anyway, we're really chill and that definitely switched up the mood last night.

119
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:34.590
Magan G.: That was pretty intense. And I felt really bad for her and I wanted to like help her. But gosh told me that I needed to, you know, step, step down and just stay out of it because she kept trying to pull me in as somebody to back her up or validate her

120
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:50.580
Magan G.: And I it was putting me in a predicament. So, and I didn't want to be stuck in the middle. So I, I respectfully listened to my boss and but it was hard, because I just wanted to. I wanted to just

121
00:10:51.900 --> 00:11:00.240
Magan G.: Help her. I just even just to say some kind words to her and tell her that, you know, perhaps this is just God's way of saying

122
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:12.450
Magan G.: This isn't your something else you know something does anything, but I couldn't. And I just, it, it bothered me because she was right there in front of me. It's not over the phone. Yeah.

123
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.450
Magan G.: And I know what it feels like. So that I'm dealing with

124
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:28.950
Magan G.: My boss told me that apparently somebody went to the head boss and told them that I'm starting a pattern of calling out on Saturdays.

125
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:43.470
Magan G.: So I went through my call outs and I have two Saturdays that I called out one was when Jared was not well. And the second one. When was the nine when I was not well. And it was actually four weeks apart.

126
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:55.050
Magan G.: So, yet again, it's somebody else trying to look for something that isn't there, and my my supervisor, Josh. He validated it and said, yeah, there's, there's no issue here.

127
00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.620
Magan G.: Because it all reflects in our, in our schedule. There's no way that you can ship it.

128
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.490
Magan G.: Right and

129
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.610
Magan G.: I'm everybody wants to know if I'm leaving and

130
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.210
Magan G.: Stephanie apparently wants my shift.

131
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: They got wind that you're

132
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.120
Magan G.: Uh huh. Yeah.

133
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.840
Magan G.: They've gotten

134
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:32.010
Magan G.: Happen. I have no idea. I don't know how it happened. But even like officers know so I don't know if officers from BC. So communicate with each other or what but I yeah so

135
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:40.920
Magan G.: It's impacting me because I'm I feel like, Okay, I know this sounds awful. But I don't want Stephanie to when

136
00:12:43.290 --> 00:13:04.590
Magan G.: I'm working on letting that go and not letting that be my focus, but she like she wants my schedule. She wants to the Sunday off she wants to work nights, because a lot of the younger officers work at night and just a lot of her behavior is just to get me out in every way.

137
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think you should stay at this job and protect everyone that you work with Stephanie. What's your first response to that.

138
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.140
Magan G.: It's not my job.

139
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.430
That's right.

140
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.680
Magan G.: That's not my job.

141
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You

142
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Know who we got Stephanie, there'll be the Stephanie's there's going to be a new Stephanie where you're going and we're going to get ready for or a him if they're going to be all over

143
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.800
Magan G.: Yeah, well, so then that happened, and like I guess my head boss was asking my supervisor. If I was leaving

144
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.810
Magan G.: And all he said was that

145
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.640
Magan G.: I apply, but that he had no word of me leaving or not.

146
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:58.890
Magan G.: And I guess he spoke highly of me in that meeting. He said that the way that I apologize to Stephanie that day, and that you remember when I did that mock thing.

147
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.270
Magan G.: I guess.

148
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:08.190
Magan G.: That stuck with him and he was very impressed by my taking being the bigger person and just trying to squash it

149
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:27.630
Magan G.: And that he also reviewed the footage of that incident of the chair thing and it blatantly shows, even though she was the one who initiated the investigation that she was the aggressor and she hit me with the chair so

150
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.830
Magan G.: Even if I don't stay I at least know that

151
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:48.540
Magan G.: I'm that I'm leaving on good terms with my boss and perhaps if I need to in the future when things are whatever they need to be if I need to return or choose your turn that door is still open for me. Right. That's right.

152
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you

153
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no sort of negative feeling from from folks over there.

154
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.920
Magan G.: Like oh

155
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're leaving us, none of that.

156
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:06.630
Magan G.: I'm just Stephanie and Sydney. They're there. The negatives. Everybody else is saying.

157
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:13.980
Magan G.: Omega, and you're going to do so good over there, you're, you're, you've excelled here and there's no reason why you want Excel there.

158
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:30.960
Magan G.: I know you're worried about the economy right now and Colvin and going through probation again. And you're going, and going through another year of probation and training, but you can do it if anybody can do it. You can do it. I'm getting a lot of encouragement like

159
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

160
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:44.130
Magan G.: A lot of James and Josh and Julie and even are there people from swing shift are all like, I really think you're going to do well there because I

161
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.580
Magan G.: I, they say, I'm good at police dispatch so

162
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. Are you surprised by all of this piece.

163
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:58.980
Magan G.: I am a little bit surprised and I'm a little uncomfortable. I don't know how to just take a compliment and say thank you.

164
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:07.320
Magan G.: I want to just analyze it and be like, What's your ulterior motive. Why are you saying this to me, like what is what. What are you looking for are you

165
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:15.840
Magan G.: Are you wanting something in return. Are you wanting a compliment. Are you are you reaching for something from me. Do you have. Do you want personal 49

166
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:25.680
Magan G.: Are you trying to get in good with me. That is the first like all those things go through my head before I could even accept the fact that it was just a compliment. Right.

167
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nuts. Not unlike the guard that you have up all the time, are you analyzing what people are saying, so just

168
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.770
Magan G.: Sinking

169
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, just, just a little quick memorized.

170
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:37.650
Magan G.: Thing.

171
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know.

172
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a little mixed feelings about it.

173
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you thank you and oh yeah I'm excited. I have some mixed feelings about it. I'm not sure I don't have the job. Yeah, I don't even know. Have you ever and then come up with a question. You can redirect it to them.

174
00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:04.800
Magan G.: Yeah, I definitely wanted to give that a go. I'm going to try that. Because, and I just don't know how to respond and

175
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys, it just memorize that, and then turn the question on their shoulder so it's off of you.

176
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.960
Magan G.: Yeah, and that's so much better for me.

177
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah. Oh.

178
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.230
Magan G.: I'm much happier with that.

179
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Hot potato, you go

180
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.470
Yes.

181
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

182
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You stay on topic. Have you ever been like this to like you want to work two jobs at the same time. And then they answer and then you should let them answer.

183
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:40.650
Magan G.: Oh, and it's kind of feels that way, like I i want to stay for because I'm worried like, what if I leave and

184
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:50.670
Magan G.: I miss an opportunity to be a supervisor. I'm going to lose seniority. I've gained seniority there the economy's awful covert is awful.

185
00:17:52.950 --> 00:18:01.140
Magan G.: Probation is awful. I just all those things are going through my head, but then I think about why did I apply in the first place.

186
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:15.030
Magan G.: I applied because I want to excel. I want to better myself. I want to better myself, for my family. I want to make more money from my family. I want to take care of my family. I want to take care of.

187
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.880
Magan G.: Me, I want to be happy in the most way that I can be and

188
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:33.750
Magan G.: I'm always up for new adventure and. But what if I'm making a mistake, you know, and all these things are happening and I haven't even been offered the job yet.

189
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But

190
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: All you've got, and I know it would be lovely to have certainty. I wish I could hand it to you in an envelope. I would hand it to all of you that want certainty and frankly, I would take five of those envelopes myself.

191
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Unfortunately, all you've got is you've got

192
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:00.840
Magan G.: My gut.

193
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.550
Sorry.

194
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.370
Magan G.: Clear enough

195
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.870
Magan G.: In my gut. I feel like, can you hear me.

196
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I sure can.

197
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:27.330
Magan G.: Okay, in my gut. I feel like I am going to take this test, and I'm going to do great at it and I am going to get a job offer.

198
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.320
Magan G.: That is what I feel in my gut.

199
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Me too. And this thing where you say, all things being pretty equal it tips the scale because you believe, which you're not omnipotent. None of us are

200
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.110
Magan G.: That there is entity.

201
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: For more growth for you at this other position if it's offered if it's not

202
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And hands in the air and you go, Well, I tried. We'll see what pops up. Maybe it wasn't meant to be same way. This woman was told by you.

203
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know, we push only so hard to the universe. And then when it pushes back, they gotta wonder is it pushing back because it's not where I'm supposed to be.

204
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:20.790
Magan G.: Exactly. And so if I do not get an offer and it doesn't work out, then at least you know i i tried. I'm going to a four hour test on Monday. So I'm putting in effort. I'm putting in time.

205
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:31.650
Magan G.: And and if it doesn't work out, then maybe something better will come along later on. Now it's just not the time. And I need to hold fast.

206
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know what else

207
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Your boss your boss is know

208
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They're about to lose their like one of their best. And so it's not there. It's on the radar.

209
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.400
Magan G.: I sure hope so because I I work so hard. There

210
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.880
Magan G.: I tried to be a good team player. I try to volunteer and help people out

211
00:20:54.390 --> 00:21:13.410
Magan G.: I, I will take somebody else's mandate, because they have something going on that's important, and I need the money it benefits me as well. But I always try to look out for the greater good, and unfortunately I'm in a market of business market that is not like that at all and

212
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.210
Magan G.: I

213
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.440
Magan G.: I feel like I'm the irregular one

214
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're probably Megan, you're probably always going to feel like an outsider.

215
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's just

216
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Everywhere. Yeah, everywhere. That's, that's part of the

217
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:36.810
Magan G.: Enemy

218
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Will I ever belong, where it's my tribe, where is it, where do I belong. I don't understand why am I the odd one out that may follow you.

219
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.780
Magan G.: Forever.

220
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, forever, but you can flip it because the truth of the matter is, you do have a tribe you do actually. You have your family.

221
00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have people that you find interesting to people that you like we just flip it around, you know, your younger version was

222
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Here you are defined by the opinions and judgments of others. But as you grow more and more into yourself into your authentic self. You're going to define what your tribe is and where you're happy is is you're going to look around and say,

223
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I'm actually happy all by myself or I like these five people.

224
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: These are these are my people and and and maybe the tribe is the fact that you're, you're, you can move into some lick. Get in. Get out and not get hung up on the rotations of them you can get along anywhere.

225
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.620
Magan G.: Well, I've been noticing like

226
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:59.130
Magan G.: I had a I talked to my dad last night for a few hours. That was pretty intense and there was just more drama as usual brought up about me and my sister and what she thinks. And it was just more crap that I don't need and

227
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:13.290
Magan G.: I've been talking to some old friends from. Well, I've known one girl since middle school. She was Scott's girlfriend. And that's how I know her, and

228
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.180
Magan G.: She

229
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:23.130
Magan G.: I've known her since I was in the sixth grade and she's always been. We've always been close but

230
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.460
Magan G.: She's a person

231
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:33.330
Magan G.: I was talking to Andrew and I was telling him I feel like everybody in my life.

232
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:43.080
Magan G.: Is only out for themselves. They only care about themselves, they, you know, I had a conversation with her for

233
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:58.530
Magan G.: Multiple times over the last two months and she's never once asked how I'm doing what's going on with me. Am I okay. And it's not just her. I feel like so many people in my life are like that.

234
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.500
Magan G.: And it's draining.

235
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.930
Magan G.: And I hate it.

236
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do it differently, or do you wear this is this one.

237
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.550
Magan G.: Well, I want to do it differently. I know it's probably going to sting but sad.

238
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.090
Thing.

239
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.570
Magan G.: To say state say the sting, and I'll get it. As usual, I need to do it.

240
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The irony is

241
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We choose to be offended.

242
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch it, they're still being rude, but everything stays the same. They stay self centered they stay self interested they stay in their drama triangle moving between victim persecutor and hero they continue to move through there and we step out

243
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it and choose not to be offended. And the second you do that. The second you say, wow. Oh, good grief. He didn't even ask me how I'm doing. You just told me it was a half hour and you already talked about yourself.

244
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I only draw these kind of people in and yes it's tempting to go back to that. But you don't don't drop in to the drama triangle being a victim you step out and you can look at it.

245
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't feel like being offended. I want to have a happy day. I don't want to be offended.

246
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:23.940
Magan G.: But OK, so don't be offended. Don't be a I totally get what you're saying.

247
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.700
Magan G.: But how

248
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Sister drama, drama, like this.

249
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.420
Magan G.: Right. Yeah, but like

250
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.980
Magan G.: Do you remove them from your life.

251
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no, no, just in your head. All you do is

252
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What it is. So here's the circling like this.

253
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Comic Con. My dad.

254
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Has been sister dramas spinning. All they do is we they're worried about themselves worry, worry, worry, worry they forget to ask you how you're doing. And God forbid they actually don't.

255
00:25:51.870 --> 00:26:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Care, who knows. We'll never be in their head, but then they go from the outside. All we know is you did not hear them. So that's all you know for sure there was no asking, how you feeling it's going is

256
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:04.920
Magan G.: Nothing about me.

257
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you decide to get hit by this and it hits you, and you decide whether you want to get in it and being a victim role or you stay out. You watch it going

258
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.740
Magan G.: Yeah, I know. I don't want to be in the victim role.

259
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.730
Magan G.: And and in my friendships and

260
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to

261
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:37.410
Magan G.: How do you step back, like how do you say like eat like for example when my husband, or somebody that I'm very close to, how can I not be, how do I step back and not

262
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.250
Magan G.: Be in invested

263
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.890
Magan G.: And say I choose not to engage

264
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it like this.

265
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what you're going to feel at first. There's no bypassing that you're going to notice the threat. You'll notice that might

266
00:26:53.550 --> 00:27:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Come under review. You're going to feel it, you probably feel it in the body is the stomach, the throat, the chest, it will it will the jaw, it will have a response and you go up.

267
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, ouch. Okay. Wait, no, I don't want to feel that

268
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to step back and see they are speaking they are doing from their point of view.

269
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They're doing their storyline. I have mine. I don't want it. I don't have a father is this is going to take 45 minutes or so and take a week me feeling bad and insulted and hurt. I don't have the time for this.

270
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So I that's all going on in your head, you just look at it and you go look at that and now you can see it as if a therapist, we're looking at it from a distance.

271
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.960
Magan G.: Hmm.

272
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: See it, but it has nothing to do with you. They're just talking about some character in the play on up on stage with the name Meghan Oh yeah, Megan, right, right, right, right, right. Oh, yeah. Okay. So show. Okay.

273
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.750
Magan G.: Because I'm How are your needs.

274
00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:01.470
Magan G.: Ever met at all. Beyond the disinterested beyond because we are social beings, we are

275
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so first of all, do they look like they have anything to give you when they're doing this.

276
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No. And why would you go in that cyclone. Why would you go in there.

277
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.090
Magan G.: I don't know because it's it's familiar

278
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.050
Magan G.: They don't really

279
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You. That's right. Well, you're such a you know all the right words you just you're getting it girl. That's right. So what, who, who does know what to do.

280
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knows what they want.

281
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.170
Magan G.: Me.

282
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. And so you look at this, this is what you think is your resource. This is where all the resources are. This is where love is. But look at the

283
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.050
Familiar

284
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really not available to you right then. Now, if it slows down enough

285
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where he's calm and he's available to you. Maybe you'll decide to ask for a piece of that resource and like a little attention. I'd like a little reassurance. Can I process. You know, my job really kind of torn between these two. Maybe he's available or you could

286
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:57.690
Get

287
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:06.270
Magan G.: My asked if you do step out in this situation and you choose not to engage in the behavior.

288
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.630
Magan G.: Are you actively listening.

289
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you're looking at it as if it's up on a stage you're in the audience, you're looking at it.

290
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.160
Magan G.: As like a plan.

291
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're just went and there's a character Megan and look at these two sisters. Look at this one blaming that one.

292
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at, look at Megan She staying chill. In fact, she's like in that

293
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That meeting at work. Look at her. She's, she's can i can see her. She's playing her she's taken on a granted to truth.

294
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's true. She did withdraw a little bit just trying to protect yourself because it's freaking crazy. Yeah, I see here. I see. Are there who she looks so chill the CO calm, she is. She's taken care of herself. Look at her breathing.

295
00:29:53.370 --> 00:30:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she's washing her poor sister. She hasn't done the growing. She's not growing up. She's still doing what she's always done. That's kind of sad.

296
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not going to get her needs met, either. She's going to keep this chaos going

297
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: On look at Megan Oh she's kind of she's kind of at a distance from all of that on that stage. Look at that. Look at these two all of her sister, she doesn't find Megan interesting anymore just not getting anything out of us. Now she's turning your attention to someone else.

298
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's all in your head, what comes out of your mouth is just just active listening stuff.

299
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You want it. You want to give me an example of how you get sucked in, like, give me some of the worst things people have said around your to you or you get sucked in.

300
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.060
Magan G.: Your statements.

301
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.110
Magan G.: I get sucked into these statements.

302
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey what is, what is this Stephanie or a dad saying

303
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.810
Magan G.: Stephanie says

304
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.470
Magan G.: You're, you're, you're rude your route.

305
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.770
Magan G.: Dad says

306
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.210
Magan G.: You let him walk all over you.

307
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, James.

308
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.610
Magan G.: Know, Dad.

309
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.410
Magan G.: Oh, that

310
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you, you let your husband do that. Okay.

311
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.280
Magan G.: Yeah, yeah, or he'll say, like, you've lost yourself.

312
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that one.

313
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.860
Magan G.: So like just you, you use statements.

314
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:35.490
Magan G.: Okay, those are not active, but those are things that have been said and those have pulled me in

315
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And your sister.

316
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.020
Magan G.: You're my sister, you're

317
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.670
Magan G.: You're

318
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.090
Magan G.: You're, you're not protecting your children. That's that one hurt the most

319
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.330
Magan G.: That one's the most painful one

320
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember, I'm not going to be bringing anything new. All of these are going to be familiar, you remember any pieces of what day

321
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:07.800
And

322
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Time, so that you can breathe, so that she can remember even more things to say. Do you remember the the stall.

323
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.420
Magan G.: Nothing, nothing.

324
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.200
Magan G.: You don't remember. No, no, it's I say nothing.

325
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.690
Magan G.: Nothing that

326
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Works, but then that would definitely work so you can

327
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.530
Magan G.: But they're waiting for a response. And I definitely noticed that in the meeting with Chris

328
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:42.510
Magan G.: When I didn't say something, it was like, hello, but I really did take a moment to just not just blurt out the first response.

329
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can always say, I'm really listening.

330
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:55.590
Magan G.: I'm listening. I'm just, I'm considering what my response. I'm listening. I hear what you have to say, but

331
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.500
Magan G.: I know I'm overthinking it

332
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To how I listened to my tone. This is the difference. So if you say to me.

333
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: YOU'RE QUIET. Man, what's going on, like, if that was asked of me, I would say, oh, yeah, I'm just really listening.

334
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll try and say it like that to me.

335
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That

336
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.950
Magan G.: You're quiet, man.

337
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:24.510
Magan G.: Okay. Can you say it like that. Can you say

338
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hey, making your, your quiet.

339
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.900
Magan G.: I'm just really listening. Okay.

340
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: A little less dramatic.

341
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the inflections are great, but it was a little saccharin so go more like you give a shit about me now care about me.

342
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.380
Magan G.: Okay okay again.

343
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, hey, Megan, you're kind of quiet over there.

344
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.630
Magan G.: Yeah, I'm just really listening.

345
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, perfect.

346
00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:12.240
Magan G.: So fake in every way.

347
00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:15.240
Magan G.: Really dead.

348
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but it didn't, because what am I

349
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:19.650
Magan G.: Gonna

350
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Say anything back to that. Oh, you're listening. Like, that's, that's great. You

351
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.980
Magan G.: Can't argue with me.

352
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.570
Magan G.: Yeah, cuz I'm

353
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.260
Listening.

354
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the only last thing to do is

355
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any feedback about which what you're hearing. Do you have any feedback about this. That might be the next thing someone might say if they're really done talking

356
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:44.880
Magan G.: Let me think on this.

357
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

358
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.180
Magan G.: I would like to further

359
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I would like

360
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:56.580
Magan G.: To, I would like to further think on this. Um, I'll get back to you. Oh, man. Okay.

361
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What's

362
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The most difficult your sister with you're not you're not protecting your children was that the most difficult one. You heard

363
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:11.940
Magan G.: The most yeah the one you're not protecting your children, that one hurt the most out of all of

364
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Much it hurt because this and you went in. You got yourself offended by it, right, man.

365
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:25.620
Magan G.: Well, you're I think you're hitting way below the belt. When you are bringing motherhood into shit.

366
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.490
Magan G.: I would never knock another mom.

367
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but you're using. See, now you're in a fight. Because here's what just happened. She said you and you said

368
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.270
Magan G.: I did. You're right.

369
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.010
Magan G.: You're into now and we're fighting

370
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.870
Magan G.: Because I just said you statement.

371
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You got in the ring, whereas before

372
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She was either in the ring by herself looking for someone to fight with and yelling out or a stage, same thing.

373
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:57.240
Magan G.: I don't want to get in the ring with her. I don't, I don't want to get in the ring with her. It hurt.

374
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.770
Magan G.: It hurt really bad.

375
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.530
Magan G.: I'm not gonna lie. It hurt me.

376
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so here's the here's the trick. Remember there's freedom in owning

377
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That

378
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Have there been times where you fail you protect your child to the standard that you would have liked to go

379
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.030
Magan G.: Yes.

380
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's all you need. You feel that you go, oh, that's things because there's been times I could have done.

381
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: More better. That's in your head, you gotta do grand a truth otherwise they'd. Gotcha.

382
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't go to right you're in deep fight with how could you call me a bad mother, really. I mean, you're in a fight with that one. And it's, it's just going to be all about protection. Well guess what, neither one of you.

383
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Were protected and you're going to both be really angry and projecting it on to all kinds of people. That's the trauma right there. Okay.

384
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.870
Magan G.: That why she protects it on me.

385
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she's got a lot of work to do, I hope, I hope she find someone to work with.

386
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.180
Magan G.: So do I.

387
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a look. So if she it like there's lots of analogies, you got the cyclone. You've got the stage. You've got of the boxing ring, but all of them are separate and so when you hear that you're going to have a zing. You're gonna hurt. It's like dang, I went there.

388
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So you all the same things you do with a Chris you quiet.

389
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, that hurt. Yeah, there are some things I I don't really like thinking about, I guess I could have done more. Um, what, what, what are you thinking about your sister. Stephanie to

390
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Exist you

391
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.340
Magan G.: Know, sister. My sister is Alicia. Okay. Stephanie was your route.

392
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah I the names go okay so Alicia. So yeah, Alicia.

393
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So that first part, you get that first part down, which is the same thing you were doing.

394
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: With everybody else.

395
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:59.550
Magan G.: So I actively say to her out loud. Yeah, that hurt.

396
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, and why

397
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:10.800
Magan G.: Because yes, that hurt because there has been more than one said, I wish that

398
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.240
Magan G.: I would have done things better for Jared and McKenna.

399
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. And then hey, at least, Alicia, Alicia says whatever you call her.

400
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel about what I've been doing

401
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.580
Magan G.: How do

402
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.720
Magan G.: You say, I say, how do you feel about what I've been doing

403
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now about my marriage and my family.

404
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.280
Magan G.: Oh, she's made that very apparent.

405
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter. This is

406
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:46.110
Magan G.: Nothing. Okay. Um, how do you feel about what I've been doing

407
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Deletion to I think you're basically

408
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.090
Magan G.: Your week and your

409
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.790
Magan G.: You know your

410
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.230
Magan G.: Your weekend.

411
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:02.940
Magan G.: You're

412
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.970
Magan G.: Okay, it's manipulative you're controlling your

413
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:18.060
Magan G.: And and all of, I don't know why, but when it comes from her. It hurts so much more. Yeah.

414
00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:43.410
Magan G.: Mike, it's it's equivalent to Andrews King when I feel a pain from him something that's hurtful. Something that stings. It's not as intense as it is from Andrew, but it's it's up wearing that ring. Yeah, it's, it's, it hurts me

415
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.680
Magan G.: Deeper than most.

416
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be the problem with just

417
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, that really hurts.

418
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.770
Magan G.: I could say that boy that really hurts.

419
00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then shush, do you don't, I don't think you should

420
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.080
Magan G.: I think you keep I don't shush I fill in the silence.

421
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know because there's some interesting things that can happen there. If you just say, boy. Yeah, I do have some some things I would have liked to have done differently.

422
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It does her to hear it from you.

423
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then sure.

424
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.400
Magan G.: That's gonna take some practice.

425
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.480
Magan G.: Touch I

426
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.730
Magan G.: Never met anybody that oh

427
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm out of the ring. Because what she's up there. Yelling over she's in the boxing ring looking for someone to spar with she's looking down at you in the audience, and she's saying yeah well you know what kind of frickin mother. We do that.

428
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, trying to get you in the ring,

429
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:41.790
Mm hmm.

430
00:40:43.290 --> 00:41:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're looking at. Man, that hurts to hear that because I'm already like, you know, I got this guilt response. The shame responses and things that I didn't, I didn't protect what I wanted to, I was kind of busy just trying to survive in my own stuff. And boy, her to hear

431
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You shush.

432
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what would she say to that.

433
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.360
Magan G.: I see it there. I don't know because I've seen Alicia.

434
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:29.730
Magan G.: since we were kids. She's been this way, he will push and and she will find any weakness. Anything that she can utilize against you. She has brought up.

435
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:40.980
Magan G.: Every dirty secret that she wasn't even privy to that I didn't welcome her into things that she saw growing up things that

436
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:56.670
Magan G.: She witnessed things that she heard things that she thinks she knows things she's heard from third party things she's heard from my ex husband. My ex best friend and she will utilize it against me as ammunition and I have never met anybody

437
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.000
Magan G.: Anybody like that can

438
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.880
Magan G.: Rip me apart.

439
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.950
Magan G.: With just

440
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.270
Magan G.: Well, no, because Andrews done it, too.

441
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:21.270
Magan G.: I told my dad that last night that I think they don't like each other because there are so much alike.

442
00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:29.820
Magan G.: There are a lot of things that I do see in semblance, and then others. I don't

443
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:48.090
Magan G.: But I have never seen I've, I could never do I want to. And I've tried. I have tried to meet her words I've tried to go to that level and push those buttons and bring up

444
00:42:48.750 --> 00:43:00.990
Magan G.: Rub your dirty shit in your face, but I cannot meet her level. I can't. I cannot get to where she can because my conscience and my heart tells me.

445
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:09.510
Magan G.: No. Now, can you feel that that hurts to even think of that she's yours a little sister.

446
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.260
Magan G.: She's your baby sister and I stopped.

447
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.060
Magan G.: I she keeps going.

448
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.740
Magan G.: And she keeps going.

449
00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That she's going to continue to

450
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you do have a way out. You're in the audience.

451
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.320
Magan G.: And i wanna i want to do this. I do.

452
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say,

453
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you still love me.

454
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.990
Magan G.: She would probably go into shock.

455
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:37.950
Magan G.: If I said that

456
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm here, I'm in the audience.

457
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing I asked her, that

458
00:43:45.420 --> 00:44:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Her spit reached me from up in the ring, the spirit, she spit on me. It reached because you can split pretty far and it hit me and I wiped it out and I man that hurts to think about. I really set out to be just the best mom, I could be. And even then,

459
00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I see how I missed the mark with the best of intentions.

460
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.250
A lot of love me.

461
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.550
Magan G.: And then how do they respond

462
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me you know are

463
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:18.030
Magan G.: You ever seen that

464
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.160
Magan G.: I've never done that.

465
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.030
Course

466
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is

467
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.440
Magan G.: How they responded

468
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, the person I'm referring to as a narcissist. So they redirected it back to themselves. So no, it didn't work and I stayed happy.

469
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.510
Magan G.: And that's a lot of what I'm surrounded by

470
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: only care about you.

471
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.160
Magan G.: You're right.

472
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I of course I care about of course your family unit. Therefore, including your sister, including everyone that you love. I do, too.

473
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.880
Magan G.: But, but your goal is, if

474
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I want you to be like, I can't believe I'm not completely compensating right now I'm noticing my heart is a little racy and unclench.

475
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.370
Magan G.: I want to cry.

476
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to cry but

477
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.540
Magan G.: My may be crying at this point.

478
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually brain is still working.

479
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I

480
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.470
Magan G.: So do you still love me.

481
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So yeah, this hurts and

482
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.650
Magan G.: you still love me. I think she would tell. I think she would tell me

483
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:36.480
Magan G.: What does that have to do with anything, we're talking about. That's, that's what I'm thinking about right now.

484
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.040
And then what

485
00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You just stay in your truth. See what I'm doing. I'm only talking about me, she can make up crap. All she wants to I'm sitting here in the audience saying I feel hurt. I'm wondering if you still love me and I'm still thinking about that right now.

486
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna say i i

487
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not use I'm in the ring. Once I'm in the you

488
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.230
Magan G.: I feel hurt.

489
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:08.580
Magan G.: I realized that some of the things that you have said carry truth and it stinks.

490
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:12.870
Magan G.: I'm wondering

491
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.790
Magan G.: What you think of that. I'm wondering if you still love me.

492
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:19.470
Oh,

493
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What would she say okay well what does that have to do with our conversation.

494
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.310
Magan G.: What does it have to do with our conversation.

495
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.460
Magan G.: Because that's what's coming up for me.

496
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful, that's beautiful.

497
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then again, she would try it because she's an expert. Right.

498
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.830
Magan G.: She is very good. He is so good.

499
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:46.410
Magan G.: She will she's just like my mom that way. I love these are sparse.

500
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But the only way is just to disengage. It's this healthy detachment. You just disengage it doesn't mean you stop talking to them and then you just stay in your truth.

501
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: With defiance two hands on the hips. I will not change my mind just to accommodate your manipulation and gaslighting I stay in my truth right here.

502
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really hard. I really want to talk to you.

503
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys, but

504
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I'm still feeling hurt. Maybe we could talk tomorrow.

505
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.140
Magan G.: I

506
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:31.500
Magan G.: I would like to talk to you. I would like to visit with you more. Because I I keep leaving early I've gone over there twice to try to hang out with her, but she started stirring up drama and talking about Brittany and

507
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:47.670
Magan G.: And Joel and the kids and all the stories that are being said and it's all, he said. She said, and I left early both times. And really, the only reason why I went over there was to spend time with ariela

508
00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.790
Magan G.: And I do like seeing my sister, but

509
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.520
Magan G.: She's grown to be so unattractive to me that

510
00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.470
Magan G.: On the inside

511
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:00.360
Magan G.: That I just

512
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.700
Magan G.: She said suffocating

513
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:18.720
Magan G.: She's literally suffocating when I'm around her. She takes every bit of energy, good, bad, ugly everything and she takes it for herself and then I have nothing left to give. So I walk away.

514
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this predicates something else. And again, this means you only give what you have to give

515
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.840
Magan G.: That's going to be an interesting concept with this is

516
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:38.550
Magan G.: Because she won't come over to my house because she to hate Andrew she hates him.

517
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.640
Magan G.: So she won't come over here, unless it's like she needs something or wants something for me.

518
00:48:47.250 --> 00:49:06.720
Magan G.: And if she does, it's it's uncomfortable and I try to Exeter out of my home because I would, I don't want to being rude in my own Tantra that's not okay. But when I go over there. I'm in her element. So I literally have to just say, Well, I'm getting tired. I haven't gotten any sleep.

519
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.770
Magan G.: And I worked all night. So I'm going to go ahead and go home.

520
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:18.780
Magan G.: Something wrong because she makes me feel guilty and like, Oh, well, you just got here. Oh, I haven't seen you in a while and

521
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care.

522
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:25.110
Magan G.: I just don't want i want i want to turn her and say to her, Alicia.

523
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.510
Magan G.: I don't want to be around you right now, but I can't.

524
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:32.820
Magan G.: You're hurting me.

525
00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:35.370
Magan G.: My every word you say hurts me

526
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: stead of you.

527
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:44.730
Magan G.: Okay i i i feel tired right now, Alicia, and I don't have the energy to

528
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:48.960
Magan G.: To stay up and and

529
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.970
Magan G.: continue this conversation, I would like to try it another day.

530
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.730
Magan G.: Grace I and

531
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's sad to I'm feeling a little wiped out and sad. Some of the things you've been talking about today.

532
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just kind of in my head. Getting sad and I'm already pretty tired, but it is important to realize that keyword, but it is what you are talking importantly

533
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.220
Magan G.: What you are talking about is important to me.

534
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Really tired and a little preoccupied.

535
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: In the head and can we can meet maybe continue this day when I'm retired and maybe a little more fresh

536
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you move from your position. Oh, well great you come over here for for an hour and I barely get to see you, you're shooting.

537
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You say,

538
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want to start going to really be available. And I just need some rest.

539
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you want to meet tomorrow and you redirect it. Notice I just asked a question.

540
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:56.640
Magan G.: Yeah, the question of redirecting when would be a good time to for me to come over again.

541
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I mean, Jesus, I thought we were going to be talking today.

542
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.050
Magan G.: Oh, okay. Maybe we can try next week.

543
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.120
Magan G.: Okay. I love you.

544
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.640
Magan G.: I do love you very much.

546
00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.690
Magan G.: That was great.

547
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know where we go

548
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.110
Magan G.: With that

549
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:40.770
Magan G.: Maybe, maybe even like that sometimes she surprises me. And I'm like, Oh, there she is.

550
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.050
Magan G.: A little girl. I remember

551
00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:44.160
So,

552
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is just handling this this chunk of where you hold on to yourself okay is enough.

553
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't mind repeating these pieces over and over

554
00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.990
Magan G.: Is this. Oh, it helps

555
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, no, no problem. But this part that you don't have to remember, but it's probably going on.

556
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't the history between you and your sister that you protected her as best you could

557
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.760
Magan G.: I did. I tried to protect her.

558
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the thing.

559
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to you with the wound. She's still going to you, although you don't feel it that way. She's coming at you with with the same

560
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But it feels like anger, but she's coming at you with here's a problem. What are you going to do with that with it. You are my hero before you're not taking it that way, but it's she's still looking for help. She just doesn't know how to get it.

561
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:51.720
Magan G.: No, and she's the most it honestly. She's almost angriest person. I, I know. And my dad said it last night like she's never going to change and

562
00:52:52.440 --> 00:53:06.090
Magan G.: I. It breaks my heart, but I honestly see that if she doesn't correct some of these behaviors. She's going to lose you because I'm not going to be here forever. And there's only so much a person can take

563
00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:18.030
Magan G.: And he said, you know, because I told him on Mother's Day, the day before Mother's Day. She called me and she said, I have a Mother's Day present for you. And I was so surprised.

564
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:28.080
Magan G.: Because she never buys me a gift. She never does stuff like that for me. And it's not that I'm expecting it, but it was it was a surprise for me and

565
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:37.860
Magan G.: I got her a book because it was her first Mother's Day a book that she and ariela can share together about mommy and baby.

566
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:51.000
Magan G.: And a gift card and the card and they went over there and I gave it to her. She opened it up. She seemed to like it. She didn't seem overzealous or anything, and said, thank you. And she said, Oh, your gift is in my car.

567
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:52.770
Magan G.: And

568
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:59.910
Magan G.: I was like, Okay, well, I'll get it some other time. So Arielle I asked if I could have referred our

569
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:17.400
Magan G.: And she bought her over and chill. Oh yeah, your Mother's Day gift. And she goes, I think it's in the back and she goes to the back of the car and I go with her. And she was like, oh, it's under the stroller. And all I see is this like brown bag squashed under the stroller.

570
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:26.070
Magan G.: And I'm like, Okay. And she's like, I'll just give it to you some other time. It's nothing special. And I was just like,

571
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.680
Magan G.: God I'm that bag.

572
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:37.500
Magan G.: You know, like I had such high hopes and you actually thought about me, you actually

573
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:48.930
Magan G.: Considered, me, you, you, you, and you don't give a flying fuck like it's just you just threw it away like a piece of trash and

574
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No Megan.

575
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.140
Magan G.: Is that it, that's how I felt.

576
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.570
Magan G.: That's exciting. I know that's not true.

577
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.860
Magan G.: But in that moment.

578
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.270
Magan G.: That is like

579
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.260
Magan G.: How I felt

580
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone would have that experience.

581
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:00.300
I

582
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.000
Magan G.: Mean I still haven't gotten my Mother's Day gift I still haven't gotten it.

583
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:09.360
Magan G.: She's. She was like, Oh, I'll get it some other time again.

584
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but this is the push goal. This is just her pushing and pulling push pull

585
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this has nothing to do with you, I promise you. This is your sister's wound. I wish.

586
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish she was in therapy so badly.

587
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.670
Magan G.: She would benefit, but one time she went to therapy.

588
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.970
Magan G.: She it was court ordered

589
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:51.390
Magan G.: And she went through therapy and the therapist requested that my mom go and my mom went and Alicia told her everything the truth of what happened to both me and her

590
00:55:52.590 --> 00:56:04.920
Magan G.: And by the end of that therapy session, the court appointed counselor was telling my mother, like, Are you hearing your daughter, she's telling you that she was raped by your son.

591
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:12.900
Magan G.: And she refused to hear her and Alicia cried and

592
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:24.330
Magan G.: Every time that she ever talks about any form of therapy. She talks about that session and didn't route it if Dr. Like she really

593
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.670
Magan G.: It was it was court order. So she was forced to go

594
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That was poor judgment on the part of the therapist.

595
00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, better judgment would be for a consent to have been obtained so that if it were me, it would be, I need to know that this mother can hear some shit has enough ego strength to actually own it and validate

596
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.030
Magan G.: Because otherwise she didn't

597
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.650
Magan G.: She didn't at all.

598
00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just like being not believed again.

599
00:56:55.710 --> 00:57:08.310
Magan G.: It was that's exactly what Alicia said, and that's exactly how I felt when I told my mom. It felt like, Oh, you don't even believe me. So if my own mother won't believe me fucking will so

600
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.140
Magan G.: No.

601
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry that happened, but I try to tell you my ears just got really bad. Sorry.

602
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.570
Magan G.: That's okay. Take care. Take your time that

603
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Unfortunately, in, in

604
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.210
In my professional

605
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.210
Magan G.: Life delicate line.

606
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: really subtle it's of course I would love your mother to be the good good enough. The 30% minimum, good mother that's necessary. You know, to have this this sort of life, but

607
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.950
Magan G.: No.

608
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask it of everybody. That's why I don't ask the Andrews. I don't ask the Stephanie's I don't ask the

609
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Alicia has to be different.

610
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked you.

611
00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.770
Magan G.: To be different. Yeah.

612
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: An adaptation that reminds you that you're enough a way that says what I have is already enough

613
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But I can't be in denial about it anymore. I have to say this is really happening. My sister is hurt and wounded.

614
00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And still really hurting, and she is using anger to stay alive and she's not going to let it go. I hope she doesn't help. She doesn't collapse into a depression. I hope she keeps the anger going now. That's another perspective, keep it up, girl, you know, it is not about you.

615
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: wanting it to be so is your own wounding, but you have a me and you have a you

616
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have your children and slowly but surely, you're going to surround yourself. You're going to notice healthy and healthier people because you're going to like who you are around them. They won't suck the life out of you.

617
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll likely you are more and more and more and more and more moments of it.

618
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But your sister may continue to only have anger and I don't want her to let it go.

619
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she might collapse.

620
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see that's a different perspective.

621
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:56.070
Magan G.: No, absolutely. That's a wonderful perspective.

622
00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:06.480
Magan G.: It makes it makes me think, like, if that's the only thing that's keeping her alive. It's only thing it's keeping her all together, then keep your anger.

623
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.860
Magan G.: Because they only thing that can help you be a mother and get through your day then

624
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:11.640
The angry.

625
00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It because the because out here as a therapist. When I see is you either do that you do drugs you cut you burn you drink you you sex you overwork you sleep.

626
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.740
Magan G.: All the above. Yeah.

627
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You access or you kill yourself.

628
00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:33.330
Magan G.: I've done all those things. So for the gambling and killing myself.

629
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank goodness

630
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:41.220
Magan G.: Yeah. No, but seriously, that's true. I do always wonder though like

631
00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Crack down or you go crazy or you can go crazy. You can do that one too.

632
00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.650
Magan G.: I haven't done that one either.

633
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.490
Magan G.: But I have always wondered

634
00:59:52.200 --> 01:00:03.420
Magan G.: Or I've at least tried to wonder, because Andrew said it to me one time, he said, it must be so difficult being the mother.

635
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.090
Magan G.: Of all three.

636
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:14.700
Magan G.: In that situation, the one is the offender and two victims and you're the mother of all of them.

637
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:23.250
Magan G.: And that really did put in things into perspective, because she really just

638
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:28.590
Magan G.: couldn't give me any more than what she she gave

639
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So Megan, let's process what today was like go inward.

640
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.810
Magan G.: It was insightful.

641
01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.360
Magan G.: Curious

642
01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you come away with today.

643
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

644
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.670
Magan G.: Um, and

645
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:03.060
Magan G.: A desire to explore that curiosity.

646
01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:07.530
Magan G.: I think that's what I'm walking away with today.

647
01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation is to dip out of the ring and. Watch it. Watch the cyclone watch the performance watch triangulation. Watch the boxing ring.

648
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And care about the dynamics from a distance. And yes, you're a player but look at it from a distance. It's just a Megan over there, not you. It's just that's playing out. Just get some distance from it for a second.

649
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you want that character to do see it.

650
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You would want her to be resilient. We wanted to breathe. You'd rather take care of herself.

651
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We need some distance from this. I feel sorry for Alicia let this is all she's got is rang or she's taking out all on her sister. She's therapist. She needs someone who knows how to handle that anger. She needs some

652
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That will take care of her, who will protect her.

653
01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about you. You can love her. Any way, the way she's. Same way, she can love you. Okay, you can love her anyway can just see that anger is something else. It's just, it's an adaptation. She's doing the best you can.

654
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

655
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to figure out what I'm doing with this next Friday thing.

656
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.730
Magan G.: You'll tell

657
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.750
Magan G.: Me Um, let me know.

658
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Seems like I mean, right. Come on, help me with this math if it's

659
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.360
Magan G.: Not good at math.

660
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's eight o'clock here. It's going to be 7am in in in in Seattle. Right.

661
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:47.550
Magan G.: Yes, because that's Pacific time. Correct.

662
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

663
01:02:50.370 --> 01:03:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no enough my thing doesn't start until 10 nine 939 30 Pacific Pacific time. Okay. So then, so let me turn seven people together here. So, this will be Mountain Standard

664
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay equivalent is so we would be starting at nine. So then that would be nine, it would actually be nine to 10 Pacific Standard Time. And then it's

665
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The earlier keys, it'd be seven grief. It'd be seven to eight pacific standard and this one the gal. I mean with is really, it's 6am to 7am pacific standard. So that's how I'm meeting with you. So really, really and truly over on Pacific Ocean side.

666
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be eight o'clock, and we're done. I think we can meet. I think we're okay I'll double check myself. It's hard to hold three time zones and same time

667
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.580
But I'll fingers.

668
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.020

Gwenevere Abriel: And I've got to be plunked down here for quite a few hours and won't be able to get from Albuquerque to hear quite quite in time.
