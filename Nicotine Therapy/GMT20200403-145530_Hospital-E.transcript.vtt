4
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.210
Joshua Ward: I used really really heavily and it's done nothing but taking it back and back. I've been in prison for times I barely got out again.

5
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:51.960
Joshua Ward: And I'm not trying to be a statistic of trying to break that cycle. And when I was out last time. Like, I know I shouldn't say this, but I was using my sister Suboxone and I say doing good for a while.

6
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.010

Okay.

26
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.200
Chris Alliman MD: What do you think about that.

27
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.850
Joshua Ward: Wrong.

28
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:08.040
Joshua Ward: Yeah, well it's, it gives me it does, it gives me right now. Like, I'm trying to do good. So like it doesn't get it keeps me confined for the moment.

29
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.960
Joshua Ward: So I can get my life going good. If I like right now. I'm trying to think before

30
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:26.670
Chris Alliman MD: Good. I like to hear that. I mean, often people here think that, you know, parole is this punishment type thing, but it looks like you've got a really good view of it and using it as a tool to help you in your recovery. Yes.

31
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.660
Chris Alliman MD: And I like that. That's great. So when you were in prison. How much heroin, were you using

32
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.280
A lot

33
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.250
Chris Alliman MD: Can you give me an idea of what that means.

34
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.040
Joshua Ward: Like two three grams a day.

35
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.030
Chris Alliman MD: Oh, wow. Yeah. How many times a day were you using heroin, then

36
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.060
Joshua Ward: Every time I come out of him blacked out

37
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.380
Chris Alliman MD: Okay so multiple times like four or five times a day.

38
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.310
Joshua Ward: Yes, sir.

39
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.540
Yeah.

40
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.740
Chris Alliman MD: What's your motivation at this point to stay out. I hear not wanting to be a statistic. I'm wondering, more from you. Why

41
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.740
Joshua Ward: I have two kids that I just barely I just barely met and I'm back with my with my baby's mom and like I i just want to be there for my kids and I want to do good.

42
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:24.750
Chris Alliman MD: That's that's often a very strong motivator, you know, wanting to be there for the kids, wanting to do better that way then makes a lot of sense to me. How old are your kids.

43
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.370
Joshua Ward: 10 and eight.

44
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.230
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

45
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:43.950
Chris Alliman MD: All right, let me get a little other information here from you. It's we're working on this and we'll come back to all of it. We're going to get you a Suboxone prescription today. So we'll get that taken care of. Okay, just to put your mind at ease that way.

46
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.940
Okay.

47
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.000
Chris Alliman MD: Any allergies to medications.

48
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.280
Joshua Ward: Not that I know I've never had any

49
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.570
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Do you take any medications currently just

50
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.640
Joshua Ward: For my sinuses, like over the counter.

51
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.370
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good. Nothing prescribed though.

52
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.690
Chris Alliman MD: No. Sure. Have you been diagnosed with anything like diabetes, high blood pressure, hepatitis C.

53
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.080
Joshua Ward: I had have saved but I got the Tribune. When I was in prison, this time.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.680
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent glad to hear that. Is it gone

55
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.910

56
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.380
Chris Alliman MD: Wonderful. Any other diagnoses that you carry Joshua

57
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.550
Joshua Ward: I don't know if there's a died on so but i got i have a kidney removed.

58
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.970
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. So when did you have that removed.

59
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.530
Joshua Ward: When I was 16

60
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.170
Chris Alliman MD: Why did you have that removed.

61
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.590
Joshua Ward: I got stopped by a bowl one and the rodeo.

62
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.300
Chris Alliman MD: Oh wow, okay. And how have you done with that, just one kidney is like

63
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.970
Joshua Ward: It, it hasn't been a problem so far.

64
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.780
Chris Alliman MD: Good, good, knowing that, do you have a primary care doctor that you see.

65
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.610
Joshua Ward: I don't not at the time.

66
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.600
Chris Alliman MD: I would imagine just having gotten out of prison, a few days ago, you wouldn't yet.

67
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:10.200
Chris Alliman MD: So we are we are not a primary care group, right. We want you to have that in place. Also, you may not need to go. Very often, but just with your kidney problems. You want someone checking in on you like once or twice a year.

68
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.310
Okay.

69
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.660
Chris Alliman MD: What town are you in in New Mexico.

70
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.980

Joshua Ward: Yes, sir. Okay.

75
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:35.100
Chris Alliman MD: Good. And are you working towards getting a job or how are you, what are you doing with all this covert 19 stuff going on.

76
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.940
Joshua Ward: I was going to get a job with my friend's dad, but they really don't want me working out there because he they said

77
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.770
Joshua Ward: They've been out there before because my friends been on pro and they said that they don't want me working out there because he drinks a lot. I don't want me around it. So I got

78
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.280
Joshua Ward: Like

79
00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:01.530
Joshua Ward: It's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty hard. But right now, they have me right they because I was locked up for five and a half years. They put me on a cash assistance and Medicaid and all that stuff.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.660
Joshua Ward: This ankle bracelet.

88
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.430
Chris Alliman MD: How long do you have that on

89
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.550
Joshua Ward: Um, they say, six months.

90
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.240
Chris Alliman MD: Oh, wow. Alright, so that's that whole till November time. It sounds like approximately

91
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.620
Joshua Ward: Yeah, pretty much.

92
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.780
Chris Alliman MD: All right, besides that kidney surgery. Have you had any other surgeries.

93
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.120
Joshua Ward: No, sir. Good.

94
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.710
Chris Alliman MD: All right. And have you been diagnosed with I need any psychiatric issues like depression, anxiety, bipolar PTSD.

95
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:58.200
Joshua Ward: I haven't been diagnosed with it, but I was like, I want to get into it. They imprison the phone. I need to get with a psych when I get out because of how much time I've been in prison.

96
00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.550
Joshua Ward: Okay, just

97
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.460
Chris Alliman MD: Process through some of that sounds like

98
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.200
Chris Alliman MD: So how much do you know about our program Joshua

99
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:16.680
Joshua Ward: My friend Robert said it's really good, that he did he really liked it because if you do it from home, cuz he's on parole to and

100
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.120
Joshua Ward: He said that it's like he's

101
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.930
Joshua Ward: got no problems with it. And he said, it's just great. He's all

102
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:33.420
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Good. I'm glad you're getting that positive feedback. So basically, the way it works. And I've got a lot more questions for you. And so we'll get through those. But the way it works is that you have two meetings a week.

103
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.730
Chris Alliman MD: One is a group meeting with me a therapist and several different patients.

104
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.300
Chris Alliman MD: And that's when we read, talk about your medication.

105
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:53.820
Chris Alliman MD: See how it's going and refill the medication and generally here for the first 30 days we refill the medication to get to your therapy session. So we have therapists with our group.

106
00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:03.840
Chris Alliman MD: And so you'll have a weekly therapy session when you've attended those therapy sessions, they let me know and I send in another refill of the medication to get you back.

107
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:12.840
Chris Alliman MD: To your regular group time. So for the first month we do two prescriptions, a week. The idea is to get people to

108
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:21.420
Chris Alliman MD: Buy into and go to those therapy sessions. What we've noticed is if we do a full week of medication, people don't go to the therapy sessions.

109
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:32.520
Chris Alliman MD: And this recovery from drug use. There are two things. One is the medication that helps keep you from going into withdrawals, which is very important. Right.

110
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:48.660
Chris Alliman MD: The other is dealing with the mental aspect of addiction and that recovery happens through behavioral health through therapy sessions. So they're both extremely important and we need you to do both. Can you do both. Do you think is

111
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.020
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. That's what I needed to hear. That sounds good. When was your last heroin use

112
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.580
Um,

113
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.030
Joshua Ward: I, I started doing good in prison. Like my last six months. I got into

114
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.330
Joshua Ward: The program. And so I'd say probably six months ago.

115
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:16.140
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. Have you been taking any medications to help keep you off of heroin or you just toughing it through.

116
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.880
Joshua Ward: I was just talking to through

117
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.080
Joshua Ward: And I got a wave.

118
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:27.030
Joshua Ward: I get general population in prison. Like, that's where all the drugs are at and I went to the art that program, which is a drug robot robot robot rehabilitation.

119
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.310
Chris Alliman MD: Program and prisoner. Sure.

120
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.750
Chris Alliman MD: Good. It sounds like that helped out quite a bit and you were really motivated to work on that. That's really good. I'm glad to hear that.

121
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:44.580
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. All right. Um, you haven't been on Suboxone then either for the last six months. Right.

122
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.470
Joshua Ward: I'm not prescribed

123
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.980
Chris Alliman MD: So I don't care prescribed or not. Right now I just want to know if you've been when when when did you last take Suboxone

124
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.240
Chris Alliman MD: Yesterday, okay, how much Suboxone are you generally taking

125
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.160
Joshua Ward: My sister goes to 12 and I take one of those in the morning.

126
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.400
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And does that help hold you pretty well all day.

127
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.990
Joshua Ward: Yeah, just been pretty good.

128
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.200
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent, excellent. So we're probably going to shoot towards getting you your own prescription of the 12 milligrams

129
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.960
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good. Um, let's see here.

130
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.610
Chris Alliman MD: So you've got an eight year old and a 10 year old in the house.

131
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:34.200
Chris Alliman MD: And you're living with your it is your wife or just a girlfriend or you said mentioned baby mama and I'm always confused as to what that means. Exactly.

132
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.220
Joshua Ward: She's my fiance.

133
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.330
Chris Alliman MD: fiance. Okay, and your own living in the same house together.

134
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.320
Joshua Ward: Yes, sir.

135
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.480
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Any drug addiction, a drug issues or addiction issues for your fiance.

136
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.130
Joshua Ward: No, never.

137
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.110
Chris Alliman MD: And she's aware of what's going on for you. Clearly, and she's supportive of the process.

138
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.760
Joshua Ward: Yes, sir, but

139
00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:12.450
Chris Alliman MD: What I want you to know is that Suboxone the residue when you use the Suboxone the residue that's on your fingers. The residue that's around your mouth or in your mouth. The residue that's on the packaging is enough to kill kids if they lick it.

140
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:24.780
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. All right. So we always send in a prescription for Narcan the nasal spray to help reverse overdose. Okay. God forbid something happens.

141
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:38.940
Chris Alliman MD: The kids get into the packaging or you didn't wash your hands. And for some reason, you know, you kids bite net or you give your kids a kiss or something you know something passes along, God forbid, you'll have the Narcan to use for them.

142
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.050
