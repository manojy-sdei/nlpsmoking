00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You seem like you've got something weighing heavy on. Yeah.

2
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.650
Alicia Noedel: I'm just not feeling good much. My lungs are hurting pretty bad. My throat hurts.

3
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.880
Alicia Noedel: Two days ago I started getting like, body aches and like cold sweats and I felt really hot, but I didn't have a fever anything

4
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.180
Alicia Noedel: Last night. Oh, a cane started feeling sick and this morning I woke up with my lungs kind of feeling weird

5
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Any, any like the congestion is the phlegm there.

6
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Oh, I don't mind sharing that at all.

7
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.070
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I mean, it could be because I like

8
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.970
This week,

9
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:27.270
Alicia Noedel: Just because I've been getting, like, kind of like cabin fever from being in the house for so long, I started to smoke more

10
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.540
Alicia Noedel: Oh, be, you know, from that.

11
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. I'm with you. I'm with you.

12
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.160
Alicia Noedel: But, um, the baby's teething.

13
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.420
Alicia Noedel: And she's having a rough times like with the sleeping and everything so

14
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.140
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

15
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do something that

16
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Has hopefully a positive effect on still if we see if we can set some

17
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: warm, fuzzy feelings to an object. I want to see if we can find if you're up to, um, let's see if we can find it might mean you walking around your place a little bit. I'll show you what I mean by a neutral object and then you have to think of one.

18
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to think of

19
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A neutral object that

20
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no negative memory. Oh, this is when I had blah, blah, blah. And you look at it, you're like, really happy really happy. No, just neutral. So for example, you know, it's a little earbuds case, you know, headphones or maybe

21
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like I glass bag or something like that. Something that has really something neutral.

22
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It'd be nice if it was not too big, just in case it needed to travel with you think someone texted Jeff.

23
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.500
Alicia Noedel: I'm going my nose spray

24
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep thinking as that's got much meaning in it. I mean, neutral, so I'm

25
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.400
Alicia Noedel: Gonna say my notebook, but no books mean a lot to me too. Yeah.

26
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But take your time. So just pay attention.

27
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: To

28
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's a lot of meaning to different things. But that's part of the searches. We're going to try and find something that really is like this just neither here nor there. I'm not drawn to it, nor repulsed from it.

29
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Smile.

30
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, baby.

31
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.540
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, she's been screaming for like an hour now. She's having a really hard time

32
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Calm, that might be a possibility that one might not be bad. Let's keep that one. Do you have anything like any little, little river river stones, anything like that that are neutral.

33
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.720
Alicia Noedel: My niece Codex rocks.

34
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.600
Alicia Noedel: And she has like 100 rocks in our house. Let me see.

35
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be something I'd want you to keep

36
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.630
Alicia Noedel: Sorry.

37
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm asking you to go look.

38
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.380
Alicia Noedel: See if I can find a small piece of this

39
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.080
Alicia Noedel: Ever string of coral.

40
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's think about it like this. If I were to work with you and you had

41
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: An experience that was a positive one. And you had this sort of sense of odd. This is a sort of an object that I can take with me if I was ever going anywhere. Yeah, yeah. Now, can you can you keep that. Okay. Yeah, let's do that one. I like how small it is.

42
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.790
Alicia Noedel: Get back to my little group.

43
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let me take a look at that baby what you got.

44
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you paint that

45
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.750
Alicia Noedel: My niece painted it for me.

46
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think that might be a good one. We're going to go with that one.

47
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So overall, your

48
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: House your stress level with baby teething walking with virus with just everything going on your recovery. Just the whole thing, kind of, where have you been house how distressed. Have you been

49
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.420
Alicia Noedel: I I been a little

50
00:08:50.340 --> 00:09:01.290
Alicia Noedel: Cuz late lately. I haven't been, you know, since you kind of set that set me straight. That sounds horrible. But like, you know, told me, like, Why worry about things. I can't control sort of thing.

51
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:11.310
Alicia Noedel: I've been kind of mellow and like that helped me put things into perspective, a lot, but it's the past like three days.

52
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:23.700
Alicia Noedel: A good death toll rising and you know people getting really, really sick. And it started to get a little higher. My anxiety and being stressed out about everything.

53
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.570
Yeah.

54
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was thinking about, I think we'll spend some time with that today. Okay, and see if we can kind of do some work with that and and with that rock, you've got

55
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been noticing that in my clients and

56
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this is something that, again, we don't have the answers yet we don't. Yeah, we don't have control over it.

57
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice that you were able to kind of compartmentalize it somehow. And now it's back

58
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But also, do you notice the context that you're also feeling poorly.

59
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:15.990
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I'm not sure if I'm actually feeling, you know, sick or if it's just like, kind of like a reverse placebo.

60
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

61
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

62
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:30.330
Alicia Noedel: Like knowing that there's something out there that has all the symptoms that like I'm feeling very mild because I don't feel like extremely sick, like I need to go to the hospital, but like

63
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychology I has a term. Actually, this comes from

64
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, see if we can

65
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear this isn't you but it you know how you're saying this reverse

66
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: reverse psychology

67
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Placebo

68
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think I know what you're trying to say, I'm gonna, I want to pull the definition up so you can see it. See if this was what you're thinking.

69
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.900
Alicia Noedel: Oh, it's my anniversary today.

70
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:01.710
Oh,

71
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to find a way to kind of celebrate that.

72
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:14.400
Alicia Noedel: Um, I don't know, I, my mom might watch the baby for a few hours and will probably play video games thing.

73
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.910
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

74
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.890
Alicia Noedel: There's not much to do.

75
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know, but keeping keeping on tradition in ritual in place right now. Really important.

76
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:34.590
Alicia Noedel: Right, I'll probably make dinner or something. He likes pasta. I'll probably make like Fettuccine Alfredo or something, some good

77
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what would you like to receive as a gesture of love language to you, what would feel like love to you on this special day.

78
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.010
Um,

79
00:11:45.150 --> 00:12:05.130
Alicia Noedel: I I'm a big gesture person like I'm not, I'm not like the for a new person to expect big extravagant gifts or you know even want that the littlest things make me feel loved, because it's the effort that counts.

80
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:06.720
Alicia Noedel: I know

81
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But she you notice how you didn't give me one you just give me an explanation about hi

82
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.090
Alicia Noedel: No, no, I was gonna

83
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.500
Alicia Noedel: I was gonna continue

84
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me

85
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.790
Alicia Noedel: Like a letter.

86
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.740
Alicia Noedel: A poem

87
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.960
Alicia Noedel: Little things little things like that.

88
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.000
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I've been just, you know,

89
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.190
Alicia Noedel: If I had about running a bathroom me or you know something. Yeah.

90
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks like he's gonna miss a beat. Is there any way he would miss it and not not get those done for you.

91
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Are seeking Him.

92
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.270
Alicia Noedel: Is he gonna remember

93
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.620
Alicia Noedel: He's pretty consider it of things like that.

94
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.170
Alicia Noedel: And he knows that I'm a, I'm a big

95
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.230
Alicia Noedel: I'm like I'm I

96
00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:02.400
Alicia Noedel: I show affection by like being loving and, you know, touch, that's how I show you know that I love you and so

97
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:12.780
Alicia Noedel: He knows that that things like that little things are what you know make me feel special.

98
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If there is any chance that it looks like he's not going to do that for you today.

99
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just playing with this idea of giving yourself permission to

100
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring poetry into it, bringing that back into it on your own and it may seem weird well but just making sure self soothing that that stuff is there. Don't deprive yourself just because right because he's going through this stress to

101
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean he doesn't love you just means

102
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe pawn didn't come up or running the Boston come up so

103
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.860
Alicia Noedel: Also, you know, sometimes you need to tell men was

104
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.530
Alicia Noedel: Like the not very you know that

105
00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.370
Alicia Noedel: That way.

106
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you're now you're getting my point. I was dancing it

107
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But

108
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.590
Alicia Noedel: They don't know until you're mad, we can't expect them to.

109
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Know they actually mind reading does not actually exist. It's not

110
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm I would really be an expert at it. If anybody could

111
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But even realize

112
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's, that's not my space that's your space. And so if we get over the fact that will you should know by now. Right.

113
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What you know if we get over that and say, no matter what. I just want I want this to be an easy really loved. I want to feel loved. I want you to feel love you know

114
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could be a, you know, if you're wondering how to kind of make me feel, you know, to honor today would love a little poem or run a bubble bath or something sweet like that. You know how you know

115
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Easy for them, be like, Oh, snap. I'm so so glad she gave me an hour because I forgot. I didn't know what to do now.

116
00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:06.930
Alicia Noedel: Well for Valentine's Day. He bought me. You know how they get pieces of glass like squares of glass and then they etch things inside of them like glass cut

117
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:26.040
Alicia Noedel: for Valentine's Day. He told me, You know, we don't have money for our anniversary. I got you this. And so he got me a picture of our family portrait engraved in glass and then he got another like heart shaped glass necklace with my daughter's face action to it for Mother's Day.

118
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.450
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, he's pretty ahead of the

119
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.230
Curve.

120
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: He'll probably do just fine today.

121
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yummy. So this word that I thought you might have been searching for is now i this is not the label. I'm giving what you're talking about. But if you wanted to play with another word. Let me show you. It's a word I play with when I'm describing myself. I'll show you.

122
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a word on I might say,

123
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm being a hypochondriac.

124
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

125
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.570
Alicia Noedel: I yeah i know what i hypochondria yeah

126
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.500
Alicia Noedel: So the things that there's all kinds of things wrong with them.

127
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but we if we say it, then we're like, Okay, I have some perspective that I might that the stress itself, although we say how can

128
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We call this word stress, but it actually has a chemical response in our body.

129
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we say okay

130
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be because I I'm over right number that halts like I'm overtired I'm also not feeling well.

131
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.180
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I'm exhausted, too.

132
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:36.930
Yep.

133
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So you might go around and say, I might be a hypochondriac. Maybe I got to really see if this is this breathing just me because I'm just so focused on it. Is this wedding, because I'm just so focused on it. Um, but that that might be all it takes is just that dual awareness and saying,

134
00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me, let me just see how long this last and if I really look at it and pay attention to it. The

135
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:08.250
Alicia Noedel: Oil. So know that they were saying like when when you do have Cobra 19 that the symptoms don't just come on very slowly it

136
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.660
Alicia Noedel: You know hits you.

137
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.680
Alicia Noedel: Already hard

138
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:30.630
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, so, you know, if I start getting worse, you know, in an hour, two hours. The way you know with the cold or the flu. You know, one day you'll wake up and you have a cough and your nose is ready and you know you have a little bit of body aches and that'll last the whole day.

139
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:44.850
Alicia Noedel: And you won't feel worse that whole day until like probably the nighttime go to sleep, wake up. And then you feel worse the next day. It's a slower progression. I guess then opening TEAM COVERAGE IN PROGRESS is a lot faster.

140
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.410
Alicia Noedel: So,

141
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know that that's that's useful.

142
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But I mean, I think it's pretty natural for all of us to be like

143
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.930
Alicia Noedel: Mike Yeah.

144
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, is that, and so then I look at it, and I'm like, huh, okay, ya know, that was only like three or four times that went away. But how do we all not pay attention to that of course we're going to say

145
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're, you're, you got to remember

146
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Your shoe. How many hours did you get asleep really back to back, because she was teasing.

147
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.010
Alicia Noedel: Me to sleep at to

148
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.900
Alicia Noedel: woke up this morning at six for appointment, because I like to wake up a little earlier, just in case.

149
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yeah, see, so there wasn't a lot of sleep. So what's going to be probably

150
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.680
Alicia Noedel: It's been like that for like the past four days.

151
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're remembering. It's okay. And, but it also, it's not a small thing.

152
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to say, well, that that could make me more sort of sensitive to highs and lows of a mood throughout the day.

153
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So that we can play with that word a little bit

154
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Better country.

155
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.860
Alicia Noedel: You know, a few of those.

156
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you do

157
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, oh, you got this. And

158
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about his health.

159
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, oh boy.

160
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go in here and look a little bit more. I've got you got that little rock. Let's see where we left off a couple other things we were doing.

161
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, my ears are really bad this morning.

162
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.280
Alicia Noedel: I could also have like allergies. I have like a little inner ear tickle.

163
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

164
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.810
Alicia Noedel: Or my hair was on all night. I could just the, you know, dry recycle air all night.

165
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.600
Alicia Noedel: If you need some fresh air.

166
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do this, let's take this rock.

167
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's do

168
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We call this

169
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, the goal of this is to sort of create

170
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: An automatic response to your holding this rock.

171
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, let's say you were going to go somewhere and you had some trepidation over it. I have to go for some people it's they have to go to court or they have to go to a doctor, they have to go even even shopping

172
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.440
Alicia Noedel: Might right now. Yeah, it's the store for me.

173
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

174
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.530
Alicia Noedel: Like today I have to go to the store.

175
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.520
Mm hmm.

176
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you can use is we're going to, you don't have to hold that in front of me. You can just

177
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it in your pocket, just kind of put it, put it in your right hand. Just get a feel for it. And so maybe what we'll do is we'll have this rock be

178
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a positive imagery rock that it said, I don't want to say the word hypnosis, because I'm not going to do hypnosis, but

179
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: A touchstone right this is how I can feel okay again and let that be sort of the button to getting back into your body out of the worry mind back into

180
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything's okay. I feel good again. So I don't we can come up with a name for it.

181
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.520
Alicia Noedel: Like grounded. Okay, feeling more grounded.

182
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we call you want to call it a grounding rock.

183
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:46.770
Sure.

184
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What about what about a grounding stone. Okay.

185
00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We change the name because that's got that groundings a long word if we want to change it, we can. Let's do this.

186
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.230
Alicia Noedel: Because I was gonna stay stability with us. Just as long so

187
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: will will will find it. We can change in hundred times.

188
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's when you think of the stone and there may be words this week. Do do this exercise together that come up and then that will transform the name. Okay.

189
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. I'm going to do it with you.

190
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I want one to

191
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Mine. So let's close the eyes and see if you can feel. And I do want it in your right hand.

192
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.500
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

193
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.340
You can

194
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But this right hand.

195
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

196
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Controlled by the left part of your brain. The weather has words and it's got lots of knowledge stored information. It's what we often think of it as our, sort of like just sticks logical part of our mind.

197
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And just get a sense if you have

198
00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Any emotion, one way or the other around this grounding stone.

199
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just watch your own awareness come and go like to just get a sense of things first.

200
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To have a sense of its neutrality.

201
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so it's neutral. It's neither distressing nor exhilarating.

202
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got the emotion there that neutral that experience of neutral.

203
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can bring it

204
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Some images, maybe have something really positive. Let's see if we can take this neutral grounding stone.

205
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's attach it to a positive image. What's a positive image that that you get just as I invited

206
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Something really really positive that we're going to attach to this groundings done

207
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.550
Alicia Noedel: Like a place or

208
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Any of the above.

209
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.020
Alicia Noedel: I just thought about like a big field.

210
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.520
Alicia Noedel: Of like flowers are beautiful sunny day.

211
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into that. And notice the temperature of that day and how the errors are moving on that field of flowers.

212
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The colors of the flowers are just the types of flowers.

213
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:54.000
Alicia Noedel: It's kinda like the Wizard of Oz at the end when they go through the poppies.

214
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got it. I just saw

215
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:57.870
Uh huh.

216
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Field poppies. What color poppies.

217
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.680
Alicia Noedel: purplish pink fuchsia.

218
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.670
Alicia Noedel: Magenta maybe

219
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get a sense all the sudden never smell.

220
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.110
Alicia Noedel: Just smells kind of like nature like the countryside and you're like,

221
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.160
Alicia Noedel: I don't know how to describe it is fresh.

222
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Fresh

223
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Fresh countries.

224
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can connect that grounding stone to that space to them imagery. How are they connected. How can we bring what you're feeling in your hand.

225
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To that magenta field of poppies.

226
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.360
Alicia Noedel: That's where I found it.

227
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.560
Alicia Noedel: Is only rockin the whole field.

228
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

229
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion you get that you found the only rock in the field, you have it in your right hand. What's the emotion.

230
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.880
Excitement

231
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking

232
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.350
Alicia Noedel: Good. I'm lucky.

233
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You found the only one.

234
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how your body feels in this imagery of the magenta poppies and fresh countryside warm sunny day.

235
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the body.

236
00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it know excitement. How does it know that's true or does it feel excited

237
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.130
Alicia Noedel: I'm

238
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.230
Alicia Noedel: Excited I'm things

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.590
Alicia Noedel: Like jittery

240
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And are they doing that now.

241
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.830
Alicia Noedel: little tingly. Yeah, it's just kind of like

242
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.550
Alicia Noedel: Like are more aware of how my hands feel

243
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:33.780
Uh huh.

244
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how about the feet. Let's scan the body on it kind of check in, since I can't see you. How the feet doing kind of tune in there.

245
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.910
Alicia Noedel: Everything else is pretty calm.

246
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.990
Okay.

247
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this experience as true as any other imagined.

248
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. Can this be just as true as some other imagined thing.

249
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.630
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

250
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Really feel feel those

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.610
Alicia Noedel: tingly hand something negative. You mean

252
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's what I was doing. I don't hide it. That's what I was doing. Yeah. Hmm.

253
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of playing with that rational mind now now. Well, if we're going to just make up a story will, why don't we make up a positive one in our head. So yeah, that's what I'm doing. So now just go tactile really feel this grounding stone.

254
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Juliet edges with your tingly excited feeling

255
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking I'm lucky.

256
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I found the only rock in the field.

257
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel the edges.

258
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Going around the edges.

259
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing the sensation of the sun on your skin. The warm

260
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling again. Other parts of that stone feeling also

261
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Connecting to the magenta poppies.

262
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Smell.

263
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Countryside a fresh smell.

264
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And the excitement of finding the only rock and I'm lucky.

265
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The hands tinguely

266
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice anything else come up

267
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:39.090
Alicia Noedel: Park that me and my exit. I was with for a really long time came up for a second.

268
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.620
Alicia Noedel: Okay, but

269
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.770
Alicia Noedel: It went away, Radiohead. And I didn't let it invade that space.

270
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you prevent it from invading

271
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:52.590
Um,

272
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.250
Alicia Noedel: I just did, you know, shoot it away.

273
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.390
Cute.

274
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And

275
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.480
Alicia Noedel: Does that was one of my favorite parks.

276
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.610
Alicia Noedel: My whole life. So before it held really great memories.

277
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.590
Alicia Noedel: But I'm

278
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.380
Alicia Noedel: Afternoon so much

279
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, that might be something later, it could transform for now kind of wanting you to have something mobile in your hand.

280
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to ground yourself and feel calm.

281
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: accepting those tingly hands that are excited

282
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And that you can go there when you show away something that you don't want to be thinking and feeling

283
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go to this grounding stone.

284
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But just as you were talking about the park. Let's check in there a little bit. Did, did you notice anything else.

285
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like when you did the shooing away. What happened to the hands of the body.

286
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.470
Alicia Noedel: Um, it kind of like broke my focus your second

287
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.570
Alicia Noedel: I'm

288
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:18.240
Alicia Noedel: Because I i only been to one you know Park. That was my favorite part with a huge field.

289
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.910
Alicia Noedel: And

290
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:30.900
Alicia Noedel: When you think about sun hitting my face I'm unlike wind and fresh nature, smell, that's where I think of

291
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.550
Alicia Noedel: But I tried to to make it to where this place was more powerful than any of those memories.

292
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

293
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But there was a longing to go to a real one. And then there was mixed feelings that

294
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Somehow the purity of it because of that relationship.

295
00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:02.220
Alicia Noedel: I didn't want to contaminate this exercise with it with, you know, a bad memory.

296
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:12.630
Alicia Noedel: And this place being linked to a place where I spent, you know, a lot of time with somebody who wasn't very good to me.

297
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about that park. Is there a way to

298
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of have this

299
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: imagery of this person and the way you were treated have that part.

300
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To go on a container go on a distancing

301
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.710
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, because I went to that place before

302
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.210
Alicia Noedel: I knew him.

303
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.070
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I've gone since after with working

304
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:02.160
Alicia Noedel: It's my favorite part in the whole world. I love it so much.

305
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I guess I have this feeling of not wanting you to have access to something that special, you know,

306
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and

307
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's now just remembering so we can shoo away having to reflect on this is who I was. This is how I was treated. How dare you any of those

308
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, shoo.

309
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoo. And so seeing, seeing these integrated maybe playing a little bit with that imagery with this stone in your hand. Let's go back to how it feels, because we've probably been up in our thoughts now feel that stone in your hand again.

310
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And how it gives you permission to just have the clarity of pure and simple.

311
00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The excitement of being

312
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: In a field.

313
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing in puppies and fresh smell.

314
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And with a breath of comfort blow the rest of way.

315
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Are negative things they can go

316
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to reel against them, they will come up. They are part of our history, just a breath of comfort no warm sunny day, they just blow away, they're not

317
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: True for you now.

318
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They come into awareness and they're gone again and you get to enjoy.

319
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The presence of this field. This park this poppies bringing maybe an integration of those poppies into your favorite place just making it just beautiful. Just so

320
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe replacing where you sat or

321
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What used to be, what has just been blown away, bringing more poppies there that what has come is

322
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Growth.

323
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: From those difficulties.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: There's mulch.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Composting

326
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's coming out of it is just beautiful.

329
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That rock in that entire place and you found it and how lucky you are to appreciate it.

330
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.180

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:41.430
Alicia Noedel: Even before this whole pandemic one where it was always like a really triggering place for me because it's so like over the top and

435
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.290
Alicia Noedel: Crazy.

436
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. I'm just curious what what what's over the top right now. I don't want to misunderstand. Tell me what feels over the top.

437
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:52.440
Um,

438
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:57.270
Alicia Noedel: I mean, maybe it's just because there's so many people

439
00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

440
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.670
Alicia Noedel: And everybody's you know

441
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:10.050
Alicia Noedel: In my town, since it's really small. It feels like everybody in their ground was at Walmart all at once, half the time. And so

442
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:15.150
Alicia Noedel: It's constantly people will be a new each other and you know

443
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:26.610
Alicia Noedel: Right now it's, you know, the six feet thing, but people are still literally like squeezing past each other. Basically touching each other and

444
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.430
Alicia Noedel: Like, there'll be like nine people with all their baskets and and in one I'll

445
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:34.740
Alicia Noedel: So,

446
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.310
Alicia Noedel: I think it's just the amount of people

447
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like there's a couple of things that this touchstone can do is

448
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: IS NOT LET YOU GET RIGHT TO LAST also in

449
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.840
Alicia Noedel: The aware. I do. I do forget things every time.

450
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:55.950
Uh huh.

451
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe what today is is going around, nice and easy getting a piece of paper, write it all down.

452
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we do our brain. We're, we're going to be so preoccupied with this other piece we're not going to be thinking is straight that's universal that's not a flaw of you that's everyone

453
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm certainly write everything down. I don't rely on me.

454
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.010
Alicia Noedel: Usually I try and write lists, but sometimes I even forget the list.

455
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.160
Alicia Noedel: On the way to the store or

456
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:42.180
Alicia Noedel: I don't know, it's just like I get there, and my mind automatically starts going into like a panic and I'm trying to just get out of there as fast as I can. So I'll go to the bat. I'll try it and go like an order.

457
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:51.720
Alicia Noedel: from Iowa Iowa and then I'll get to the back and realized I forgot something in the friend zone and realize that there's something in the middle that I saw.

458
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: At least. Yeah.

459
00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You can touch that stone.

460
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You can feel it. And you can also know everybody's going through this. As soon as you think that they are not supposed to be going through this. You have to go back to that same mile because you forgot. Three things from that same mile just lightly giggle and say,

461
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This is worth it. I'm going to go back to that I'll I'm going to go get exactly what I need. I just remembered it. Thank you brain for helming there. I gotta remember this list, I can do that.

462
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Use as much as you can that stone to get you to don't go past this moment just experiencing it differently. I can have this neutral positive experience right now.

463
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All of its on screeching hold you can literally bring your heart rate down I feeling that stone and the cognitive reframe is

464
00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here, I might as well go back to that I'll again. Might as well.

465
00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Already there are digital the hard work and you don't know how it's going to be today. You might notice it's not as stressful. You might notice it's not quite as distressing as before, maybe that'll be the experience. I hope it is.

466
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:12.480
Yeah.

467
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, is there also a piece of the

468
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The assertiveness part. Are there people that you want to be able to say, hey, I'd be more comfortable if we had some more distance is that that nice

469
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:27.930
Alicia Noedel: Nice.

470
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You too nice. Okay.

471
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

472
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

473
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know the Walmart out here. They have an in and out area they they're trying to limit the number of people and and you may notice going back that they have new rules in place. Yeah.

474
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so it's ok so maybe this area is congested. So then if you bring your list and a pen. You can mark off the things that

475
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already. You don't have to overthink it. I've already gotten this one I market through. That's a congested area. I'm not going to push past that already is kind of people

476
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've watched it to they I have one guy at Costco. He was a young lady from from the, from the store and I was like, Oh, it is. This is like off the chain these people's behavior. It's, it's just bizarre.

477
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know it's surreal.

478
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:27.450
Crazy.

479
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Give this stone a try. I would invite now when it wouldn't work if she's not in distress right now. Take some time right that list have it out on the counter say hey guys, if you guys want to add something, you know, whatever your family kind of style is and

480
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And keep that keep that stone with you in your in your pocket.

481
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And and let it be magic give it that power.

482
00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Why wouldn't we yes of uncertainty, having all this power over us, which we gain no more certainty, we can't do it. You can't, we can't overcome that.

483
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can tap into this magic and guess what you'll have in a day, you'll have comfort. Why wouldn't I want you to have that. Of course I do.

484
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.370
Alicia Noedel: Thank you. Quinn.

491
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, middle, it could touch a little bit in some of that that concept of assertiveness and ton of go from sort of

492
00:53:51.840 --> 00:54:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagery where we're kind of doing some fancy stuff that way. And we could just old school basic communication. We can candidate into that one and see if you like that too. Okay.

493
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:03.690

499
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That that yellow brick road was how your kids from Walmart.

500
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:37.950

501
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:46.320
Alicia Noedel: I just bought the DVD probably like a month ago. And so I just rewatch the Wizard of Oz like as an adult.

502
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:53.010
Alicia Noedel: And it's so amazing. Like, it's so different as an adult, you understand it so much like in a different way.

503
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:54.690
Alicia Noedel: Such a good movie.

504
00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, as we've matured, right. The, the symbolism. Now we can see it from this sort of psychological level.

505
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.390
Alicia Noedel: Right. And it was like 90% of what they were saying. I never understood when I was a kid.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, keep it in your pocket and even just knowing that it's there in year

Gwenevere Abriel: You've got some pocket jeans, maybe having them there. I don't know if you want to be moving your hand back and forth to it from the outside. I was thinking about, I was like well under normal circumstances, I have you reached in the store.
