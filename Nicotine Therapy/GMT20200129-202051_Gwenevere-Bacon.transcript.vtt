Gwenevere Abriel: A review of what it might be like to have a refresh on your commitment to whatever your goals are here. Okay.

30
00:02:48.210 --> 00:03:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is labeled the behavior contract, but you can call it something else, why don't we look at the content of it and see if there are pieces of it that you like that. You don't like that. You want to modify and I have created this so I'm really happy with it.

31
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's going to help you have a refresh.

32
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But

33
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.680

34
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to show it to you because if you don't like it, okay. Won't do it, then it's pointless. Then, of course, you'll find a way to sort of not stay engaged. So this is what I've got.

42
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I will attend individual therapy in there about between 45 and 60 minutes, but you have to sort of create this time and it's actually more like 70 if you think about. We got to log in to virtual clinic.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No less than twice per week over the next 30 days I'll attend group, no less than once per week. That's where you do your check in for medication. Talk to your doctor.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is how the head

50
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's how it works for the most part. Yeah.

51
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So right being on time probably brings up some stuff for you. So persevere. Here I will text call or email my therapist experiencing.

54
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be communicating

55
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.270
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I wanna, I want to, I guess, before I I'm

56
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Going all the way through this

57
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.430
Nicole Bacon: This is part of

58
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundary to it's getting all the way through something before going to something else. This takes also some restraint and some right some vigilance here. So let's let's continue. You've got something important to say, Do I want to hear it.

59
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's keep going. I think we're at number six, I will identify how my substance use all mood altering substances which includes alcohol, right, and includes marijuana.

70
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A specimen there.

71
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And this isn't necessarily urine. This might also be blood, but most of the time it's your own

72
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I will present for telemedicine in a quiet private place seated and able to engage in both seated and standing activities.

73
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You've seen a little bit. At least, not a lot, a lot, but I do some things that are a bit experiential and we want to have some movement possible. Maybe there's some energy work or something like that.

74
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I will accept and initiate a call, text. This is a little different this I could cross out if you wanted me to because I don't have anybody that's doing, and I wish I did.

75
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I will accept and initiate a call, text or zoom contact with a peer support designee

76
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: To help resolve treatment goals and objectives. So I have someone in mind, but I haven't done all the training and bright heart health. Doesn't that kind of abandoned that idea. I still think it's a good one.

77
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But

78
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If

79
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.270
Nicole Bacon: I don't quite understand that it's a different. It's another person.

80
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: cross it out. So let's go down here to you. This is, this would be something that you would be stating. So the advantage. See if you can find the advantage of those above tasks.

81
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The advantage of my achieving these goals include the following. So when you take a moment and I know there was some sort of realization of what this entails the responsibility that time and energy and commitment. It's a huge

82
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece of your treatment and it's different than what you were doing before you didn't have it written out quite precisely

83
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What you think for a moment. What would be the advantage of achieving these schools and I'll put this in a quote, and then we can kind of have it to as a reminder of why you're bothering

84
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.600
Nicole Bacon: Advantage. For me, achieving these goals includes

85
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.450
The

86
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.690
Nicole Bacon: Actual actually like actually

87
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.970
Nicole Bacon: Completely

88
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:27.030
Nicole Bacon: Investing in myself and my healing and my growth and to staying sober. Okay.

89
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It would represent that you can see that

90
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

91
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:32.880
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

92
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be different than what you've been doing. It's all right.

93
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.770
Nicole Bacon: Yes, definitely. Okay.

94
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

95
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:47.490
Nicole Bacon: I said, I like this written down and you know something tangible like even want to print it out and put it up on my wall.

96
00:10:47.610 --> 00:11:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'll be sending it to you in an email right now and you can write me back and say I agree. And then, why then that's sort of an agreed on, I'll show up, ready to help and offer my wisdom and experience and skills all show up on time and rested unable to be present for you.

97
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.870
Nicole Bacon: And then ice versa.

98
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you, I learned a lot.

99
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.270
Nicole Bacon: I learned a lot. Just this one Meetup.

100
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have received and so many email it to you in just a moment. I've received this contract and agreed to discuss the experience involved in accomplishing OR NOT ACCOMPLISHING THIS health

101
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Behavior improvement with my therapist and physician by acknowledging agreement.

102
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: With this behavior contract. I accept that failure to complete the above notated behaviors will result in a recommendation for a higher level of care and

103
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: referral to an outside agency or discharge due to non compliance, so it's it's like if you just disappear for 30 days. Then there's really no need for referral. You're just sort of Mia and but if you're there and you let's say a week from now, you're like,

104
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Screw this and you start disappearing again and you've done it times

105
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I'll remind us of this

106
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll create this space and time to talk about what worked about this contract, what didn't. But 99.9% likelihood, you're going to get a referral of whatever resources are nearby and best to you.

107
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll go from there. This is

108
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: A significant departure than what we were doing before. Okay.

109
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it feel different.

110
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.790
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes.

111
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's a part of you maybe likes it. Is there another part of you that's a little bit like oh my gosh, what am I getting myself into.

112
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:47.850
Nicole Bacon: I'm

113
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.310
Nicole Bacon: Not

114
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.390
Nicole Bacon: Like more of just like

115
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:15.900
Nicole Bacon: Okay, this is it like I need, I need. But I also want to take this more seriously and feel like I can trust and be vulnerable by reaching out to you when I'm feeling triggered as my therapist.

116
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.640
Nicole Bacon: My mind before was more. Oh, she has tons of clients like

117
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.170
Nicole Bacon: Probably bugging her and you know that's not

118
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.140
Nicole Bacon: Mine.

119
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.810
Nicole Bacon: So because you told me before. Sometimes I just have to be tough.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

142
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, um, we need to review your goals and

143
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense of where you are with him. Okay. Because it's months overdue. I want you to just assess yourself and say how you're doing around this goal of I want think you called it self sufficiency was your for I see if I can find it.

144
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember, I remember

145
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I want self sufficiency. So assess yourself on how it's going well. Would you say

146
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.110
Nicole Bacon: I'm moderate

147
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.870
Nicole Bacon: Moderate because I

148
00:16:50.040 --> 00:17:09.720
Nicole Bacon: Was working at the salon built in clientele wasn't going that fast, and I wasn't motivated, either as I I had to really accept that I want to get hired before I touch people's heads, and that's not helping me so I actually

149
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:16.530
Nicole Bacon: I quit this job and but

150
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:41.040
Nicole Bacon: My friend wants to hire me on as her business partner so that all happened just a couple days ago so moderate still haven't seen the money from the new job, but I still have to pay rent to my father yet because my parents still know i'm i'm getting on my own two feet so

151
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.360
Nicole Bacon: It's all right there, but

152
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you something. Moderate sounds like it's in the middle. What would your life look like if it was poor.

153
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Poor rose Porter.

154
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, will be

155
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.690
Nicole Bacon: Homeless

156
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.260
Nicole Bacon: No house.

157
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.260
Nicole Bacon: Okay, no money at all.

158
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no place to live.

159
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:11.610
Nicole Bacon: Right.

160
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No place to live and then no money. And where are you getting money.

161
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.850
Nicole Bacon: My parents

162
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:31.260
Nicole Bacon: There, they're helping me with specific things like credit card bills. I tell they're helping me with with money and I don't have to pay rent right now. So, okay.

163
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

164
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And would you be willing to sign a release of information so that I could communicate with your pre trial police officer or is that been dropped

165
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.960
Nicole Bacon: With my appeal. Yes. Yes, that'd be great. Okay.

166
00:18:50.340 --> 00:19:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think before we end today, I'll have you go over back to virtual clinic and we'll have them have you do it there. I'll see if I can send you the form. Sometimes I have luck. Other times, but the form just doesn't work for me.

167
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

168
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.070
Very

169
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:22.620
Nicole Bacon: Be sorry because I just checked in with my appeal officer. I'm a couple of days ago and he did rip. I told him I was wanting to get back into this program. He did refer me to

170
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.330
Nicole Bacon: intensive outpatient

171
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.660
Nicole Bacon: A physical place in Albuquerque. Um, but

172
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.360
Nicole Bacon: I just feel like

173
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:44.460
Nicole Bacon: I've made so much like breakthroughs with with you as my therapist, and I do get triggered.

174
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.260
Nicole Bacon: Mean around other people and

175
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:57.810
Nicole Bacon: When it's not like that we're working on something positive, which I've been in a group like that before where it's just like

176
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.270
Nicole Bacon: Very negative

177
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.360
Nicole Bacon: So yes, just saying you know that's that's but

178
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

179
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there.

180
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: an expectation that you go to an assessment at that location.

181
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:34.350
Nicole Bacon: Yes, but he I also he's open for to me doing this program just as long as I'm no program I they couldn't get me in for like three weeks to that other place for assessment. Okay. All right.

182
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't

183
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.710
Just

184
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.450
Nicole Bacon: Me.

185
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.590
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah, I just have to communicate with him.

186
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

187
00:20:49.170 --> 00:21:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's keep going. Let's keep reviewing here. We gotta write this stuff down here. So here we go. A little. I don't think I've talked to you about this part, or I don't have a little note in here. When you think about how spirituality affects your recovery process.

188
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How much does it help when you do you ever go to sort of

189
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know something greater than yourself, even if its mother earth or or a God, as you know it. Right. Do you ever go there as a refuge and as a resource.

190
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.930
Nicole Bacon: All the time. Yes. All the time.

191
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And do you

192
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you call it, like, how do you

193
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.700
Leave

194
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Nicole Bacon: Um, oh, I, I guess it depends how I feel. Sometimes it's universe. Sometimes I pray to Jesus Christ. Sometimes I prayed a Kanye, and sometimes I prayed to my my spirit guides

195
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.980
Nicole Bacon: Mama guy. I mean, yeah, I guess.

196
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.220
Nicole Bacon: So it changes. Yes.

197
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you you go there all the time. Can you be a little bit more like

198
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.500
Nicole Bacon: I, I pray I pray, many times every day.

199
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.140
Nicole Bacon: For help

200
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.610
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

201
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like it's a significant part. Do you notice that there are times when you do get an answer, and it has helped you to remain clean

202
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:34.590
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

203
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:43.890
Nicole Bacon: Yes, like this. This job opportunity with my friend. I've been praying. That's an answer for me.

204
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.610
Nicole Bacon: I've been praying for something like that.

205
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.710
Nicole Bacon: For a couple years.

206
00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to taper off of Suboxone. How are you doing around that.

207
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.330
Nicole Bacon: I haven't stabilized on it so

208
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.100
Nicole Bacon: Deftly definitely want to take her, but that's in the future.

209
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

210
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.470
Nicole Bacon: I'm on seven

211
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on Sunday checks.

212
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, off the streets.

213
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.780
Nicole Bacon: No, no, no, no.

214
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.880
Nicole Bacon: Suboxone and send me checks is different. I don't know if that's your

215
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: After. No, it is. Sorry, I got it.

216
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.360
Nicole Bacon: All right.

217
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It just hit me in November must have written it wrong. I don't know if you were taking the Suboxone back then I remember a change

218
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:49.080
Nicole Bacon: Oh yes, I did try it and then just went back to this every text because I get real nauseous and I puco on the Suboxone

219
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:50.790
Okay.

220
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So, when was your last use of a short acting opiate

221
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.140
Nicole Bacon: A couple days ago.

222
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: A LONG HAS THE the relapse been how many days.

223
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:25.440
Nicole Bacon: The whole month. I mean, cuz I only had a couple pills left from my prescription so

224
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you made a choice not to go to services to

225
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.200
Nicole Bacon: Go to the streets.

226
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

227
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:46.950
Nicole Bacon: Yes, instead of taking responsibility. Okay.

228
00:24:47.220 --> 00:25:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright. Alright, so let's go to this one. Um, we've already got the behavior contract for it. That's going to cover individual therapy but there you really hearing that you needed more than once a week and you weren't doing it. You were not doing that you're finding

229
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me show you some

230
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you've named and it might be the wrong names for things. But I want you to see just a few reasons you've presented for why they just can't show up for for your treatment.

231
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: My phone

232
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: new job, no money.

233
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Early hours right I'm too activated.

234
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: On my self sabotaging behavior.

235
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I relapsed

236
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hard time falling

237
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.260
Right, my wife.

238
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: My grandma's socks and she is busy, but notice how they

239
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.560
Nicole Bacon: Right, but they keep coming and

240
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, but just it does you a disservice to think and you are an incredibly intelligent woman, but it does you a disservice to think that your clinician, the person that's here for you is such a pushover that she doesn't register any of it. Like it doesn't do you any good.

241
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To understand

242
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.450
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, definitely.

243
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.860
Nicole Bacon: And it sounds like ridiculous when you say and

244
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.880
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I've been in this victim story for way too long.

245
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.220
Nicole Bacon: Making excuses.

246
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: People

247
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Have job children they have so many the car, the tire bloody bloody and then now this person's now in jail. And this person about about. Let me tell you something. They have stuff happening for real. I get it.

248
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Kid breaks collarbone. I cannot be in group, I have to go take care of my son. I get that.

249
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:06.900
Nicole Bacon: Right.

250
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.230
Nicole Bacon: It's fear.

251
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.870
Nicole Bacon: It's fear. That's what it is.

252
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now let me flip. Let me flip the script a little bit. I noticed we did an activity and it was the last activity we did. We did this resource room and you went to a place that shocked me. And as a part of me that wanted to

253
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Prevent you from doing whatever it was that you were doing with it. Um, but you went there. I can't say hey go here, go there and that was your mind to go in this direction, but I remember this sense of wanting to rescue you wanting to, like, say, Wait, you sure

254
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, are you sure that's where you want to go. And so I guess what I'm trying to say to you is, it's both. It might be a little bit of you not putting your recovery first

255
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's also maybe the pace and rate that we were going still might be too intense. And so let's go at it a little differently.

256
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

257
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I want it to work. But this medicine, what happens between you and I, the trust. It's just budding it's just starting

258
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be. What makes the difference your wounds, I think, are from an interpersonal

259
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Hurt.

260
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And it will mean

261
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Not getting distracted with rules that I bring right like these are they expect this treatment, you have to show up for it. You actually have to take the dose of medicine which is us.

262
00:28:50.490 --> 00:29:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean you have to say, I, I don't want to do this. It's so scary. Then, then that's what we're working with in the moment, or I don't want to close my eyes or, you know, that's how we're going to develop the kind of rapport and trust that might make a difference for you.

263
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

264
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's asking a

265
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.930
Lot.

266
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.200
You

267
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.050
Nicole Bacon: Know, I just, I was really, really shut down.

268
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.940
Nicole Bacon: Really shut down and really guarded

269
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:37.470
Nicole Bacon: The last couple of weeks I've been actually able to cry like I hadn't been able to cry for so long. It's really been helping

270
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.340
Nicole Bacon: To be vulnerable and

271
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.270
Nicole Bacon: To give myself a chance, like

272
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So what, tell me something.

273
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh inside and see, see what

274
00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What may or may not have happened. And remember, you don't want to be protecting me. I don't need protection.

275
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You being able to say what you saw in here with me. What do you think makes it possible that you're going to be able to commit to twice a week. It means no bullshit transportation why FI I can't get up.

276
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The it's it's it's just this contract or it's somewhere else. Think about it for a second, really think about it, what did you see a glimmer of here with me or you may have recognize it in yourself that makes you think this will be different.

277
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.930
Nicole Bacon: Now have you my walls up like actually

278
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.930
Nicole Bacon: being vulnerable and

279
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.940
Nicole Bacon: I have

280
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:05.220
Nicole Bacon: These opportunities that have shown up. And so I actually feel motivation now.

281
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:12.330
Nicole Bacon: That I have these goals that are attainable that are right there. And I don't want to

282
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.160
Nicole Bacon: Miss out on these opportunities.

283
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.100
Nicole Bacon: Because I feel like in that up a really important point where like

284
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:33.120
Nicole Bacon: I'm either gonna get, you know, clean or my left just gonna stay shitty and get worse. I don't want that for myself.

285
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.580
Nicole Bacon: But, Nicole.

286
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been wanting a job for years and it just came your way do you think you're going to almost immediately be presented with a choice.

287
00:31:52.980 --> 00:32:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Of either taking what we're talking about. Seriously, that you can't keep that job notice over this other job was really important and you were putting it first number that's on the list, I can. I am working okay

288
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But you recovery your addiction got in the way. And I don't mean to say just addiction. I'm talking about

289
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The mind so that it squirrels around that, then everything just maybe flight right touching someone else's body and just like all that. That's what I'm talking about in recovery recovery of the authentic self. Like that work.

290
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not done yet. We were just starting it has to come first job at least second and now may not make sense to you. But how long do you think your family's going to say

291
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we gave you all this time.

292
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have been working your recovery there. And, oh, well, I wasn't, I just now I am

293
00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's now you will never feel like doing this, you will never want to do it. You won't grow unless there's this bit of discomfort not thought on hundred percent like I'm dissociating stuff. I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a little bit

294
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncomfortable.

295
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're never going to feel like doing it. And I think you're going to be prioritizing other things like job.

296
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And some other something you've got some other interventions. I don't know what they were some vibration think you will find some reason to not do this.

297
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe because there isn't enough motivation, because it's just you.

298
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just you.

299
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And you sick. Now you're enough. Right. You're saying I'm enough I I'm motivated. Now I want to feel better. Are you sure that's what's motivating you

300
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.060
Nicole Bacon: Because we know it's not just me.

301
00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what is it,

302
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:03.060
Nicole Bacon: I mean, it's my loved ones, my family.

303
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:10.560
Nicole Bacon: Everyone wants to see me do better. I want to do better. I want

304
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:19.770
Nicole Bacon: I don't want to see the dark world of addiction anymore. It's scary.

305
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You have almost died because you almost died. And that doesn't motivate you enough to give a shit about yourself. Do you see my cynicism here.

306
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What some people like they they they want to believe that that's true. Like, it makes sense. It's logical any kind of rational person would be like, Yeah, I'm worth it, like, totally, like, look, these people love me.

307
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes what you do or could do is

308
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: For a while, borrow this idea of, I don't want to go to jail.

309
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that for some people it's that they're like

310
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.630
Nicole Bacon: Yo, that's

311
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:12.930
Nicole Bacon: That's a big one.

312
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That could be one you could kind of leverage for a little while. If you were there and it was really awful and really scary sometimes that's the one that shocks people into oh my gosh this is legit. Like if I am going to stay alive. It can be really bad if I don't get

313
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To healing and working on myself. That can be a useful real motivator, like the staying away from that.

314
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're you're dying didn't seem to motivation.

315
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.850
Nicole Bacon: Oh, I like this associated with that I like.

316
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.520
Nicole Bacon: Put it in

317
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:57.450
Nicole Bacon: I think it compartmentalize that

318
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I love that you have a new job, Nicole. I love that you get to be with your friend, but there's a part of me that wants to say I'm waiting for the text where you say,

319
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's work. It's a job and I've wanted this and then I'm going to discharge, you

320
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Are you hearing it though that you're worth this

321
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That your life and your freedom are at stake if someone doesn't say this is it.

322
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you'll go maybe there'll be someone decent at in Albuquerque. Maybe there will be. I know me, I know my intentions. I know I've got myself in check. I don't, can't speak for other musicians.

323
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I want to work with you and I do know this this dance and you're so intelligent and you've got this game down, you've got victim, you've got

324
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right persecute a rescuer you've got those roles down pat, and you can flip around and switch and whenever you want to. But it is doing you a disservice.

325
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You are much more than those roles, your

326
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know. We've been robbed of finding out and you can do that. You can find out who you are nice and slow your own preferences. You don't want to touch it. Okay, don't have to

327
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know what it's going to be in the future, but I'm interested in. Now I want to know what you're like what you want. Now what's working for you. Now what feel safe now. And I want you to keep coming in here.

328
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.010
Nicole Bacon: But

329
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not. And I have to accept that.

330
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:56.880
Nicole Bacon: What's hard for me.

331
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm a helper.

332
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about

333
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.310
Nicole Bacon: I just feel like like before.

334
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:18.150
Nicole Bacon: I really in my head. I wanted to take it serious

335
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.010
Nicole Bacon: But

336
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:33.210
Nicole Bacon: It just wasn't connecting for some reason the the repercussions with my behavior and this or not but

337
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.040
Nicole Bacon: A couple things happen in the last 30 days that

338
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.990
Nicole Bacon: Started to get me to wake up again. And like I said, I haven't

339
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.370
Nicole Bacon: I haven't been able to cry and be vulnerable and

340
00:38:51.720 --> 00:39:03.210
Nicole Bacon: Like, I know, I know. My, my, the things that the two big things that I have a hard time letting go. But preventing me from all the way and

341
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.650
Nicole Bacon: Like

342
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.230
Nicole Bacon: I'm ready to work.

343
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we'll go slow go slower.

344
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.290
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

345
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got a, you've got to be in your truth, too, if I'm inviting something and it's too much then put a hold on it.

346
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:36.300
Nicole Bacon: Well honestly when I think before I would, it felt all too much because I wasn't being real. I wasn't being open and vulnerable.

347
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's that. But there's also these things that we're going to do these interventions right that touch.

348
00:39:44.820 --> 00:40:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: On pulling up some old memory and I want to first get you grounded. I want resources in place. It's not me unearthing and having you tell all of these details. I want you to

349
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Save first and then we can go into it and you dove in a little fast and I wasn't saying to go there, but she went in and I got scared.

350
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you were gone. Do you know that you're gone.

351
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:18.450
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

352
00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Be a coincidence but

353
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You stopped services. And I wonder, gee i wonder if we just, it was just too fast, but do you play a part in that too.

354
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:38.610
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I, I do that, I think I'm ready for something or right I

355
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:47.340
Nicole Bacon: I can't. It's a call it like my like little mania spurts I'm like yes do it all. All of it.

356
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.200
Nicole Bacon: He can people and then I get overwhelmed and shut down.

357
00:40:54.690 --> 00:41:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No, this is where you get to learn your own boundaries you like the idea of being this open spirit meet you like this idea that's different than knowing your own limitations in real time and you can plan out here, you can plan out and you can find out and go

358
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you, right, you can find out where that is in here.

359
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, no, maybe it's not anger. I think I'm scared. Hey, this is my limit. I just found one. Okay.

360
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But having no boundaries in a world that takes advantage of people is no way to live.

361
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no way to live. Okay.

362
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not going to have moderation, they're going to suck the life out of you people are takers.

363
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to own your own. I can only give this I'm I've got this to give and I can give it wholeheartedly, but I need to keep some of this.

364
00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, and that's okay too. That's really important. I want to see. I want to witness you doing that protecting. Oh, I have this big idea. I don't have that much to give

365
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet, be not showing up for care.

366
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we get to do all kinds of stuff.

367
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what you benefited from today.

368
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you've had a lot of people saying these are your limits.

369
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what just happened. I said, hopefully in a caring way.

370
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: These are limits stay in here, it's a safe place. It's predictable. This is what it's going to look like. But you're affecting another human being.

371
00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And we said it. I said it, and maybe that's what you're registering like oh my gosh I'm affecting another human being and your action affects you to it could mean the inconvenience of an I. O. P. It could be maybe higher level of care could be jail. I don't know what else is out there.

372
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe it's registering

373
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:17.790
Nicole Bacon: I

374
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.160
Nicole Bacon: Honestly,

375
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:37.500
Nicole Bacon: I parents kind of do it. Not really. There's only one person that really tells me how it is. And I like that the rest, kind of like cuddle me or just tell me what I want to hear.

376
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, I don't do that. I've noticed that over the years.

377
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Somehow I can be unconditionally loving, I can do that. It's true that won't change that will be here.

378
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.130
Nicole Bacon: You can go off and you'll

379
00:43:53.130 --> 00:44:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Go do whatever the care doesn't change, but my commitment to being predictable to being structured my my value in that for people when their lives are unmanageable. I won't stop doing it. They exist at the same time.

380
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's what re parenting is. That's what's possible. That's where healing a ruptured attachment. It can happen. They exist at the same time.

381
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to feed you a

382
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot. Okay, I'm not going to do that.

383
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think you're going to run in right away to a conflict, having energy go to this job or having it show up for bright heart health. Where do you think it's going to show up right away.

384
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.410
Nicole Bacon: The job.

385
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, and how quickly like as soon as I start to say, when can you commit to two days a week.

386
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.540
Nicole Bacon: Um,

387
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.060
Nicole Bacon: I'm not sure, but

388
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:11.310
Nicole Bacon: The job right now is all through the phone right now we're in different physical places.

389
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it all in New Mexico time

390
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.200
Nicole Bacon: No Hawaii.

391
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So knowing that time zone white might be good to know what it is.

392
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.450
Nicole Bacon: Three hours.

393
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.010
Nicole Bacon: Three hours ahead of here.

394
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:33.510
Okay.

395
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Something done here at three o'clock in the afternoon would be six there. So what you're saying.

396
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.910
Maybe later three hours later.

397
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.190
Nicole Bacon: Three hours earlier. Sorry.

398
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

399
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now be thinking about

400
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This can you commit to twice a week at least for the next 30 days.

401
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:14.010
Nicole Bacon: Yes, it would. Do I, it would help if it was the same time.

402
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.220
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I don't know. Yeah.

403
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a real possibility.

404
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A week or two from now.

405
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:22.950
Nicole Bacon: But

406
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: People are here showing up for services and I booked them.

407
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.100
Nicole Bacon: Right, right.

408
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're accommodating the early part and then I'll start to protect certain times and hold those spaces for you so that you have some predictability. Okay. I like that. I like the consistent

409
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of my clients. There's a real set predictable. Time to it. Okay.

410
00:46:52.500 --> 00:47:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, why don't we do this, let's not pick a group until we've picked the other days that we want to do. And then we'll put you in a group, because this way. We're not i'm not unlimited when we do it the other way around. So

411
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.050
Okay.

412
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think there's any chance you're going to be showing up to 7am group. So why don't we pick one.

413
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:15.960
Nicole Bacon: No.

414
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Never know maybe something changed so

418
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:41.010

Okay.

421
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not going to stay that way. But that's what it's going to be for next week. All right, let's move over to another day.

Nicole Bacon: It was Monday.

429
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you okay, and the reason why I was thinking it was on Thursday is because I remember you were in there with Nicole.

430

Gwenevere Abriel: And we had this negotiation about nicknames.
