41
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:24.270
Ryan DeVito: Ended up getting a scholarship to go to Sac State where I accepted it and ran track and cross country or I just ran track and then do cross country they I can run too long. I was more of a mid distance runner.

42
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:36.990
Ryan DeVito: So, you know, I didn't. I kept it under about two laps to last maybe three, maybe four laps. If I had to do the 1500 in college, they did the 15 other than in high school year on the 16 full mile

43
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:54.300
Ryan DeVito: So, you know, that was probably my best. You know what I did was just very athletic, you know, in sports and stuff. My dad side of the family is very athletic my grandpa, my grandpa was a football coach over at DDC in and St. Mary's and had the football program.

44
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.890
Ryan DeVito: He was a professor at San Francisco State University, Todd.

45
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:12.330
Ryan DeVito: Their stuff and then. So my dad would play football and so I pretty much just played, you know, sports and everything football. The football role isn't the biggest guy. I was just the quickest guy.

46
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.350
Ryan DeVito: Well yeah, I mean granted my mom's side of the family.

47
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.710
Ryan DeVito: You know my grandpa was in the Navy. My mom. My mom just kind of worked. She's a

48
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.700
Ryan DeVito: Dental Hygiene Jed dental hygienist for children or teens, you're either patriotic

49
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.880
Ryan DeVito: And so she you know she mostly would work only my dad was more the bread when I worked for Chevron still works for Chevron and you know he worked. Most of the time he was the bread.

50
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:50.310
Ryan DeVito: Bread broker. So my mom was able to work only three days a week, really. So you know I gotta you know genius. Take us off, take us to war or take a school

51
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.800
Ryan DeVito: And know we grew up in a neighborhood with a bunch of kids so parents are like carpool. You know, when we Johnson's would take us are

52
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:09.150
Ryan DeVito: Going to see those will take us through the door to us and take us. And then, you know, my mom is so it was kind of like, you know, bunch of not just pretty much a typical Child Life grow up life. I guess I can say

53
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:19.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that was I was going to go into your experience in school if he graduated. Did you have a hard time. Did you have a learning disability that comes up.

54
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.280
Ryan DeVito: Yeah. So through throughout

55
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.360
Ryan DeVito: High school I was in, you know, special class where they are split, you know,

56
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.210
Ryan DeVito: Where they would have, like, it was like a kind of like when other kids had electives. When do you like word shop or

57
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.430
Ryan DeVito: You know dance or something. I would go to this class and you know we focus on doing her homework is like mostly just a homework, you have to do more homework because I know that you know you need

58
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.700
Ryan DeVito: More time or more help one on one. It was a small smaller class, you know, usually the class was, you know,

59
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.360
Ryan DeVito: Maybe five to seven people in a class, rather than, you know, regular classroom of 30 something 35

60
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:14.490
Ryan DeVito: And then I did English I did an English like a resource English all all through my life I had to like in middle school, I had to go to a speech therapy and do like this. My grandma got me. I remember a hook on hooks on phonics

61
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.130
Ryan DeVito: Yes I did, and helped me be decks of the

62
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.260
Ryan DeVito: So yeah, I was, you know, I've been resourcing school was always kind of harder for me, rather than my little brother, he kind of was more of a

63
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:41.760
Ryan DeVito: You know, he just got stuff, stuff came, namely easier and stuff. And then I graduated from high school graduated from college came along and then that's when

64
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:51.510
Ryan DeVito: Actually, my first year in college is when I was having a little harder time with stuff because you know they in college, you know, you don't have that resource class, we get to do is

65
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:59.820
Ryan DeVito: Get the like have extra little perks like a time and a half. So, you know, for regular classes, an hour and 15 minutes

66
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:17.430
Ryan DeVito: You have, you know, that extra time. So, you have another whole hour and 15 minutes in a room, you go to a private like a private room, other than having the lecture hall. I had note takers in some of my class I was really bad with the English. English is probably one of my week or subjects.

67
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.770
Ryan DeVito: So yeah, I always had that, you know, and then. So back in freshman year I was telling my mom, I had a hard time with

68
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.620
Ryan DeVito: You know school and all that, you know, all this stuff dealing with it. And so she

69
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:42.150
Ryan DeVito: Said, these are like I tried one of my buddies at an Adderall. And I tried it and I ended up getting an A on my test I told my mom about it, my moms like oh yeah you were frustrated that long time ago.

70
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:56.190
Ryan DeVito: Took you off, we, you know, we thought you needed or anything. So I ended up going to get the test and doing all the psychological tests at the state of union or this university state of Sacramento. It's like an eight hour test to break up in like three

71
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:10.050
Ryan DeVito: Little periods two to two and a mess when I was Adderall. So from oh nine was when I was Dr Adderall and

72
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.490
Ryan DeVito: Pretty much from focusing and managing my time and staying focus in class, rather than being distracted.

73
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:36.090
Ryan DeVito: Yes person colleges, you know, lecture halls, or sometimes three to 400 people and it's a little more definitely a lot more stuff going on and stuff so I thought it was good. You know, that's what helped me get through college and graduate, they're

74
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.940
Ryan DeVito: Very much. Yeah.

75
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.950

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And are you interested in any kind of individual therapy.

141
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:55.320
Ryan DeVito: Not really. I mean, I'm pretty happy. I mean, I'm not. I don't look like the very sad. I kind of always, kind of, you know, look happy and always be happy because

142
00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:08.730
Ryan DeVito: You have a happy mindset and happy you know everything. If you look at if you look sad. You know, yet to process we're kind of trickles down and you know I'm just, I've never had that problem. Always try to turn something that's bad and good

143
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so for your treatment planning it, it sounds to me like you'll be going to a group with

144
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was at the seven o'clock group that you went to

145
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:30.600
Ryan DeVito: Yeah, I go to the seven o'clock group because I usually will go to the gym after work after for, you know, and then drive home. So seven o'clock works for me.

146
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:38.820
Ryan DeVito: She tried to get me into the earlier one. She said that ones will be a little better with me because with the group setting, but I would just messed up with my gym routine.

147
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.160

Ryan DeVito: No strong workout every day. I feel like I'm the strongest I've been you know i before I was running track and doing the soccer and stuff. So it was more running not building muscle, I guess. Now I'm more not running and hitting the weights and getting more bigger upper body lower body.

167
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.000

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if it turns out that there's anything that you think that you want to work on on an individual basis, just let me know when you see me in group and we can schedule a couple meetings outside of group and and I can help you process through that kind of stuff. OK.
