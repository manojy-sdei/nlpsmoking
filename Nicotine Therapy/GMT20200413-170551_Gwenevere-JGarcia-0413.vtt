00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.410
Jessica Garcia: More

13
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.410
Jessica Garcia: Areas.

14
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So what, where does this leave you with the, the new work are you on hold.

15
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.930
Jessica Garcia: I just received a call from the scheduling.

16
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.660
Jessica Garcia: Person and I'm okay because last week I called

17
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.180
Jessica Garcia: And the lady was pretty rude and she's like, we don't have anything available, but it wasn't the same lady.

18
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:59.100
Jessica Garcia: They texted me on Monday, and I told them, I'm only available on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays and then so I call the next day. And they're like, we don't have anything available for you.

19
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.990
Jessica Garcia: You're gonna have to wait until next week, it will have their scheduling person call you in and hosting me and it's like

20
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.110
Jessica Garcia: I was like,

21
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:29.790
Jessica Garcia: I she asked me if I was available to work today and I told her, I'm sorry. I told her I put it in my, in my application. Like I said it a few times that I was only able to work Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays and she was like, I had no idea. I'm so sorry. I'll write that down.

22
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.310
Jessica Garcia: So already,

23
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

24
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.320
Jessica Garcia: Like that.

25
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.880
Just shows

26
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So now this is an interesting thing, Jessica.

27
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: On one hand, you're turning in you're paying attention. This is a sign right your head is up, you're paying attention, um,

28
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes there's a phenomenon of allocating

29
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.560
Of managing

30
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oftentimes,

31
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: People that are in a position of authority.

32
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean that they got that position because they're more qualified than us.

33
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: They got your level in competence so weird thing get promoted to a level of in competence. So what we're left to do is if you're okay with it. It might mean that we manage up, which means so

34
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you know it'd be something like, I don't want to let anyone down or me look

35
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I was unavailable. I want to make sure everybody's on the same page. Do you guys are you could be like you guys already have people that have set schedules. How does this information gets disseminated across the organization.

36
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: See that kind of questioning

37
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What it presupposes is that it does and what it puts in the listeners ear is. Oh yeah, we don't have anything like that.

38
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they're left with answering you. Oh, we don't do anything like that. What are you talking about, and then you can continue and say, well,

39
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there three or four people that maybe a couple of hiring managers or scheduling manager that I could send a quick email to that way I don't have to burden you with it. I can take sense it's it's so precise and

40
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do it if you wanted me to are there people that you want me to send it to you could already be sort of that person who's already organizing it.

41
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is there a central place on a bulletin board. Like, where do you guys already have a system of what people's limitations are, what their, their work availability is and what you would find out right away from that other person was she didn't know, boo.

42
00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You out right away. So although you might be tempted to say, well, this is a wishy washy organization. Is that what you're thinking.

43
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.930
Jessica Garcia: Yeah yeah just just every time I get a job with

44
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.990
Jessica Garcia: You even if it's just one person and I have experiences like that. It turns out

45
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.630
Jessica Garcia: Being just like that.

46
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.130
Jessica Garcia: So,

47
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Staying awake, you're paying attention to it. But if you keep asking follow up questions maybe more evidence to support what your gut instinct is this might be another waste of my time or

48
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Be that you just got someone inexperienced on the phone because sometimes we do the first person you talk to doesn't know as much as the third person third person that's the one that I always

49
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Third person.

50
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's all these people up front, but you're you're tuning in, which I'm glad because I don't want you to have to go through what you went to

51
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you worked for nothing.

52
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.110
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

53
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you, then what do you feel like the next, what's your gut tell you oh

54
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.430
Jessica Garcia: I'm just gonna work.

55
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.920
Jessica Garcia: Okay, I'm just gonna work. I'm kind of

56
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.050
Jessica Garcia: More

57
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.920
Jessica Garcia: I'm more afraid now because

58
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.250
Jessica Garcia: My auntie does let me grab my charger.

59
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.040
Jessica Garcia: Sorry night and she does.

60
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.510
Jessica Garcia: She's delivering flowers and, for she went into this

61
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.480
This

62
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.880
Jessica Garcia: Retired community living place.

63
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.380
Jessica Garcia: And

64
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.600
Jessica Garcia: And I guess they had a sign up saying that

65
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:59.190
Jessica Garcia: That there was a staff and and patients, they're affected with the coven 19 so

66
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.370
Jessica Garcia: Your own risk.

67
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

68
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.720
Jessica Garcia: Which is kind of

69
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.430
Jessica Garcia: Its kind of

70
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.490
Jessica Garcia: Concerning

71
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.300
Jessica Garcia: Couch

72
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.240
Jessica Garcia: I didn't know my phone was dying.

73
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.620
Jessica Garcia: Okay.

74
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.860
Jessica Garcia: Hit or miss with these things.

75
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

76
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know what we're talking about.

77
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.890
Jessica Garcia: About that in the the assisted living communities that they

78
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.880
Jessica Garcia: They had a sign that said that there was like a few patients infected with the covert 19

79
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that, how does that impact you.

80
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:59.670
Jessica Garcia: Excuse me. Well, I don't know if I may, might have like patient in assisted living homes or even patients that are in an assisted living homes.

81
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.700
Jessica Garcia: That are infected with the coven 19

82
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are you thinking

83
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.720
I'm

84
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.300
Jessica Garcia: Going to be extra careful

85
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So what would that look like what does care what's precautions you can take

86
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.420
Jessica Garcia: A face mask a hazmat suit.

87
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

88
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.510
Jessica Garcia: And then just like change out of my scrubs whenever I go home.

89
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

90
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

91
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To the point that you're starting to wonder whether to go to work or it's not getting in the way, you can still see yourself going

92
00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just I'll wear a mask all I'll tell them, hey, this is for your protection in mind and setting up some sort of protocol that those shoes right they don't come into the house. That's something that I've been kind of echoing

93
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That maybe their shoes that you wear to work and then their shoes that you walk around the house with those those shoes that drift out in into the community, maybe they don't make their way into the house.

94
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Then little kid feet, hands and mouths touch that. So that might be a little precaution might help you feel better.

95
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.440
Jessica Garcia: Definitely

96
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

97
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a schedule. Do you have some days that they're able to give you know

98
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.570
Jessica Garcia: She says she's probably right back.

99
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Excellent. Alright, so hopefully that'll get going for you.

100
00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:00.000
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I'm just excited to start earning my own income, honestly.

101
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.330
Jessica Garcia: Start pulling my own way around here.

102
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Here excited. I want to put that in here because this is a

103
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Time to myself I get healthier China. We already got the job. I think so. I probably close that one.

104
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay Close that one already. Yeah, okay. That one's already closed. Okay, what about you just started to talk about some issues, kind of going on with with your boyfriend.

105
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had brought up this topic of, you know, the libido may be impacted by the buprenorphine.

106
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you, how did you feel after that conversation last week.

107
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.760
Jessica Garcia: I felt more informed.

108
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:57.780
Jessica Garcia: Pretty much it I didn't like we've we haven't really been away didn't get along very much this week.

109
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it because you guys weren't together or there was arguing

110
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.690
Jessica Garcia: Um,

111
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.610
Jessica Garcia: It was just both

112
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.620
Jessica Garcia: Are not not because we weren't together.

113
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:21.900
Jessica Garcia: I don't know why, but we argued, and we just can't seem to get along.

114
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.940
Jessica Garcia: Like I'll try to talk to him and

115
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.380
Jessica Garcia: And he like snaps at me like he answers me really rude. And so I

116
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:42.120
Jessica Garcia: I get upset and turned off, and I'm just rude to him for the rest of the day.

117
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:51.390
Jessica Garcia: Like I'm upset I'm just not. I'm not, like, oh, I'm gonna be rude to him since he's rude to me like no like I'm mad. Like, why

118
00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:05.520
Jessica Garcia: You know, and I told him yesterday. I told him, you know, you don't have to ask them like that like I asked him if you wanted to go to my grandma's or do something like it's Easter, like, at least for the baby and

119
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.750
Jessica Garcia: He likes. Not that mean

120
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.630
Jessica Garcia: And he and he was like, I run a global there.

121
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:26.460
Jessica Garcia: Are all the leaders of be like that. And I'm like, Why do you have to answer me like that. Like, for one. Look at me when I'm talking like when you're talking to me, give me the

122
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:38.940
Jessica Garcia: DE DE like enough respect to look me in the eyes, because that's what, that's one thing about him that I just he won't look at me when he's talking to me and I feel so disrespected

123
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:52.530
Jessica Garcia: I told me, look at me and tell me, Oh no, it's okay. You go ahead or or whatever, if you had plans for us and say something like, how, how am I supposed to know, you know,

124
00:13:54.420 --> 00:14:04.440
Jessica Garcia: And so I took. I took the baby out. I was like, You know what, I'm taking the baby out. I'm going to go put some hours in with my parents, and you could stay here by yourself to see

125
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that visit, like with the baby and with your grandparents.

Jessica Garcia: She loved that idea.

131
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.660
Jessica Garcia: And for we're probably going to do that today.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.740
Jessica Garcia: My own job and start earning my own money, because that's how she gets me

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I talked last time that maybe today, we might do a little desensitized thing. Or we might do some positive installing you may not know what those words are, but we had talked about maybe doing some some bilateral work.

148
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Could we just get in a little bit to some targets to maybe have some idea of what we might be focused on. Can I kind of go there for a minute or 10

149
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:30.510
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

150
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking, I'm right now I'm looking at my

151
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Thermometer my subjective unit of distress, and I've got a couple little stories in there. I have one. Um,

152
00:16:51.390 --> 00:17:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A distress level of 99 I don't know who we're talking about here, but it says, I feel sick to my stomach when she even talks to him, so I don't know who that is. I don't know who she is. I don't know. He is that may come to you later.

153
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I wonder if that's your mom talking to her boyfriend.

154
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:09.810
Yeah.

155
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Okay, some input mom it

156
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just it just hit me. I was like, I bet that's mom talking to my friend. Okay. So mom even talks to

157
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To her

158
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

159
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's that one that was high 99 is really high.

160
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm right and then 85

161
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Was you described as debilitating fear somebody doing what happened to me happened to my son. That's your fear. That's the debilitating fear.

162
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I might have put this at 85 but really belong somewhere else. We can always change it. I'm just going to bring up some stories we went in a little more depth to this one because I can see

163
00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got some cognition is in here noted somebody doing what happened to me happened. My son don't want that I'm

164
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I might have been working or son in daycare and then you were cheerful the soma, the body responded with it in the throat and chest, the negative thought was, I feel like I'm I'm unapologetic about it. I'm doing the best I can.

165
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Motherhood motherhood is about sacrifices, the negative cognition, I feel useless and worthless. I'm not contributing or doing anything.

166
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And the positive cognition. So I wouldn't mind finding out more about this when we could take something else. Or we could stay here with this one. The positive cognition at the time that would have been nice that you are thinking is, I'm doing the right thing.

167
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So this stability. This thing somebody's doing what happened to me to my son.

168
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I I keep wondering, Jessica, if, if, if there's a history with you have more than just physical abuse that maybe you haven't shared yet. Is that a possibility.

169
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.090
Jessica Garcia: Like, what do you mean

170
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I wonder, is there any recollection of someone touching you sort of sexually that you don't quite remember there's sort of this vague history, you don't have any history of it.

171
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.990
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, there's been a few people.

172
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.740
Jessica Garcia: It's been a few times.

173
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you a child.

174
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.560
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I was a little girl.

175
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so that's how I kept wondering and check because I keep hearing things in your dream life. I keep hearing little pieces of it. And I didn't remember hearing that in your bio psychosocial

176
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe it's just my error not going back and seeing it, seeing where I wrote it. Or maybe you didn't share it. Do you know if you shared it back then.

177
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.340
Jessica Garcia: Remember,

178
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so let's just stay with where we're at now. So what's that like to say that out loud. There was a few times that it happened as a child.

179
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this feel like free right now.

180
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, well, you're

181
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.640
Jessica Garcia: Just old just

182
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.190
Jessica Garcia: Like

183
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:37.710
Jessica Garcia: I was so bad for so many I was. It was bad, and how can I explain it. It was hard for me for so many years.

184
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.110
Jessica Garcia: So many years I used to cut. I used to do anything I could

185
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:55.560
Jessica Garcia: And then these past few years in my adult life, I've kind of

186
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.190
Jessica Garcia: Just processed it

187
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.830
Jessica Garcia: I guess I don't know. And now it's just like

188
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.410
Jessica Garcia: Like, just like it.

189
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.170
Jessica Garcia: I don't know how to explain it.

190
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.540
Jessica Garcia: Like I'm angry about it.

191
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.240
Jessica Garcia: And I'm angry about it because they took a lot like

192
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.190
Jessica Garcia: From me

193
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.420
Jessica Garcia: They changed my view of life completely and

194
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.630
Jessica Garcia: But at the same time. Now I'm more aware

195
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.540
Jessica Garcia: And I know that

196
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.790
Jessica Garcia: Child's can do it kids can do it to other kids.

197
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:03.720
Jessica Garcia: And or females could do it to females, males, especially males to males, and that's what worries me.

198
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.290
Jessica Garcia: And so

199
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:25.830
Jessica Garcia: Growing up, like I've, I've always been like even afraid to go near kids that aren't mine like you know mine or or my my close family or anything, because I don't want

200
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.230
Jessica Garcia: Anything to be perceived as like inappropriate.

201
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.410
Jessica Garcia: So that's how I am.

202
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.960
Jessica Garcia: That's how I've always been

203
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:41.970
Jessica Garcia: And then

204
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.260
Jessica Garcia: I just watched my son a lot more around his cousin.

205
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.880
Jessica Garcia: Around everybody

206
00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's keeping you vigilant. It's keeping you aware you're not sort of assuming everything's fine. You'll you might want checked in on a room after five or 10 minutes. You might just pop in and look

207
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.620
Jessica Garcia: A more he won't be in a room alone with anybody.

208
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there wouldn't you

209
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I see it.

210
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.460
Jessica Garcia: I remember those times. No.

211
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting. I didn't, for some reason, maybe it's because it wasn't shared with me but i i'm glad I asked the question today because it was confusing. I kept thinking, something's missing.

212
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I kept feeling like something was missing. And this is making more sense now.

213
00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this topic itself. It happened a few times in childhood, um, does it feel like the emotions attached to it are happening right now. Does it feel like you're reliving it right now.

214
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when you say process what it makes me wonder is, if it is set in history. If those events are in the past, you can really see time. You can see the distance between

215
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's I don't feel what I felt. Back then, there's a there's a time distance and it's actually got the right timestamp and it's stuck, where it belongs, which is in the past.

216
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it feel like that.

217
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What

218
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: He does. Okay.

219
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.340
Jessica Garcia: And I think no more. It's, it's more like the aftermath

220
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:51.990
Jessica Garcia: Like

221
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.930
Jessica Garcia: I guess a ruin my life it dictated

222
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.610
Jessica Garcia: All the decisions that I made as a teenager.

223
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.240
Jessica Garcia: Without me even knowing it.

224
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.100
Jessica Garcia: I didn't tell anybody until I was like 19 years old.

225
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And who is the first person who told

226
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.510
Jessica Garcia: My best friend you wish to thank my very, very best friend.

227
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:36.570
Jessica Garcia: And

228
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.110
Jessica Garcia: She used to stay with us often on because she had problems with him on

229
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.160
Jessica Garcia: She knew, but because she was like

230
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.820
Jessica Garcia: There for a lot of my episodes.

231
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:59.370
Jessica Garcia: And so, um, she knew, and then the first person I told was my mom.

232
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say episodes, was that she was there when the

233
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: molester molesting was occurring or when you are cutting

234
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.670
Jessica Garcia: When I was. Yeah, when I would like

235
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.550
Jessica Garcia: freak out.

236
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.230
Jessica Garcia: And there wasn't just that more so like I did. I felt like

237
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.380
Jessica Garcia: I didn't even have time

238
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:36.480
Jessica Garcia: To be upset about that because so much more was going on those so much more abuse going on.

239
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.270
Jessica Garcia: Physical

240
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.440
Jessica Garcia: And emotional abuse.

241
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: My home.

242
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.480
Jessica Garcia: My older brother.

243
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that one. Do you feel that one just now. Are you feeling that one. Okay. That one's still sits here very real free as if

244
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the distress of it is still very present

245
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And backing up a little bit to the other topic.

246
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When you told your mom. I'd like to get a sense of her reaction, though, when you did tell her that it happened. What did you say to her, and how did she respond

247
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.010
Jessica Garcia: I just told her to

248
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.000
Jessica Garcia: Do you remember that time that

249
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:45.180
Jessica Garcia: Because there's seven aunts and uncles, they all got together and they found out that

250
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.350
Jessica Garcia: Something was happening within the family and

251
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.430
Jessica Garcia: They asked me if it was true and I denied it.

252
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.340
Jessica Garcia: And so I told her.

253
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.440
Jessica Garcia: That it was actually to

254
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See how old were you when you initially denied it.

255
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.240
Jessica Garcia: I was probably like

256
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.180
Jessica Garcia: 1112 years old.

257
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you say, You know what, I lied when we when they all sort of brought it up. What was your mom's response to I lie back then. But the truth is, it did happen.

258
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.300
Jessica Garcia: She didn't say anything.

259
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.000
Jessica Garcia: Didn't say anything. I think she didn't know what to say.

260
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Still a response.

261
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:50.820
Jessica Garcia: And

262
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So she doesn't say anything. And now you're if you're in the same room together. How does the, what happens then.

263
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That she cried, and she

264
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: protects you. Did she get angry that she just pretend like it never happened. I mean, something happened.

265
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.260
Jessica Garcia: I don't know. I don't know, to me, I perceive this like

266
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.310
Jessica Garcia: Just

267
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.450
Jessica Garcia: She didn't say anything.

268
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To this day, nothing's been addressed.

269
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.500
Jessica Garcia: And it has been

270
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:56.550
Jessica Garcia: It has been because it came back up and we in her spoke about it and she said that she to suffered some of you.

271
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.610
Jessica Garcia: From a neighbor.

272
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Sexual abuse or neighbor.

273
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:05.640
Yeah.

274
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How old was she

275
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.580
Jessica Garcia: She said she was very little. I don't I don't I don't remember what age, for she says she was a little girl.

276
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.440
Jessica Garcia: And that

277
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.930
Jessica Garcia: That's what she said. She said that

278
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.740
Jessica Garcia: I don't remember her saying no.

279
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it helpful to hear

280
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That she had had the experience and so did it make more sense her reaction.

281
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:41.520
Yeah.

282
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And are you able to tell me

283
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it happened a few times.

284
00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get a sense of, was it one person several times. How old were you

285
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.880
Jessica Garcia: What the first person I was

286
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.990
Jessica Garcia: A tween eight and nine. It was like eight

287
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.750
Jessica Garcia: Years old.

288
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That was

289
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.570
Jessica Garcia: Family member

290
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.050
Jessica Garcia: And then the second person.

291
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:05.550
Jessica Garcia: Actually with the with the with the second person, it was when I was were younger.

292
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you get a sense

293
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.880
Jessica Garcia: When he

294
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Was younger than age eight or nine. There's something younger

295
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:22.290
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I was way I was still a little both still little probably like five or six years old.

296
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.870
Jessica Garcia: And she was

297
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:27.540
Jessica Garcia: She's

298
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.210
Jessica Garcia: Two years older than me.

299
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that ever report. Well, no, it wasn't. Did you didn't that didn't come out.

300
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Normally I'd wanted

301
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.720
Jessica Garcia: It's still it's still hasn't even spoken about, like,

302
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.560
Jessica Garcia: I remember her being caught because

303
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.170
Jessica Garcia: We were

304
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.540
Jessica Garcia: We were laying down and they had us lay down together.

305
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:11.640
Jessica Garcia: Or know something like that happen or she wanted to lay with me or something and then she started

306
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.150
Jessica Garcia: molesting me and my auntie seen the

307
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.110
Jessica Garcia: The cover moving and

308
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.270
Jessica Garcia: You pull it up.

309
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You're onto side.

310
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.000
Jessica Garcia: Man.

311
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, appropriately.

312
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And like an alarm.

313
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:52.020
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, she got upset, she could, she got upset and she was like, what's wrong with you and she told because I was just laying there like pretending like I was asleep, like, oh, like, you know,

314
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.170
Jessica Garcia: Just how I reacted and so when she pulled the covers up like I was like frozen like

315
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.450
Jessica Garcia: She was like yelling at her like

316
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:15.420
Jessica Garcia: She got in trouble.

317
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you now know if this person, this female. Do you know her history of she also was the inappropriately touched, and so she was just mimicking what was happening to her. Is that a possibility.

318
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:31.740
Yeah.

319
00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, the stuff gets passed down over and over, doesn't it, yes.

320
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.060
Jessica Garcia: I just don't. I don't understand, though, because I don't

321
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.980
Jessica Garcia: I didn't react like that.

322
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.520
Jessica Garcia: I'd be like, I don't

323
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:56.250
Jessica Garcia: That's why when they say that with that kids do it or adults do it because there happened to them like I would never

324
00:34:59.100 --> 00:34:59.310
Jessica Garcia: Well,

325
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

326
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and

327
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got that part. Um, and de de de

328
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're incidents, they weren't ongoing with a particular person. Is that right or was there one that it was ongoing.

329
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.660
Jessica Garcia: Your one those ongoing okay

330
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you still have a relationship with that person.

331
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.220
Jessica Garcia: No.

332
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still feeling like all of this is in the past, still failing in the past, or is it feeling like it's being relived

333
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.160
Jessica Garcia: That wondered, the when I went into detail that knows

334
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your tiny

335
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.540
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, those kind of hard.

336
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So him. Let's come up to the surface a little bit on this. And I remember I said I wanted to kind of understand debilitating fear and notice in your wording debilitating fear can debilitating fear fight can debilitating fear run

337
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Does debilitating fear immobilize freeze. Yes.

338
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Notice in your own words, the word you're using around this. So,

339
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just sort of psychobabble this for a second.

340
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's oftentimes that it's those incidents where we didn't fight back where we didn't

341
00:36:47.490 --> 00:37:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish the self protective motion, whether it's scratching punch shame running when we don't get to do those. But instead, our trauma happens in him mobilized state. Notice he said, I felt frozen.

342
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what the other

343
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Sympathetic responses. Well, this was actually his parasympathetic but it's you went down below zero. It's actually fight fleet and freeze. And what did you you froze.

344
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:19.860
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

345
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So when our trauma when our solution is only the immobilization, it's not uncommon for people to have just this continued intrusion of the impact of that trauma. When we got to actually fight our way out.

346
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And run away. Okay. Any it sticks around with us. So don't be surprised or mad at yourself, somehow. Okay, that is

347
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. The best the body knew how to do it already knew. I can't run. I can't fight it already knew. And so it did.

348
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The next best thing. And it tried to take care of you. The best way I knew how and it froze. Okay. Your body knew what to do and it's an amazing things body of ours. Okay, was trying to protect you psychologically. It was doing the best it could okay but

349
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That stuff sticks around. It's not quite done

350
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what I'm saying. So notice how that one, that one still kind of is with you, and you've got you've got some assets so

351
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I may want to revisit some piece of that and mobilization parts so that that one's put way in the distance and that you can have this vitality this energy that comes from

352
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not frozen. I'm not helpless. I can take action.

353
00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I can. So that's where reprocessing comes in in the FDR part is

354
00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a different relationship with that history. Same way you can kind of talk about those things have your Leary rebel talk about it, but the emotion wasn't coming up with it because there was a distance, but this one.

355
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's I'm thinking, it may have something to do with that particular freeze response me where you were very little.

356
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.900
Jessica Garcia: So I think when I said like the bait at nine men like

357
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:25.650
Jessica Garcia: Like I felt like I couldn't make it. I couldn't. I didn't want to

358
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.820
Jessica Garcia: Get her job. I didn't want to leave his side,

359
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.600
Jessica Garcia: And so to me, that was

360
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.590
Jessica Garcia: The ability debilitate me

361
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And leave his side, you're talking about your son.

362
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.840
Yeah.

363
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So, but notice that in general. And you've probably heard me say this before. How do we decide what debilitating is what's right, what's good, what's bad well i don't i don't look at those words I looked at whether it's adaptive

364
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So we take what you were doing with your son, which is I can't leave his side, so we look and we say, well, is that adaptive

365
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't, I honestly don't know. This is where you're measuring it and it's different today than it was three months ago.

366
00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how it's changed now wait a minute. No, I need to work.

367
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to feel this sense of control in my life and you're I think you're starting to have some sort of perspective, maybe there are people that can provide good care for your son keep him safe. So you're sort of looking at it.

368
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

369
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes

370
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be the way to go. Maybe just don't leave in his side is the way to go. But really, it's sort of, you'd get to decide what's adaptive and what's maladaptive it's not going to be my measure, it'll be you.

371
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why it's important that you guys come up with what you want to do with your day on your own. Not me.

372
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm trying to say like you came to this conclusion on your own. But this isn't, this isn't working for you.

373
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, yeah.

374
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they get like that it can get like I have to because it could go so extreme. Couldn't it I can't be away from my son, he's now 10 I'm going to keep him home. He's not going to be socialized won't go to school. I'm going to stay in an abusive relationship.

375
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I might risk my sobriety because I can't be away from my son, my son never gets to learn that he can't protect himself that he can distinguish appropriate

376
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Touch appropriate psychological boundaries emotional boundaries. I can teach it to him because ultimately we're trying to raise an independent little critter so that he can be a man. Eventually, so that

377
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But taken to an extreme. It could be that. And would you recognize that that was adaptive or maladaptive i don't know but

378
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It could get to that degree, right, it could

379
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.230
Jessica Garcia: Yeah yeah

380
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but it's not you saw something that wasn't working for you too. And you, you're really looking at it and guess how you are. I'm now excited

381
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To go work. That's what you said today, and I'm like, well, look at that. That's something because you would have not said that to me you wouldn't have months ago.

382
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.580
Jessica Garcia: You did better.

383
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Facilitate afraid.

384
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.250
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, that's true.

385
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So that comes, probably from a sense of

386
00:42:48.090 --> 00:43:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I can take care of myself. I'm teaching my son at right he drew talking about his body parts. Here's good touch bad touch. Here's this is a there's nothing shameful about the penis, you know,

387
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The PS repeats recoup, you know, the more it's sin tonic. The more we are like, yeah, there's nothing wrong with my body. Then there's nothing wrong with talking about it if something uncomfortable happens. I can tell my mom.

388
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You know someone touched my leg and left it there. I'm like, that was so weird. Now we can hear it and we're hearing it right away.

389
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

390
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: nothing shameful about our bodies.

391
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.120
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

392
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.540
Jessica Garcia: I try, even as little as he is like, you know,

393
00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:39.840
Jessica Garcia: Like what is, you know,

394
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Parts are

395
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.210
Yeah.

396
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:44.880
Jessica Garcia: He knows it.

397
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.590
Jessica Garcia: He knows it to go pee and, you know,

398
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.960
Jessica Garcia: his dad's is different than his mom.

399
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Is different. And then, as he gets older then there'll be like it'll start behaving a little weird on its own. It's like all that bloods going to rush in there.

400
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's true, but it's like a little body does a little systems check at like age nine, and 10 you're like, gotta be kidding me.

401
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but there is but it's going to be about our comfort. So the work you do. Now the work that you get comfortable with your own body.

402
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right as you get clear and clear that that was just

403
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Unhealthy behavior from other people. You're not just that story. Now you are. What's the healthy way you can. I can continue to talk about those things.

404
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The more comfortable you are with it, the more he's going to say, oh, it's just a body. There's a healthy way to look at it and there's a real sense of yeah that's unhealthy and he's going to know it right away and be able to communicate and trust that you can handle hearing it.

405
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

406
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.470
Jessica Garcia: Yeah yeah

407
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The more resilience. You're getting this hard work that you're doing right now and all that processing. You did over these last couple years because you said you've already done and I can see that you were able to, you were talking about it, just like

408
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and then the facts, lady.

409
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, and then we ran across one that still had a pretty pretty sort of deep emotional piece to it somehow. So that might be a target down the line, we may want to explore. We'll see.

410
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's take a minute and process what today was like for you. Okay, you kind of turn inward and sort of do a reflection and just have a nice quiet moment.

411
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to run through the film strip of little pockets of what today was for you.

412
00:45:52.200 --> 00:46:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just observe the self. We thought we felt your body motions.

413
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see see if you noticed anything just ever so slightly new

414
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever so slightly different

415
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was.

416
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:26.610
Jessica Garcia: I actually have unresolved feeling about what happened with my cousin.

417
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.820
Jessica Garcia: Little girls.

418
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that you were willing to say cousin.

419
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, maybe not before but like it. See how it moves it just gets easier and easier. There's less shame.

420
00:46:46.500 --> 00:47:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because it wasn't her fault either really she did it. But what she know she was doing like she's trying to process it if it's okay that someone do this to me. Well, then, could I do it to this little girl like this one's trying to work it out too.

421
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:04.290
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

422
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we mimic it to say, is this okay. Is someone going to stop me someone going to say no. Is this normal is this you know so. Okay, so someone process stuff you're you're aware of. All right.

423
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.310
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

424
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.900
Jessica Garcia: I think because I'm

425
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:29.880
Jessica Garcia: Like we talk sometimes she calls me when she's happy she's in a really abusive relationship.

426
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:35.100
Jessica Garcia: And so when she's having problems like she calls me and

427
00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:47.130
Jessica Garcia: I just listened to her. I just listened to her and then when they get back together. She stopped talking to me and that's just right now what her cycle is

428
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.470
Jessica Garcia: But

429
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.350
Jessica Garcia: I get pretty annoyed.

430
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I do like leave the guy.

431
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.740
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I get annoyed. I think because she

432
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.210
Jessica Garcia: She's just so entitled and so

433
00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:18.090
Jessica Garcia: And so she makes me feel like if I'm obligated to talk to her. And I think that's what it is like

434
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:26.880
Jessica Garcia: she's not. She's very not aware of herself at all to very unaware

435
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.320
Jessica Garcia: And it's kind of annoying.

436
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.620
Jessica Garcia: But other than that, I know.

437
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm writing down what you just said. It's really important. Actually, what you just did I get annoyed she acts entitled I feel obligated. Those are big, those are important pieces. I'm glad you able to add that, that last bit.

438
00:48:55.830 --> 00:49:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the these are current time. So kind of interacting with her and she is on aware and which also means doesn't sound like she has a tone that she has come to you in a really honest way she's not yours. Yeah. So we're going to put a pin in that one.

439
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that was a lot right there at the end. Okay, that's a big piece of it. Thank you for that. For for trusting me with that information. I really feel like I may not have been the easiest thing in the world to do
