00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.220

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.680
Galaxy S10+: Okay. All right.

121

Jonathan Figg: Um, have you ever heard or use

122
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.720
Your finger suboptimal

123
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:38.340
Galaxy S10+: I'm I've heard of it. I've been told by people, and especially someone close to that, that it's really helped and

124
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.570
Jonathan Figg: How did you get referred to us a bright harder. How did you find right

125
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.970
Galaxy S10+: By my girlfriend.

126
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.360
Galaxy S10+: Okay, other than

127
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.340
Jonathan Figg: your significant other. Okay, awesome. And what's your understanding of Suboxone

128
00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:06.330
Galaxy S10+: My understanding is that it locks nerve centers in your brain for the feeling that basically the effects of coming down off the heroin so that you could start using the hell.

129
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.060
Jonathan Figg: All right, great. That's pretty accurate.

130
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:23.010
Galaxy S10+: Okay, that that's that's my main problem is I started doing it to get away from like basically myself and my problems. And now I can't stop there because I said

131
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.670
Jonathan Figg: I missed that.

132
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.580
Galaxy S10+: I get. I get so sick. Yeah.

133
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.470
Jonathan Figg: So heroin is an opiate time drug

134
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.250
Galaxy S10+: Yes.

135
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.240
Jonathan Figg: And that's a specific kind of chemical that's a specific kind

136
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.450
Jonathan Figg: And it has actions, it activates pleasure. That's the high

137
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.600
Jonathan Figg: Off pain, it turns off. How awake, you are writing to make you drowsy knock you out.

138
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.960
Jonathan Figg: And, you know, it'll turn off your breathing, and that's the

139
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.670
Galaxy S10+: Yes.

140
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.760
Jonathan Figg: When you stop taking

141
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.090
Jonathan Figg: It for a long time. Are you going to throw up. Are you okay

142
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.410
Galaxy S10+: Yeah, sorry.

143
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.270
Jonathan Figg: I just if you have to go for a second best. Okay. I don't want you to

144
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.560
Jonathan Figg: We're going to do something, is that we have to talk for a minute here.

145
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.820
Jonathan Figg: So when you stop taking it suddenly you get

146
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.720
Jonathan Figg: All of those effects it make you feel horrible.

147
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.240
Jonathan Figg: Everything hurts worse than it did before. Anyway, right, you feel anxious or

148
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.760
Jonathan Figg: So, and in

149
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:38.940
Jonathan Figg: Your brain will continue looking even after the Israel is gone. Right. So you'd have a dependence on it and there's nothing that will change that.

150
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.480
Galaxy S10+: So,

151
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:53.700
Jonathan Figg: In order to treat you. For that, we have to place heroin with something that's safer that we told that we can have a control for okay

152
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.300
Galaxy S10+: And if

153
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.590
Jonathan Figg: You get you off that then we can slowly over time to eat.

154
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.210
Jonathan Figg: So,

155
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.460
Galaxy S10+: You can do that.

156
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.370
Jonathan Figg: Better. We're going to go into severe withdrawal and just relax.

157
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.010
Jonathan Figg: So buprenorphine is also right we have to do a replace

158
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.590
Jonathan Figg: It does not have the same

159
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.640
Jonathan Figg: Other brands who does have her on pleasure.

160

Galaxy S10+: Yeah yeah

164
00:11:45.690 --> 00:12:04.860
Jonathan Figg: It also has a blocking effect. And then your significant other was telling you about. So it will stop the withdrawal because it's a little bit. And once you're already on Suboxone it will block the effect of other things like heroin have any effect on you. So it helps reduce the reward.

165
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:05.490

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:57.510
Jonathan Figg: Interview I pulled this year's report, which actually I don't find any records. We're going to have to check

342
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:05.160
Jonathan Figg: On why he says he was treated with Adderall. In the past, but just curious report, even on partial matches.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.860
Does not

344
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.090
See, everybody else.

345
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.400
Jonathan Figg: And so I'm not putting anything

346
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.760
On his shirt report.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:31.440

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.360
Jonathan Figg: Group.

349
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.380
Jonathan Figg: For opioid use disorder and rewriting the script for Suboxone ain't no grand start one strip a go to

350
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.240
Jonathan Figg: And excuse me excusing is

351
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:55.770
Jonathan Figg: questionnaires that I reviewed during the thing is expert. He has a low audit score. So I'm not concerned about drinking. He doesn't have any history of using other

352
00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:06.960
Jonathan Figg: Drugs is quite straightforward. He had a normal mental status. He's physically uncomfortable. He's in mild withdrawal. And so he looked like he was gonna vomit. A couple times there.

353
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.480
Although he didn't. Thankfully,

354
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.630
And that's it.
