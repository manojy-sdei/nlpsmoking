00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.030
Mm hmm.

163
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.420
Magalie Marcellus: So that's happened you manage whatever

164
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.430
Magalie Marcellus: Triggers or

165
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.290
Odessa Martin: Even when I've had mean

166
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.560
Odessa Martin: Ron I have cravings.

167
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.540
Odessa Martin: Not, not

168
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.480
Odessa Martin: I don't know, not

169
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:40.860
Odessa Martin: Not that I would act on them, but I do still have cravings. I don't think that ever goes away really

170
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.750
Magalie Marcellus: So then when those craven come handle you. What do you do

171
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.930
Odessa Martin: This is how I do it.

172
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:57.960
Odessa Martin: The doctor, we have the floor. He had told me, like, because I have a lot of pain. I have a lot of kidney problems.

173
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.700
Magalie Marcellus: He would tell me to like

174
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:15.720
Odessa Martin: Take my medicine and break it up and pieces. So if I feel the urge like I need a head change or something already take me like a quarter of about my savvis x. And that pretty much ends it at that.

175
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.430
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

176
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:31.170
Magalie Marcellus: So do you ever use anything else besides the medication to manage those cravings, like doing something to kind of distract yourself. Now what about

177
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:38.100
Magalie Marcellus: Taking animals or those things will that does that ever help you get your mind off it.

178
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.500
Odessa Martin: Yeah yeah

Odessa Martin: I get them and have them fixed

196
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.000
Odessa Martin: And I just never got rid of them.

197
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.110
Magalie Marcellus: That must be pretty expensive to take care of. So how do you guys manage that.

198
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.180
It is

199
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:01.680
Magalie Marcellus: Well,

200
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.240

347
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:09.540
Odessa Martin: But taking the medicine and I started smoking cigarettes, which was the worst thing in my life to ever start known again. But I did.

Odessa Martin: My doctors, she called me and some the Nicorette gum.

353
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.260
Odessa Martin: Because we don't smoke in the house with the baby. So when she was more I started smoking outside

354
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.160
Magalie Marcellus: Are you using the GM to help you.

355
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:53.940
Odessa Martin: Yeah, but I just started I hear reason but I'm smoking now.

356
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.960

357
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.720

363
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:36.780
How
