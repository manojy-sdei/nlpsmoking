00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.340
Dominique Pozo: Erica. I have had a I wish I had more time today, but my schedule is really packed so I couldn't push it back.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.190
Erika Romero: No, that's fine. It's fine. I just needed to let you know that I was going to be a little bit late because 1015 minutes just because I

3
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.480
Erika Romero: had to wait for my husband to get home. My daughter's on a on a roll today. So she saw all attitude and all about her so

4
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:38.580
Erika Romero: I knew that wasn't going to work with her being in the same room with me. So I just figured, I'll just tell Dominique, I'm going to be a few minutes late. That way I can go ahead and have some peace and quiet.

5
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.610
Erika Romero: Sorry, I apologize, but I appreciate you being here.

6
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.840
Dominique Pozo: No problem.

7
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.960
Dominique Pozo: So, so how's it going in the last session we had you had some come to Jesus moment, as you call them and

8
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.040
Dominique Pozo: I'm just wondering how this last week has been for you.

9
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.370
Erika Romero: Um, it's been ok I am

10
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.390
Erika Romero: I had a rough Mother's Day. Like I said yesterday, and

11
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.400
Erika Romero: And so I

12
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.820
Erika Romero: I think I'm, I'm kind of still dealing with that. But it's, it all has to do with my family and

13
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:32.370
Erika Romero: I don't know. I'm just, I feel less like really let down by my family and disappointed with my family and my mother's day was no exception. And so

14
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.980
Erika Romero: It was kind of a really it was it was a tough day

15
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.800
Erika Romero: So,

16
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.220
Erika Romero: You know, I just

17
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:58.110
Erika Romero: I just don't. I really don't know what to do about you know about them anymore. And I'm you know in in in the past I've just I've always kind of just

18
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.480
Erika Romero: throw my hands up and said, You know what, I can't deal with this. And I'm not going to. So I'm just gonna

19
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.850
Erika Romero: I'm just gonna

20
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.480
Erika Romero: Separate myself and I'm in. So I so that's actually worked out the best for me in regards to people in my life.

21
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:41.010
Erika Romero: Sometimes if it's not healthy for you and it doesn't bring you joy and peace and I get that, you know, everyday life happens. And people do disappoint you. But when it's on a constant basis and just not getting any fulfillment out of your relationships.

22
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.670
Erika Romero: They're more of a disappointment than a fulfillment.

23
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.750
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

24
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.470
Erika Romero: It's just easier just to say, Okay, I gotta go. You know, and I go home and do my own thing.

25
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.230
Erika Romero: But I have so few family you know and and

26
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.190
Erika Romero: So in that aspect. It's, it's kind of hard for me to to do to do with it on that level.

27
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.900
Erika Romero: Um,

28
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:22.290
Erika Romero: But you know, I just, I don't know my family's just really disappointing to me, everybody's in such denial and I'm in everybody's got

29
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:37.140
Erika Romero: Not to say that I don't have my own problems because I do and I'm not perfect. I'm definitely have my own issues. Um, but everybody. So in denial, you know, and

30
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:55.320
Erika Romero: I've, I've always I've always been the one to to provide for people, you know, to take them into my home or into my life and provide and be there for them and support them and all that and it and it makes it hard for me.

31
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:06.900
Erika Romero: When I when I'm constantly disappointed by those people. You know what I mean. And so that's where, that's where it kind of fell on on Mother's Day.

32
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:21.060
Erika Romero: So it made it made it very difficult day. I mean, me and my children. We don't have a relationship. I don't have a relationship with any of my children.

33
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:34.350
Erika Romero: I have four of them and have no relationship whatsoever with any of them, and my two oldest I've, I've come to you know that that's just kind of been part of the experience of losing custody of them. Um,

34
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.650
Erika Romero: But my twins I my daughter really is the only one who I am.

35
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.710
Erika Romero: Who I raised out of my children I raised her twin brother. For the first four years of his life, and then

36
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.420
Erika Romero: He was a very challenging child and and really

37
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.010
Erika Romero: Make things hard for me. So I sent him to go live with us at all.

38
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:10.170
Erika Romero: Because I really felt like he needed a father figure in his life. So the only one that I raised was my daughter and her and I have no relationship whatsoever. She

39
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:21.060
Erika Romero: Like I told you she's hell bent on on destroying me. Anyway, that she possibly can, which. Okay, fine, whatever. But I raised my niece and, you know,

40
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.530
Erika Romero: sure exactly what I did for her.

41
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.590
Erika Romero: But she's you know she is completely just um

42
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.790
Erika Romero: How do I say I'm

43
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:50.130
Erika Romero: Kind of turned a cold shoulder to me for some reason. And I don't know why. And she won't talk to me. So I don't know what it is.

44
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.130
Dominique Pozo: Well, you said you said that she's using right

45
00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:11.340
Erika Romero: Well, I don't know, I, I, I honestly don't know. Oh, with her. I, I can't honestly tell you that. Yes, she is. Or no, she's not because I can't talk to her. She won't return my calls. She won't see me. I know that she went back with her boyfriend.

46
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.420
Erika Romero: Or the her HER BABY'S dad.

47
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.100
Erika Romero: And she was gone for a couple weeks so I can only imagine that's probably what she did, but

48
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.520
Erika Romero: Again, I don't really know but you know for the holidays has always been

49
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:41.640
Erika Romero: She's her and I have always been really close. And so for the holidays. She always make sure that she calls me and you know I always try to include her and make sure that she's part of

50
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.860
Erika Romero: My life, you know, and if it's even if I don't see her every day or every month or or

51
00:06:50.670 --> 00:07:09.480
Erika Romero: Or whatever I know for sure that on the holidays. I'm going to get a phone call from her and she especially like Mother's Day and my birthday she always tries to make sure that she you know she calls me in. It makes me feel because I'm been the only mother in her life and so

52
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:19.500
Erika Romero: So, you know, for Mother's Day I get a text message from her, and it was very impersonal and

53
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.250
Erika Romero: And I guess I kind of just felt really

54
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.260
Erika Romero: sad about that, you know, and hurt because that's not her. And I don't know. I don't know why she did it.

55
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.290
Dominique Pozo: I mean, I have a feeling, who knows it's all speculation. You don't know unless you confront her directly or she tells you, but

56
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:54.330
Dominique Pozo: If she's you know, turning away from you and it feels really cold and dry I i do suspect. She's probably using she's probably ashamed. She doesn't want to be told that she's doing anything wrong. She's in her in, you know, in it so

57
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:01.320
Erika Romero: And and and you know my husband and I have talked about it. And honestly, that that's the only time that she

58
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:14.070
Erika Romero: She does that to me, you know, and she she she cuts me out of her life. And she and she won't respond to me and she won't talk to me is when she's doing something wrong because she values.

59
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:22.650
Erika Romero: Really what I think and feel, you know, and because her and I do have a really close relationship. It's just, I don't really know what's going on.

60
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:32.970
Erika Romero: You know, again, it is all speculation and I don't you know want to sit here and say yes, she's on drugs for sure my daughter, definitely. I know that for a fact.

61
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.880
Erika Romero: But my niece, I don't

62
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:36.870
You know,

63
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:48.330
Erika Romero: But she doesn't. She not usually like this with me. So I don't really understand what's going on with her, my mom I brought my mom up here on Mother's Day to my house and

64
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.350
Erika Romero: My mom's that damn disaster. I don't even know what to do with her and I keep thinking, she's getting elderly

65
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:03.960
Erika Romero: And I'm the only person that she has that that's there to take care of her. And so

66
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:17.700
Erika Romero: But I think, honestly, in my opinion, because what I see when I have my mom. Here is my mom's a junkie to my mom spent her whole day high on her medication.

67
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:33.750
Erika Romero: To the point where she can even worse. Her words are slurred, you know, and she's falling. Oh, she's constantly falling, you know, not here at my house, but you know she's but I've seen her.

68
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:42.990
Erika Romero: This past weekend. You know, there was several times where I caught her you know just nodding now and just falling over.

69
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:55.920
Erika Romero: On on the bed or falling over on the over on the couch, you know, and but my mom so deep in denial that everybody else is doing everything but not my mom, you know, and

70
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:05.160
Erika Romero: You know she's got that mindset that if the doctor gives it to me. I'm not, you know, I'm not addicted. I'm not an addict well

71
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:20.460
Erika Romero: There's a whole lot more that goes behind that and you know I'm getting to the point now where I just don't know what to do with my mom anymore. You know, I can't have it in my home. I can't, I can't allow my granddaughter to be around that.

72
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:21.900
That's what

73
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.040
Dominique Pozo: I'm hearing so like you even you even said it that there's just a lot of disappointment around your family.

74
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.300
Erika Romero: Mm hmm.

75
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.850
Dominique Pozo: From mothers two daughters two nieces.

76
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:45.150
Dominique Pozo: Gosh, and what I'm thinking. And I see your granddaughter as this little shining one who's still hasn't developed the dysfunctions so I'm

77
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.780
Dominique Pozo: Wondering

78
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.190
Dominique Pozo: What kind of, what can you do to keep focusing on what is not hasn't been impacted so fully yet.

79
00:10:54.030 --> 00:11:12.690
Erika Romero: That's so funny that you say that because my husband and I talked about this, this, this past weekend. I said, you know, she's the only one I haven't you know who hasn't disappointed me in my family, you know, and then I kind of jokingly said, oh, you know, she's still a little

80
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.520
Dominique Pozo: And but

81
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:20.190
Erika Romero: You know my fear is there, you know that I put so much energy and so much

82
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:34.920
Erika Romero: All of me into everybody else, you know. And then, and then it's just a huge disappointment, you know, and I'm so terrified that that's going to happen with her to, you know, and

83
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.930
Erika Romero: I'm just tired of being disappointed.

84
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.130
Erika Romero: And I don't want

85
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.600
Erika Romero: My granddaughter to do the same to me. You know what I mean.

86
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.880
Erika Romero: I don't really know how to change that table. I don't know, um,

87
00:11:52.290 --> 00:12:00.090
Erika Romero: You know, I thought I did everything right with my girls and I showed them better. And I, I gave them a better life and

88
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.190
Dominique Pozo: I get better Erica.

89
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:10.590
Dominique Pozo: Let's before we go into the but i just i am noticing so much emotion coming up. I just want to give space for that. And I do believe that

90
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:24.120
Dominique Pozo: Beneath the emotion. There might be some clarity. That's not coming from your mind. So let's take a moment and just be with what I'm hearing is grief and I'm also hearing a deep desire to

91
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:42.510
Dominique Pozo: Do it differently with your granddaughter. And I'm just wondering if we just sit with this for a few moments and let yourself feel and let your heart speak like how can you do it differently with her. What could it look like to support her in a, in a way that

92
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:54.300
Dominique Pozo: That hopefully she can, you know, be her her best self moving forward.

93
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.660
Dominique Pozo: What does your heart say

94
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.630
Erika Romero: Let's just get scared.

95
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.180
Erika Romero: I really don't know.

96
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.340
Erika Romero: I don't know.

97
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.320
Dominique Pozo: No.

98
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:21.690
Yeah.

99
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.420
Dominique Pozo: So let's just take a few deeper and a lot of things.

100
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:39.960
Dominique Pozo: What were you gonna say

101
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:42.450
Erika Romero: I said,

102
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.130
Erika Romero: My, my mind goes through a lot of different

103
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.030
Erika Romero: A lot of different things, you know, and

104
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.000
Erika Romero: Especially with her because she's

105
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.150
Erika Romero: She was brought into this world with a lot of with disappointment, you know,

106
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.070
Erika Romero: And

107
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:15.000
Erika Romero: And she may not realize it now. But eventually, she's gonna have to know

108
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.580
Erika Romero: What happened, you know,

109
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.340
Erika Romero: Why she is why she's here.

110
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.860
Erika Romero: Know what, what kind of a trail is that Emily for her. We

111
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.460
Dominique Pozo: Know what

112
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.970
Erika Romero: I'm afraid that regardless of what I do, where she comes from maybe her driving force, you know, and

113
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.990
Erika Romero: You know i think that's that's the same thing that happened with with my daughter.

114
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.140
Erika Romero: I you know I don't know I don't really know what to do for her.

115
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.810
Dominique Pozo: How about

116
00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.830
Dominique Pozo: How can you be how can you be different, rather than doing anything. What, how can you be different.

117
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.820
Erika Romero: I don't know. I honestly don't know. I don't know.

118
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.680
Erika Romero: How did you things different. I don't really think that I did. I mean, I wasn't a perfect parent, but I know that

119
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.780
Erika Romero: I did the very best I could with my girls, you know,

120
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.090
Erika Romero: So honestly, I don't know. What would be different.

121
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:56.970
Erika Romero: Because I if I've learned anything really over my lifetime is that I can't accept responsibility for what other people do.

122
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:02.880
Erika Romero: Yeah, I taught I taught my girls better you know they didn't see

123
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.850
Erika Romero: The messed up part of me. You know that I didn't raise them that way.

124
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.230
Erika Romero: So,

125
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:23.700
Erika Romero: To be honest, I mean, I, I, I just don't know what to do different and then I guess that's that's the part that scares me.

126
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.450
Erika Romero: Is I I really don't know what to do different because

127
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:40.950
Erika Romero: I don't think I did anything wrong, you know, again, like I said, I'm not a perfect person I'm by no means a perfect parent, but

128
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.760
Erika Romero: I don't think that I was a bad parent either

129
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.310
Dominique Pozo: I have an idea. I think that sometimes our deliver some

130
00:16:52.740 --> 00:17:00.630
Dominique Pozo: Insight that our mind can't come up with. So I do you do you think some art could help or. Where would you like to go from here.

131
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.480
Erika Romero: Yeah, I guess I could try it.

132
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:14.910
Dominique Pozo: I mean the vision I keep having is your, your granddaughter inside of a big circle.

133
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:29.880
Dominique Pozo: And in the middle. She's in the middle and then I wonder with your non dominant hand because a lot of information comes from the non dominant hand that we're not consciously thinking what would you surround her with so

134
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.240
Dominique Pozo: You know, it could be a lot of what you've done. But I'm curious if

135
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.990
Dominique Pozo: Something new comes through that maybe is a new idea from something that that didn't happen with your daughters.

136
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.770
Dominique Pozo: Your daughter your needs your son's so

137
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:58.620
Dominique Pozo: just imagining your granddaughter in the center of the circle and then with your non dominant hand either illustrating or writing. Okay. What can you say What's like the circle of protection and support. What is it made up of

138
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.780
Erika Romero: All right, let me. Um, let me just go get a piece of paper. Okay.

139
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.700
Erika Romero: Okay, give me just a second. Okay.

140
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.730
Erika Romero: Okay, don't make. I'm sorry.

141
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.660
Dominique Pozo: That's okay.

142
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:26.490
Dominique Pozo: So yeah, if you could do that, go ahead and make a circle and then place whatever representation or the word or and if you could do all of this with your non dominant hand.

143
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.940
Erika Romero: me use my dominant hand to make a circle.

144
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.540
Erika Romero: Okay.

145
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:46.800
Erika Romero: We realized that was we tried it. We try to write with your non dominant hand. You write backwards.

146
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.900
Dominique Pozo: Hasn't happened to be, but that is interesting.

147
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.890
Erika Romero: Anyway, and that's what I'm finding now.

148
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.270
Erika Romero: Okay, I think I got it.

149
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.780
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so tell me what you've got.

150
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.330
Erika Romero: Okay, let's see if I can

151
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.510
Erika Romero: I can show you.

152
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.410
Erika Romero: The picture and make it this way, where it's a little bit more like

153
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.200
Erika Romero: Okay.

154
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.780
Erika Romero: I don't know if you can see it but

155
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.290
Erika Romero: In the middle is alley and then I have myself.

156
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:14.430
Erika Romero: Here, this is my husband on the other side. And then I have a couple of clocks one on the bottom and one on the top.

157
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.450
Erika Romero: And the box represents time

158
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.960
Erika Romero: Just I think being able to just spend more time with her giving her that

159
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.350
Erika Romero: Huh, one on one, you know,

160
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:38.910
Erika Romero: Because I think and I got my mind. And there's a little hearts around there. So just giving like that extra love that extra time.

161
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:55.770
Erika Romero: That I guess I didn't really get to give my girls. You know what I mean, because I was a single parent. And so, um, you know, I kind of left just destiny to

162
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.200
Erika Romero: To be the guide, I guess, you know what I mean. And I think that

163
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:03.210
Erika Romero: I'm

164
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:11.400
Erika Romero: Just being able to give my granddaughter that, first of all, the two of us.

165
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:12.990
Erika Romero: I'm

166
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.230
Erika Romero: Just having a dad.

167
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.220
Erika Romero: Because my girls, they didn't have dad.

168
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.840
Erika Romero: And like my daughter was a piece of shit.

169
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.490
Erika Romero: And

170
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:41.970
Erika Romero: And so I think just being able to have the two of us there. And being a united force to be able to raise her together. And even though we don't always see i'd i think will be a big

171
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.910
Erika Romero: You know, as far as

172
00:26:46.980 --> 00:27:01.230
Erika Romero: The raising raising her goes you know i think that that will eventually all work itself out. But I think just her having the two of us, you know, on a united front for her.

173
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:11.760
Erika Romero: Being able to give her that extra time and that extra love and that extra affection that you know kind of gets away with, you know, from you as a single parent

174
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:23.670
Dominique Pozo: So that those are two significant things that when you set up initially that you know you you wouldn't do anything different, or you change anything it having more time.

175
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:33.660
Dominique Pozo: Is huge and having both parents in the house. That's a different model for sure. So this is I do see potential to do things differently.

176
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.750
Dominique Pozo: Definitely

177
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:51.390
Dominique Pozo: And those are foundational you know the the amount of mirroring and the kind of attachment bond that can happen when a parent is so available for a child is huge. That makes a huge difference. And then

178
00:27:51.810 --> 00:28:07.770
Dominique Pozo: Have the, you know, at least you know I think having more adults around but definitely at least having mom and dad is that's a human or dad figure you know it's not her dad, but having these two parental figures, that's, that's huge to

179
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:22.890
Erika Romero: And I guess the thing that that just scares me about that is you know her have growing up and and and knowing that we're grandma and grandpa and not Mom and Dad, you know,

180
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:34.230
Erika Romero: Well, that, that, that scares me and you know she's, she's got a lot of challenges ahead of her. She really does you know

181
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:41.310
Erika Romero: Her mom could care less about her. And I think that that's going to be a huge thing for her.

182
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:52.710
Erika Romero: As she gets older and I mean right now she's content and her mom isn't an issue for it's not an issue in her life, or even in her thought process.

183
00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:07.560
Erika Romero: But I think that that's one thing that just frightens me you know it. I think that's where my fear photos from is, you know, she's gonna have a lot to realize

184
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.720
Erika Romero: When she gets older.

185
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:22.140
Erika Romero: And I, and I guess that that scares me. Because then that's, that's where the disappointment starts coming in, you know,

186
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:22.740
When

187
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:30.180
Erika Romero: When things get tough for four people, and they can't deal with them so they find a different outlet

188
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.550
Erika Romero: To be able to deal with them.

189
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:44.970
Dominique Pozo: Well, as long as you're as present as you, it seems that you're able to be because you're not a single mom working you know she'll have somebody to come to the talk to our somebody to listen because

190
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:50.490
Dominique Pozo: Oftentimes people go turn to other substances when they don't have anyone or they're not being heard.

191
00:29:51.270 --> 00:30:13.350
Erika Romero: Yeah yeah i think that's that's where my mom's where my mom's gone awry. I know psycho therapist. By no means. But you know, I think my mom's dealt with a lot of stuff she's really bitter with, you know, sure her mind is going. Already, as it is.

192
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.520
Erika Romero: And you know, I think that now she's

193
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:28.260
Erika Romero: She's starting to overdo her medications and, you know, and I think it she's always been very bitter and very angry and

194
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.080
Erika Romero: Has never gotten any help for anything that she's gone through in her life and

195
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:48.150
Erika Romero: And I you know I like i said i'm not psycho therapist, and I'm not going to psychoanalyze her yet either. But I just know my mom, you know, and so I think my mom. My mom and I

196
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.070
Erika Romero: Always had a disappointing relationship.

197
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.950
Erika Romero: She's never been a very present

198
00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.540
Erika Romero: emotionally present person for me, you know, so

199
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:02.910
Erika Romero: Um,

200
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.710
Erika Romero: You know, so anything that I dealt with as I was growing up, or as an adult.

201
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.530
Erika Romero: I had to deal with that on my own. Because going to mom wasn't somebody that I went to you and I don't

202
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:24.840
Erika Romero: Know, I still don't you know i i don't confide in my mom or go running my mom when things get rough. I never have because my mom and I don't

203
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.860
Erika Romero: Have that relationship.

204
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:27.390
Dominique Pozo: You know, um,

205
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.400
Erika Romero: And my daughter and I

206
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.930
Erika Romero: I've always tried to be there emotionally for her because that's

207
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:42.210
Erika Romero: Because I was something that I was missing in my life. And so I always wanted to be available for her and that aspect.

208
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.760
Erika Romero: But

209
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:55.620
Erika Romero: There's a whole different dynamic between my daughter and I and I just as I just don't want my granddaughter to fall in that too. You know what I mean. And so

210
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.090
Erika Romero: I get I

211
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.060
Erika Romero: Get really scared to, you know,

212
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.530
Erika Romero: To have to try to face that future, you know, and

213
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.440
Erika Romero: And I mean I know that's a long way off.

214
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.000
Erika Romero: And

215
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.480
Erika Romero: Running my chickens before they're hatched but

216
00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:22.440
Erika Romero: I guess because I've dealt with so much disappointment. I don't. I'm just afraid that I don't know, have more

217
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.770
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Yeah, I really I you said that earlier that your heart feels afraid and

218
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.720
Erika Romero: I know you know I just

219
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.580
Erika Romero: Went anyway. Yeah, so that was my mother's

220
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.110
Dominique Pozo: Well, it's a lot to talk about this.

221
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.490
Erika Romero: Yeah, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna

222
00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:06.060
Erika Romero: I just don't want to deal with it anymore. I'm just so tired done with all this shit excuse my language, but I'm just, I really am. I'm just tired.

223
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:24.810
Erika Romero: Tired of dealing with it and you know I like I said, I don't have a big family. So, you know, I try to keep the family that I do have false to me but Colleen, man. I just don't know how to deal with them anymore on an emotional level on a psychological level they're

224
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.200
Erika Romero: They're short circuiting me

225
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.430
You know what I mean.

226
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.520
Erika Romero: I pride myself on on being

227
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.080
Erika Romero: Pretty grounded, you know,

228
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:35.970
Erika Romero: But

229
00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.350
Erika Romero: Whenever I have to deal with my family. It's just

230
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:55.050
Erika Romero: That's hard. It's really hard and I don't I don't want her to grow up thinking that either, you know, my gosh, my, my non is freakin Fruit Loop, you know,

231
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.120
Erika Romero: I think my, I think my mom is, you know, but

232
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.520
Dominique Pozo: Well,

233
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.890
Erika Romero: There's really no way to just see into the future. Let's see how that all turns out

234
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:23.790
Dominique Pozo: I'm going to invite you to make a list of all the things that you wish your mom would be for you right now. Can you make a list of that.

235
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.010
Dominique Pozo: What you will

236
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:28.410
See what you

237
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:45.960
Dominique Pozo: Will you make a list of the things that you wish your mother would be to you today, like, you know, she would be present compassionate kind, whatever, whatever the list is what, what is the list that what is the anti to the fruit loop.

238
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.280
Because it sounds like

239
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:48.960
Dominique Pozo: That

240
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:50.130
Dominique Pozo: Your mom, you don't

241
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:57.300
Dominique Pozo: You don't have a great connection with your mom at the moment. So what would be the, the other end of the spectrum of the things you really wish you had with her.

242
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.620
Dominique Pozo: So go ahead and if you can write the stuff

243
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:07.740
Erika Romero: Give me just a minute and such down. Okay, so I have both hands. Okay.

244
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.910
Erika Romero: I think I had to grab a few

245
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.620
Erika Romero: Okay, let's see.

246
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.520
Dominique Pozo: Tell me what you've got.

247
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.090
Erika Romero: Is

248
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.580
Erika Romero: Over hope on to

249
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.290
Dominique Pozo: Oh no, sorry.

250
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.130
Okay.

251
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.460
Erika Romero: All over me all over my bed.

252
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.300
Erika Romero: Have a bathroom of my bedroom.

253
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.260
Erika Romero: I might turn back on it like that.

254
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.890
Erika Romero: But it just shut off and come back on and then

255
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.660
Erika Romero: Put it out on the table, a drunk class and all his friends on

256
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.640
Erika Romero: Okay, I'll just leave that with you.

257
00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.800
Erika Romero: Okay, so

258
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.770
Erika Romero: My list says

259
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.130
Erika Romero: Comforting affection and

260
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:55.800
Erika Romero: Interested loving, caring and present and more. So just emotionally. I think President and my mom so

261
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.050
Erika Romero: She's not

262
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.810
Erika Romero: Just none of those things, and she never has been. And so

263
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.490
Dominique Pozo: I

264
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.570
Erika Romero: My mom.

265
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.780
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I'm just saying, I imagine.

266
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:24.570
Dominique Pozo: If you wrote those words down and maybe pin them on your refrigerator on your bathroom mirror and remind yourself of all the things you'd want for yourself if you imagine if you become that for your granddaughter, it's going to go differently.

267
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:36.120
Erika Romero: I you know I really try to be all those things for her because I didn't have that when I was growing up, or even nowadays, you know, yeah, my mom.

268
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:51.030
Erika Romero: SHE KISSES but there's just like a disconnect between, you know, my mom and I and I'm growing up. But you know, I never had a good relationship with my mom. It wasn't until I became an adult and

269
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:56.220
Erika Romero: And got my life together and on on track and stuff.

270
00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.470
Erika Romero: Her and I even started having a relationship and and so

271
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.620
Erika Romero: You know, it's just

272
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:14.280
Erika Romero: The way that I've learned how to deal with things negative the negative things in my life is by

273
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:24.450
Erika Romero: Being the opposite, you know and and doing the opposite, because I know how it makes me feel and I'm

274
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.170
Erika Romero: You know, always. I always say, I don't wanna

275
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:41.160
Erika Romero: I don't want somebody asked to feel that, you know, especially people that I care about people that I love that. I don't want them to feel that same way. So I try to be all those things for my granddaughter. I really do.

276
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:50.580
Erika Romero: But even at times because you know I didn't get that one. Uh, as, as I was growing up, I find myself, kind of, you know,

277
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.400
Erika Romero: I'm falling into that, you know, and then so I

278
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:06.300
Erika Romero: very vigilant and I tried to try to bring myself from that so that I don't fall continue to stay in that

279
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.580
Erika Romero: Box. But there are times where I find myself, you know, not

280
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:18.240
Erika Romero: Where I just, you know, kind of have that arm's length you know and and

281
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.470
Erika Romero: When so I guess that that's something that I really need me to work on.

282
00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:28.470
Dominique Pozo: What

283
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:41.670
Dominique Pozo: I've heard. I've heard you in the session, say, you know, you don't know what to do. And it sounds like you're doing it, Eric, I just want to reflect that back to you. It sounds like you are already doing things differently and

284
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.060
Erika Romero: They're yes what I see.

285
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:52.950
Erika Romero: I try. I'm, I'm trying. I really am because I go, or I don't want her down.

286
00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:06.810
Erika Romero: That same path and I don't want, I don't want her to be a disappointment. And I don't want to disappoint herself either, you know, because I know that when you go down to those that those that

287
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.490
Erika Romero: Pass. Yeah, you know,

288
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.340
Erika Romero: You become a disappointment to yourself, not just to other

289
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.180
Erika Romero: Definitely

290
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.210
Erika Romero: You know, and I don't want her to grow up that way either.

291
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:17.160
You know,

292
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.140
Erika Romero: Like I you know I don't know I guess I just worry about

293
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:28.050
Erika Romero: The repercussions of her arms axes, you know,

294
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.610
Erika Romero: In her life and in that those are the things that scare me.

295
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:49.080
Erika Romero: More than any more than anything that I do because I, you know, I try to be different for her and show her that she is valued, you know, and that she is loved and that sits there is people that care for her.

296
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:59.370
Erika Romero: Because eventually she's going to realize that her mother does it, you know. Yeah. And yeah, at some point in her life. So

297
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:03.090
Erika Romero: Anyway, that was helpful and I appreciate it.

298
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:08.640
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good. I'm so glad. Yeah, I think I, I just, I hope you're hearing

299
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:18.960
Dominique Pozo: It reflected back all the things I I see that you are doing, you know, and that you do know actually more that you do know, you know. Yeah.

300
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.920
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes, sometimes when we're so steeped in the process. It's hard to see, but someone from the outside can see

301
00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.010
Erika Romero: You see it. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it.

302
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:29.910
Erika Romero: Okay.

303
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:34.800
Dominique Pozo: All right, Eric. I'll see you in group next week and then let's see, I've got you in the calendar.

304
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.130
Dominique Pozo: Or do I hold on, let me see.

305
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:55.020
Dominique Pozo: I don't have you in the calendar, would you like to book something next week, or do you want to skip a week. How are you feeling. I feel like it's helpful to come weekly

306
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.160
Erika Romero: Um, we can skip a week and that's fine. I think

307
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.170
Erika Romero: I think I've gotten over the hump of this this week that

308
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:11.880
Erika Romero: I had to deal with. And I think I'm okay. But I mean, if I come across anything and I have a

309
00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:18.000
Erika Romero: You know, and I feel like I need, I need to get ahold of you or or whatever. I'll get ahold of you.

310
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.890
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so see

311
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.350
Erika Romero: Maybe can squeeze me and but i mean i think

312
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.000
Erika Romero: I think we'll be okay.

313
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:24.750
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

314
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.120
Dominique Pozo: So let's plan on the 27th and

315
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.630
Dominique Pozo: That would six o'clock, be a better time for you. Is that better with your

316
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.150
Erika Romero: Husband. Yeah, that would be much better.

317
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:41.160
Erika Romero: Okay, so let me know because it's just so close. You know what I mean, I don't want to. I don't want to leave you hanging like that, you know, I just want to make sure that it gives

318
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:49.890
Erika Romero: Everybody enough time in my husband doesn't have to rush home because he's just to stop by the pharmacy on the way home because I threw away my driver's license.

319
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.120
Dominique Pozo: Oh, no.

320
00:44:51.480 --> 00:45:02.940
Erika Romero: Yeah, Walgreens staples all those receipts to your bag. And I guess I must have thrown it away with, with all those receipts and of course the MVP is close so

321
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, my gosh.

322
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:12.780
Erika Romero: It's on Wednesday. So, you know, that gives that will give them some time to get that done before he gets on so six o'clock will be five.

323
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.100
Dominique Pozo: Six. On the 27th. Okay, great. Okay. All right. Bye bye.

324
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.630
Erika Romero: Good bye bye. Take care.
