20
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.870
Kiara ✌-: I don't know. I guess he was trying to, like, I don't know, like the word but trying to make me feel bad, or like

21
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.330
Kiara ✌-: Kind of forced me like make me feel obligated to definitely let him go and stuff like that.

22
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:53.340
Kiara ✌-: And so I was kind of like thinking about it and stuff like that. And for two days. I was like, kind of upset about it. I was just really quiet didn't really want to talk to him, and though the like the first couple days. Yeah, I was okay but then I think it was like on Wednesday. I told them.

23
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:07.890
Kiara ✌-: Actually, we don't hold on knows about two weeks ago when all this stuff was going down with him asking me at first it was kind of like a joke. And it was all playful, or whatever. And then on Monday is when he and because that weekend.

24
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.260
Kiara ✌-: We were like cleaning and stuff. And I was like writing down a list like I had another little list, we're all like, Okay, well, if you want to go to Michigan.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.010
Kiara ✌-: ride your bike all the way there, then, like, three things. And then on Monday is when he asked me.

26
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.940
Kiara ✌-: Because I told him, like I have a list. He didn't ask me over text, but then whenever we came home, he was doing the dishes and he's like, so what's the list about and I was like, there's three things that I would like you to

27
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:49.620
Kiara ✌-: Do, and I did say yes to the money, but not because I got wanna. I just want to hold on to the money or like buy stuff that I do want to buy because he buys a lot of stuffers motorcycle and

28
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:59.760
Kiara ✌-: Claire and he has like an IRA and I told him it like what the whole money thing. I'm like, it bothers me that you say that that your money. That's all your money. I don't care for make more money.

29
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:10.890
Kiara ✌-: Because like even this car that I'm driving he Yeah he worked in stuff like that. But I told him, like I hate how he a lot of stuff. He says, oh, that's mine This is mine.

30
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:21.090
Kiara ✌-: He does it say this is ours. You know, I told him, like with the Carl's like even though I drive the car and the car is for me. I still don't call it my car, I call it our car.

31
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:32.730
Kiara ✌-: Well, anytime I say if it's my cars like if I'm at work or with a friend. I'm like, Yeah, I'm gonna go out to my car. Like, that's when I say my car alley either say our car or the car.

32
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:44.790
Kiara ✌-: No, I brought that up to him, but the part that that the other two things was, you know, like, try to have sex with me more instead of saying, Oh, I'm tired because he doesn't work overtime anymore.

33
00:04:45.330 --> 00:05:01.560
Kiara ✌-: So with him, saying, Oh, I'm tired, he could, he could sleep for like 10 or 12 hours in a day and still be tired or even if he just got a regular eight hours of sleep. He still always tired or he just doesn't want to have sex with me. And then the last thing was is that I told him that

34
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:12.390
Kiara ✌-: I would like him to stop getting his Adderall. Because yeah, even though he gets a prescription for it and he doesn't take it like every single day or abuse or anything like that.

35
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:32.220
Kiara ✌-: And I told him like, it's like, like I don't know exactly if I should be mad or by shouldn't be mad like I'm overreacting over it but him like he basically said, Why should I have to stop taking my Adderall and I'm not the one who abuses a or like you do and

36
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:44.460
Kiara ✌-: He basically tried to make it sound because like I said it's disrespectful. I feel like it's disrespectful that you won't say that you'll start getting your Adderall and

37
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.480
Kiara ✌-: Like, I don't know, he kind of like turned it on. To me, I think, in a way, like, I don't know how to really describe it, but

38
00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:03.030
Kiara ✌-: I just wish he wouldn't get it. He thinks like I got my Adderall. And he's like, oh, I want some at all. I told I was like, I'm not going to give me my Adderall, because it actually really helps me, like, ever since I was a kid.

39
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:19.890
Kiara ✌-: I was never really treated for it until I became obviously became just like within the last year or so that's whenever I was like okay I work in a call center and it's very, very bad but like my whole life. I've always just dealt with it. And you know, it's just whatever

40
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:32.700
Kiara ✌-: But then he was like, well, I'm just going to go to my doctor and then just get some Adderall. And I was just like five or whatever. Do whatever you want to do, and he does have like a smaller dose than what I used to have.

41
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:42.810
Kiara ✌-: I just wish he wouldn't take it because he doesn't actually need it, but he's, he says, well, when I take it, it actually does help me focus and that are that are that are like

42
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:53.910
Kiara ✌-: Like, I don't know, like I just don't feel like he needs it, and he like his doctor his main doctor is kind of considered like the candy, man.

43
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.650
Kiara ✌-: You know, like he feel good about pills and stuff like that and

44
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.090
Kiara ✌-: He I got a Jolly Rancher my mouth and it's like it's making

45
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.830
Kiara ✌-: A lottery. So my that

46
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.500
Kiara ✌-: I'm going to take it out home.

47
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.460
Kiara ✌-: So,

48
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.970
Kiara ✌-: With the Adderall. He said, like with Adderall. Whenever I asked my doctor about it. He's like, okay, I'll give you the first dose.

49
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.530
Kiara ✌-: And then after that you have to go not first dose, but the first month and then you have to go see psychiatrists for it. And, you know, they'll be able to

50
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:44.970
Kiara ✌-: Test you and then you know continue your prescriptions and stuff like that. Well, with my husband's doctor, he doesn't do that you just build it for him every month and then like once every six months, he comes in and takes a pee test and then he's good, but

51
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.260
Kiara ✌-: I just like I was just kind of like stuck because like I don't know if I'm being selfish myself.

52
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.730
Kiara ✌-: Or I just feel like I'm disrespected, and for like two old days, like that's what I was just really upset. I didn't want to talk to

53
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:17.280
Kiara ✌-: And it was kind of like a fight, and I was just like he said that he will love you and I just kind of like ignored it or I said okay, or something like that and not because the mall because I felt like he just disrespected me in a way and I tried to tell him because like

54
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:34.470
Kiara ✌-: After we had Kilian MY HUSBAND, HE HAS dad gave him like one like an Oracle or whatever. And that was like whenever I was like trying to stop and everything. And I was like, is disrespectful for you to just take like an oracle right in front of my face when you know I have problems and

55
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:42.360
Kiara ✌-: He like understood that he's like, okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that kind of thing. But now that he has that are all who takes out all the time.

56
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:49.500
Kiara ✌-: You know, like every day and he tries to say, Oh, well I don't take it you know every single day. I only really take it all work days and

57
00:08:49.920 --> 00:09:00.090
Kiara ✌-: I even, you know, give a couple to Danny, you know, here and there and stuff. And I tell her, like, you know, technically supposed to give that stuff away. Anyways, we're sell it or whatever because he even said that he's like well

58
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:08.610
Kiara ✌-: I'll still get it, but maybe I'll just sell it. And that's where I tour. Like, you shouldn't be doing that either, because if you get caught. And you could probably like something serious can really happen.

59
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:21.840
Kiara ✌-: Definitely get to take it away from you, for sure, but you never know. Like, somebody could either rat you out or you can go to jail or, you know, I don't know exactly what the repercussions for that are but you know I look

60
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:29.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have a struggle with him taking it does, it does trigger you want to wanting to take it.

61
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.450
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, like, I mean, I wish that I could take it because even though I've never gotten like high or anything off of Adderall.

62
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:44.250
Kiara ✌-: I still wish that I could take medicine, just like Adderall itself that actually does help me.

63
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:54.630
Kiara ✌-: But he takes it. I feel like he doesn't really need it, but I guess it is kind of like a trigger. And I, I kind of try to explain to him that, but

64
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.270
Kiara ✌-: Like he he's still turns it around on me and thinks that like I abused it because

65
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:11.250
Kiara ✌-: Like, yes I do that like and what like Dr. Alan Jackson was wasn't hurt. No, sorry, it was Dr. Kurtz. The lady with the interview when I told her I was like yeah I typically

66
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:26.400
Kiara ✌-: Like I said that I technically I've used it, but I didn't like take like three, four or five, like, you know, I wasn't doing it like I was doing with the narcos and all the painkillers. It was more of like I would just take like one extra because it actually worked better that way.

67
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you what you what I hear that you're saying

68
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.310
Kiara ✌-: I hate

69
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a therapy thing, but is that you took it and your dose probably needed to be adjusted.

70
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it wasn't

71
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so when you took that extra dose.

72
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got the effects from it that you needed. Yeah.

73
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:52.920
Kiara ✌-: But whenever I tried to tell the psychiatrist that I wanted to go, you know, I think that I should be adjusted more

74
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.960
Kiara ✌-: She told me, Well, you should you like you don't just get used to the medication.

75
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:06.690
Kiara ✌-: And then need to be bumped up, you know, kind of like with, you know, pain medicine like your body gets used to it and then you go up a dose or whatever. But I guess with Adderall.

76
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:13.860
Kiara ✌-: That doesn't happen. But the thing is is that anytime. When I start off on like other medications and stuff. I always like to start off small

77
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.960
Kiara ✌-: And then I like to work myself up.

78
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:24.030
Kiara ✌-: And where I was at. I was like, yeah, it works, but it's not like it was it was definitely working like okay

79
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:30.780
Kiara ✌-: That was good. It was more of like I was like yeah this is fine, you know, but it wasn't like the best right

80
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.040
Kiara ✌-: So, so

81
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then do you feel that you were abusing it in that manner.

82
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:46.980
Kiara ✌-: Well that see that was the thing is like I was kind of confused because I didn't feel like I was abusing it. Sorry, like I was saying, so like I take took multiple of it never gotten high off of it ever like how people

83
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:54.750
Kiara ✌-: That's what I don't understand what people say oh yeah I take Adderall and like people stay up and they feel like super happy off of it and stuff.

84
00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:05.130
Kiara ✌-: Like I've never felt that ever off of that role. And then when I told the psychiatrists that I was like, Yeah, I didn't tell you that I was taking double the amount because I want her to take it away from me.

85
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:11.730
Kiara ✌-: But I told her, when I was first taking. I was like, I can tell that this is like actually really helping because it's not like I feel

86
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:22.500
Kiara ✌-: Higher loopy off of it when I take Adderall. Not only did it calmed me down a lot. I can actually focus and like gather myself when memory was getting better. I wasn't for getting stuff.

87
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.720
Kiara ✌-: But

88
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.980
Kiara ✌-: Talk about memory.

89
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So why did you quit taking it.

90
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:40.680
Kiara ✌-: Because right guy was getting it through my regular psychiatry just, you know, through my regular doctors, you know, place.

91
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:48.330
Kiara ✌-: And my doctor whenever he basically caught me or found out about like my abuse. He's like, I'm about to tell your psychiatrists

92
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.280
Kiara ✌-: So I said, Okay, fine. And then after that, because my psychiatry, she was kind of like

93
00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:04.560
Kiara ✌-: She was like, intimidating, even though she seemed kind of like nice, I could just she she just gave me like a weird vibe that I could just tell her. Tell that she was like, kind of like a bitch deep down inside. You know, so

94
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.130
Kiara ✌-: After that, when she found out I was like, I don't want to

95
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.550
Kiara ✌-: I don't want to see her talk to her ever getting kind of thing so

96
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.080
Kiara ✌-: At that point, because it's considered I guess like the

97
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:27.450
Kiara ✌-: Controlled substance or whatever else, like, okay, I'm not going to take it kind of thing. And when we were talking to when I was talking to, what's his name again Moser for his

98
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:28.290
Kiara ✌-: First name.

99
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Dr. Master

100
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.190
Kiara ✌-: And NASA. There we go.

101
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.750
Kiara ✌-: So when I was talking to him. He's like, Okay, first will because

102
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.350
Kiara ✌-: You know, like all the things that I have, like, of course, addiction is number one.

103
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.070
Kiara ✌-: Mm hmm. And then like if because I had marked off over like

104
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:52.800
Kiara ✌-: You know, depression, anxiety, bipolar and then they Adderall. Like he basically wanted to work on one thing with treatment wise.

105
00:13:53.190 --> 00:14:06.420
Kiara ✌-: So first, like if I had my anxiety and my depression. That would be kind of like obviously the substance thing would be the first thing. And then my depression, anxiety, and then basically last thing on the list would have been, you know, my ADHD.

106
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.250
Kiara ✌-: Anything, so he's like, I don't want to treat anything for that until we get everything else sorted

107
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:24.570
Kiara ✌-: Kind of thing and even my husband, he's like, why don't you still get your outer on like because they basically kind of took it away from me and I'd have to go through my psychiatrist again over there and like I don't want to see her again. And, you know,

108
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.080
Kiara ✌-: You can't

109
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why don't you ask Dr. Our DAG about it.

110
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.460
Kiara ✌-: I was

111
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:48.540
Kiara ✌-: Thinking about it. Yeah, I was gonna, I was thinking about that because I know she's, she's like more open to it and I've been, you know, like today's by former or know yesterday was my four month so and I feel like even with my my Suboxone even though you don't get half of that or anything.

112
00:14:49.050 --> 00:15:02.940
Kiara ✌-: And and of course what the Adderall. Definitely don't get half that either, but I feel like I'm in a good place where I'm like, Okay, I don't, I don't have any depression. Well, I mean like sometimes I might go through like little spells, but I don't really call that depression.

113
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.610
Kiara ✌-: My anxiety and stuff like that.

114
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:24.840
Kiara ✌-: I don't. The only time I really have anxiety is whenever I wake up from those crazy ass dreams and I feel a little bit anxious and stuff, but I don't have like full blown panic attacks, out of nowhere like I used to. And I think the reason why I had such bad anxiety back then was because

115
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.890
Kiara ✌-: Of, you know, because I was taking so many, so many Narcos and then when I wouldn't take it. I feel very anxious and

116
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

117
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:45.810
Kiara ✌-: It would do all that stuff. And with the bipolar I was talking to Dr. Kurtz with a lady who's doing the interview or the podcast. She I told her about that.

118
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:51.300
Kiara ✌-: And she basically said that she like truly believes that when people who are

119
00:15:52.860 --> 00:16:01.830
Kiara ✌-: Like, or people who have addictions. There's always like a kind of like an underlying like there's some type of like mental

120
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:10.020
Kiara ✌-: Mental thing behind it and she said, I don't know if it's good or bad or not, but she said she would take the bipolar stuff off because

121
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:18.510
Kiara ✌-: Usually, like when you're, you know, on drugs and stuff like that, you're, you're usually up and down like all the time because

122
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.170
Kiara ✌-: You know whether you have the drugs or if you don't have the drugs and

123
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:31.260
Kiara ✌-: If you really looked at it, the times that I was up in always happy is when I was on drugs. And then when I wasn't on drugs like when I go through withdrawals for a few days.

124
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:39.060
Kiara ✌-: Because I didn't have any money to get my supply that's what I'd be in my deep, deep blows and feel depressed and stuff like that so

125
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:51.270
Kiara ✌-: She took that off for me for my record because I said like I asked her, I was just like, I really wish I could you know have that taken off my record and she's like, I could do that for you. And then she told me all that stuff. So

126
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:59.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's really, really good because you can't really gauge any kind of mental health until after you get substance abuse under control.

127
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.020
Kiara ✌-: Right. Yes. And

128
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then it takes a while for your body and your mind to start functioning normally

129
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, when you're diagnosed, whether you're in 30 and you see this all the time with 30 day rehabs people get diagnosed with these things and then six months after they get clean and sober and their heads coming together and they're

130
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, everything is aligned. All of a sudden, they don't have those same symptoms anymore, but they are still being treated and

131
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's in their chart.

132
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As they have this diagnosis. And so, you know, I'm glad she took it off because here's the thing, you know, if you aren't technically bipolar. You don't want to be labeled with that.

133
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly. Oh.

134
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.460
Kiara ✌-: My thing is something happens to me or if I'm in the hospital and for whatever type of reason. I don't want them to be like, oh, she's bipolar because

135
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:56.670
Kiara ✌-: Especially with people who are bipolar. There's always some stigma around it, where ya know she's she has to be freaking crazy out of her mind or something, you know, but it's

136
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My bad, or is it seems like so many people are diagnosed bipolar with bipolar.

137
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:15.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, that's the Go To anymore. You know what I mean to go to diagnosis. When technically you really don't know it can't see what is actually going on until you have a little bit of time under your belt. You know what I mean.

138
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.350
Kiara ✌-: Yeah.

139
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would encourage you, you know, especially since you know it sounds to me like here, you didn't abuse it.

140
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:37.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean that, and you can explain this to Dr. Ellen died that you were on it. You started treatment, you know, the last dr, dr Nasser said he wanted to wait till you were stable in your program your stable and your program. And now you would like to revisit this piece.

141
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, set up a meeting with her and see

142
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:55.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, if it's if your husband is it ABUSING IT AND HE IS TAKING IT LIKE HE'S LIKE HE SAYS HE IS myself. What I would suggest is that you leave him just leave them be

143
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really focus on your own ADHD.

144
00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.520
Right.

145
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no reason why you can't. Yeah, you're an addict, you're addicted to opiates. Right. Yeah. But that doesn't mean that you can't still utilize these medications to help you with your ADHD. You know what I mean.

146
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that would be what I would say, you know, work, work your program around your stuff. If he hasn't abused it and he doesn't show signs of being an addict and abusing them like if you see him taking four or five a day. You see, have taken two and three a day staying up for nights on in

147
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would have huge concerns at that point myself.

148
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.030
Kiara ✌-: First, I was kind of like upset and then

149
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:47.910
Kiara ✌-: You know as like the days went by, like, I know that I usually have a tendency to overreact at them in the moment type of thing. Sure. And that's kind of

150
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.490
Kiara ✌-: Usually why I kind of stay quiet.

151
00:19:50.760 --> 00:20:03.630
Kiara ✌-: Because like will like back in the day, like whenever I was a kid, I would just blow up like with my ex. I was just, it didn't matter what it was. I would just throw a fit. And then a couple days later, I'm like, wow, I was acting pretty crazy or

152
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:11.730
Kiara ✌-: I shouldn't have overreact and stuff. So like, and then whenever it happened, I was thinking I was like a kind of want to talk to you because I know that

153
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:23.190
Kiara ✌-: Like I wanted to talk to somebody to kind of like, you know, be like no care sorry but you're not wrong. But, you know, kind of like what you said. Like if he's not abusing it and stuff, then

154
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:30.780
Kiara ✌-: You know, kind of, let him be but if he's RC overtaking it or something, then you know then be concerned. But I'd kind of

155
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:40.770
Kiara ✌-: Like over the days I've kind of slowly kind of been thinking that, but I, that's why I haven't like reached out and like I need to talk to Rebecca, like right now kind of thing.

156
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:57.990
Kiara ✌-: Because I kind of slowly started to realize that he's not really abusing it and stuff. And I was thinking, like, I'm kind of being selfish for wanting him to stop because of me even though he's not abusing it kind of thing. But, you know,

157
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If he's been if he's got it from a, from a doctor and he has the diagnosis to back it up and it helps him. You know what I mean.

158
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:08.520
Yeah.

159
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would just tell him you know if you start abusing it. Then we're going to have some issues we're going to have to revisit it. Wait, I was trying to pull up your chart. I want to pull up your chart to see if you had that in there. Hold on one second. I want to see if you can

160
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hear

161
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.000
Kiara ✌-: Your kind of choppy your screen is frozen.

162
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm here in an area. Can you hear me now.

163
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.130
Kiara ✌-: I think so. Okay, you

164
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.240
Kiara ✌-: Hear me now come back.

165
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.740
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, hear me now.

166
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.610
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, I can hear your pictures. Just a little frozen, but that's okay.

167
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me, how do you spell your last name.

168
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.700
Kiara ✌-: Oh apostrophe and

169
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.270
Oh,

170
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.250
Kiara ✌-: Okay. Oh, and he I ll

171
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.550
Kiara ✌-: And then hyphen domingo's

172
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.220
Kiara ✌-: Do you mean spot at to

173
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on, let me get that piece.

174
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Domingos the M.

175
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I N

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.530
Kiara ✌-: G you easy

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay i a RA.

178
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.690
Yes.

179
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think they just have you either. I think they have just under two new guys

180
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:52.980
Kiara ✌-: Because I know some places they either have me just under O'Neill, or just domain guys or the whole thing or no apostrophe no hyphen like

181
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:53.850
Kiara ✌-: Well, I

182
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.350
Am confusing.

183
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:57.810
Kiara ✌-: Yeah.

184
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.360
Kiara ✌-: I went from like one of the most simple last name, I

185
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.800
Made a name is more

186
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, you did. Is this your husband's last name.

187
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.580
Kiara ✌-: O'Neill yummy. Yeah, the whole thing.

188
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, let me see what they've got you diagnose says exactly. Yep. They got you used to take Adderall. But state stop do too.

189
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want to see this.

190
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One.

191
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, let's see.

192
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: inside us to take out a robot stop due to a noticeable effect. Okay, so

193
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would definitely and I'll shoot her an email.

194
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About having maybe setting you up a you know a med review appointment with her so that you can talk about it.

195
00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:06.780
Kiara ✌-: Okay. And I know when probably the Adderall. She might want me to set up a psychiatrist with bright heart because I think she doesn't have access to or she doesn't have

196
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:20.790
Kiara ✌-: Like her. I don't know her whole licensing like I know whenever she first started, there were certain medications, where she's like, okay, yeah. To see psychiatrists for that. So I don't know if Adderall would be kind of under the same thing. I'm not sure. So

197
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:32.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. That would definitely I'll find out. I'll email her and asked her, you know about it. And if it's something that she's willing to evaluate with you because it's in your chart that you you know that you do have it.

198
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that you were taking the medication for but you

199
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The exact wording that he put in there was that you didn't feel any effects from it.

200
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:49.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it, which is, you know, which is awesome because then you can reevaluate it with her. And if you have to get an appointment with one of our psychiatry. So that's totally cool.

201
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And then there, they would definitely work with you as far as the amount

202
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And adjusting it until it does what it's supposed to do like

203
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Would be normal. I mean, we did you do that on Suboxone to right yeah you're just IT YOU GO UP UNTIL IT DOES THE has the desired effect.

204
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:16.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, it would seem that it would be the same exact way with any other

205
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, medication. So

206
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, let's focus. Let's focus on getting your stuff. Right. Right. And just kind of take it from there, you know,

207
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think

208
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.460
Kiara ✌-: That sounds good.

209
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what did you you came to the conclusion that you were gonna let him take the bike ride.

210
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:47.160
Kiara ✌-: And yeah, like he's going to be gone for two whole weeks. And that was another thing that kind of like upset me is because I was like

211
00:25:48.390 --> 00:26:01.980
Kiara ✌-: Again, me being selfish. I'm like, I gotta wake up early and I gotta you know drop them off drop, you know, killing off, you know, a daycare and like normally I told my husband because he usually picks them up and drop them off at daycare.

212
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:16.560
Kiara ✌-: Every day, and whenever he works late or, you know, does whatever then have like a or if he asked me if he wants to ride his bike home, or two, or whatever, then, oh, drop them off or pick them up or whatever.

213
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:25.470
Kiara ✌-: But I always tell him, I was like, if anything, I really don't like dropping them off in the morning because he's always a butthead in the morning.

214
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:37.320
Kiara ✌-: And He always wants his daddy and I'm always late to work. Anyways, so it's like usually like I might be like a couple minutes late to work, but then whenever I have to drop killing off. He

215
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:46.050
Kiara ✌-: Doesn't want me to go after I drop them off and it just always makes me late like I'm always between, like, five to 15 minutes late, every day and

216
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:57.870
Kiara ✌-: Even then, my boss is fine with it. And then one of the other MSA is who is kind of like a lead. She's very she's very controlling and bossy, you know, she's basically like a supervisor, but she's not really

217
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:09.720
Kiara ✌-: But she's okay with it because with her. It's like, as long as it's like family related or a real emergency like if you don't have any kids and you're just late all the time, then

218
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:21.090
Kiara ✌-: She can be crap for it, but she's okay with it. But then other people will start to go to my supervisor or her and be like, Why is she always late. Why does KR get to start at this time and feminine so

219
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:36.150
Kiara ✌-: It's always it always creates that kind of friction type of thing with other people at work. And another thing about work is we have a new gal start there. I actually used to work with her at the call center. I don't know if I told you this or not but

220
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:47.250
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, we used to work at the call center together. She started like maybe a few weeks or a month after I did. And we've become a lot more

221
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:53.460
Kiara ✌-: Close, I guess. And, you know, we're kind of like on the same page because I told her, when she first started, I was like,

222
00:27:54.090 --> 00:28:05.880
Kiara ✌-: Trying to be negative or try to be gossipy but I'm just like, know that what I've noticed is that when you're like the newbie of the group. They kind of they kind of treat you like shit, or they make you feel bad.

223
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.440
Kiara ✌-: And because like

224
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:16.560
Kiara ✌-: I noticed that with me. And at first I thought I was kind of overreacting, or just being sensitive and stuff. And I might have been extra sensitive about it because of my I feel like

225
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.190
Kiara ✌-: Through this whole process of being like, like recovering and stuff like that for my addiction and stuff.

226
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:36.120
Kiara ✌-: And I've had to feel my feelings in real life, instead of having to cover them up and you know smother them with drugs, all the time. And because I used to just be like, I don't fucking care what you think about me like I do.

227
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.790
Kiara ✌-: Whatever I want and done at it and now it's like, I don't

228
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:53.970
Kiara ✌-: Have that you know the drug blanket to cover me up to hold in my feelings or prevent things from affecting me and now you know it does. But does whatever anyways but then a new guy. He started

229
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:08.820
Kiara ✌-: Like a couple of months ago and I saw that. I saw like what they did with me. But what they did with him and they kind of treated him and they kind of talk shit about him when he wasn't around or even to his face like he'd be sitting on the other side of the room and

230
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:21.000
Kiara ✌-: You know, they would be all like, well, he doesn't do this or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, I knew it, I knew that I wasn't like completely crazy and then the same thing with her name is Susie. She's like,

231
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:40.680
Kiara ✌-: She was she's a veteran. So she's, she's like, I'm a lot more tough, but she also doesn't take shit so she definitely notices things and she realizes, and she's not really like the feeling type of person, but she she gets what people are like insinuating things and stuff like that so

232
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.810
Kiara ✌-: Last Friday.

233
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.610
Kiara ✌-: We did, and

234
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.490
Kiara ✌-: That was the thing is like I felt like karma hit me because

235
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:59.670
Kiara ✌-: Me and Susie, we were the best ones left and everybody else left and I stayed a little bit late because I came in late, of course, and

236
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:10.020
Kiara ✌-: That was the night that my son cut his finger open and broke the tip of his finger. And I was like, if I wasn't talking shit and that probably wouldn't have happened to him if I would have just got off.

237
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:20.220
Kiara ✌-: A few minutes late, then it would have been fine but I got off like 40 minutes late. So if I wasn't yeah reacting my well that would have probably never happened. But I can't really

238
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:31.980
Kiara ✌-: Go back into the future and fix things. But she but the conversations that we were having she's just like, yeah, they like when I do my there, you know, my group therapy appointments with you guys.

239
00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.030
Kiara ✌-: And

240
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.440
Kiara ✌-: I guess last or the beginning or not. This week it was last week.

241
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:48.300
Kiara ✌-: They were all like, does anybody know work, er, Wayne. What is she coming back like just asking a whole bunch of questions. It's like, what I'm doing is none of your damn business and

242
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:54.390
Kiara ✌-: My supervisor knows what I'm doing. He knows not like my full story, but he knows about my story.

243
00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.330
Kiara ✌-: And he knows where I'm doing. And that's all that technically really matters. And even then, I shouldn't

244
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:07.200
Kiara ✌-: EVEN BEEN, LIKE, I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE HIM details, but I do just to kind of make it a little bit, you know, kind of, let me do my thing.

245
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:20.010
Kiara ✌-: My and I put my time in I'm using my leave. So it's not like I'm doing it for free or just using my lunchtime, or whatever I do I use part of my lunchtime, but we normally

246
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:29.040
Kiara ✌-: Have an hour lunch break, because we take all of our breaks at once, just to get it out of the way and be done with it. And also, just because it's nice to have an hour lunch.

247
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.120
And

248
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:42.540
Kiara ✌-: But for Mondays. I go from pretty much 930 to a little past 11 whenever we're done is 930 at to make sure I check in and get in time. And then we could start at 10

249
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:53.340
Kiara ✌-: So, um, how I put my time in is I pretty much just take an hour off from work, but then I still take a 30 minute lunch, but then I don't take my last

250
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.320
Kiara ✌-: That you know i i should be getting anyways but

251
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:02.550
Kiara ✌-: I don't take those 15th, because I know if I do go on my 15

252
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:16.290
Kiara ✌-: People will talk shit and, like, say, well, how come she needs to take a break. She already went to, you know, she's already gone for an hour and a half. Like, that's how they are. They're like, they don't say it, but they do tell my my supervisor.

253
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.510
Kiara ✌-: And it's like they're trying to get me in trouble, kind of thing. And it's like, it's like

254
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.400
Kiara ✌-: Another business school. Yeah.

255
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:36.480
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, exactly. And that's what I told my supervisor. I was like, it's nobody's business what I'm doing. I'm like, you see how I put my time in I'm cleaning my time and using my time up the way that you know

256
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:45.240
Kiara ✌-: It like typically I'm still get paid for it because it's paid time off, but I usually use like sick leave for like my appointments and stuff and then

257
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.040
Kiara ✌-: You know, so

258
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:56.250
Kiara ✌-: Like me and Susie with our conversations and stuff like that. She's like, I know they're probably talking shit about me whenever I'm not around, and

259
00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:09.180
Kiara ✌-: I'm like, Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do too. And I told her I was like, Well honestly when you're not around Susie. I was like, I don't hear any I don't hear them really talk about you or insinuate anything

260
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:17.250
Kiara ✌-: And she's like, Yeah, they probably don't. Same thing, because we talk and we're like friends and stuff.

261
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:28.350
Kiara ✌-: And and and that's whenever she told me about me where that head lady. Her name is Monica. She's very controlling I'm pretty. I don't want to like assume anything but

262
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:38.910
Kiara ✌-: I feel like she's on something, because the way that she acts and I don't know she's kind of shaky, and she really insane pregnancy rates. She

263
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.980
Kiara ✌-: And then she gets her words and she's crazy

264
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.760
Kiara ✌-: Obviously, assuming you're

265
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:56.580
Kiara ✌-: Right, because like she just the way that she acts and I think I told you is I don't know weeks ago, but my boss was walking out

266
00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:06.480
Kiara ✌-: While he was still working there because now he works from home right now because his health and she pretty much asked my boss. She's like, You want to Norco john

267
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:15.690
Kiara ✌-: Like just offer them a frickin Norco and I'm like, What the hell is this a candy shop like she just offered him one. And I'm like really wish I could just

268
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.450
Kiara ✌-: Write like like just say something to her, but obviously I can't, I will

269
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:28.020
Kiara ✌-: But I don't know it's just like it's kind of like when you see one, you know, one type of thing.

270
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's the great part about

271
00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:37.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the great part about what we have to deal with, is it gives us like this. Extra Sensory

272
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know what I mean a weekend tell somebody that has been using or is sober or struggling with using

273
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can tell it like right off the bat. It's kind of amazing.

274
00:34:50.910 --> 00:35:00.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like an Extra Sensory is what I call it. We have the extra sense because she always because like whenever I took Norco and stuff. I feel like I was probably will.

275
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:11.370
Kiara ✌-: I don't know if I was kind of technically allergic to them because it would make my noses. It would make you know I would just always feel really itchy. So I don't. That was considered an allergic reaction, but

276
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:19.050
Kiara ✌-: Of course, when I would look on Google or something about being itchy from it. I think it could also just be because it's an opiate and

277
00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:24.690
Kiara ✌-: I think that just naturally already does that. But then again, I think so. I didn't know if it was technically a side effect.

278
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:37.560
Kiara ✌-: Or like an allergic reaction kind of thing, but she had always like it's her nose. Your nose nose is always read. She says that her back is always itchy. And that was, like, one of the things with me, too, is like

279
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:49.680
Kiara ✌-: Always like in the middle of my back, like where my spine is it would always be edgy and she's like, Man, my back is always so itchy all the time. Oh my. Oh, I wonder why. But again, that's

280
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.180
Kiara ✌-: Funny but

281
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I, you know, I've definitely heard or seen

282
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.080
Kiara ✌-: Or witness

283
00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:01.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, or even felt when I've been on opioids in the past that knows just for some reason, but

284
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The back is new. I haven't heard of that before. So it could be that could be a real allergic reaction to it. Or it could just be

285
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, an effect from it. I just sent her an email. The doctor telling her that you would like to

286
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have evaluate medication and I kind of gave her a little bit of history that you and Dr. NASA talked about it in the beginning.

287
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But he wanted you to

288
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get stable in the program. First you're stable in the program. Is it something that she can handle or do I need to get you an appointment with a psychiatry, one of our psychiatrists, so I'm just kind of waiting for her response. So she has an idea, you know on what

289
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're looking for, you know what it is. And definitely, if you're struggling with concentration and staying focused on what you need to do carry you know have that diagnosis.

290
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.490
Kiara ✌-: Who

291
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:04.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you feel that you can benefit from it and you're not going to abuse it, which is a good thing for you and your husband to really utilize keeping each other accountable for it.

292
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. It's another way to connect with him.

293
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

294
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:20.550
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, cuz he did ask me. He's like, how come you know how come you don't get your at all anymore. And I told him I was like, I basically lost it whenever I

295
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:33.900
Kiara ✌-: You know, whenever my doctor found out. So, you know, I just told him that I can't get it anymore. Kind of thing but he does things like he does kind of like some every once while he kind of throws it out like

296
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:38.130
Kiara ✌-: You need to take your Adderall. But I mean even like within the last four months, but he

297
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:50.310
Kiara ✌-: And he has like asked why and I was just like, and I like in before like the past like week or two, or whatever or the last week, you'd always asked me like

298
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.210
Kiara ✌-: If I've taken my Adderall or

299
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.940
Kiara ✌-: You really need to take like an Adderall or something because I just be all over the place.

300
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

301
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:08.700
Kiara ✌-: A lot of the time, like my, like, I could say something like, sometimes it's kind of almost like a job like he tells me that my memory.

302
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:15.600
Kiara ✌-: Is horrible like will be like, he'll say something or always saying something, and either

303
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.920
Kiara ✌-: He will be like, What did you say, and I'm like, I literally forgot. Like, I've always thought I just had like a horrible memory problems stuff.

304
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:36.240
Kiara ✌-: Which I think I still probably do. But even like when I do stuff. I do like multiple projects at once. I can't stay with one thing at a time like I start stuff and then I lose stuff. And then same thing like

305
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:42.660
Kiara ✌-: Like what my psychiatrist did tell me is like, usually people not usually but

306
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:59.220
Kiara ✌-: I guess when people who have like ADHD or a DD even like in their relationships. They like to kind of like bounce around or they they can't stay in a relationship because they want something new and because like she I think she knows I can't remember.

307
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:12.840
Kiara ✌-: About how like with me like cheating on my husband, like, it's like I love my husband. I know he's a good guy. He's obviously the father to my son and all that kind of stuff. But there are times where I'm like, I wish I could just, you know, like

308
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.990
Kiara ✌-: You know either have a new boyfriend or a husband or mostly like a boyfriend kind of thing.

309
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:28.050
Kiara ✌-: But, and then, of course, in the last like 10 years I've talked to, like many, many guys and then like once I'm, you know, to a certain point, like board.

310
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.390
Kiara ✌-: You know onto a new guy, you know, even though I have a guy sitting at home for me but

311
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:43.920
Kiara ✌-: He he lacks in a lot of stuff. And that's what but in the past like it pretty much ever since I've been clean. I haven't. I don't really talk to anybody. I mean, I

312
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:49.020
Kiara ✌-: There's this one guy that I talked to you that I have had sex with, but I don't

313
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:59.010
Kiara ✌-: Like I tell him I'm like I'm doing good in my relationship and stuff. He knows about my addiction and he's the guy that I met from a when I was first going and

314
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:06.450
Kiara ✌-: I just told her I was like, I don't like you obviously wants to meet up with me to like have sex rule stuff. I'm like, I don't, I don't want to do that anymore, kind of thing.

315
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:20.940
Kiara ✌-: So, you know, the way I see it is like me cheating and stuff like that with him. I know that I'm like clean and stuff. I feel like I don't want to blame my addiction, for me, cheating. But I feel like it's

316
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:28.920
Kiara ✌-: Possibly like that was a different me that made that decision I i'm not sure if that's right or wrong.

317
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: risky behaviors. It's part of addiction, you know, we do things that we wouldn't normally do when we're sober. Yeah. You know what I mean.

318
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you could. And you know what I know is that if you feel that your marriage is worth

319
00:40:46.920 --> 00:41:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your loyalty. It's also worth the work to put in to make it better. You know what I mean, on both sides, you know. Yeah, definitely. I think that that's part of the problem today so many people are ready to jump and run and not

320
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:06.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tough out

321
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.370
Kiara ✌-: Yeah.

322
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like a next

323
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:16.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Figure someone else and then we go and we find somebody else and they're worse than the ones we just got rid of

324
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.130
Kiara ✌-: Yeah.

325
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, makes

326
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.840
Kiara ✌-: And I definitely feel like with today's generation.

327
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:28.170
Kiara ✌-: Especially the people are younger than me, because I'm starting to get old, you know,

328
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:41.130
Kiara ✌-: 30 Mark like whoa, you're so old, but I feel like, you know, the kids are young adults that you know between like there. Well, I would say probably pretty much from like 17 to about like 25 or so.

329
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:49.140
Kiara ✌-: They're also like, I don't want to be married. Well, I guess I probably even need to like I have a lot of like people who I was with in high school, but people

330
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:59.190
Kiara ✌-: Like, I guess, friends or people who I went to high school with that. They either don't want kids, or they don't want marriage, like they don't want any of that stuff so

331
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:09.900
Kiara ✌-: I do feel like they're like this, today's generation, I guess, is not, they don't want to settle down or be married or have kids and stuff so

332
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, because they've had to live through their the previous generations mess up.

333
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they see what's the sense of that piece of paper. You know what I mean. And

334
00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:29.190
Kiara ✌-: I mean, I do admit whenever I was younger. Before I met my husband. I didn't want to be married.

335
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.420
Kiara ✌-: Didn't want to have kids.

336
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.580
Kiara ✌-: I mean, I did want to have a kid, but I only wanted to see what the kids look like. Like, how much

337
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:41.430
Kiara ✌-: Like me, but that was the only real reason and it wasn't technically a logical I guess reason so

338
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what you get.

339
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.660
Kiara ✌-: I got a

340
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:46.770
Kiara ✌-: Baby so

341
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Isn't that funny.

342
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I do feel like I got

343
00:42:52.260 --> 00:43:02.550
Kiara ✌-: Pretty lucky I kind of say, in a way, because even though I feel like like you take some, you lose some kind of thing, like, yeah. He's technically a good guy.

344
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:14.070
Kiara ✌-: He makes money and he puts up a lot of my shit and spoils me in a way, and he gives me what I want. I could still kind of treat him like shit. And he's still very calm about it.

345
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:24.210
Kiara ✌-: I mean, it kind of he's kind of like stood up more and more like throughout the years and stuff like whenever I start acting up or something, he kind of called me out on it or says like

346
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:32.010
Kiara ✌-: And that's kinda like where the name calling you know comes in, like, Oh, you're such a bitch all the time and you're kind of, you know, that is that a de

347
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:46.110
Kiara ✌-: And like the big part I'm like that just rolls off of me because I'm like that's like nothing but I don't. And like I even hate seeing the word count, but I just don't, I don't like that word. I feel like that's like really

348
00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:51.420
Kiara ✌-: Derogatory or it's like really really negative. You know, it's like worse than a bitch.

349
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.710
Kiara ✌-: Ya know, so I don't appreciate really being called that. That offends me

350
00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:01.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's true defend you definitely you know that that is a very bad words.

351
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:02.700
Kiara ✌-: Yeah.

352
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:08.460
Kiara ✌-: I don't like it. I don't even like that. And I definitely can't even say the P word, you know, the female part I

353
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.690
Kiara ✌-: Can't stand that word.

354
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:11.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

355
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:29.100
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, very derogatory and then even like it sounds weird when I tell people I hate when it's like my husband will say it to me too. And I hate being called a woman like calm down. Women are getting the kitchen woman or, you know, like I just don't like the word

356
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:40.200
Kiara ✌-: Or when people call me women, whether it's like to be kind of like jokingly, or whatever. But even like when they say man or women I

357
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:47.310
Kiara ✌-: Don't know. I just don't like being called a woman like if I seemed like if I were to, like, say, what kind of gender, I guess that I am

358
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:58.770
Kiara ✌-: I mean, I guess I'd say I'm a girl, but I usually just say I am what I am. I'm not really I don't really say like, yes, I am a girl. Why say I'm a girl. Really, but

359
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.020
Kiara ✌-: Me. Thank you. Yeah, I'm not obviously I'm not a guy.

360
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Obviously, right.

361
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:15.840
Kiara ✌-: Yeah. And I'm not trying to say, oh yeah, transgender, or I'm like how some people are like, I'm non binary like I call me they are there, or I don't know.

362
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:27.870
Kiara ✌-: They them type of things. So, but I'm very, very like supportive of people who are like transgender and, you know, non binary like I'm very, very for that kind of thing, you know.

363
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:36.900
Kiara ✌-: Very interested in that kind of stuff. Not like curious like you know like when people are like, by curious or, you know, that kind of stuff, but

364
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:51.360
Kiara ✌-: I don't know, I just feel like those people are very, very, very strong and very confident in a way to kind of pursue to be who they think they really, really, really are, or I shouldn't say think that they know who they are, you know,

365
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.180
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, so I don't know what are we

366
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.930
Kiara ✌-: Talking about that. But yeah, that's all right. No big deal.

367
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're gonna let him go for two weeks.

368
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:15.900
Kiara ✌-: Unfortunately, I don't want him to go but it says that in this another part I forgot to say it is like he says it's a once in a lifetime opportunity for him like he

369
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:26.460
Kiara ✌-: He has like a couple reasons or whatever for it, like him and his friend, Danny. They work they work together, they don't work at the same location, all the time because DANNY. HE

370
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:39.480
Kiara ✌-: Doesn't have like an actual office like my husband does he usually works more that way. Danny works more at different locations. Every day he fixes things around all the different up and down California and

371
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:49.290
Kiara ✌-: And then, but for their department is so small that if they were to bolt take time off, and at the same time, it would be

372
00:46:50.160 --> 00:47:03.660
Kiara ✌-: Impossible like it'd be like, No, it's either you, Danny, or you Kevin not both you but I guess with dignity health because they're not seeing as many patients as they usually do, because of the coven 19 thing they

373
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:13.020
Kiara ✌-: They were told that they have to take at least like two weeks off before the end of June, so

374
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:26.370
Kiara ✌-: I guess they so they're not spending as much money, but at first I was like, I don't understand how that works because you have to use PTO anyways and you're still getting paid. So how does that work, but

375
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:40.440
Kiara ✌-: When I told Susie at work about it. She said that it probably has that probably put money into a certain account for people are for the company to pay for that paycheck, like it's a different account kind of thing.

376
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.570
Kiara ✌-: So it's not the actual, you know,

377
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:55.770
Kiara ✌-: It's money that they have set aside, kind of thing to pay for people to be off work or use the sick leave, etc stuff. So yeah, that part makes sense now. But first I didn't get it. So I really

378
00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.270
Kiara ✌-: Want to go but

379
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:07.320
Kiara ✌-: What do you think, like, should I actually took. I mean it. I'm not gonna go by your actual decision because I feel like I'm kind of forced, in a way, or you know and and the way I kind of think about it.

380
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:19.920
Kiara ✌-: I'm always that type of person, like it's good to be away from people and then kind of like get back together because it can make a stronger kind of thing. And I really hope that kind of happens, it doesn't push us further away. But

381
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that

382
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I have

383
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:33.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Had a past partner in the past that he did the same exact thing. You know, he took a road trip from the West Coast to the East Coast and

384
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: was I afraid of him being on the motorcycle. Yeah, but he checked in with me text me throughout the day checked in with me at night, let me know that

385
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He was safe and that he was okay.

386
00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:53.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the great part about it is that it is time that you get for you.

387
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:55.470
Kiara ✌-: Know,

388
00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:04.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And yeah, he's going to be able to have an experience see people that he hasn't seen maybe connects back up with his son. You know what I mean.

389
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

390
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think it would be a bad thing. I really don't.

391
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, going through it myself. I understand what it was about. And for me, I was like, he's gonna be gone for a couple weeks and

392
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get to watch what I want to GV I get to do

393
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever you know what I mean, I can go have coffee with somebody. I haven't seen for a while I can. You know what I mean, do something for me. And so I took that time and I spent a couple days, you know, with one friend a couple days with another friend and just really

394
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, utilize that time, to the best of my ability.

395
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:52.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so, I mean, it's up to you, you know, whether or not what I know is that if it's something that he's really excited about. And he really wants to do.

396
00:49:53.790 --> 00:50:06.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you can voice your concerns about it and you could tell them you know what your fears are and what you hope happens out of it that it brings us closer together. And that takes you guys farther apart.

397
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe he'd be willing to take that time and

398
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:14.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: evaluate how he can improve on his side of the relationship. Yeah, you know,

399
00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:18.570
Kiara ✌-: That sounds good. Yeah, because there was two things. One,

400
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:36.870
Kiara ✌-: I get him going about the part like him kind of thinking about the relationship. I think that's a good part. Oh, and then, you know, being able to do kind of like what I want to do you know think oh, and there was another thing about the time. Remind me if I forget, but him.

401
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:54.660
Kiara ✌-: Crap, I forgot the other damn part. What was the other part it was. Oh, OK. Traveling okay so him, you know, going out for sounds like you know the whole quarantine. I can't do anything. I can't go anywhere, hang out with people and do what I want to do kind of thing.

402
00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:05.670
Kiara ✌-: But then I was talking to my aunt and she makes a lot of quilts out of jeans. So she collects jeans and I have like about 20 pairs of jeans.

403
00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:14.640
Kiara ✌-: You know, between me and my husband like pants that just don't fit us or they're too worn out and she collects them and makes quotes. So it's like, even though this whole quarantine thing is happening.

404
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:25.410
Kiara ✌-: I think because she's been her house and yeah no I think about maybe it might be bad if I did go up there, but she's not like super worried about it, kind of thing.

405
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:35.370
Kiara ✌-: But I'm going to take a couple days off of work and go up there and visit her and spend time with her because she lives all the way up in Reno. So that's like a two hour ish drive

406
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.740
Kiara ✌-: Those seniors. So I'm going to do that for a few days and take my land up there and then the thing with time.

407
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.080
Kiara ✌-: What about the term. I don't know.

408
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:56.940
Kiara ✌-: I don't know, I can't remember what the time part

409
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.210
Kiara ✌-: I don't know, I can't remember now.

410
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.000
Kiara ✌-: I remember later.

411
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:08.190
Kiara ✌-: Offline

412
00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:12.270
Kiara ✌-: I'll be like, fuck, I remembered

413
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This what I wanted to ask

414
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:20.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I mean, that's what where I would come from, you know, with it all.

415
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:41.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely allowing him to experience and it's not fun. Can I just want to throw this out there too. Yeah, it's not fun. I mean, that ride you know from West Coast to East Coast is long, hot, cold you bugs in your face all the time, big huge bugs.

416
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:43.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot

417
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To it that

418
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is rough

419
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

420
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:59.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you know that. Yeah, he's having fun and he's he's with his friend, and he's doing this trip, but it's not all going to be peaches and cream so

421
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:01.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know that piece to

422
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:05.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It. I remembered I want to say before I forget it, but

423
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:17.460
Kiara ✌-: The whole time with him is that usually whenever he would work overtime and stuff like that. He obviously when he's working. I'm not going to expect him to message me and stuff like that.

424
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:29.370
Kiara ✌-: But then there'd be times where he would get off and it would be like a few hours and or he won't even messaged me anytime after he gets off of his work and he's like out of town.

425
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:40.950
Kiara ✌-: And I'll wake up or I'll be messaging, the hell out of him. And, you know, thinking of like what time did you get off or what are you doing, and then he just basically ignored me and I'd be like,

426
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:47.460
Kiara ✌-: You need to message me and at least let me know that you're going to bed. So I'm not worrying about you like

427
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:54.450
Kiara ✌-: something bad happen and stuff. So I did tell him I was like when you go, you better make sure that your messaging me

428
00:53:55.170 --> 00:54:03.510
Kiara ✌-: I'm not. I said, constantly, but I don't mean like while you're writing. I told him. Oh, they do not like he whenever he he drove all the way up to

429
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:12.660
Kiara ✌-: Your Rica, or down to your Rica, whichever way it is, and he drove there a couple weeks ago, just to drive there to see how it is.

430
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:24.660
Kiara ✌-: On long distance, you know, that was kind of their trial thing. I think it took like five or six hours, you know, and then they stayed the night and then they came back and it was another five or six hours.

431
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:36.630
Kiara ✌-: But the whole time, like every time they stopped. He text me anytime he got to the hotel he texts me and then before he went to bed he texts me like he just kept in communication with me because I told him I'm like

432
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:44.670
Kiara ✌-: You know, especially if you're going on this ride. You need to make sure that you message me so I know that you're not freaking dead on the side of the road and nobody knows who you are.

433
00:54:45.060 --> 00:55:02.490
Kiara ✌-: Is your wallet flew around and no can identify your body, you know, like I need to know because that's, to me, a lot of my anxiety is like death and like me thinking. I forgot what the word is but like basically the obsession of like overthinking stuff that's not

434
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:12.360
Kiara ✌-: Not it. Like I always have this fear and I always obsessively think about, like, what happens if my dad dies or, you know, I forgot what the word is but

435
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.540
Kiara ✌-: I was telling somebody else about it. And I remembered it off the top my head and I was like wow actually remembered

436
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: ruminating

437
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: ruminating

438
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You ruminating your ruminating in the what ifs.

439
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:26.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

440
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:39.090
Kiara ✌-: There's another word I use it but that's basically like reminiscing or something. I forgot what the URL where it is, but basically it was just me being like obsessively thinking about, you know,

441
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.920
Kiara ✌-: The whatever any negatives.

442
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.400
Kiara ✌-: It. There we go, catastrophic. There we go. Yeah.

443
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:51.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the same thing. That's what, that's what builds up the catastrophic thinking is a ruminating about the one thing

444
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because

445
00:55:52.620 --> 00:56:03.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We ruminate we think about it, and then we continue to think about it and we continue to think about it. And as we're thinking about it. It grows. Remember, whatever, whatever thought we give power to grows

446
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you're

447
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:29.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: ruminating about what if, if you're ruminating about death then that fear is what's going to grow. Right. And if you think in terms of, you know, nobody has a guarantee for tomorrow in this world. And that's number one. And one thing that is for certain is birth and death.

448
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, and so we understand that about life. We know we're born, we know we die, don't know when. Because we don't get privy to that information, it just

449
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Happens when it happened.

450
00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:46.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you got to keep telling yourself that yes, I am afraid of this

451
00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:51.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know very many people that are not afraid of death.

452
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:59.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's more comforting to know that there's the two guarantees in life or both of those, you know,

453
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a way.

454
00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:05.130
Kiara ✌-: To say to his last Monday.

455
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:20.490
Kiara ✌-: It. I don't, I don't think I said anything. I think I did. But my aunt, the one that one of the answer that I was talking about going to see in Reno. She has a sister or had a sister that were twins and

456
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:31.830
Kiara ✌-: She passed away, or she basically died. And I guess she was over, drinking, and she was taking more drugs and stuff. She used to be a pill popper and stuff and

457
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:38.910
Kiara ✌-: My aunt Tani is the one that kind of like disowned her. I was like, she's very against like the drugs and stuff like that, I guess, but

458
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:59.610
Kiara ✌-: I guess she was so drunk that she like fell and busted her head open and then just bled out and she was just so drunk. She couldn't even like stop herself to fall. She just fell and hit her head and just died. Pretty much like that she could even get up or anything, and

459
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.070
Kiara ✌-: Kind of like

460
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:18.180
Kiara ✌-: I don't know if it's like really hit home or I don't know if that's the right terminology, but it just made me think. I'm like, I'm glad I'm not like drinking excessively and using excessively because that could have been me in a way like

461
00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.020
Kiara ✌-: If I was you know, it just makes me think, like, if that was

462
00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:29.880
Kiara ✌-: Like I was so reckless and like just pop as many pills, as I want. You know, like there were times where I take like five or six of pills at a time and

463
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:36.090
Kiara ✌-: Like I always used to stop myself like okay three at a time. That's my top or like my Max, but then

464
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:51.690
Kiara ✌-: An hour or two later, then I'll take another you know three, you know, I've added up like that, but never like at once. And then on top of that, I was drinking and then on top of that, I was driving. So it's like I increase my risks even more and more and more. So

465
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's what we do.

466
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:56.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As part of the addictive behavior. Definitely.

467
00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're still going to meetings.

468
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:08.040
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, I go to meetings every single day and I do multiple like that website that I told you guys about

469
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:17.220
Kiara ✌-: And that group. I listened to the NA one they have one that's like a 24 hour one and I get on there, anytime and it's good because you could pop in and now and

470
00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:32.130
Kiara ✌-: You're not really missing anything, necessarily, I mean you're hearing stories, of course, but usually like there's a schedule. You know, like there's always a topic and a chair and stuff, but with a lot of the 24 hours. It's just like open meeting.

471
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:39.000
Kiara ✌-: You can say like the Serenity Prayer at the beginning and they tell you a couple things that there's nobody sharing so

472
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:49.680
Kiara ✌-: sharing their stories constantly, constantly, constantly in you know they have co host and regular host that swap off every hour, two hours, three hours.

473
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:59.310
Kiara ✌-: You know, however long they want to stay on there for. So actually really like the NA one A I occasionally do too, because there's certain ones that

474
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:12.870
Kiara ✌-: Like my home. I would say like my home a is group three offer Bradshaw, that's the A that I first went to, and the one that I really liked, but it's a

475
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:24.180
Kiara ✌-: And I always kind of felt a little out of place because I never thought of myself to be as an alcoholic, even though I still went because I was like an addiction as an addiction. It doesn't matter, exactly what it is.

476
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.100
Kiara ✌-: But some of the virtual ones are like if you're not an alcoholic.

477
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:37.230
Kiara ✌-: You know, please, please shut up pretty much like they don't want to hear about if you're like crack addict or anything they want to hear if you're an alcoholic kind of thing so

478
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:45.990
Kiara ✌-: And they they seem to be more chill and relax. There's people. Let's say that still say like, yeah, I'm a an alcoholic to kind of thing.

479
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:57.450
Kiara ✌-: Because you don't just normally really have one addiction, because that that's how it was with me. I never really thought that I was never really a drinker. But then I started to

480
01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:08.160
Kiara ✌-: When I slowed down on the pill use I started to drink a lot more. And then I was like, Damn, I'm an alcoholic. Like I never thought, you know, call it oh my battery's about to die.

481
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's and you got to know that alcohol touches the same receptors as opioids and your brain for those one thing and it's easy when you're letting go of your drug of choice that you're something else ramps up right i mean that's just a part of addiction.

482
01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:24.990
Kiara ✌-: just replacing oh

483
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally. It's sometimes it's sometimes it's porn. Sometimes it's food. Sometimes it's, you know, relationships, it's something

484
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know

485
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's about balance.

486
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:45.090
Kiara ✌-: You know, and I feel like that's my thing now is cigarettes and still kind of like the addiction to me but food like

487
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:54.000
Kiara ✌-: I used to be like, oh, I forgot to eat all day and then like that. No, just eat dinner and now it's like I'm like oh my god like I'm obsessive Lee over eating.

488
01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:09.090
Kiara ✌-: And I don't like it. I know that I need to work out like it's gotten so bad that whenever I get up. I could be resting my feet for like 10 1520 minutes and I go to get up. My frickin feet hurt my ankles her, you know, I'm like,

489
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:17.160
Kiara ✌-: I need everything's wait, yeah it's but it's mostly like my legs because all the weight is like nine have tiny P I have like size six and a half feet.

490
01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:27.960
Kiara ✌-: So I'm like, You got 200 pounds and that's literally the heaviest I've ever been even when I was pregnant. I was 130 pounds. When I was pregnant. So really need to start working out. I know I do. But I don't

491
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's a piece of it to where your body says when you start when you get clean and sober.

492
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:41.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you had that pattern of eating where your body's like feed me now because I'm not going to get anything later. You know what I mean.

493
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's about finding balance, you know, switch. Some of the things that you're eating healthy

494
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stuff. You know what I mean, it's just about paying attention to what you're putting in your body, but that's perfectly normal and early recovery to gain weight. You know what I mean.

495
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you will be able to lose it, and you'll be able to get back to you know where you're at. Once all of this levels out

496
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. So, no, that means to god I think I gained

497
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:22.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 3040 pounds. The first year and sobriety. And then the second year and sobriety. I worked to get rid of that 30 and 40 pounds and i i got rid of 20 of it.

498
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And was perfectly happy with it.

499
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:24.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

500
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I got rid of it. But you know, I still you know struggled with it was about what I was putting in my body.

501
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and that starvation factor.

502
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:44.700
Kiara ✌-: Because I used to start myself. I got all the way down to like 138 maybe 135 which is like what I wasn't high school and then

503
01:03:45.930 --> 01:04:03.300
Kiara ✌-: About two years ago. Whenever I got I sit down job he just kind of it just went on and went on and now 200 pounds I game. I'd say basically like that. I don't know the math of it, but like 70 pounds. I think or 60 pounds adorable it

504
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:03.810
Kiara ✌-: You'll

505
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:09.150
Kiara ✌-: Get it, but at least I get down to 170 because I used to be my old norm. So

506
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're tall, too.

507
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.050
Kiara ✌-: Sometimes we're

508
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like Oh really. Oh, you're still taller than me.

509
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where you're tall.

510
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're still talking to me, but

511
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wish that I could have those couple inches because I wouldn't look so compacted

512
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.220
Kiara ✌-: You know, yeah.

513
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.700
Kiara ✌-: I'm even though I carry my weight pretty evenly all over

514
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:37.410
Kiara ✌-: I still have big hips. I have big cat. I feel like I just have big legs.

515
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.850
Kiara ✌-: And then when I have like the big legs like everybody tells me on your feet look so tiny and your I definitely have tiny hands too.

516
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:54.360
Kiara ✌-: But everything else. I feel like as big, except for like the ends of my body and even my head, my head is tiny to

517
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:54.870
Yeah.

518
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:58.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll get it. It just takes work. It does.

519
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:07.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just give yourself a break this first year. You know what I mean. And you can get yourself in a routine. You know what I mean, a little bit out of time.

520
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:15.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I would start with powder and water and switching junk food to healthy. That's not that easy. By the way, good.

521
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.920
Kiara ✌-: Drinking water drinking water is so i mean

522
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:28.890
Kiara ✌-: This right here in my coffee. This is, I mean, I usually only drink this. I just drink like this little coffee and then that's it all day. This is probably

523
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:42.420
Kiara ✌-: Maybe 26 ounces or so and then that's it. And then I take like a couple sips of water just to take my pill at night and then that that's all I all I really drink. It's horrible.

524
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:43.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I

525
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.990
Kiara ✌-: Drink water, but I just

526
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.490
Kiara ✌-: It's like appetite.

527
01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:48.870
Kiara ✌-: It doesn't it.

528
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:50.160
Kiara ✌-: It's like, I mean,

529
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.450
Kiara ✌-: I mean, I did.

530
01:05:51.810 --> 01:06:00.240
Kiara ✌-: I love lemons and I love lemon water. I tried doing that, but even like because like these little things a little ice Sparkling Ice

531
01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:04.470
Kiara ✌-: Actually like these, but I it's just I don't really have an appetite to drink.

532
01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

533
01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:10.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's weird. Yeah, you got to kind of make yourself at first and

534
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:12.390
Kiara ✌-: Crazy, of course, because

535
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:13.530
Kiara ✌-: The water.

536
01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's another piece of it, too, because then you

537
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Got to get used to drinking the water then you gotta used to go into the bathroom.

538
01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:21.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 15 times in a work day

539
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and it sounds like some of those women in your office would probably have a problem with that.

540
01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:28.620
Kiara ✌-: Probably

541
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is funny, but it's not. But I get it.

542
01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, women, women can certainly be caddy for sure they got nothing better to do than talk about you.

543
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.470
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, you know,

544
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:46.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing. All right. Well, I'm going to go. I have somebody else already in my waiting room.

545
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:47.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's

546
01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.200
Kiara ✌-: Okay, too. So

547
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you have a great week. Right.

548
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make some plans.

549
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:58.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do something while he's, you know, while he's away just for you. Yeah.

550
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:04.500
Kiara ✌-: I will. I'm pretty concerned about the podcast. So I'll probably as she said, I gotta write like you know

551
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:17.670
Kiara ✌-: Kind of like write it out, but don't read it out loud, just kind of have like your cue cards of what, just in case if you get sidetracked because I told her about my memory. She's like, just write it all down, and then we can practice it and stuff so

552
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:27.300
Kiara ✌-: Good. The doctor and then her, of course, and then the substance abuse coordinator or navigator together so it'll be good. Yeah.

553
01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:28.320
Kiara ✌-: Good, though.

554
01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So let me know when you do it.

555
01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:34.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when it's available because I'll go search it and watch it. Oh.

556
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:35.730
Kiara ✌-: OK.

557
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's

558
01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gonna be exciting.

559
01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.210
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, I'm excited for it.

560
01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yours. Yeah, advocate. Yeah.

561
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

562
01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:46.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's exciting for me and

563
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:51.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're doing it. You know what I mean, it's exciting because your voice is going to get out there.

564
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:55.920
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, I brought me here mostly a podcast for doctors and nurses, so it's

565
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.280
Kiara ✌-: Like

566
01:07:56.850 --> 01:08:07.590
Kiara ✌-: A real patient talking about, you know, like addiction and stuff, because I feel like, and that was why I was scared to go in, is because I was so afraid that the doctors

567
01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:15.120
Kiara ✌-: And the nurses were going to be like she's just a druggie or a junkie. And, you know, just be so negative and it was the complete opposite.

568
01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:23.640
Kiara ✌-: Yeah, but I was telling my husband just real quick story. I was telling my husband, like the day that it happened when I was asked to do it.

569
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:32.190
Kiara ✌-: I was like, I was like, wait a minute, I'm a white girl that doesn't look like a junkie, it's, I mean, it'd be one thing if I was like homeless and I was

570
01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:46.800
Kiara ✌-: You know black or Mexican or something, then I'd be like, Wow, that's so empowering. But I just feel like I'm a white like Oh, she has privileged type of thing, but I'm not trying to think, negative and try to be a doubt myself down for it, like I always do with everything so

571
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a piece of it and listen to your story. You have to know that your story is just as powerful as anybody else.

572
01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anybody else you still go through the same feelings, the same thoughts about it. You know what I mean. You put yourself.

573
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In risky situations. You know what I mean. So don't discount

574
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your experience because you are you know your recovery and your story can impact somebody

575
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: More than one somebody out there.

576
01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.900

586
01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where, where did I put you

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.420
Kiara ✌-: We can do it on Monday, I don't want to hold up the other personal

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, are you, yeah.

751
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.600
iPhone: It will be better for him to you in the long run. So

752
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:35.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. You know, it's like it's true what your husband says we can't control other people, but we can definitely set boundaries for what we're comfortable with and what we're not

753
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know,

754
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.190
Exactly.

755
01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:42.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I get that piece. Very much so.

756
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: However, you can't control your husband over there, so he can do it.

757
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:51.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your recovery.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

760
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love, I love that. I just keep my opinion to myself, because one time that I did voice my opinion. I got a lecture. So, I quit.

761
01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.140
iPhone: Right.

762
01:23:13.770 --> 01:23:18.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I just quit and you know my perception is very minimal.

763
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:23.910
iPhone: You gotta ask yourself, has logic and reason failed in our society.

764
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think there's a lot of things that are found in our society.

765
01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely more recent

766
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.550
So,

767
01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:34.980
iPhone: Well, I will say that

768
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.480

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, but I agree with you. I just want to tell you that 100% I agree with you. So

771
01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:51.630
iPhone: How can anyone take someone's word that's a constant liar and feel it. That's okay.

772
01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:53.550
iPhone: Right, okay.

773
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:57.540

iPhone: Know, yeah.

776
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We could, like, it is we can be in this conversation about this issue for a long time because

777
01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They understand that.

778
01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:14.430
iPhone: I know, and I'm not religious, either. And you know how that works too.

779
01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:15.480
Right.

780
01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

781
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:20.190
iPhone: The study of

782
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.630
iPhone: Epistemology is very interesting to me and

783
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:41.790
iPhone: I want to do something I want to put something forward to help society in its mental state, but I haven't exactly been able to conjure up a plan to do that. Yeah, how it would work. You got to be able to do it for you. Don't piss anybody off.

784
01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:43.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, good luck with that.

785
01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.640

789
01:24:56.670 --> 01:24:57.810
iPhone: Oh, okay.

790
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:00.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's up to you. How long have we been in here.

791
01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:01.830
iPhone: I have no idea.

792
01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:05.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably 15 minutes

793
01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We've been in for about 15 minutes. Are you tired. Are you ready for bed.

794
01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.750
iPhone: No, I mean, I guess.

795
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:15.690
iPhone: I don't talk about

796
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:18.990
iPhone: Politics, or whatever it is.

797
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:22.230
iPhone: Jesus study

798
01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:25.080
iPhone: To study

799
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. See, I didn't know that.

800
01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Learn something new every day.

801
01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.090
iPhone: Yeah, did

802
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not know that

803
01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:37.140
iPhone: Yeah, and and you you

804
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:51.870
iPhone: This guy does a study on YouTube and he meet strangers and you ask them specific questions to study where their mental state is and then he doesn't analysis. It's really cool.

805
01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.540
Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah.

806
01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.490
iPhone: Because people

807
01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.910
iPhone: When people have sort of belief systems. They can be asked questions, it puts them into a paradox.

808
01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:12.150
iPhone: And then, you know, it's like if it was a binary code for a computer. The computer, we would freeze, you know,

809
01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.260
Because it doesn't

810
01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

811
01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:26.670
iPhone: It's so cool. It's, it's, it's like that. But the people they they realize that they've they're believing in something in yet believing in something that's quite the opposite.

812
01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:27.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

813
01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:43.890
iPhone: Like, do you believe in magic. And if they say yes, then they say, well, when you go to the ATM. Do you just do a stone money comes out, you know, or do you have to actually do something. Well, yeah, but I can't make that. And that's a bad example. But if you

814
01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.990
iPhone: If you believe in something that is not proven. Okay.

815
01:26:49.290 --> 01:27:12.090
iPhone: Some people believe there is a slack. So if you have that belief system that the earth is flat, then why can you, can you explain how that would be, and then he has some very specific questions and they and they come to an end a reality that is that He analyzes and

816
01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:24.300
iPhone: Anthony to Bosco is on YouTube. And if you ever get a chance to look up epistemology. Oh, it's called street epistemology. That's what's called street epistemology.

817
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:27.000
iPhone: That's good. It's a good deal.

818
01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I will check it out.

819
01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:31.950
iPhone: It's hard to explain but it's really, it's really cool.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

823
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:49.380
iPhone: One last thing I have to say usually is questioning people about their religious beliefs.

824
01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:59.400
iPhone: And about their fat, so I don't, no matter what it is, it could be could be anything Buddhist

836
01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:42.780
