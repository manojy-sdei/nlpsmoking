00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.889
Dominique Pozo: Hey how's it going

2
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.900
Great.

3
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.770
Dominique Pozo: I'm just, I have a few more bites of my lunch here, I'm just going to kind of finish it up while we check in. So how are you doing

4
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.540
Martin Price: Pretty good.

5
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.860
Martin Price: I probably have to go at 530 no

6
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.420
Dominique Pozo: Oh,

7
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.980
That's okay.

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
Martin Price: Right, still have to get the dog to the dog park and I told this guy meet him there at six.

9
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.980
Martin Price: Or something like that.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.940
Dominique Pozo: Okay, sure.

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.310
Martin Price: Um, yeah, I think it's just, it's kind of a demanding day and

12
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.400
Martin Price: Yeah, and the middle of it. My is my pen pal girlfriend texted me that she had to call the cops on her son having

13
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.350
Dominique Pozo: Oh, no.

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.670
Martin Price: Yeah, I was like, oh, this craziness, you know, and

15
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.670
Martin Price: I think it to her voice because she

16
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.060
Martin Price: You know, but tell me as he was in the middle of serving the kids spaghetti or something like that. So she came

17
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.590
Martin Price: And the sun is Manny

18
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.110
Martin Price: He just kind of looks like a thug man but and she's just really nice lady. And we're like,

19
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.410
Martin Price: Kind of talking a lot more about our families and like what

20
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.930
Martin Price: Sort of family systems role, each of us played and everything like that, you know,

21
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.840
Dominique Pozo: Okay, that's such a good conversation to have.

22
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.630
Martin Price: Yeah, she was like a teacher and

23
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.610
Martin Price: She

24
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.550
Martin Price: Apparently did conferences or something on instant gratification, or like kids playing video games and the whole instant gratification.

25
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.300
Martin Price: Culture that that

26
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.430
Martin Price: Support, you know, or that I don't know. I hate to say it, it just the kids want more and more and more, you know,

27
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.210
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Yes. There's so many levels to how that has impacted this generation, for sure.

28
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.600
Right.

29
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.640
Martin Price: So yeah, she's pretty interesting, but I just didn't know she was having such a hard time with her son.

30
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:41.460
Martin Price: And I was like, God, you know, I've found another like women that needs to be rescued or like Marty jumps into save your role or something, you know. So, at least I'm aware of it.

31
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.470
Dominique Pozo: It's kind of great that you all are

32
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:52.530
Dominique Pozo: Thinking about this now too. So, you know, you're naming hopefully I would imagine you're naming what your patterns are and what you don't want to repeat

33
00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:13.440
Martin Price: Yeah yeah yeah like my initial inclination is like, What can I do for you, how can I help you know and it's like she's in Milwaukee and not much I can do for that's now I understand why she was saying she was, you know, kind of looking for a place to escape to every other week.

34
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.450
Martin Price: Because she takes care of his kids like every other week or something.

35
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.250
Dominique Pozo: I didn't catch. When you say his his his

36
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.930
Martin Price: His kids it. Oh, that's her son.

37
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.920
Martin Price: So she had two

38
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.640
Dominique Pozo: Kids our son is 23 and has two kids.

39
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.780
Dominique Pozo: Oh, gosh.

40
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.940
Martin Price: Yeah yeah and

41
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.630
Martin Price: Yeah, throughout this whole time, you know, she's always like

42
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.290
Martin Price: Just a walk on eggshells around him and everything like that. So I think she's finally basically evicting him and

43
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.310
Martin Price: I don't know, hopefully that'll help things

44
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.210
Dominique Pozo: So I

45
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.310
Dominique Pozo: Can. What's that

46
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.470
Martin Price: I don't know if there are any normal

47
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.170
Martin Price: People on these dating sites.

48
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.740
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

49
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.200
Martin Price: I guess he is the surface, you know,

50
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.620
And

51
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.520
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Um,

52
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:25.680
Dominique Pozo: Well, from what you shared with me about her. It sounds like although you are offering your support. She's also been offering support. Has that been consistent. Is she still

53
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.650
Dominique Pozo: Like I know she offered to go look at my

54
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.230
Martin Price: Sponsor back in Janesville

55
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.540
Martin Price: Like he wants to buy a house to rent to me and

56
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.340
Martin Price: So,

57
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.150
Martin Price: She said, yeah, she offered again to

58
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.610
Martin Price: Go check one out tomorrow.

59
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.040
Martin Price: And those scammers are just terrible. They just like think I told you about them, right, they just

60
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.270
Martin Price: Yeah, that's really

61
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.710
Dominique Pozo: That's really horrible.

62
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.620
Martin Price: million different ways. It's always kind of the same pitch. You know, like we're gone. And we just want somebody to take care of it and then

63
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.120
Martin Price: Yeah.

64
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.530
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

65
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.750
Martin Price: So,

66
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.080
Dominique Pozo: So I am wondering though, are you, are you allowing which she's offering in. Are you able to have the experience of receiving with

67
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.980
Dominique Pozo: With ease and like feeling the nurse Amy receiving from another have that happen.

68
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.080
Martin Price: Yeah. It's nice. It's like

69
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.870
Martin Price: Asking me if I need help, you know, or 100 help me.

70
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.250
Martin Price: Mm hmm. You know, it's like my whole persona is like what could she ever seen me, you know, so

71
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.090
Martin Price: That's just always been the way I am.

72
00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:04.590
Dominique Pozo: So okay, so still kind of thinking on and working on this self worth pieces. And how about this week you know I know last week or not even earlier this week, you know, you were talking about.

73
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.060
Dominique Pozo: Considering on an inpatient treatment center so that you could just take it down quickly had where you at with that now and

74
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.930
Martin Price: I'm still thinking about it.

75
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.230
Martin Price: You know, at the same time I'm

76
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.030
Martin Price: doing my best to taper.

77
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.540
Martin Price: Oh,

78
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.440
Martin Price: And I got another job interview tomorrow. And, you know,

79
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.400
Martin Price: They do drug test. So I would have to

80
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.210
Martin Price: You know,

81
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.260
Martin Price: Go to it like at least like a two week

82
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.170
Martin Price: Last time I wait. It was a two week

83
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.650
Martin Price: recommitment to recovery, they call it.

84
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.520
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

85
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.600
Martin Price: And it's, it's not really long enough, but

86
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.370
Martin Price: You know, it's kind of hard to say that month in right now.

87
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:14.040
Dominique Pozo: I didn't, I didn't know you were needing another job is would you keep your the job you currently have. And then this is an additional job.

88
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.920
Martin Price: No, this one is in

89
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.370
Martin Price: Livermore, California. It's Lawrence Livermore National Lab. It's

90
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:33.570
Martin Price: It would be like a super high paying all expenses paid you know contractor job.

91
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.760
Martin Price: You know, the National Labs there.

92
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.930
Martin Price: You know, I'm sure I'd have to do a pre pre employment drug screen or something like that.

93
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.030
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Okay, so

94
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.570
Dominique Pozo: Oh, so I wasn't aware of this. So your reality may completely change, you won't be going to Wisconsin anymore. If you go

95
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.590
Martin Price: That's a possibility with

96
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.650
Martin Price: What's going on is, I finally told my boss, I think yesterday or the day before that I was

97
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.620
Martin Price: A long story, I got like a real short contract extension through July and

98
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.630
Martin Price: I basically told him the underfunded and I'm only funded through June and I just wanted to give him the heads up and

99
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:32.580
Martin Price: So now I'm kind of like, and he said he he'd go take care of it. And he said, you know, he didn't want to change horses in the middle of the stream. So I think he wants to keep me but

100
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.490
Martin Price: You know, when they only extend you by two or three months. It's kind of a real

101
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.340
Martin Price: Temporary type situation, you know,

102
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.430
Martin Price: It's like

103
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.010
Martin Price: The timing. It never usually works out like

104
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:02.370
Martin Price: I probably won't know about the Wisconsin job before I have to make a decision on this other job, you know,

105
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.370
Martin Price: But I'd rather go, I think I'd rather go to Wisconsin. I mean,

106
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.360
Martin Price: I in there for like nine months and really like to see it builds and these

107
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:23.760
Martin Price: Like the National Lab jobs there the deal. We, the Department of Energy moves so slowly, you know, it's like

108
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.370
Martin Price: It's just a much different.

109
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.910
Martin Price: Pace.

110
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.090
Martin Price: But it's a lot more money.

111
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.460
Martin Price: I guess the way I'm thinking is, I'd rather go to Wisconsin.

112
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.330
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you're just. It sounds like you're also like researching options in case you need to take care of yourself.

113
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.830
Martin Price: Right, yeah.

114
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.360
Dominique Pozo: Oh, sorry. Any it's turned my phone off. Sorry.

115
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:51.690
Okay.

116
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.410
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

117
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.440
Dominique Pozo: May I switch gears.

118
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.810
Dominique Pozo: I saw, I didn't want to make you talk about it in group, although I was

119
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:25.080
Dominique Pozo: I was kind of watching you and wondering if you are going to bring it up as a group conversation around what's coming up for you around tapering and I'm bringing that up with the group did you did you, was it not important to you in the last group.

120
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.430
Martin Price: To kind of let it go.

121
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:32.550
Martin Price: I started there was like a specific top topic. They were asking us to talk about

122
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.280
Martin Price: But yeah, I don't. For some reason I didn't go there. I don't know. I guess I'll just

123
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.410
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. I almost asked you, and then I didn't want to

124
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:53.040
Dominique Pozo: Put you, you know, under any pressure. So if you maybe are like waiting for an open, you're not sure. Do I have your permission to just ask you, Hey,

125
00:10:53.310 --> 00:11:00.630
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to bring up what what we've been talking about in your individual sessions or do you want to just do it when you feel ready and comfortable.

126
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.990
Martin Price: Knowing that you can bring it up. I mean, I'm doing my best to do it. I just don't you know I

127
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.080
Martin Price: I just want to see like faster results.

128
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.800
Uh huh.

129
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.150
Dominique Pozo: I think it's such a great thing to talk about an express and

130
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:40.080
Dominique Pozo: You know, usually I have a topic and group. But what I really do is I follow what's actually alive for people and I really listen to what what's what people are naturally talking about and i i'm pretty willing to just change my course and follow you guys so

131
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:41.220
Okay.

132
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.060
Martin Price: Let's go, come up a few times.

133
00:11:51.090 --> 00:12:00.330
Martin Price: Yeah, and I'm glad I'm you know down at like three two or 3.2 instead of eight or 12 or 24 so

134
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:01.980
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

135
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.630
Martin Price: Hopefully it'll be easier.

136
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:20.100
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Yeah, be a great conversation for others who have maybe gone lower than you to talk about their experience and and the thing is to everyone's different. And every body responds differently. The tapering is different for everyone.

137
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.960
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I just

138
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.890
Martin Price: One thing I noticed is like when I'm on zoom meetings or whatever work or like with you. I

139
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.140
Martin Price: I just don't even worry about it. You know, it's weird.

140
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.970
Martin Price: My mind.

141
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:46.680
Martin Price: Like engages with what I'm doing. Instead of like worrying about how much is my next dose going to be inspiring X dollars and everything like that.

142
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:54.060
Dominique Pozo: Do you think it's this is it, this has a big part to do with the amount of time that you have on your hands from the whole

143
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.290
Dominique Pozo: Thing. Yeah.

144
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.640
Martin Price: Yeah, so

145
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.620
Dominique Pozo: It seems very situational to me.

146
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.420
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like

147
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.860
Martin Price: You know, I'm probably in these meetings, three or four hours a day. But then there's the other

148
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.170
Martin Price: You know, four or five and during the workday.

149
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.770
Dominique Pozo: Well, how has this week been with yourself talk. And since we spoke last

150
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.690
Martin Price: Night. I think I'm improving i'm not

151
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:36.540
Martin Price: As

152
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.860
Martin Price: I don't go to that dark places as much anymore.

153
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.150
Martin Price: So I, myself, I probably gotten there a couple times today.

154
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.080
Dominique Pozo: Just

155
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.380
Martin Price: Real quickly and kind of caught myself. It's like

156
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.160
Martin Price: You know, there's nothing you can do about it. Now, beating yourself up about it is

157
00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.970
Martin Price: About the past isn't going to help you know

158
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.600
I mean,

159
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:12.930
Martin Price: All I can do is just, I kind of try and look at every day is a little victory, you know, because I'm able to make you know some pretty good money and

160
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.960
Martin Price: Work towards you know work my way back towards financial stability.

161
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.220
Martin Price: And just

162
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.190
Martin Price: To have had it. And then last thing, you know.

163
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:30.990
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. Because you know what it can be like and and to have to kind of climb back up the ladder. There's, like, oh,

164
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.130
I

165
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:41.580
Martin Price: I know I was it's weird even like when you do have money put away for retirement. It just, it's like

166
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.990
Martin Price: It's never enough. You know, it's never going to be

167
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:53.790
Martin Price: Enough to tell your 85 and so security is not going to be there and you know all that stuff. It's just like

168
00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:03.270
Martin Price: If you talk to the financial planners. If you don't have a million dollars in the bank and your house paid for, then you better keep working, you know, that's how they are

169
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.260
Me.

170
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:06.840
Martin Price: I know

171
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.040
Martin Price: Well, it does what

172
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.760
Dominique Pozo: Would you

173
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:18.240
Dominique Pozo: Know what would be your ideal. Can you are you open to getting a piece of paper and a pen and writing out your personal financial plan.

174
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:28.080
Martin Price: Well, I mean, I got a pen and a paper. I mean, right now it's like, Oh, I can do is just trying

175
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.150
Martin Price: I don't even

176
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.540
Martin Price: It's hard to even plan, you know,

177
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.680
Yeah.

178
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.160
Martin Price: Basically zero right now.

179
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.470
Martin Price: I think

180
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.210
Martin Price: I don't, I don't even

181
00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.540
Martin Price: You know, I guess the way I feel about it isn't probably going to have to work for the next five years, you know,

182
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.310
Martin Price: To

183
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.060
Martin Price: Try and get to a point this the house that I'm in is

184
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.830
Martin Price: It's like the mortgages like 20 $700 a month. Right.

185
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:25.830
Martin Price: I have a tenant he pays 1000 a month. So the mortgage is 1700 a month that I have to pay. And that's really not too bad.

186
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.180
Martin Price: But that's still

187
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:37.170
Martin Price: would basically be half of my social security and pension combined, you know,

188
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:38.940
Martin Price: So,

189
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.830
Martin Price: And you wonder, well, do you really need this house, you know,

190
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:47.730
Martin Price: Or just

191
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.860
Martin Price: It's hard for me to make it

192
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.920
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

193
00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:03.480
Dominique Pozo: Actually I don't I don't I don't think making a plan is the best idea of more what I had in my mind is, what's your vision, like, you know, when you think of

194
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:14.160
Dominique Pozo: What's important to you what you value, you know, just kind of spelling that out drawing it out whatever however you illustrated or communicated on the paper.

195
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:27.780
Dominique Pozo: Just really putting the priorities down and then saying, Okay, well, you know, what would that take just to start to maybe think about unless you think it's not worth your time to do that right now.

196
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.030
Martin Price: Or you're not tough. Are you checking financially or just everything

197
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.460
Dominique Pozo: No, I'm talking about everything. Although everything includes finances so its

198
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.960
Martin Price: inherent to it, but not

199
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.570
Dominique Pozo: Not a specific financial plan like you're going to do this, this to make this so that you can pay off that that's not what I

200
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:59.940
Dominique Pozo: Was originally thinking I was my thinking you know what's most value to you, maybe the top five things that are of most value and you know how, what would you like your future to look like and what does that include and then thinking about, okay, what would it take to

201
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.370
Dominique Pozo: To really manifest that

202
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.060
Martin Price: I mean,

203
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:25.830
Martin Price: Like what I do value. I mean, I really like living in Santa Fe like being near the mountains and being able to ski and bike and take it all and

204
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.190
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so that's that's important to it's just I think it's great to have that

205
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:46.020
Dominique Pozo: Kind of vision on the horizon, so you know where you're headed toys and what you actually need, you know, because it sounds like you've held a certain standard of living. Certain things up to this point. But I'm wondering

206
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.410
Martin Price: If that's

207
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.440
Dominique Pozo: Still, what you need. If it's still current because it may

208
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:49.950
Martin Price: Not be

209
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.680
Martin Price: May not be sustainable, either.

210
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:53.790
Dominique Pozo: Right.

211
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.830
Martin Price: Yeah, I could always get a roommate.

212
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.070
Dominique Pozo: Huh, you feel open to that.

213
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.420
Martin Price: Oh, possibly, and you know i i'd like to be in a

214
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.570
Martin Price: You know, a loving relationship. We're like, there's mutual support.

215
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.650
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, that's huge to put down there. That's a part of the vision.

216
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.840
Martin Price: doesn't kill me.

217
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.030
Dominique Pozo: Can you imagine

218
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.390
Dominique Pozo: Moving is her name. April.

219
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.890
Martin Price: Yeah.

220
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.770
Dominique Pozo: Can you imagine moving in April, down to New Mexico.

221
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.440
Martin Price: I think, yeah, I mean she wants to get away. And I'm certain to see why.

222
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.290
Martin Price: But I think she probably feels obligated to take care of his kids you know every

223
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:55.860
Dominique Pozo: Other one

224
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.320
Martin Price: But yeah, I mean she her ideas to

225
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.690
Martin Price: Have you ever seen those

226
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:10.710
Martin Price: Like delivery bands like Mercedes delivery bands that they turn into campers.

227
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.180
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yeah.

228
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.070
Martin Price: Do something like that.

229
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.420
Dominique Pozo: Oh, that's fine, and go and just live out of the van.

230
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.460
Martin Price: Yeah yeah but yeah affiliate with

231
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.870
Martin Price: You know tables and stuff like that. So I don't know why she

232
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.600
Martin Price: She kind of quit teaching sort of early, you know,

233
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:48.900
Martin Price: I think she said she had a she had been a teacher for 18 years and she just recently quit. No, I don't know what's up with that kind of like she wanted to

234
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.580
Martin Price: go explore, you know,

235
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.970
Martin Price: That's essentially guy.

236
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.330
Martin Price: Um,

237
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:09.180
Martin Price: But anyway, yeah and i i love that that I mean it would be great to be in. If I could somehow

238
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:22.530
Martin Price: Like keep this house, you know, keep the mother in law's apartment ran it so that I could come up with 1700 bucks a month to pay for the mortgage and

239
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.760
Martin Price: You know, I'd like to, I, I had a lot of dreams about kind of building out my company and stuff.

240
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:36.330
Martin Price: But

241
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:48.720
Martin Price: And I thought I was going to start providing people to the company I work for, you know, other engineers, I'd bring them into my company, but it didn't and

242
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.220
Martin Price: So kind of like building up my company here. You know, I'd like to do that.

243
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:11.400
Martin Price: And then I I was trying to do like mature MALE MODELING for about a year and I did like six or seven things but

244
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:24.480
Martin Price: I kind of like to try that with, you know, I've tried to email that was shots I did to magazines like a RP and stuff like that, you know, kind of like the whole

245
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.340
Martin Price: 60 is the new and

246
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:43.380
Martin Price: Kind of outdoor lifestyle bicycling hiking, you know, because there's a lot of people that have moved to Santa Fe, and they're kind of my age, and they, they're not ready to

247
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:51.810
Martin Price: You know retire. They still want a real active lifestyle, you know,

248
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.260
Uh huh.

249
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.330
Dominique Pozo: Dance. Yes, yes. So

250
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.850
Dominique Pozo: So what I'm hearing is you want to get back into the mature MALE MODELING and see how that

251
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:14.430
Martin Price: Go. Right. Right. And just like so I submit little stories about you know how they could promote like the lifestyle in the West mountain biking and

252
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.190
Martin Price: Or individual towns, I just haven't had any. I know it's really hard to break into

253
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.870
Martin Price: I hid this kind of agency for a while but

254
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:26.760
Martin Price: It just

255
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.000
Martin Price: You couldn't make any money at it, you couldn't

256
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.070
You know,

257
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.460
Martin Price: They anywhere. That's something I'd like to pursue

258
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:50.880
Dominique Pozo: I think that the more that these things are in your conscious awareness, the more

259
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:52.320
Dominique Pozo: You know,

260
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.360
Dominique Pozo: You're going to be moving putting your energy in that direction. Even if you're a say you're out.

261
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:09.120
Dominique Pozo: At the store or something and you overhear someone talking about it if if you're really conscious of the things you want to do you can potentially just have those you know serendipitous moments when

262
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.260
Martin Price: You can start to

263
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.680
Dominique Pozo: Move towards what you want. If we know you know if one knows what they want.

264
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.530
Martin Price: Right, yeah.

265
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:24.660
Martin Price: Yeah, there's all kinds of magazines like in Mexico magazine Santa Fe magazine.

266
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:32.400
Martin Price: We even did like a video for realtor real estate companies and stuff like that so

267
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.050
Martin Price: anything's possible you have dreams.

268
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:45.090
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so you have done some already you have had some some opportunities that that came to fruition.

269
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:46.110
Yeah.

270
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:47.730
Dominique Pozo: Great.

271
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:59.430
Martin Price: And then I'm like, I've got some small investments like speculative ones and bitcoin and stuff like that. I like doing

272
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.310
Martin Price: Well, it's kind of like having

273
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.970
Martin Price: I don't know, like

274
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.630
Martin Price: I don't know how to describe it. It's like having something that you hope will really take off.

275
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:16.860
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

276
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:27.000
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's almost. It's kind of like having part of your financial reality be a bit of a game, you know, to

277
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.650
Dominique Pozo: To have your money somewhere and and see what's happening.

278
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.000
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

279
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.830
Martin Price: Yeah. So those are kind of

280
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:46.980
Martin Price: You know, being in a really good relationship would be nice and whether it's in Wisconsin or here, you know,

281
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.280
Martin Price: It just hasn't been any work here.

282
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:56.760
Martin Price: It's always either it in California or in the Midwest, so far, sometimes Denver.

283
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:08.550
Martin Price: So I'm not. Yeah, I don't know, for some reason, I don't know if I'm just kind of burned out from this week so far and just kind of like

284
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.390
Martin Price: Super optimistic.

285
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.090
Dominique Pozo: Optimistic about what

286
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.690
Martin Price: Anything you know I'm just

287
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.740
Dominique Pozo: About your future.

288
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:26.580
Martin Price: Yeah, I'm just like living a day to day existence, you know, and just trying to be grateful for that.

289
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:37.170
Dominique Pozo: Well, this is such a strange time to i just i think i want to keep putting things in perspective, it's like, you know, our, our community and the

290
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:49.620
Dominique Pozo: Things. We're used to being able to do you know go here, go there and meet these people go there. It's just not happening. So I can see where maybe you're feeling a little like what what's going on.

291
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.720
Martin Price: Like cabin fever or something.

292
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.110
Yeah.

293
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.220
Martin Price: Do you drive there do you bike around or

294
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:09.960
Dominique Pozo: Mostly drive. But yeah, sometimes biking, for sure. I just did earlier this week a bit, but now it's a pretty big island. So it's not that easy to ride. I mean, you can ride your bike, but it's

295
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:10.830
Dominique Pozo: A lot of

296
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.080
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, for sure.

297
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.240
Martin Price: So, yeah.

298
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.130
Martin Price: Guess I just need to get back into gratitude, you know,

299
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.070
Dominique Pozo: Oh, have you been doing your gratitude.

300
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.610
Practice.

301
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:35.490
Martin Price: Yeah, I've been trying to do, like, you know, five things I'm grateful for and I've definitely been meditating in the morning.

302
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.580
Martin Price: And that's pretty nice trying to like rid myself of all thoughts.

303
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.270
Martin Price: But like I was at the three this morning and just

304
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.630
Martin Price: You know, in fear and

305
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:07.290
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm going to just offer one thing there. I think there's many different ways to meditate and

306
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:17.640
Dominique Pozo: One way that I appreciate is, you know, not trying to get rid of the thoughts because they're going to be there. It's just watching them, you know, watching them go cross

307
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.010
Dominique Pozo: I think the more you fight them, the more they're going to come back.

308
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:35.670
Dominique Pozo: It's almost like that voice. You know, it's like the voice that shuts you down and you know it's hard on you. It's like, it's not going to go away. It's still there. It's just, oh, listening know being curious and then eventually the five or the voice kind of moves on.

309
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.220
Martin Price: I guess I thought you were trying to like

310
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.240
Martin Price: Have no thoughts or something.

311
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:50.580
Dominique Pozo: Think there's

312
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.540
Dominique Pozo: There's moments of that, but I'm pretty sure at least from what I've experienced with different teachings.

313
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.090
Dominique Pozo: Our minds are

314
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.020
Dominique Pozo: Are pretty

315
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:11.100
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, they're going to keep moving. And it's just, you know, enjoying the moments when there is a skill point and there's no thoughts and then recognizing the mind is going to kick in again and just watching a

316
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.470
Dominique Pozo: Lot kind of hooking into the thought.

317
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:20.310
Martin Price: My mind is kind of quiet is like first thing in the morning. So that's what I try and do it.

318
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:21.630
Uh huh.

319
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:30.480
Dominique Pozo: I mean, another way to move away from the thoughts is to really focus on the body. So, you know, if you notice that your mind is getting

320
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:44.490
Dominique Pozo: Circuit swirling are circling and thoughts, you can always move to your breath and focus on that and count. That's a good way to get your attention away from the looping biases to count make it. Let's do it. Actually, do you want to do it so you can feel it in your

321
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:54.270
Dominique Pozo: Body. Okay, so go ahead and inhale for four seconds and then you're going to hold for three and then exhale for four. So inhale.

322
00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:15.990
Dominique Pozo: 234 and then hold for two, three, and then exhale 234 and then again, inhale 1234 got on hold it.

323
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:30.600
Dominique Pozo: To three and then 1234 and then see how it is for you for a few breath cycles you count for yourself.

324
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.590
Dominique Pozo: Yeah and you know

325
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.270
Martin Price: I'm not

326
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:20.160
Dominique Pozo: Expecting that your mind is going to just turn off, although it gives your mind something to focus on. That's different. Because like divert the attention.

327
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.240
Martin Price: Now I've done that before. And then I

328
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:35.940
Martin Price: You know my counselor was like, well, don't even worry about your breath. Just dream, you know, that'll happen eventually, just trying to be quiet for a while and

329
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:52.230
Martin Price: See how long we can go without thoughts occurring, you know, so I just kind of watch these kind of little images that form and my eyes are shot.

330
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.620
Martin Price: Kind of watch those

331
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.170
Dominique Pozo: Hmm. Cool. Well, it sounds like you've got a number of different tools so you can see what you know what you feel moved to do

332
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:14.910
Martin Price: Yeah, I just have to be more consistent about it. I don't know. For some reason, you know, I just got up really early and just never really go back to bed properly and

333
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:15.870
Dominique Pozo: Then again,

334
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.250
Martin Price: Just kind of worn out today.

335
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.880
Martin Price: Yeah yeah my age, too.

336
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:28.140
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, there's a lot of factors, the full moon to I mean it was a bright moon I was definitely

337
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.700
Yeah.

338
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.760
Martin Price: I saw that here tues beautiful

339
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:33.840
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

340
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.520
Martin Price: Um,

341
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:45.900
Martin Price: Yeah, so to me like thinking of sort of big things that I'd like to work towards

342
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:59.880
Martin Price: A lot of them, you know, have to do with finance finance and romance, I guess, but I always just been orphaned holds me back, you know, and so that's why

343
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:06.930
Martin Price: It's just always that voice that's like, you're never going to get there until you get you stop taking this stuff so

344
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:13.170
Martin Price: That's kind of, you know, we talked about that last time. It's just like a nagging voice.

345
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:26.700
Martin Price: And then, like I said, sometimes I wake up and my hips like throbbing like really bad. And so there is like a pain component to it also. So,

346
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.240
Martin Price: I mean, that's what I started to get it for

347
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:34.620
Martin Price: And

348
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.310
Martin Price: You know, but then I got dependent on it.

349
00:33:52.110 --> 00:34:04.980
Dominique Pozo: So tell me what the next few days. I'm looking like me, because I know you set up a lot of support for yourself this week. And I'm just wondering for the weekend. What, what kind of support, have you put in place or activities.

350
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.080
Martin Price: Well tomorrow night. Oh, it'll be

351
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.930
Martin Price: It's called Celebrate Recovery and it's like a

352
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:23.790
Martin Price: Sort of a evangelical Christian church revival type thing.

353
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.320
Dominique Pozo: Cool 100

354
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.100
Martin Price: Will go on for an hour or two. They have like

355
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.760
Martin Price: Excuse me, they have a

356
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:50.250
Martin Price: Service for like an hour and then you break out into groups for, like, I think it's like I'm not sure, but at the groups are like say addictions and then another group for codependency and another group for

357
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.450
Dominique Pozo: For

358
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.440
Dominique Pozo: You know, awesome.

359
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:53.850
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

360
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.330
Martin Price: Yeah, I want to try it and then

361
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.490
Martin Price: I don't Saturday I met this guy that

362
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.960
Martin Price: He wants to ski these shoots up in the mountains, but

363
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:14.640
Martin Price: Well, yeah, but he wants to like start checking up there at sunrise, which is like 530 or something.

364
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:17.940
Martin Price: And I don't have a beeper yet.

365
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.400
Martin Price: To move. I can go to. You gotta have the avalanche beacon.

366
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.930
Oh,

367
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.200
Martin Price: Do it without

368
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.900
Martin Price: Having an avalanche speaking

369
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.710
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that sounds fun. That sounds like an adventurous.

370
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.280
Martin Price: Yeah, it's, yeah.

371
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:50.580
Martin Price: It's what I did last week at a clam up to the ski back down. Basically, only this time you climb up to the top of the mountain and go over to another mountain and ski on these shoots

372
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.020
Dominique Pozo: Cool.

373
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.700
Martin Price: Good be pretty fun.

374
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.100
Martin Price: Excuse me.

375
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.350
Dominique Pozo: I'm cocky.

376
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.270
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

377
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.890
Dominique Pozo: So catchy near your hands.

378
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:09.300
Dominique Pozo: Gosh, could you, I was gonna say might be good for you to take a nap, but

379
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.840
Martin Price: Yeah.

380
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.450
Martin Price: Do you mind if I get a glass of water.

381
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.750
Dominique Pozo: Go ahead, go. I'll go. I'm gonna get some water to action.

382
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.580
Martin Price: I think maybe it's like

383
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:33.600
Martin Price: It's not even gratitude. It's just kind of acceptance that I certainly need to be in, you know, just

384
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.240
Martin Price: Accepting

385
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:44.580
Martin Price: where I am right now and then trying to like do my best to

386
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.320
Martin Price: You know, recover financially and and

387
00:37:53.640 --> 00:38:00.720
Martin Price: I don't know, change things like I can rent my house. You know, if I do go to California. I do go to

388
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.210
Martin Price: Wisconsin.

389
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.210
Martin Price: Make some money that way and

390
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:19.710
Martin Price: It. Yeah. It's kind of like I need to be in a like more accepting and kind of be more grateful for just the day, you know, not

391
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.740
Martin Price: And quit future tripping.

392
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.100
Martin Price: Well, not so much about the future.

393
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:44.280
Dominique Pozo: Maybe. Maybe there's more of a balance that can be struck because I mean it's kind of like part of how we make things happen as we think ahead. So I wonder what more of a balance would look like.

394
00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:04.650
Martin Price: To stay more in the moment and be more appreciative of like a nice meal or just

395
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:10.500
Martin Price: Some cold water, you know, the fact that it's springtime out and the birds are all

396
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.670
Martin Price: I don't know the way I feel right now is I'm just really

397
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.220
Martin Price: Stuck

398
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:27.600
Dominique Pozo: Gosh, I were shoot. Let's see 26 we've got 10 minutes. Um, let's see if I can pull up this TED talk that you're making me think of it as really great

399
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.690
Martin Price: Sleep good tonight.

400
00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:04.410
Dominique Pozo: Let me see. I'm not going to take too much more time. But there's one here that I mean there's there's 34 possibilities will be the

401
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.250
Dominique Pozo: Maybe what I'll do is I'll cue one up for you neck for our next. Oh, here it is.

402
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:21.000
Dominique Pozo: What time do you need to you wanted to leave. I'm going to save this. I'm going to save it for next time.

403
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.390
Dominique Pozo: So that we can watch it fully and and talk about it.

404
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.930
Martin Price: Monday night so

405
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.430
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, let me make sure I've got it in my calendar.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.660
Dominique Pozo: Yep, I have you at 6pm on Monday.

407
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.250

Martin Price: Right.

411
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.030
Martin Price: Yeah, I think I'm just kind of tired and rundown. So

412
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.460
Martin Price: You know, hopefully Monday. I'll be a little brighter. I'm really looking forward to the weekend, just to get some rest. You know,

413
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.070
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, sounds like you need. I can tell you need your body's asking for some downtime.

Martin Price: To the dog park.

418
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:21.540
Dominique Pozo: Okay, enjoy your afternoon and I'm just thinking until Monday I kind of want to give you maybe like one or two homework assignments.

419
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:35.460
Dominique Pozo: Can you practice like you you offered it up around to, like, you know, eating a meal and just being grateful for it. Can you just practice doing that with all your meals.

420
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:42.630
Dominique Pozo: Really noticing what it's like to really be present with the meal and giving thanks and see what you notice, by doing that.

421
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.820
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

422
00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:57.270
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Practice gratitude for meals and then here's one more thing to practice to

423
00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:10.980
Dominique Pozo: When you notice your mind starting to do these looping things. See if you can just bring your attention to your body, bring the attention away from the head to body sensation and just notice like okay paying attention to your right shoulder.

424
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:18.660
Dominique Pozo: Taking a deep breath, pay attention to the left shoulder and just moving shifting the attention.

425
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:27.990
Martin Price: Okay.

426
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:34.230
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and we'll see how that goes on Monday, and then I'll have a video and gratitude queued up for you.

427
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.880
Martin Price: Okay. All right. All the way down for a couple minutes and then take off.

428
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.670
Dominique Pozo: Right, okay, Marty. Have a great weekend.

429
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:42.450
See you Monday.

430
00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.400
