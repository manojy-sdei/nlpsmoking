386
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.340
Okay.

387
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:28.920
Natalie Austin: That makes sense.

388
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:35.310
Natalie Austin: Yeah. And then eventually, eventually, we'll get you in two weeks and then to four weeks.

389
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.710
Natalie Austin: Okay, I think it goes. Um, one week and then two weeks.

390
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.970
Natalie Austin: For two months. I think you go for two weeks and then after that your monthly

391
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.380
LG Stylo4: Okay.

392
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.930
Natalie Austin: So you don't have to do this every week, you know,

393
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.390
Natalie Austin: And then

394
00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.420
Natalie Austin: You can also do individual therapy with Rochelle, if you want to, you feel you need it.

395
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.950
LG Stylo4: Okay.

396
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:09.780
Natalie Austin: And then if you do, you can discuss that with Rochelle next Thursday. Or you can call them and have them scheduled for you.

397
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.720
Natalie Austin: Okay, either one. I know you work a lot. So you might not have time for that. But

398
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:20.910
Natalie Austin: Yeah, as long as you have the group therapy. And I think that that meets the requirements for the state.

399
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:22.380
Okay.

400
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.540
Natalie Austin: I believe so.

401
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.880

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.580
Natalie Austin: Yep. Yeah, when we're done, just check the email and make sure you got the

406
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.580
Natalie Austin: urine drug screen and the lab work.

407
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:51.000
Natalie Austin: I'm usually what we do is we send that information over to a quest nearest you like the closest quest lab.

408
00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:00.870
Natalie Austin: OK, and then all you do is you just show up and they'll, you know, look up your name and date of birth and they'll pull up the information

409
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.380
LG Stylo4: I can go do that tomorrow.

410
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.460
Natalie Austin: Do you have a quest near you.

411
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.990
Yeah.

412
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:13.770
