18
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.210
Antoinette Casados: And then I would go to work I would wait I would go to bed by 10

19
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.160
Antoinette Casados: And wake up by five will now I've been going to bed like one in the morning. Two in the morning because I've been out of work for two months until we open back up.

20
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:24.030
Antoinette Casados: So I guess now then when I wake up I wake up around like maybe 10 3011 and I really need to stop doing that because it's almost time to go back to work. So, so as soon as I wake up, I'll go brush my teeth.

21
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.440

Antoinette Casados: Two years.

75
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.300
Jocelyn Corrales: That's a good thing because you don't need to buy some of those vegetables, when you have it available in your backyard.

76
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.510
Antoinette Casados: Exactly, yeah.

Antoinette Casados: So, usually there's times that she won't even let me clean the dishes. I'll ask her, like, oh, let me clean the dishes, since you cook dinner. She's. No, no, just leave it. I'll do it.

137
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.940
Antoinette Casados: And I think because she gets anxiety to from being stuck at home and she's so at risk. So she can't really be out

138
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:28.680
Antoinette Casados: On because she has a lung disease and what the corona viruses. She can't say, there'll be times that I tried to help her clean in the kitchen, and she just won't let me. Um,

139
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.700
Jocelyn Corrales: But for the most part, she's

140
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.970
Antoinette Casados: There'll be times that I do the cooking like any what we're thinking

141
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.110
Jocelyn Corrales: I think it's fine, as long as she could tolerate those activities.

142
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.620
Antoinette Casados: Yes, and I think it

143
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.260
Antoinette Casados: Was just want to

144
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.360
Antoinette Casados: Like

145
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:56.760
Jocelyn Corrales: I think she I think she would feel better if just moving around the house because, you know, if you just let her sleep all day. It would actually make her weaker and

146
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.830
Jocelyn Corrales: letting her do some activities that

147
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:05.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Able to let her do some activities that she's able to tolerate it would actually make her more, you know,

148
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.850
Jocelyn Corrales: More active and more, you know,

149
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:17.520
Jocelyn Corrales: That's really better, but at least it you know she's better if she's you know doing some stuff.

150
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.130
Jocelyn Corrales: You'd rather than yes, it keeps her movie.

151
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:33.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Because she's going to be more sick if they if just she just say something you're actually people like that, you know, they would rather move around as long as they're able to tolerate it. It's fine.

152
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:42.720
Antoinette Casados: Right. Yes. And I definitely see that with her and they've always told her, like, you need to do exercises because her lungs are so bad.

153
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:54.510
Antoinette Casados: It's only like 20% lung function right now and it's really bad, but they don't want her to just not do anything because like you said, If she doesn't, then I think it's going to make her worse like she's not

154
00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:02.040
Jocelyn Corrales: At least her at least her doing some chores. This already her exercise, but then let's let her do some

155
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Yoga exercise because it might

156
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.520
Jocelyn Corrales: She might have difficulty.

157
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Beach. Yes.

158
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.330
Jocelyn Corrales: That's going to be very

159
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.370
Antoinette Casados: She was away. Yeah.

160
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:30.330
Jocelyn Corrales: If, if, in your case, it would be fine doing basic exercise and doing big basic yoga. That's actually good for you, but maybe not for her but you know her doing some chores that I think it's a good thing for her this a little bit of, you know,

161
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And it is something

162
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:31.890
Antoinette Casados: You have to be

163
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:45.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Able to move around as long as it's not contraindicated I think for doctors would like her to do some moving around. That's already her exercise. At least she walks around the house, you know, sleep a little here, you know,

164
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.290
Yes.

165
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:47.820
Antoinette Casados: Yeah.

166
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.800
Antoinette Casados: Okay, that's you think

167
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.160
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to your mental health like

168
00:16:54.210 --> 00:17:08.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Positive Thinking exercise. How you regulate your emotions or moves, especially when you're moody, or you're angry. How do you manage it. If you're having some stress or distress. How do you manage it.

169
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:16.710
Antoinette Casados: Usually when I'm getting really stressed or angry of the situation. I'll try to just like let it go.

170
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:22.950
Antoinette Casados: Try to not think about it so that way because I noticed when I get these really bad migraines on the side of my head.

171
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:31.200
Antoinette Casados: The doctor says it's maybe what it is really short pain in there. And when I started to get stressed or angry have a certain situation.

172
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:44.670
Antoinette Casados: It just like really works me up in that pain starts to come. And so when I noticed that happening. I kind of just let it go and not think about it, especially with stuff that's out of my control, you know, and I can just keep dwelling on it.

173
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:54.750
Antoinette Casados: Kind of just like step aside and like breathe and just say it's not worth it. I could feel the pain coming in. So that's why I'm like, Okay, I just need to stop thinking about something else.

174
00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:03.510
Antoinette Casados: I'll put my mind on something, whether it's by going to the TV or, you know, doing something, anything reasons, thinking about it.

175
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Well, you can actually try you've mentioned that you're doing self.

176
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:28.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Meditation or music meditation you could actually do that listening to music. Okay, and be around the years, you know, just be yourself. Because if you're angry and you, you tend to react to it. You know, you tend to hurt people ever. And it's good that you try to just

177
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:37.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Let it go. And just, you know, it's good to be alone. At times, especially when you're on a bad mood, so it's okay to be alone, try to, you know,

178
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.130
Antoinette Casados: Do

179
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.210
Antoinette Casados: I stay in your room.

180
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to stay in your room and

181
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Listen to music.

182
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.660
Antoinette Casados: If not, you know what I do.

183
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:57.120
Jocelyn Corrales: You could also do some really exercise. Let's just like you mentioned, breathing exercise now. Breathe in, breathe out, try to relax and it's good if you put an also some music.

184
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.210
Antoinette Casados: It's like self meditation. Okay.

185
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:09.720
Antoinette Casados: Awesome. Yeah, I'll try to stay in my room and just like shut myself out just so I'm not getting so angry nor

186
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, because sometimes the more you see that person.

187
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, we got some more. You see this person in the more you get irritated.

188
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Right, it's better to be alone.

189
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Thank you.

190
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:30.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Although you're trying to let it go. You know, you want to let it go. You try to let it go. But if you see the person you know trying

191
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.740
To go somewhere.

192
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:35.820
Antoinette Casados: Right.

193
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.630
Jocelyn Corrales: And I'm just adding here the

194
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Possible suggestions or plan that we could do.

195
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.150
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to your spirit will sell. Do you consider yourself spiritual

196
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.600

197
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.680
Jocelyn Corrales: That's right.

198
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.080
Antoinette Casados: Like thought about that or what. No, I would say not too, too much.

199
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.730
Jocelyn Corrales: A little bit spiritual not too much.

200
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.220
Antoinette Casados: Yeah, a little bit.

201
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.470
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so

202
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you into

203
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.630
Jocelyn Corrales: A religion. Do you know

204
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.320
Antoinette Casados: Like Christian. I'm not. No, I'm not.

205
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.150
Antoinette Casados: No, I'm not really big on religion too much.

206
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.090
Antoinette Casados: When I was little, my parents said they had me in Assemblies of God.

207
00:20:51.630 --> 00:21:01.500
Antoinette Casados: But I didn't grow up really, you know, going to church or I would do it a little bit with my sister in law. She was she's a big Christian and, you know, does that stuff and but me. I haven't

208
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:14.460
Antoinette Casados: Like I believe in God and I mean I have my own beliefs and stuff, but I'm not real big on religion as far as like, going to church or praying every day, I guess, or you know just stuff like that. I'm not too, too big on religions but I

209
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.630
Antoinette Casados: Am I know that I had that connection with somebody that

210
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.140
Antoinette Casados: I think that's good for me.

211
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:29.850
Jocelyn Corrales: So you do you believe that there's a higher being, that control says, you know, that watches over us, something like that.

212
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.660
Antoinette Casados: I do, yes.

213
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, and you mentioned that your sister in law.

214
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Is going to church. Do you also go to church with your sister in law sometimes

215
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:03.630
Antoinette Casados: Not, not now that now that I'm older. When I was younger I used to, because I used to spend a lot of time with them with my nephew.

216
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:15.420
Antoinette Casados: With this has been a long time. So this is more when I was younger, a lot younger. So I really with it. You know, my husband's when I first got with my husband, he's Catholic

217
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:24.390
Antoinette Casados: And I would always go to them with them for like masses, or just whatever's going on at that particular time.

218
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.860
Antoinette Casados: So I would sometimes go with them to the Catholic Church.

219
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.810
Antoinette Casados: But in our lives. Now, it's not really part of our lives as far as going to it.

220
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Is your husband still going to church.

221
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.150
Antoinette Casados: He's not know

222
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.330
Jocelyn Corrales: And he's not considering I think he's kind of

223
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:45.660
Antoinette Casados: Like this.

224
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.290
Jocelyn Corrales: He just kind of

225
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.860
I'm sorry.

226
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:56.520
Antoinette Casados: Maybe he's kind of like me, like we we both believe that there is a higher power and

227
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.640
Antoinette Casados: It was believe in God. And it's not like

228
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:10.110
Antoinette Casados: It's not us to go to church, I guess, um, I, I personally believe that we don't need to go to church to believe in a God.

229
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.750
Antoinette Casados: We don't have to be there.

230
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.330
Antoinette Casados: To be accepting. That's how I feel.

231
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:26.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Jackie. Have you tried, or have you considered maybe attending online worship service instead of going to a physical church just listening I

232
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.110
Antoinette Casados: Know,

233
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:38.430
Antoinette Casados: Yeah, no, I never thought about that it would be really cool, you know, to learn because I don't know a lot about like my husband knows a lot about the Bible.

234
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:46.500
Antoinette Casados: And I don't because I wasn't grown up, you know, I didn't grow up that I didn't was never taught really and he was in the Catholic church catholic church and

235
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:53.460
Antoinette Casados: He had his first Holy Communion, all of that. That involves the church. So I kind of would like to learn

236
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.030
Antoinette Casados: So that would, I think that would be really good. I

237
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.320
Antoinette Casados: Do. Yeah, mine.

238
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:08.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of doing it you know sometimes when you are not ready, but you're, you know, there are many people who are not ready ongoing in a physical church but you know

239
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:16.530
Jocelyn Corrales: They have some considerations of maybe attending church, especially if you're not prepared or, you know, you're, you're not mentally prepared.

240
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:28.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Of going in there or you're not, you know, physically and mentally prepared to go there. So what they usually suggest is, why not try attending online services, maybe could learn something, you know,

241
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.390
Jocelyn Corrales: They yes they also teach the Bible there, you know, they also, you know,

242
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:44.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Make you understand what these what the Bible says about. So maybe you could try attending online services and let's see if it works out for you. You're actually a lot of, you know,

243
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.730
Jocelyn Corrales: church services online, especially nowadays because of the epidemic.

244
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.470
Antoinette Casados: Yeah.

245
00:24:53.340 --> 00:25:08.580
Antoinette Casados: I haven't seen one of my local churches here in my town, one of the like cathedrals and they do have online services. So I've been wanting to look at it, but I haven't. I've never it's never like came across my mind. So I definitely want to look into something like that for sure.

246
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:22.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so you can see her attending online services to learn more about God in the Bible. That's good. That's good to know.

247
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.180
Antoinette Casados: Yes.

275
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:45.480
Antoinette Casados: My dad was super, super close our family was more closer, I felt like what he was like

276
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.360
Antoinette Casados: Before he passed away when we were younger.

277
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.190

Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

280
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.770
Antoinette Casados: I think I'm a person that keeps my

281
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.160
Job.

282
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:17.280
Antoinette Casados: Not really, I would say, friends, not really, not people that I go and hang out with or anything like kind of and I don't feel like I want to have friends, I guess, I don't know. I'm more of like a prison to myself I don't trust people too much.

283
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:28.890
Antoinette Casados: And because my my work life. It's just, I'm so busy that when I'm not working. I would rather spend time with like family. The people that I'm close to my nephews and nieces.

284
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.800
Antoinette Casados: My husband and my mom. So no, I don't really have any friends that I could say, are my friends and

285
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.690
Antoinette Casados: We hang out or anything, you know,

286
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.750
Antoinette Casados: But that's because of my own choice. I think

287
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:47.610
Jocelyn Corrales: That's right, but you're, you have a good relationship with your coworkers and you know your neighbors.

288
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.290
Antoinette Casados: Yes, definitely.

289
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.430
Antoinette Casados: Yeah, definitely. I would say yes.

290
00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.030
Antoinette Casados: I communicate with like a lot of people online like on Facebook and stuff.

291
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:11.880
Antoinette Casados: Like called coworkers old coworkers and I do actually have somebody that really close to me. She used to be my old boss. So I guess you know what that is. My best friend.

292
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.640
Antoinette Casados: But I consider them now. Yes. Yeah, I consider more

293
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Filler Fred my

294
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.250
Antoinette Casados: Boss. When I was out for right

295
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.960
Antoinette Casados: Yeah.

296
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:29.130
Antoinette Casados: And we were just so close. We communicate all the time. We don't see each other that much now, but we do community all the time.

297
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:41.790
Jocelyn Corrales: That's fine, as long as you keep in touch with your friends. It doesn't have to be physical contact, but you know, you could do on social media, you know, you could also meet via zoom

298
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.360
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

299
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:54.990
Jocelyn Corrales: You could also chat on social medias things like, stuff like that, you know, the strike to keep in touch, especially nowadays nights, it's, it's difficult to go out, you know, with so many people around and you know

300
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.340
Jocelyn Corrales: It was to be

301
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:01.980
Jocelyn Corrales: And you don't want to be infected especially that your mom is sick and you don't want to

302
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Bring all those things at home.

303
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.900
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's better to stay at home, you know,

304
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.170
Jocelyn Corrales: So your husband is currently

305
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.340
Working

306
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.240
Antoinette Casados: He is yes.

307
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:16.950
Jocelyn Corrales: But you are

308
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.850
currently a member

309
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:27.420
Jocelyn Corrales: But currently, you are not working because of the current situation, but once the situation is back to normal. You're going back to work again.

310
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.120
Antoinette Casados: Yeah, we've got temporary closed down because we're considered non essential

311
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:51.420
Antoinette Casados: And so the government has it to were here in New Mexico, we would open up. She has the current orders. They own order businesses closed into the 15th. So next week. So we're hoping that we would go back to Monday on the or to work on on the 18th

312
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.780
Antoinette Casados: However, but that's still up to the governor of she decides that

313
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.790
Antoinette Casados: Extended even longer than we're not going to

314
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.050
Antoinette Casados: Order. Yeah.

315
00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:12.480
Antoinette Casados: So I might kind of have a feeling that she will extend it more because they keep getting a lot of cases, it's not not decline. Let me just keeps getting more and more Jesus made it clear that is happening if we cannot keep the numbers lower

316
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.990
Antoinette Casados: And go down, she'll have to do another

317
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.060
Antoinette Casados: That's probably an extension.

318
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:27.420
Jocelyn Corrales: It's difficult. If you're not able to control the numbers and the numbers are still getting up. Yeah, that's this. It's more likely to be extended.

319
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:27.750
Antoinette Casados: By

320
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:35.340
Jocelyn Corrales: It keeps on happening because if if works. I'm going to open, whereas time it's going to increase, increase the number, it's

321
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.120
Antoinette Casados: Going to be worse.

322
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.900
Jocelyn Corrales: It's going to be, it's going to double not only bubble. But, you know, it would

323
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Move it would multiply more

324
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:43.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Because of that,

325
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:51.570
Antoinette Casados: And then there's like if they do that too early, we end up going back to work and then that happens we're going to end up getting shut down again.

326
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.180
Antoinette Casados: Yeah, I just feel like if that

327
00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:04.770
Antoinette Casados: Case, just keep us on the same path until it's safe to go back to work until it's the right time because right now I'm also on unemployment, so we have to get for unemployment.

328
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:19.290
Antoinette Casados: So I'm making the same money that I'm making even a little bit more. When I was at work and I feel like I don't want us to have to go back to where we stopped the unemployment and then they shut us down again, and then we're gonna have to deal with trying to apply all over again.

329
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.870
Antoinette Casados: In there, I just don't want that to get messed up, and then

330
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.760
Antoinette Casados: Because that's our income, you know, that's my income.

331
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:24.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I just

332
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.090
Antoinette Casados: I hope they just keep it the way it is. It's

333
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:32.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Good to be the case, but you receive unemployment benefits because of the current situation.

334
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:50.250
Antoinette Casados: Do. Yes, yes, or company paid us for the first couple weeks they beat us about a good two weeks and like a month they gave us money because the companies like will continue to pay you guys don't worry about it. Stay at home. But then I understand, because we're not making business.

335
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:57.390
Antoinette Casados: They can't keep you in all the employees for that long, so they did finally tell us we have to get on unemployment and we were furloughed

336
00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.040
Antoinette Casados: They said none of us were fired. They were not going to not bring anybody back that's not the case.

337
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.560
Antoinette Casados: It's just until we can open back up, then

338
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.210
Antoinette Casados: They'll bring us all back.

339
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:13.020
Jocelyn Corrales: So aside from the unemployment and you also mentioned your husband is also working

340
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.600
Antoinette Casados: Yes.

341
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:39.600
Jocelyn Corrales: And who does the budgeting, or who does the managing of your income or your, you know, who does the budgeting, or the managing of your money and who is responsible for paying the bills or do you work it out with your husband or you pay your own bills are you manage your own bills.

342
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:45.810
Antoinette Casados: Shall we yeah right now. Well, we just got married. We've been together 10 years no

343
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:53.700
Antoinette Casados: Sorry, that's like we've been together, almost 12 years this year I keep thinking them, but we're going to get it almost 12 years we just got married in 2018

344
00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:00.660
Antoinette Casados: Before then, we were always were still kind of young. I mean, in high school I was a sophomore in high school and we first got together.

345
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:08.370
Antoinette Casados: And when we've always just paid our bills. He's taking care of his car stuff with my mom. We don't have rent. She owns the land jeans, the house. It's just like

346
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:20.430
Antoinette Casados: Like line taxes and then whatever bills we have. So we kind of just pay like as far as me. My husband go I pay my own bills that I have personally like my car, my credit cards on

347
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.600
Antoinette Casados: My phone and he does the same thing. And then as far as like with my mom. We help will help my mom pay certain bills.

348
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:38.220
Antoinette Casados: But we don't do it together. Like he manages his own bills and he's really good at, you know, pain, his own things. And I'm pretty good at painting my own and then obviously my mom with the house. She takes care of all the house stuff.

349
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.780
Antoinette Casados: As far as managing it.

350
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.930
Antoinette Casados: And then we'll just give her whatever needs to be paid for whatever bills will help there as well.

351
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.690
Antoinette Casados: Okay so we are going to learn

352
00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:51.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Budget, do we need to your own finances.

353
00:34:51.810 --> 00:35:00.360
Jocelyn Corrales: And Bill she do you both do it individually. But with regards to your mom's needs. And we'll see both share right

354
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:09.960
Antoinette Casados: Yes, and I think once like if it's one is Mother's Day. It's just me and my husband at that point we'll, you know, we'll get by our own house and

355
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.820
Antoinette Casados: At that point, we've already discussed that we are going to share the finances, we're going to create

356
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.080
Antoinette Casados: It together and we're going to

357
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.040
Antoinette Casados: Do it together.

358
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.740
Antoinette Casados: Instead of doing it the way we're doing now, because we don't

359
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.640
Antoinette Casados: Have anything really we live with my mom because she's sick and

360
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:32.760
Antoinette Casados: I said, once we get our own house. And we do our own stuff and it's just me and him then at that point we want to combine everything together and then I would probably be the one taking care of it.

361
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.020
Jocelyn Corrales: managing it. Yeah, you could do that.

362
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.150
Antoinette Casados: That's

363
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:49.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so we because we've already we've already discussed, what's working out for you for regards to what's not working well for you. Maybe I could put in

364
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.900
Jocelyn Corrales: You not exercising and you eat.

365
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.340
Antoinette Casados: You mentioned yes if

366
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:05.070
Jocelyn Corrales: You don't, you don't eat breakfast, but you're able to eat lunch and dinner and some snack. That's

367
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:06.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Before lunch.

368
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.590
Jocelyn Corrales: So it's like a snack before. So your

369
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.070
Breakfast.

370
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.780
Antoinette Casados: You like chips or something.

371
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.870
Antoinette Casados: And that, that's another thing too is, I'm very bad at my diet. I don't

372
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:37.020
Antoinette Casados: Eat healthy. I just like I drink. Dr. Peppers. Like I Dr. Pepper. I love Dr. Pepper. And that's all I drink lately. I have been doing a lot better with drinking water because that was my biggest issues. I just don't drink water. I don't like it. I don't like to drink water, but lately.

373
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.120
Antoinette Casados: Every night I do drink a lot of water. I can't drink water during the day and I don't know why.

374
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.510
Antoinette Casados: Especially when I'm at work, because I feel like my Dr. Pepper is my coffee.

375
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:46.140
Antoinette Casados: In the

376
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:56.730
Antoinette Casados: Evening going but like later on in the evening and the nighttime. I feel like I'm so dehydrated that I just need to drink water. And so I've been drinking a lot more water throughout

377
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:05.370
Antoinette Casados: compared to when I use what I used to be. That's something my doctor told me about his any Dr. Peppers and drink more water.

378
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.060
Jocelyn Corrales: So are you still drinking. Dr. Pepper. I though.

379
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.000
Antoinette Casados: Yeah. Yes.

380
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:26.220
Antoinette Casados: Well, in the morning when I'm getting ready. I'll drink my water whatever was left over from the nighttime logic, the rest of that water and I start my Dr. Pepper dropping in the night is when I usually only drink water.

381
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:38.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I think you're right. Let's try to cut down on the Dr. Pepper. So how many cans need drink or do you buy a big bottle.

382
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.660
Antoinette Casados: I by 2024 packs and the

383
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.430
Antoinette Casados: Last week and a half.

384
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.110
Antoinette Casados: Yeah so chance or by the cans to eat out cat Eden's

385
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you don't know

386
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.640
Jocelyn Corrales: How many, how many calories you know day

387
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.260
Jocelyn Corrales: In a day.

388
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.970
Antoinette Casados: I would say like three to four.

389
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.590
Antoinette Casados: Okay.

390
00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you

391
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:00.780
Antoinette Casados: Know, Rudy.

392
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:08.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Can you try cutting it down because she mentioned three to four. Can we try to get this out to two to three in a day instead of three to four.

393
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.290
Antoinette Casados: Yeah.

394
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.610
Antoinette Casados: And

395
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.410
To replace

396
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Replace it with water will do that for two weeks.

397
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.280
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like tapering medications. So let's paper doubt on Dr.

398
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:23.730
February.

399
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:34.020
Antoinette Casados: Because I know this is that you can't like cut it out completely, because you're so good to the caffeine and sugar.

400
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:35.790
Antoinette Casados: That it would be bad for you if you

401
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.620
Antoinette Casados: Took it out 100%

402
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.110
Antoinette Casados: Yeah, but to wean myself off.

403
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.190
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

404
00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:49.200
Jocelyn Corrales: That's like you're doing your medication papering let's do Dr. Pepper tapering so instead of

405
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.400
Jocelyn Corrales: I put here usually drink three to four.

406
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Cans in a day.

407
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.130
Jocelyn Corrales: And

408
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Basically down

409
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.080

419
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:12.480

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.820
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, I don't like drinking soft drinks or even Dr papers, you know,

423
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:28.020
Jocelyn Corrales: That has been, you know, open and you're going to take it again tomorrow. It doesn't taste.

424
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.300
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like it lost it lost his power, you know,

425

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:44.730
Jocelyn Corrales: So let's let's deeper down on your Dr. Peppers. In the end, replace it with water instead. So from cheetah for

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Cancer. Let's do a to

428
00:40:46.320 --> 00:41:01.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Me for two weeks. Then two cans for another two weeks then want to cans for the next two weeks and one can every week until you're able to put it down to probably do drinking about three to four cans in a week instead of a day.

429
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:10.260
Jocelyn Corrales: So right that that treat forecast is about one candidate and instead of taking it every day. Try to take it maybe

430
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:18.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Every other day until you're able to, you know, just take it you know you're not addicted it

431
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:29.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Just wants to take it because you just you just craving it but you know if it's not needed. I have you tried drinking healthy fruit juices. You know, like she

432
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:36.480
Antoinette Casados: For chicks. I don't know. I should, because like I said my diets left that good. I don't even eat that healthy either

433
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:40.290
Antoinette Casados: Great. A lot of junk food, like a lot of chips and just junk food.

434
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.930
Antoinette Casados: Just because that's what I feel better. I crave. You know, so I should I

435
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:52.860
Antoinette Casados: I don't really like dream how these like I never thought of that.

436
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.460
Antoinette Casados: But maybe I should start getting into, like, you know, cuz

437
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.480
Antoinette Casados: I feel like water is just so boring.

438
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe

439
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:10.140
Jocelyn Corrales: If you think it's very boring to drink water. Maybe you could do some for cheeks fresh shakes, you know,

440
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:21.690
Jocelyn Corrales: For cheeks are fresh shakes. That's going to be healthier. It's like an alternative for your Dr. Pepper. And of course, try to drink water afterwards and

441
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:31.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe let's lesson and chips because it's very salty. It's, it's not good for your kidneys. So let's try to lessen some chips. Maybe you could eat some chips, but not

442
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:39.870
Jocelyn Corrales: As much as you do in a day. We could also deeper that you know with chips, you could always stay. Breathe out and like Dr. Pepper so

443
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:47.460
Jocelyn Corrales: With regards to shave it to lessen your intake with chips. Do you eat vegetables you like eating vegetables.

444
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:58.050
Antoinette Casados: Do you usually when we cook dinner, who couldn't like born or I don't really eat salads too much sometimes like

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:09.570
Antoinette Casados: When I'm crazy when I guess but not really. It's not included in every like die every meal that we have, but usually every meal that will have like will make steaks and I'll make brussels sprouts.

446
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Vegetable side dishes.

447
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.620
Jocelyn Corrales: That's fine. That's okay.

448
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe. Maybe you do. I do like

449
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:34.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe we could do eat vegetables as your side dish instead of eating it alone and try to eat healthy meals like stakes for frying eggs are fine, you're

450
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Fine, you know, meet are actually okay yeah

Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. You mentioned your mom looks to me like

453
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:46.530
You're

454
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.830
Antoinette Casados: Like you know beans with people's were corned beef hash.

455
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.790
Antoinette Casados: That's fine. When I end up making you're

456
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:59.190
Antoinette Casados: wanting something different, you know, to you.

457
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.100
Jocelyn Corrales: That's okay, that's good.

458
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.450
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good, that's their mamas. They're taking care of you and taking care of your meals.

459
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.270
Jocelyn Corrales: That's fine if you're below.

460
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:15.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Me, maybe just try to cut down on the junk foods and Dr. Pepper.

461
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.540
I

462
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.750
Antoinette Casados: Need, but it's junk food.

463
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:25.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And replace your Dr. Peppers three shakes for cheeks.

464
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:37.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried vegetable shakes. But I think for chicks are better. It's, I think, I think you have a sweet tooth because she liked Dr. Peppers, maybe for chicks are better and maybe

465
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:41.640
Jocelyn Corrales: It's

466
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe it's difficult to start with.

467
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:53.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Vegetables, maybe we could do vegetables sometime later on when you're used to, for chicks and you want to innovate your foot shakes. We some vegetables in you know

468
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.570
Antoinette Casados: With vegetables. Okay, got it.

469
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:11.100
Jocelyn Corrales: With mental health. I have already suggested when you have some mood problems. Try to get in alone. The room.

470
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Spend time alone.

471
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.940
Antoinette Casados: Right, okay.

472
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.810
Jocelyn Corrales: And do some meditation.

473
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:36.870
Jocelyn Corrales: To relax. Okay. So with regards to spiritual self you wanted to

474
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:45.120
Jocelyn Corrales: You always want you mentioned that you're open for well let's see that here you consider attending online services.

475
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.650
Yes.

476
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.750
Jocelyn Corrales: And I think you have no problems with regards to social relationship.

477
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.540
Antoinette Casados: Might yeah

478
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.780
Jocelyn Corrales: And with regards to financial I think you're still able to

479
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.450
Jocelyn Corrales: manage your finances.

480
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.360
Antoinette Casados: Yes.

481
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:39.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so for waking up ideal. So let's start with a plan. So let's start lead routine week up

482
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:49.860
Jocelyn Corrales: So let's set out. Let's put back your routine your early morning routine like waking up early in the morning.

483
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.370
Antoinette Casados: Right. I think I do. Just go to bed early and wake up early.

484
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true. Because if you sleep late you also wake up late.

485
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Wake up at around

486
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.520
Jocelyn Corrales: You mentioned you wake up at around 10 to 11, why not do it at around eight to nine.

487
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Nine, then maybe later on, we could do.

488
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Six to seven. But let's start with 89

489
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you're already used to waking up at around 10 already

490
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.470
Jocelyn Corrales: So let's do eight o'clock in the morning.

491
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Eight o'clock.

492
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.520
Jocelyn Corrales: And set up an alarm.

493
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.030
Jocelyn Corrales: To wake you up.

494
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Do morning exercises.

495
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:52.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you don't get to exercise a lot

496
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:58.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could do. You know, you don't need to go outside to exercise, you could actually you have a yoga mat.

497
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.800
Antoinette Casados: They don't know

498
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, you can just

499
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.160
Antoinette Casados: Put in time that I

500
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:05.880
Have

501
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:09.000
Jocelyn Corrales: If you have a towel.

502
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:18.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you have a map or a carpet or a towel. You could use that as you know so that you can exercise on the floor.

503
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Are up a rubber mats this mine.

504
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:30.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, if it's some of the some of the carpets are rubberized below so you could also use if you have some carpets there.

505
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.570
Jocelyn Corrales: And

506
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:40.110
Jocelyn Corrales: And we'd be good. So you're eating, you don't eat breakfast. But you do eat lunch and dinner.

507
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.770
Antoinette Casados: Yes.

508
00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:54.210
Jocelyn Corrales: But you eat on time, just like just, you just don't eat breakfast.

509
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.000
Antoinette Casados: Right.

510
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:05.340
Jocelyn Corrales: But maybe you could eat some snacks, you know, healthy snacks probably like fruits, how

511
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:05.850
Antoinette Casados: Did you

512
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.260
Jocelyn Corrales: eat lunch later on.

513
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.140
Antoinette Casados: Okay.

514
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:17.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried eating a piece, maybe just an egg, you know, and just an egg in a bread in the morning just that, then you know proceed with lunch.

515
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.550
Jocelyn Corrales: Eggs and bread or, you know,

516
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Your room.

517
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:21.810
Well,

518
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:39.540
Antoinette Casados: Heavy sometimes for like a breakfast meal. So like for lunch on making eggs or potatoes or omelet romantic or something, I'll eat sometimes breakfast for lunch because you know I had just woken up kindly in

519
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:40.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh,

520
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.960
Antoinette Casados: I first meals like kind of stuff.

521
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:48.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, but before when you were going to work when you go to work you do you usually eat breakfast.

522
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.490
Antoinette Casados: Know, I'll take like little snacks like a

523
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:54.900
Antoinette Casados: Like

524
00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:02.730
Antoinette Casados: It's like, like I guess like sweet stuff. I do want to see. So sorry, like sweets or

525
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.640
Antoinette Casados: Something to work on.

526
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:14.970
Antoinette Casados: A cookie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, cookies, or sometimes I'll take chips and I'll eat that, like in the morning because I do get hungry. As soon as I get to work on.

527
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:16.050
Jocelyn Corrales: The we're

528
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.890
Antoinette Casados: Like a couple after hours after I'd been absolved trying to take a little bit of snacks.

529
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.110
Antoinette Casados: to snack on until it's time for lunch.

530
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:31.110
Jocelyn Corrales: And so what's the reason why you're not eating breakfast. Is it because you lack of time of eating because you have to go to work or

531
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you

532
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:45.510
Antoinette Casados: Just yes and I don't have an appetite. Yeah, I just don't feel like I have an appetite. When I first wake up. It takes about a couple hours and me up and doing things before I create that appetite.

533
00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.570
Antoinette Casados: I think that's the biggest issue that

534
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:53.910
Antoinette Casados: You're having the appetite for it. Yeah. Usually, I don't have time in the morning when I'm getting work.

535
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:55.680
Antoinette Casados: So it's kind of like

536
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.840
Jocelyn Corrales: No usually busy my routine again.

537
00:50:59.130 --> 00:50:59.610
Antoinette Casados: Yeah.

538
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Why not try making a sandwich.

539
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:12.390
Jocelyn Corrales: The night before, so that when you go to work, you could, you know, just in case you don't have time to eat your breakfast instead of eating the chips.

540
00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:21.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Or instead of eating sweets things in the morning, bring a sandwich with us so that when you're at work and you feel hungry you eat you eat that sandwich for breakfast.

541
00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:24.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Just in case you go back to work.

542
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:24.420
Jocelyn Corrales: On it.

543
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:24.930
Antoinette Casados: Okay.

544
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.430
Jocelyn Corrales: But since you're just at home.

545
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.950
Jocelyn Corrales: He's very cool.

546
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.280
Antoinette Casados: Okay.

547
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Or maybe your mom could prepare your sandwich. I think your mom also wakes up early.

548
00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:03.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Every other, you could always tell her to Mom, can you prepare me a sandwich to that they could bring it to work. Just in case you get back to her.

549
00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:12.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Because maybe the next time maybe the next time I'll meet you, you will be, you know, we're not sure if everything, but you might be going back to her.

550
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:14.400
Jocelyn Corrales: You've got, you know,

551
00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.180
Exactly.

552
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:16.800
Antoinette Casados: You know,

553
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:23.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, we didn't know anything yet. But, you know, we could assume that you might be going back to work with beer.

554
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:24.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Cream Sandwich.

555
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.600

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.350
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

705
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:23.700
Jocelyn Corrales: So this is everything that we talked about. And I've placed here the plan. So our daily routine, wake up. So let's put you back on your routine to wake up at around eight o'clock, so let's make sure that you set up an alarm to wake you up in the morning, so that you won't be able to

706
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:40.470
Jocelyn Corrales: Sleep until the late morning and do some morning exercise because you know when you when you try to set up your time again early in the morning, you feel tired because you still feel sleepy do some morning exercise so weak body cells.

707
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:42.030
Jocelyn Corrales: And then

708
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Making you eat routinely

709
01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:56.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Place in here that you don't eat breakfast. But, you know, you mentioned you've also mentioned that before going to work before having lunch you feel hungry already in

710
01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:03.990
Jocelyn Corrales: The reason why you're not eating breakfast, because it's because you don't have appetite or probably you don't have the time to do it.

711
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:17.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Before going to work. So maybe before going to work. Ask your mother or request your mother to prepare a sandwich for you so that you could bring it to work in that instead of eating those sweet cookies or

712
01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:25.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Junk food. Try eating the sandwich that she made you for breakfast, so that you know you know it.

713
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.820
Jocelyn Corrales: It would keep you energized. Because if you're just only eating cookie.

714
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Or eating junk food.

715
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.230
Jocelyn Corrales: You keep on eating more. You tend to eat a lot of snacks.

716
01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:54.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Before before lunch because you would still feel how you it's like one one small bag of chips is not enough. So you have to open another like cookies or something else. So, you tend to do snack of eating a meal. So let's eat a sandwich to keep going until lunchtime.

717
01:08:56.130 --> 01:09:04.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Then while you are still not working. I just placed here because you're not still working tried to eat life request, you could actually eat sandwich. If you think

718
01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:13.110
Jocelyn Corrales: The swine for you could eat sandwich. You could eat eggs or anything that you think he's just like to keep you because you wake up with our own eight

719
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:23.790
Jocelyn Corrales: This very near lunchtime. So just eat the light breakfast. But if you're already waking up at around six o'clock. Like, for example, your, your routine is already six o'clock because we just started with eight

720
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:36.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Then maybe two weeks after we could do seven so we could do eight o'clock right now. Then after two weeks, we could do seven o'clock. Then after two weeks, we could do maybe 630 and once you're already waking up at around

721
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:47.220
Jocelyn Corrales: An earlier time like around six o'clock he could maybe have some a bit of a heavy meal or heavy breakfast or it just medium type of meal breakfast.

722
01:09:48.510 --> 01:10:03.750
Jocelyn Corrales: And tapering down I you can see my screen right tapering down on doctor. Yes. Yes. Let's start with I think I have placed in the upper portion in the in the one that they have listed down that we're going to start with.

723
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:12.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Two to three then wanted to do three then to then want to do then one until you're able to drink.

724
01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:28.200
Jocelyn Corrales: About three or four times in a week and then three cans in a week then to cancel until you're just going to drink. If you're craving and replace that Dr. Pepper which projects or does it case you if you it would interest you.

725
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:36.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Vegetable sheets, but I'm not really fond of fashionable shakes. I am I am I am a fan of projects but

726
01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Just in case you don't want to eat breakfast, you could do.

727
01:10:42.090 --> 01:10:53.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Usually there are some patients that I have that don't eat breakfast. But if you eat breakfast, which shakes are fine, but if you do not eat breakfast. Maybe you could do a combination of fruit and vegetable shakes.

728
01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:03.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Next is early morning to be fit and healthy just do some morning exercise, you know, you could do some basic exercise or basic yoga.

729
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:09.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, and

730
01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.210
Jocelyn Corrales: And

731
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:26.520
Jocelyn Corrales: take your mind off things and keep yourself busy. You could do gardening coloring and being handcrafted in low and other hand crafts, or maybe make power cord bracelet and when, having a bad mood, try to, you know,

732
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:34.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Be alone and do some self meditation, you could do listen, you could listen some music. So, you know, you could

733
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Set your mood back to

734
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:48.300
Jocelyn Corrales: The usual and attend church online services and go to bed at around 10 o'clock, just in case you're not able to sleep so

735
01:11:50.370 --> 01:12:01.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Before 10 o'clock at least around nine o'clock, try to do some workout exercise or probably if you don't feel like doing exercise, you could do some relaxation techniques or self meditation.

736
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:16.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried to listing down your plans. Although, by the time you go to work. You don't really need a the blend. But usually, if you're just at home. What I usually suggest is that you create the day plan or a weekly plan.

737
01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.100
Jocelyn Corrales: So that you would remember what to do for today.

738
01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:28.710

742
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:43.230
That

743
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:55.530
Jocelyn Corrales: We could do a daily plan, you could create a daily tasks that it keeps it keeps you on track of things and you know you know you can do these things and it keeps you reminded of what to do.
