Dominique Pozo: It's going pretty well how are you

4
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.809
Nathaniel Sims: Good. I'm sorry I'm late again.

5
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.670
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I was

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.400
Nathaniel Sims: Trying to get truck tires on my truck.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.730
Dominique Pozo: No.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.550
Nathaniel Sims: No, they didn't have them in stock.

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.560
Dominique Pozo: Well, well, what would you like to focus on today.

10
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.700
Nathaniel Sims: I'm not sure.

11
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.350
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

12
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.270
Dominique Pozo: Um,

13
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
Dominique Pozo: Would it be helpful to start with a little mindfulness and kind of connect with yourself a little more deeply.

14
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. All right, so

15
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.770
Dominique Pozo: Why don't you go ahead

16
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.240
Dominique Pozo: Just

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.950
Dominique Pozo: Get

18
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.590
Dominique Pozo: Into a comfortable seated position so you

19
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.070
Dominique Pozo: Can really settle in and close your eyes.

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.620
Dominique Pozo: And just bring that attention in words to your breath.

21
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.940
Dominique Pozo: Just noticing the inhale.

22
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.170
Dominique Pozo: Exhale, and the quality of those two action.

23
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.550
Dominique Pozo: Just starting to scan the rest of your body. And notice whatever sensations, he might be feeling or what you become aware of when you actually pay

24
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.150
Dominique Pozo: Close attention.

25
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430
Dominique Pozo: Just allow your attention to kind of get really loose and let it kind of

26
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:13.740
Dominique Pozo: land somewhere and then stick to that place where your attention goes and take a few deep breaths. There just noticing whatever it is about that part of your body. Now that hold your attention.

27
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.270
Dominique Pozo: To your feet and just noticing your feet on the ground.

28
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.590
Dominique Pozo: And if you want to kind of lift your toes up a little bit and

29
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:36.900
Dominique Pozo: Just notice the contact with your feet to whatever whatever some surface. They're making contact. It could be your socks your shoes. The ground beneath you, the floor, whatever it is, just feel the texture of that.

30
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.260
Dominique Pozo: And then bring your attention to your body, your spine and just noticing the

31
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.690
Dominique Pozo: Spine

32
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.310
Dominique Pozo: And then just take a moment to connect with

33
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.190
Dominique Pozo: You know what, if you can shift your attention out your emotional body. What's the most present emotion that you can make contact with

34
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.190
Nathaniel Sims: I'm feeling kind of down today.

35
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.660
Dominique Pozo: Do you have anything trigger that or do you know what that's connected to

36
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.000
Nathaniel Sims: Maybe it's just

37
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.210
Nathaniel Sims: Work or

38
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.770
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know, maybe it's a

39
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.500
Nathaniel Sims: Maybe it's this whole virus thing, you know, not being able to get out.

40
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.070
Nathaniel Sims: And

41
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.620
Dominique Pozo: They real and yeah, definitely. Yeah.

42
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.180
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's

43
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.000
Dominique Pozo: Really valid. So

44
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.780
Dominique Pozo: Is there anything in your, you know,

45
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.390
Dominique Pozo: In your home space that does bring you joy that you can do and connects with

46
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.300
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I got a couple of

47
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.580
Nathaniel Sims: TOXINS THAT I

48
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.360
Nathaniel Sims: Have a fan for a long time and they

49
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.120
Nathaniel Sims: Like my little babies.

50
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.430
Dominique Pozo: Wow, all

51
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.430
Nathaniel Sims: Right. Yeah. You know, there's nothing like coming home to a dog because they

52
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:50.850
Nathaniel Sims: They don't, they don't know what you're going through what you're doing. They just know that you're home. You know, and they just want to

53
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.600
Nathaniel Sims: Hang out with you, you know, so it's it's kind of like unconditional

54
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.310
Nathaniel Sims: Love. I guess that they show you

55
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.830
Dominique Pozo: Whoa, yeah, definitely.

56
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.360
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

57
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.010
Dominique Pozo: So there's some joy that you're experiencing by having them.

58
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:21.150
Dominique Pozo: To take care of and to they also give you, they offer you some joy as well.

59
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.130
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

60
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.870
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's nice to have some purpose and meaning that's past work at the moment.

61
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.320
Nathaniel Sims: Mm hmm. Yeah, I am.

62
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:40.350
Nathaniel Sims: I enjoy. You know that night when I when I walk them like that that's the time to

63
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.370
Nathaniel Sims: kind of reflect, you know, and think about the day and then

64
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.280
Nathaniel Sims: You know, for a while there I I hardly ever got out and walk them.

65
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:57.180
Nathaniel Sims: But recently, since I've started the program that's kind of been my goal, you know,

66
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.580
Nathaniel Sims: And it's, I find it really therapeutic

67
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.620
Dominique Pozo: Tender. What I didn't hear it.

68
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.470
Nathaniel Sims: I find it. I find it very therapeutic.

69
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.040
Nathaniel Sims: To walk them.

70
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:13.890
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

71
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:25.020
Dominique Pozo: So, what, what would you like to be doing that, you're not able to do right now so that we can just name it.

72
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.720
Nathaniel Sims: All right, well, I'm a musician, but I haven't been playing music, very much.

73
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.550
Nathaniel Sims: Lately,

74
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:44.340
Nathaniel Sims: I am also I also like to do artwork and sculpt and paint drawn stuff.

75
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.670
Nathaniel Sims: I have not done that in a long time.

76
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.850
Nathaniel Sims: It for one is like finding the time

77
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.200
Nathaniel Sims: To do it but

78
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.910
Nathaniel Sims: I guess the other thing is like

79
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.490
Nathaniel Sims: Finding a space to do it. And, you know, they're like, I play the drums and that's

80
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.830
Nathaniel Sims: It's not really

81
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.100
Nathaniel Sims: You know other people in the house, don't really enjoy that.

82
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.850
As much as

83
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.650
Dominique Pozo: I

84
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.220
Dominique Pozo: Oh I I played percussion too and I have the neighbors yelling at me sometimes to shut up. Yeah.

85
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.720
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

86
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:40.860
Nathaniel Sims: I gotta find time to do it when they're either go shopping or at work or something.

87
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.170
Nathaniel Sims: But

88
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:45.720
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

89
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.240
Dominique Pozo: Well, how about the the art making that seems like something that you wouldn't impact anyone else.

90
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.130
Nathaniel Sims: Right, yeah.

91
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.920
Nathaniel Sims: For that, I guess would be like finding a space in the house here to set up a little

92
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.460
Nathaniel Sims: Like I guess a little studio to

93
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:19.950
Nathaniel Sims: And I have the space at but the space is being taken up by other things. But, I mean, I could, I can move those things around and

94
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.860
Nathaniel Sims: That I have not had the motivation to do that up to this point.

95
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:40.380
Dominique Pozo: So these things to me. I could be wrong but they sound like things that are accessible to you. Actually, I'm wondering when you said the whole covert things getting to you, does it mean like being able to do that with other people or

96
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:50.250
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, like hanging out with friends because that's like, you know, playing music, you know, if I can't do it here. I, I used to do it.

97
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.100
Nathaniel Sims: With friends, you know, but everybody so paranoid. They don't want it.

98
00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.280
Nathaniel Sims: They. I mean, I get it. They don't want

99
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.500
Nathaniel Sims: That to be brought into the their house, you know,

100
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:17.310
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, it's just been like, yeah, I mean we talked on the phone and whatnot. But it's like trying to actually get together. It's, yeah, that's just been difficult, and then

101
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.980
Nathaniel Sims: I mean,

102
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.700
Nathaniel Sims: Just doing things outside of the house, which is something I

103
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.640
Nathaniel Sims: enjoy doing. And it helped out a lot.

104
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.060
Nathaniel Sims: With my sanity. I guess it has not been

105
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.440
Nathaniel Sims: It has not been here for the last few weeks.

106
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.720
Nathaniel Sims: Just having one on one with other

107
00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.820
Okay.

108
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.610
Dominique Pozo: Reception keeps going to not I'm

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.850
Dominique Pozo: Sorry, I need to blow my nose this bug went up my nose.

110
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.500
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.770

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.860
Dominique Pozo: On the north shore.

115
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.880
Nathaniel Sims: I have an aunt that lives in Hawaii.

116
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:45.420
Nathaniel Sims: Oh, OK. We used to go there every other year as a family when I was younger.

117
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:46.200
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

118
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.410
Nathaniel Sims: So, I, I've been to. I've been to, I think I've been to every island.

119
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.300
Nathaniel Sims: At least once.

120
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.400
Dominique Pozo: Oh, cool.

121
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.040
Nathaniel Sims: Actually collide and in the Big Island.

122
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.600
Dominique Pozo: Food. Yeah, it's really special. I feel so blessed to be here and

123
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.500
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah yeah i i. That's why I learned how to surf.

124
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.550
Oh,

125
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:20.220
Nathaniel Sims: And then when I moved to Oregon. I had a friend and he said yes. The surfing is huge in Oregon. And I was like, what he's like yeah, the water's cold but

126
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:28.980
Nathaniel Sims: You just get a wetsuit, you know, and I said, Oh, wow. Alright, so once I learned that I was out there every weekend, you know,

127
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.420
Nathaniel Sims: That he did say there, there were. It was one of the most populated shores for great whites.

128
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.660
Dominique Pozo: Gosh. Yeah. Yeah. That's scary.

129
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.930
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, so, but I didn't run into any

130
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:53.310
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah, I know it's surfing. It's such a joy. Oh, yeah, yeah.

131
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.320
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, when my friends here. They don't believe that I should serve

132
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:08.340
Nathaniel Sims: Uh huh. Um, yeah, we're landlocked here, but that doesn't mean I didn't spend my summers in a place that had beaches, you know,

133
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.000
Oh,

134
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.190
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

135
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:25.830
Dominique Pozo: So, so what can be maybe three actions you can take in the next week to start to bring in some more fulfillment.

136
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.920
Nathaniel Sims: All right, again, guess I would like to

137
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.580
Nathaniel Sims: exercise more.

138
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.490
Nathaniel Sims: I walked that I've been walking the dogs now and that's great.

139
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.540
Nathaniel Sims: But I feel like

140
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.540
Nathaniel Sims: The

141
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.550
Nathaniel Sims: Especially when I get the cravings, the exercising really helps.

142
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.580
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, it really, really helps.

143
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.750
Nathaniel Sims: Me and I want to do that more and then

144
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:17.430
Nathaniel Sims: The other thing is my art, music, I guess I could

145
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.170
Nathaniel Sims: I could set aside a time where

146
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.580
Nathaniel Sims: I can tell the other people in the house here that

147
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.080
Nathaniel Sims: That I am going to be doing this.

148
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.920
Nathaniel Sims: At this time, and if they could

149
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:36.930
Nathaniel Sims: Maybe

150
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.540
Nathaniel Sims: Find something else to do outside the house. I'm not disturbing.

151
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.910
Nathaniel Sims: Make a schedule for your music and then

152
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.660
Dominique Pozo: Wait, I want to hear. The third thing, I'm just getting a little busy with the movement, can you

153
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.570
Dominique Pozo: Be willing to just place your phone.

154
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.320
Dominique Pozo: Somewhere.

155
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:04.410
Dominique Pozo: Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm like, my eyes are going back and forth like I started making my head.

156
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.030
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, I'm sorry.

157
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.620
Dominique Pozo: Thank you. Okay.

158
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.580
Nathaniel Sims: Um, but yeah, I guess I could make

159
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.690
Nathaniel Sims: I can make a little spot and a house here to

160
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.210
Nathaniel Sims: For artwork.

161
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.340
Dominique Pozo: So exercise.

162
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.790
Dominique Pozo: The artwork made, you know, asking for

163
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.640
Dominique Pozo: Your, your roommates to

164
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.770
Dominique Pozo: Kind of work with you so that you can have some time and space to do that express

165
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:33.420
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

166
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.320
Nathaniel Sims: And

167
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:43.890
Nathaniel Sims: Oh,

168
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.870
Nathaniel Sims: Reading

169
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.890
Nathaniel Sims: I have. I used to read a lot

170
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.380
Nathaniel Sims: And I've collected a books with the intent of reading them.

171
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.510
Nathaniel Sims: But I haven't been doing that, but I'd like to, I'd like to get back to reading

172
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.460
Dominique Pozo: What is what's what is one of the first book, you would want to read and pick up

173
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.910
Nathaniel Sims: I have a book by the drummer Travis Barker, who is for the band.

174
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.360
Nathaniel Sims: He plays for the band blink 182

175
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.420
Dominique Pozo: I don't know. Yeah.

176
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:39.480
Nathaniel Sims: And he, he went through a series of drug addiction and he actually almost died him and one of his best friends were in a plane crash.

177
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.660
Nathaniel Sims: When they were on tour.

178
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.320
Nathaniel Sims: And he survived, but his friend didn't

179
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.660
Nathaniel Sims: And

180
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:59.400
Nathaniel Sims: After that, he, he became addicted to pain pills, because of the, the, all the surgeries and whatnot, that they did.

181
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.220
Nathaniel Sims: But anyway, he wrote the book. It's called. Can I say

182
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.800
Nathaniel Sims: And it talks about him coming up through the band.

183
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.050
Nathaniel Sims: And

184
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.160
Nathaniel Sims: And then, and then getting through his addiction.

185
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.010
Nathaniel Sims: But I, my, my mom gave that to me for Christmas and I haven't read it yet.

186
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.030
Hmm.

187
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:34.470
Dominique Pozo: Great. That sounds like a good one really maybe something you can identify with and and possibly get some hope from

188
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.370
Yeah.

189
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.860
Dominique Pozo: And there's there's another great book by Anthony kiedis from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's called

190
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.990
Dominique Pozo: Scar tissue. Have you read scar tissue.

191
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.720
Nathaniel Sims: No, I, but I know who he is. Yeah.

192
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.250
Dominique Pozo: It's a really good one to he he really shares his journey with addiction.

193
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.430
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, yeah, I'm very familiar with his history.

194
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.370
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well those sound like three pretty concrete and doable things

195
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. Seems like just taking some action and maybe getting getting yourself.

196
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:31.440
Dominique Pozo: Engaged on was gonna, you know, potentially support, support you.

197
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.550
Yeah.

198
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.690
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, yeah, that's, I just, you know, once I

199
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.840
Nathaniel Sims: Once I start something you know I I pretty much finished it, you know, so

200
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:53.610
Nathaniel Sims: I know that if I just like set up a schedule for the music and I set up a spot for the art.

201
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.330
Nathaniel Sims: And I set up a time to read

202
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.520
Nathaniel Sims: I'll do it. I just need to take that first step.

203
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:06.450
Yeah.

204
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.310
Dominique Pozo: Did we watch. Did we watch that.

205
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.500
Dominique Pozo: Ted Talk by Mel Robbins, did I play that for your group.

206
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.310
Nathaniel Sims: No I while you might have, but I hadn't seen it. No.

207
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.590
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna play it for you. It's really great. I think it might be

208
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.040
Dominique Pozo: Inspiring for what you're talking about.

209
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.540
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

210
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.680
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm gonna share this now.

211
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.310
Dominique Pozo: Let me know if you can hear this. Just give me a thumbs up if you could hear it.

212
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.330
Do it. And the reason why I want you to do. It is

213
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.980
Dominique Pozo: Can get

214
00:22:49.980 --> 00:23:05.130
blinding light. Hi, everybody. How are you fine. Oh my gosh. Okay, so my name is Mel Robbins. And for the last 17 years I have done nothing but help people get everything that they want.

215
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.300
Within reason my husband's here.

216
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:22.740
Nathaniel Sims: And so I've done it in the courtroom in the board room in the bedroom in people's living room, whatever room. You want to be in. If I'm there. I will help you get whatever you want, by any means necessary.

217
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:41.280
Nathaniel Sims: For the last three years I've host I host a syndicated radio show, five days a week, I go live and 40 cities and I talked to men and women across America who feel stuck. Do you know that a third of Americans feel dissatisfied with their lives right now.

218
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:48.570
Nathaniel Sims: That is 100 million people. That's insane.

219
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:58.230
And I've come face to face with it. And this new show that I'm doing which is also insane. It's called in laws. I move in with families across America.

220
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.280
Nathaniel Sims: You guessed it, who are at war with their in once

221
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.520
Dominique Pozo: Move them into the same house.

222
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.860
Dominique Pozo: I verbally assassinate everybody

223
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:24.360
Nathaniel Sims: We opened up Pandora's box and I get people to stop arguing about the donuts and who's hosting Thanksgiving dinner and talk about the real stuff. And that's what I want to talk to you about

224
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.280
I'm here for you.

225
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:32.940
I'm going to tell you everything I know. In less than 18 minutes about how to get what you want.

226
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:44.640
So I want you to take a millisecond right now. And I want you to think about what you want. You and I want you to be selfish screw Simon in the we think this is about me right now.

227
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.100
Sorry, Simon.

228
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.840
What do you want, and here's the deal. I don't want it to sound good to other people.

229
00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:04.650
being healthy will not get your ass on a treadmill losing your man boobs. So you could hook up with somebody. Now that's motivation.

230
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.250
Nathaniel Sims: So I want

231
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:24.900
Dominique Pozo: To know what do you want, do you want to lose weight. Do you want to triple your income, do you want to start a nonprofit. Do you want to find love. What is it, get it right here. You know what it is. Don't and analyze it to death. Just pick something that's part of the problem.

232
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.970
You won't pick

233
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.180
So we're gonna be talking about how you get what you want.

234
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.760
And frankly, getting what you want is simple.

235
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.670
But notice I didn't say it was easy.

236
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.000
It's very simple.

237
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:54.870
In fact, if you think about it. We live in the most amazing moment in time so that thing that you have up here.

238
00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:11.880
Whatever it may be. You want to use healthy eating to cure your diabetes, you want to figure out how to take care of the elders and start a new hospice center you want to move to Africa and build a school, guess what, you could walk into a bookstore right now.

239
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.730
And by least

240
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.650
10 books written by credentialed experts on how the hell you doing

241
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:37.350
Dominique Pozo: You could Google it and you can probably find at least I don't know 1000 blogs documenting the step by step by step transformation that somebody else is already doing. You can find anybody on cyber stalk them.

242
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:45.570
Nathaniel Sims: You can just walk in their footsteps and let that, you know, just use the science of drafting follow what everyone else has done because somebody else has already

243
00:26:46.950 --> 00:27:00.780
So why don't you have what you want when you have all the information that you need. You have the contacts that you need. There are probably free tools online that allow you to start a business or join a group or do whatever the heck you want

244
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.410
It all comes down to one word.

245
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.690
Dominique Pozo: Shut the front door. You know what I'm talking about.

246
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.010
Nathaniel Sims: The F bomb. It's everywhere.

247
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:25.500
Dominique Pozo: You hear it all the time and I honestly don't understand what the appeal is of the word. I mean, you don't sound smart when you say it.

248
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.510
And it's really not expressing how you really feel

249
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:38.520
It's sort of a cheap, you know, shot to take. And of course, you know, I'm talking about the word

250
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.560
Fine.

251
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.230
Nathaniel Sims: How you doing, I'm fine.

252
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:55.500
Nathaniel Sims: Oh really, you are dragging around those extra 40 pounds, you're fine. Feeling like roommates with your spouse and you're fine. You haven't had sex in four months, you're fine.

253
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:56.550
Really

254
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.940
I don't think so.

255
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:10.110
But see, here's the deal was saying that you're fine. It's actually genius. Because if you're fine. You don't have to do anything about it.

256
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:26.790
Nathaniel Sims: But when you think about this word, fine. It just makes me so angry. I mean, here we are at a conference about being alive and you're going to describe the experience of being alive as find a flimsy and feeble word

257
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:43.560
Nathaniel Sims: Your crappy say your crappy if you're amazing say you're amazing. Tell the truth. And this not only goes for the social construct. Oh, I don't want to burden you with the fact that I hate my life for you. I am amazing but that would make you feel terrible. The bigger issue.

258
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.090
The bigger issue with fine is that you say to yourself.

259
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:56.490
That thing that you want. I guarantee you, you've convinced yourself that you're fine, not having it.

260
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.030
That's why you're not pushing yourself.

261
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:14.760
Nathaniel Sims: It's the areas in your life where you've given up where you've said, Oh, I'm fine. I, my mom's never going to change. So I just can't have that conversation. I'm fine. You know, we gotta wait until the kids graduate before we get divorced. So we'll just leave in separate bedrooms.

262
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:21.600
Nathaniel Sims: I'm fine. I lost my job. I can barely pay my bills, but whatever. It's hard to get a job.

263
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:39.180
And, you know, one of the reasons why this word also just annoys me so much is scientists have calculated. Oh yeah, I'm coming down. Scientists have calculated the odds

264
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.080
Of you being born.

265
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.700
That's right. They've crunched the numbers. I see you up there.

266
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:56.820
They have crunched the numbers on you. Yeah, I know you guys standing up. You want to sit down for this. They've crunched the numbers on you being born.

267
00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:10.770
And they took into account all of the wars and the natural disasters and the dinosaurs and everything else. And do you realize that the odds

268
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.780
Dominique Pozo: The odds of you. Yeah, right here, put your computer. We stand up for me, Doug.

269
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:26.160
So the odds of Doug. Your turn around. Say hi to everybody, the odds yeah of Doug. Doug being born.

270
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:34.140
At the moment in time. He was born to the parents. You were born to with the DNA structure that you have

271
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.080
100 or no one and 400 trillion

272
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.800
Isn't that amazing so lucky. Yes.

273
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:53.100
Nathaniel Sims: You're not fine. You're fantastic you have life changing ideas for a reason. And it's not the torture yourself.

274
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.210
Dominique Pozo: Thank you. Thank you, Doug.

275
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:08.640
Nathaniel Sims: You know, Christy was right when she said all of you could be on stage because all of you. We're all in this category one and 400 trillion

276
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:18.870
All day long, you have ideas that could change your life that could change the world that could change the way that you feel and what do you do with them.

277
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.460
Nothing.

278
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:22.650
Hopefully I won't moon, you

279
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.860
Didn't pay for that.

280
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:38.010
And I want you to just think for a minute because we all have. I love to use the analogy. The inner snooze button.

281
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:46.440
You have these amazing ideas that bubble up right you've been watching people all day and I guarantee you, like, you know, ping pong balls. Boom, boom, Mama, mama, mama got idea with

282
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.120
Me and every time you have an idea. What do you do it says

283
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.270
What's the first decision you made this morning.

284
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.030
I bet it was to go back to bed.

285
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.620
Nathaniel Sims: First decision today morning

286
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:16.920
And I get it, your bed is comfortable. It's cozy it's warm if you're lucky, you've got, you know, like somebody that you love next to you or in my case, I've got my husband and my two kids and possibly the dog.

287
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:27.180
And the reason why I'm bringing up this first decision that you made today and the inner snooze alarm.

288
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.270
Is because in any area of your life.

289
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.300
That you want to change any

290
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:38.940
There's one fact that you need to know.

291
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.620
Just one.

292
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:45.810
You're never gonna feel like it.

293
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:49.980
Ever

294
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.070
No one's coming motivation isn't happening. You're never gonna feel like it.

295
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:11.460
Scientists call it activation energy. That's what they call the force required to get you to change from what you're doing on autopilot to do something new. So try this test tomorrow. You think you're so fancy. I know you're attending

296
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.820
Try this.

297
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.860
Tomorrow morning, set your alarm for 30 minutes earlier.

298
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:28.140
And then when it goes off, take those sheets, throw them off and stand up and start your day.

299
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.770
No snooze no delay. No, I'll just wait here for five seconds is Mel's not standing here.

300
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:51.180
Do it. And the reason why I want you to do it is because you will come face to face with the physical and I mean physical force that's required to change your behavior.

301
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:58.500
Do you think that somebody who needs to lose weight ever feels like going on a diet, of course.

302
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:05.580
Do you think they ever feel like eating boiled chicken and peas instead of a croissant. I'll think so.

303
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:25.290
The activation energy required to get your ass away from your computer and out your front door to go on the walk. You said that you were going to go on is the exact same amount of force that it takes you to push yourself out of a warm bed and into a cold room.

304
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:32.640
What's interesting about being an adult is that when you become a teen

305
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.820
Nobody tells you that it's now going to be your job to pair it yourself.

306
00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:56.010
Dominique Pozo: And by parent yourself. I mean, it's your job to make yourself do the crap. You don't want to do so you can be everything that you're supposed to be. And you're so damn Busy waiting to feel like it.

307
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.230
And you're never going to

308
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.780
Dominique Pozo: My son never feels like getting office ds. That's my job. Get off the damn ds.

309
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.010
Dominique Pozo: Candle clean up the Barbies. If you're going to have a nude party in my bag, please clean and

310
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.350
Dominique Pozo: God shoe with your mouth closed in a barn, for crying out loud.

311
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.920
Dominique Pozo: Alright dinners coming. Get out of the pantry.

312
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:33.900
As parents, and you are a kid your parents make you do the things you don't feel like doing because you won't

313
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:35.640
Ever

314
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.060
Dominique Pozo: Not now, not, not ever.

315
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.410
And even when you get good at something you'll figure out something else. You don't want to do

316
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:50.640
And then you'll plateau and you'll get boring. I hate this. This is boring. But we look for. No, no, you'll just bitch about that one.

317
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.640
Nathaniel Sims: It's very, very simple to get what you want. But it's not easy.

318
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.420
You have to force yourself.

319
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.510
And I mean force.

320
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:17.880
And the reason why I use the word force when roz's up here and talking about the emotion tracking and share the picture of the two sides of the brain.

321
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:34.230
Dominique Pozo: I look at the brain, the exact same way. Only I described one side of your brain is autopilot and the other side is emergency brake. That's the only two speed you get autopilot emergency brake and guess which one your brain likes better autopilot.

322
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.320
Nathaniel Sims: You've had the experience where you've driven to work right.

323
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.360
Dominique Pozo: You get there, like, oh my god, I remember driving here.

324
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.660
Nathaniel Sims: You're drunk.

325
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.550
That was your brain on autopilot. It was functioning just at this level.

326
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:56.820
And the problem with your mind is that anytime you do anything that's different from your normal routine. Guess what your brain does emergency brake.

327
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:11.130
And it has that reaction for everything. Everything you walk into the kitchen and you see everybody's left their breakfast dishes for you and you think for the hundredth time I'm going to kill them. In fact, I'm gonna leave them here and I'm gonna make them do it.

328
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.960
But that's not your normal routine. Is it your mind goes to the break.

329
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.150
Dominique Pozo: And you go right into autopilot. I'll just load it and be kissed not have sex.

330
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:34.020
Nathaniel Sims: So when I say force anything that's a break from your routine is going to require force.

331
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:47.040
Dominique Pozo: And if you think about your life. It's kind of funny because we, you know, are kids. And then we become adults we spend so much time trying to push our life into some sort of stable routine. And then we got bored of it.

332
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:55.200
He wake up at what the same time every day you have largely the same breakfast you drive to work the same way you show up at work. You look busy.

333
00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:03.120
You avoid making calls you update Facebook you attend a meeting and doodle. The whole time you go back and update Facebook and make plans for the evening you love busy some more.

334
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:12.870
Than you drive home the same way, largely the same dinner or, you know, variety of it, you watch the same kind of media and then you go to bed and do the same thing all over again. No wonder you're bored out of your mind.

335
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.930
It's the routine that's killing you.

336
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:27.390
I have this theory about why people get stuck in life. So most of you have probably taken your basic psych 101 class and you've bumped into Andrew Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

337
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:37.710
Well, your body is kind of cool because you have these basic needs and your body is wired to send you signals.

338
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.690
If you are hungry or I mean if you need food. What do you feel

339
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.660
If you need water. What do you feel

340
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.590
Nathaniel Sims: If you need sex. What do you feel. Thank you.

341
00:38:52.770 --> 00:39:06.810
Nathaniel Sims: I think when you feel stuck or dissatisfied in your life. It's a signal and it's not a signal that your life is broken. It's a signal that one of your most basic needs are not being met.

342
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.540
Your need for exploration

343
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:28.650
Everything about your life about your body grows, your cells regenerate your hair, your nails everything grows for your entire life and your soul needs exploration and growth and the only way you'll get it is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.

344
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.170
forcing yourself.

345
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.070
To get outside

346
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:42.090
Dominique Pozo: Out of your head. Thank you. If you're in your head, you're behind enemy lines that is not God. Talking Okay, it's not

347
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:48.600
Dominique Pozo: In fact, if I put a speaker on it and we broadcast what you say to yourself, we institutionalize you

348
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:56.040
Dominique Pozo: You would not hang out with people that talk to you the way you talk to yourself. So get out of your head.

349
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:11.940
Your feelings, your feelings are screwing you I don't care how you feel. I care about what you want and if you listen to how you feel when it comes to what you want. You will not get it.

350
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.060
Because you will never feel like it.

351
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:27.870
Nathaniel Sims: And you need to get outside your comfort zone. It's not about taking risks, it's about getting outside your comfort zone those first three seconds.

352
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.240
Dominique Pozo: When you push yourself out of bed. They blow.

353
00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.240
But once you're up. It's great.

354
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:42.960
Those first three seconds when you're sitting here in a studio or stadium like this. And somebody says, Get up and come dance and you think, Oh, I should do that. And you're like,

355
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.040
That experience that you had where you had the impulse

356
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:51.990
To do it.

357
00:40:53.430 --> 00:41:05.400
And then you didn't do the activation energy required to force yourself, your emergency brake uphold I'm sitting right here. I'm not going up with those crazy people. I don't like the dancer, Amy. Amy, Amy. Amy, Amy.

358
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:24.990
What happened for me is I came up and I bumped into Rachel and then we started talking and next thing you know she's tweeting and we're friends and boom, get outside. That's where the magic is that's where the one and 400 trillion exists.

359
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:33.030
So everything I do. Oh wait, okay, this is the last part. Sorry. So one more thing that you can use. I call it the five second rule.

360
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:41.100
Your mind can process a facial expression in 33 milliseconds.

361
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.560
It can move pretty damn quick

362
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:51.960
The other thing that it does very quickly, is if you have one of those little impulses that are pulling you

363
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.250
If you don't marry it with an action within five seconds.

364
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.940
You pull the emergency brake and kill the idea, kill it.

365
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:09.150
Dominique Pozo: If you have the impulse to get up and come dance while the band is playing. If you don't stand up in five seconds you're going to pull the emergency brake.

366
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:26.280
Dominique Pozo: If you have an impulse about you are inspired by somebody speech today and you don't do something within five seconds, write a note send yourself a text anything physical to marry it with the idea, you will pull the emergency brake and kill the idea

367
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.900
Dominique Pozo: Your problem isn't ideas. Your problem is you don't act on them.

368
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:39.750
You kill them. So I'm mindful. It's not anybody's fault you're doing it to yourself, stopping

369
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:44.850
Nathaniel Sims: I'm counting on you. One and 400

370
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.340
Dominique Pozo: Trillion you got stuff to do.

371
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.190
Dominique Pozo: And it's not going to happen in your head. So I want you to practice this today.

372
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.890
When we go off to party. Thank God it's coming soon. So I think we all could use a cocktail.

373
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:09.240
I want you to practice the five second rule you see somebody and you think they have that impulse. They look interesting walk over there.

374
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:15.930
You were inspired by somebody and you have a request, make it. That's why you're here.

375
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:32.610
Nathaniel Sims: Experiment with it. And I think you'll be shocked about what happens. And one more thing. You know, I want you to know that everything that I do, whether it's the radio show or the TV show or the book that I wrote or the column. It's for you.

376
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.270
And if there is anything that I can do.

377
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:44.940
If I can do anything to make you do the things you don't want to do. So you can have what you want.

378
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:52.830
I will do it, but you need to walk over you need to open your mouth and you need to make the request.

379
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:54.420
You got it.

380
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.240
Good go do it.

381
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.680
Dominique Pozo: So would you think of that.

382
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.370
Nathaniel Sims: That's good. I liked it. I liked.

383
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.230
Nathaniel Sims: It was like

384
00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.590
Nathaniel Sims: You know why why tend to make excuses for stuff, you know, like

385
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.970
Nathaniel Sims: But basically what she was saying is

386
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.860
Nathaniel Sims: Don't make an excuse. Just do it.

387
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.560
Nathaniel Sims: And see what happens basically

388
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:48.990
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, the activation energy. I really like that you know the energy that it takes to get out of bed in the morning is the same energy it takes to to follow through with that impulse or thought that

389
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.110
Dominique Pozo: Could lead to who knows where

390
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.130
Yeah.

391
00:44:54.510 --> 00:45:00.120
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, that yeah, set your alarm clock 30 minutes earlier and then

392
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.520
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

393
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:08.100
Nathaniel Sims: That that motivation or whatever that activation is

394
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.730
Nathaniel Sims: That's, that's all you need really to get something done that you haven't completed or

395
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:16.500
Nathaniel Sims: Finished.

396
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.350
Dominique Pozo: One.

397
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:28.140
Dominique Pozo: Well, I mean, I think you named really clearly three things you can do to start activating

398
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.660
Dominique Pozo: Your, your reality so that you're not just buying or even down, you know,

399
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.550
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah yeah

400
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:42.870
Dominique Pozo: Because I really hear how much you you want to move through this. I've, I've heard it in group I I hear it today.

401
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.130
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, yeah, I'm just, I'm just

402
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.170
Nathaniel Sims: So,

403
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.050
Nathaniel Sims: just tired.

404
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.970
Nathaniel Sims: The repetitive.

405
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.570
Nathaniel Sims: Act of being a drug addict and

406
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.410
Nathaniel Sims: It is exhausting.

407
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.140
Nathaniel Sims: I just I want, I want to evolve. I wanna

408
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.530
Nathaniel Sims: I want to be like a butterfly. You know, like

409
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Nathaniel Sims: Come out of my shell and fly away, you know,

410
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:36.990
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think you're you're in that process. I think where the caterpillar, dude. Does the cocoon and kind of disintegrates.

411
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:46.620
Dominique Pozo: And and has a complete metamorphosis before it becomes the new thing. And that's, that's a big process that transformation.

412
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.810
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

413
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.140
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's really a death of that old way and

414
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.190
Yeah.

415
00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.250
Nathaniel Sims: Oh yeah i mean i

416
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:09.990
Nathaniel Sims: I want I want that so bad right now. I mean, that's why I'm here. You know, that's why I signed up for this program.

417
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:11.760
Nathaniel Sims: I mean,

418
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.740
Nathaniel Sims: I just doing this for 20 years and that

419
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.970
Nathaniel Sims: I just have no

420
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.490
Nathaniel Sims: Mental fulfillment, it's just

421
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:29.910
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

422
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.360
Dominique Pozo: Do you write lyrics Nathaniel for your music making

423
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:34.650
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I do.

424
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.120
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm gonna give you homework and you know it's up to you to do it or not, I'm not gonna like

425
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.890
Dominique Pozo: penalizing you don't do it, but

426
00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:47.430
Dominique Pozo: I'm going to invite you to either through your art making your sculpture or writing a song.

427
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.880
Dominique Pozo: You know, sometimes that takes a week or two to really work it but and I know you can at least get started.

428
00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:07.860
Dominique Pozo: Right about to this transformation process, you know, and maybe not directly. You want to be the butterfly. But, you know, just I would use that as your kind of the theme and the inspiration and then

429
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:17.430
Dominique Pozo: Really focus on that. It seems like such an alive theme that I imagine a lot can come through. If you really open yourself up to

430
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.310
Dominique Pozo: To work in it.

431
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.510
Okay.

432
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:22.920
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

433
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:33.870
Dominique Pozo: So yeah, I mean, the word can just be butterfly becoming butterfly. And then from there, just go with it, roll with it.

434
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:35.730
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

435
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:44.970
Nathaniel Sims: Cool.

436
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.650
Dominique Pozo: Great. Awesome.

437
00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.170
Nathaniel Sims: That sounds like a good homework assignment.

438
00:48:50.100 --> 00:49:04.650
Dominique Pozo: Good, yeah, it's my prayer that it's enjoyable. You know, I, I feel like, Gosh, why do anything if it's not enjoyable. Really, and I, I know this is coming from a different place because I haven't dealt with.

439
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:17.490
Dominique Pozo: Abuse substance addiction and abuse to opiates. I haven't dealt with that yet. I can relate to addictive behavior and and i think the recovery process can be fun, it can

440
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:32.340
Dominique Pozo: It doesn't have to be miserable. Sure. Physically withdrawals can be really intense. I imagine, but the process doesn't have to be miserable. So I really want to invite that it can be an opportunity to be really creative.

441
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:33.420
Yeah.

442
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.710
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I think so too.

443
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:39.210
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

444
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:52.800
Dominique Pozo: Great. So let's look at, um, let's look at the calendar and then just you tell me if you can pull up your calendar right now, when, when would you like to meet next for individual therapy.

445
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.910
Nathaniel Sims: Let's see here.

446
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.720
Dominique Pozo: I actually have you down for 7pm. On May 28

447
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:06.900
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, let's see.

448
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.530
Nathaniel Sims: That that works for me. Yeah.

449
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.520
Dominique Pozo: Does it work.

450
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:12.720
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah haha

451
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:13.680
Dominique Pozo: OK.

452
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:14.790
Nathaniel Sims: I can do that.

453
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:25.410
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. So we'll just plan on that then. And I'm wondering if we just keep that as a regular time moving forward.

454
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.890
Nathaniel Sims: If anything comes up, how I can just, like, you know, and then

455
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:36.480
Nathaniel Sims: We can go from there. I mean with with this last thing.

456
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.480
Nathaniel Sims: Around this time, I'm usually doing a lot of traveling or and trainings.

457
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:43.590
Nathaniel Sims: But

458
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:49.890
Nathaniel Sims: That's does this virus. I'm, I'm pretty much here. So I think, I think that'll work for me.

459
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.510
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. And

460
00:50:52.950 --> 00:51:04.770
Dominique Pozo: There's something that happens, I've experienced it with my own therapy process of having a regular time of the week, something happens with the psyche, where it prepares for that time and it oftentimes

461
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:16.110
Dominique Pozo: I've noticed and witness to that when it's really consistent, the day before the session or the day of an hours before things start to bubble up and stir up. It's pretty cool.

462
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:23.820
Dominique Pozo: Like the psyche starts to to ready itself to go on a, you know, on a deeper dive around the process.

463
00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:26.400
Nathaniel Sims: Oh yeah. Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense.

464
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:34.230
Dominique Pozo: So yeah, let's keep this time and day in time for now and if something comes up. Of course we can change it. But yeah, okay.

465
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.240
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, I wish you a great evening. And I'll see you in group next week.

466
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.280
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.

467
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.230
Dominique Pozo: You're welcome. Bye bye. Bye.
