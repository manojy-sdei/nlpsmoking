128
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.920
Shawn Phalen: So,

129
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:11.610
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Like I did do a few classes I guess in prison, but that was just like to get out of the cell type of thing. You know what I mean. And I guess I did learn a few things. But like I didn't apply it to anything.

130
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:20.700
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: You know, because I didn't have nothing to lose. Now I got like a wife and kids and stuff and I do not, you know, like she's kind of like

131
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:32.160
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: On me, I'd say, but in a helpful way. You know what I mean. Because if I talk up again. She's not going to stick around and not want to deal with that. Yeah, right.

132
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.430
Okay.

133
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:50.250
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: How about financially, are you doing financially mean, I know this is kind of like in my pocket. I have nothing but mom was paying the bills, you know, my wife's got a good job. Right. Okay, good. Um,

134
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.850
Shawn Phalen: Did they really see it really because the coven

135
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:59.820
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah. Yeah, they did. It was actually only a nine day kick or whatever. But they did.

136
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:10.170
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: That's good. Yeah, I know it's running through some prisons here. I was the very first guy on on my little

137
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:22.590
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Prison jarred block, whatever you want to call it to get the, the early released and then it started like domino, you know, after that it took a couple other guys. Couple other guys, that was the first

138
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.950
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Have. Do you have any questions for me anything that you know

139
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:46.470
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: No, not really. So as we meet, are there things that you want to work on, like, do you have absolutely I'd like to just live a clean life air, but I don't know how

140
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.350
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Right, like

141
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.490
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: I'll get a case of the buckets and just, you know what I mean. And I don't want to do that, especially

142
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:06.840
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Like in six months from now when I don't have to worry about a probation officer and then it's just pissing my wife off. Right. That's when you know what I mean, that's when she'll get scary for me so

143
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:16.290
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: I definitely want you know i mean someone to talk to you about stuff. Yeah, totally. I think

144
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:32.160
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: You know, because you want to do it when I try and do it differently this time because you already know what jails, like, oh, and and yeah, I've been down the same road. And sure, I'll make it a year, five years or but it always ends up in the same spot you know in bad. Yeah.

145
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.880
Shawn Phalen: So, you know, maybe this time it's about doing it differently. And, you know, having it stick

146
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:54.990
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Absolutely. You know, because you do go through different phases with sobriety and you know being out again and re integrating and you know all of that stuff is stressful and it big time.

147
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:06.390
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Big time. Yeah. You know, it's stressful. It's scary. And it's kind of like you don't want to say that you don't want to tell somebody like I'm scared because I don't know what's gonna happen like

148
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.960
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: You know, like, it's hard to talk about that stuff. So to shut people down. I'll just say no, she died.

149
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:25.170
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: You know what I mean. Because like I went to one of the job sites. And one of the guys is like hey bro. Whoo. I'm like, nope, she sees dead. She died when you know I mean, even though not live down the road. I just don't go messing with her. You know what I mean.

150
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:26.940
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah.

151
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:38.640
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: So in like a fake you notice for nobody does. I guess I'm closing the door. I didn't leave it open, right. So we'll get through. So this time, I'm trying to close it and I don't

152
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.080
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Know what I mean I was the only way I really knew how to handle that situation like

153
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.410
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Because, because I feel like a dick if I don't go help this dude out or you know what i mean if I just say she's dead.

154
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:59.430
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Then he shut up and he quit asking. Oh, I'm sorry. You know, and then boom, we moved on, or whatever, instead of. He said, No, I'm trying to be sober and I'm not. You know what I mean.

155
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.500
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah, so

156
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.060
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah.

157
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.370
Shawn Phalen: So it's about like really changing your whole life.

158
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.430
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Is it on many levels. If not,

159
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:16.200
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: That's what I'm trying. Yeah. And then, you know, it's normal to feel bored.

160
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:28.230
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah, this is dull. Yeah. And when I hit the river something just like habits. I got triggers like you wouldn't believe. You know what I mean. Yeah.

161
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.970
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. So all of this stuff is really good.

162
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.560
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: To talk, even on the lawn.

163
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:42.270
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Or or so million million triggers. Right. And that's what I'm fighting right now. That's where I'm at, in my sobriety, for sure. Fighting triggers.

164
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:55.650
Shawn Phalen: So yeah, so you're going to have those triggers and, you know, you're just going to have the only way to deal with those triggers is to move through them. There's no trick.

165
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.200
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Absolutely. There's no

166
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.860
Shawn Phalen: fairy dust. It's like you just acknowledge that you're having a trigger. And then you go do something else.

167
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:14.220
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: That's what, that's what I'm trying to work on. Because like when when my wife or we get into a little spat or you know what I mean. I used to just instantly. Fuck, I'm gone, I'm going to go get

168
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:26.790
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: drunk or whatever. For the next weekend and not come home, or you know what I mean, like we've had a few since I've gotten out, but instead I just walked around the block and the table, you know, I mean, instead of

169
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:42.390
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: And that's the stuff that you're going to have to do and it's just kind of learning new ways to be to deal with yourself. You know, like I said, it kind of scares me because I got that probation or parole or whatever.

170
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.960
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: You know what I mean. Kinda like my wife's backup or whatever. And once they're gone.

171
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.990
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: I don't know. We'll see. You know what I mean.

172
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:58.920
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so I would say don't even think about that right now because that's in six months, you know,

173
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.010
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Right, right, one day at a time, instead of six months ahead.

174
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:20.250
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Really great stuff can happen in six months and I you know I can say that the Suboxone is really an amazing thing for people like it's working for sure it can completely turn people's lives around. I mean, you obviously have to do the work.

175
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:38.430
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: And you'd have to want to be clean and sober. You have to want it. That's the number one thing which I do. And so those are, you know, that's a lot of that stuff that we can talk about and talk about your triggers and talk about

176
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:49.980
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah, I think, really, a lot of it is like talking about stuff that you've never talked about, like, just kind. Yeah. And the guys. The guys are very, very helpful because

177
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:57.810
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Dude over in San Francisco is dealing with pretty much the same. You know what I mean. And he's like, well, here you can call me or whatever and

178
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:14.190
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: And it's kind of cool because I don't have to deal with them on a face to face because you know 120 miles away, or whatever. But he's lightweight on the same page so you know what i mean that's been helpful. There's a couple, couple of dudes that I like in there. Okay, that's really good.

179
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.340
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so it's like you know surrounding yourself with people that are sober, they're clean.

180
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:26.820
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah, my wife were on teams over over here. Big time. So, and sticking with her for sure.

181
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:35.460
Shawn Phalen: Alright, so let's go ahead and set up set an appointment to meet again.

182
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.420
