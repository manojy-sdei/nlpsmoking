James: As well, yesterday I had to go up to his work because his brakes were acting up so I had to fix his brakes there at his word on his suburban so I did that yesterday and then

17
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.310

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.000
James: Are doing just projects around the house or fixing ship cleaning shit a simple sure like that and building shit.

19
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.040
When you build

20
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.170
James: A

21
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.050

22
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:52.200
James: This other little things from my dad and my dad's been helping me. I mean, while I've been having my dad's been telling me what to do, what to build and shit like that.

23
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not like to be told what to do.

24
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.270
James: Hmm.

25
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that like to be told what to do.

26
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.660
James: It's fine, because he's my boss.

27
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And what if your mom was asking you to do something.

28
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.050
James: It's fine. She's my mother, just depending on what she's asking me to do.

29
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I just some things that you don't like that. She asked me to do.

30
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.190
James: Probably

31
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.630
James: In addition, dishes. I don't like doing the dishes.

32
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

33
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you kind of know why specifically what it is about the doing of dishes. You don't like

34
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.370
No.

35
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.910
James: No.

36
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you think that if you continue to do what you're doing as far as treatment goals and tasks. Do you think that you will

37
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Complete the program and succeed with your, your treatment goals.

38
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.840
James: More likely because, so far I've been doing pretty all right.

39
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how do you measure pretty all right.

40
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:25.350
James: I'm I'm at work. I still have a job. I have a steadying co might have a roof over my head. I'm not in jail. I'm not a drug. And I'm actually sober.

41
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.350
James: So,

42
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When were you not so

43
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.480
Good.

44
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When were you not sober.

45
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.400
James: To that that night that I told you guys about

46
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.090
Okay.

47
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.090
James: Or every Tuesday that was

48
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it been like a week, we can have something like that.

49
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.720
James: I'm not sure, probably, though.

50
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I could probably find it somewhere in the notes if we could, we took the time so you, you just you're sort of defining I'm sober for, let's say, two weeks.

51
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you need the program anymore and everything's all cured. I'm

52
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready to

53
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.760
James: Go I what

54
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you cured and ready to go on. We should drop this program you're ready to head out and do your thing.

55
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.170
James: I'm not sure about that, because it is court ordered

56
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, OK.

57
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So while you're here. What would you like to do so that you're not wasting your time.

58
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.680
James: I'm not 100% sure in all honesty.

59
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you willing to do the things that I invite

60
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.260
James: More likely, some of them. Yeah.

61
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, have you done any of them.

62
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.830
James: Not as not not not at the moment.

63
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are some of the things that I've invited you to do.

64
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.350
The

65
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.750
James: Not the counseling. I mean, not counting the

66
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:23.010
James: Tutoring things online excel sheet like that are looking into math. Math tutoring apps or math tutoring sites and so on, of the sort.

67
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.350
Okay.

68
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the only thing that's been raised is, and these these many sessions. Right. It's just been go check out

69
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.910
James: Those been some other stuff like I did just kind of slipped my mind.

70
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: They sent me mind. I wonder how they would stay in your mind.

71
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you remember to go to work. How do you remember to get that done.

72
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.080
James: Well, there's a paycheck involved there. So that's a little bit different.

73
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a motivator.

74
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.800
Yeah.

75
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a positive reinforcer. Do you know what a negative reinforcer is

76
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.460
James: Yeah.

77
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.140
James: What's that like if I go to jail if I get kicked out of this program or whatever.

78
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a negative reinforcement for a lot of people they don't want to. They don't want to go to jail so they show up.

79
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To the services. And do you think that showing up is enough.

80
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:30.000
James: Honestly, yeah cuz i mean it's virtual it's like what else, what else is it do

81
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.760
James: You only do so much over the

82
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.230
James: Phone. I mean, like I said from the get from the get go. I prefer to be in person.

83
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So you think that that's that's the difference. You think that things were invited in person, you would do them.

84
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.120
James: I don't know if I'll do them still but I'll listen more

85
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.090
James: Me more

86
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.800
James: She was

87
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:12.960
James: There'll be more to be more attentive appreciate, because some person, like, I don't know, something in our mind. We're very between in person and over the phone.

88
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be more attentive.

89
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.690
James: Yeah.

90
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean what per se means

91
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.850
James: Like like kind of almost maybe

92
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, thank you. I know that meant to kinda maybe almost. Okay, so, um, I would. Is it safe to say you would be more you might be more attentive in person, you might find to be more attentive in person almost if it was in person.

93
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

94
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And but that isn't the program you're in, you're in a virtual one

95
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.370
James: Yeah, yeah, no.

96
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um,

97
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think that you could do to create an environment where you could really turn your attention even more to what we're talking about in here.

98
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Differently.

99
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.460
James: Put a little bit more effort into making scene or

100
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:28.260
James: For a little bit more effort into it and son of a bitch. I had something else that I was gonna say, but it slipped my mind.

101
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: My comeback. If we don't force or like mine to it. The mind will kind of bring it up it'll probably come up and feel free to just share it right down. Okay. Yeah.

102
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll come because we're still in the same topic. So you'd be

103
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.930
James: Tension to it, I guess.

104
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's not what I'm gonna say, though, but

105
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well it the word will probably come up. So let's just say I'm the attention you're getting right now. How do you know you're not already giving your hundred and 10% attention. How do you know you're not already doing it.

106
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.500
James: Because I have one ear out listening for cars, pulling up to the shop.

107
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see that. That makes sense.

108
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's been times when you didn't go into work and you also weren't here at all.

109
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's also been a thing.

110
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

111
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, there's also been times when you've sat outside. But then there was the wind, and there was cooler air, maybe, and that was a little distracting. So what else could you do to turn attention to really do this turn up the dial of kind of maybe almost per se.

112
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.150
James: I know get Wi Fi for my house, but I'm too fucking broke

113
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.660
James: I ain't got the fucking money for that shit. So where I could do it at home from the comfortability of my room.

114
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how much is that I don't, I don't really know.

115
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:22.950
James: I'm not sure the last, the last time I was pricing it out before all this Kobe hit it was about

116
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:32.790
James: 150 anywhere from $150 a month to $300 A MONTH. PLUS $200 for installation and

117
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.760
James: Although I did not have that much money right now.

118
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

119
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.630
James: Okay.

120
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the things that you are able to turn your interest to and it gets your full attention.

121
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.550
James: Working now.

122
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.470
James: Working

123
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.240
James: For money.

James: Vehicles.

125
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.070
James: Playing guitar.

126
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.170
James: When you are

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.190
James: Video games.

128
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.340
James: Yeah.

129
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And how have you been able to stay sober. These two weeks.

130
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.260
James: Basically been staying home.

131
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And just sitting in your room. What else have you been doing to make sure that you don't drink.

132
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:51.180
James: Playing Game video games working now staying away from 30 people avoiding certain situations.

133
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.520
James: And the little mini breathalyzer that I grow carry around

134
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that do for you.

135
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.690
James: The breathalyzer

136
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.800
James: Uh huh stops me from drinking because it's

137
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So, brilliant.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.140
James: Night. They gave me that

142
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Okay.

143
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Just what does that feel like to have to answer to this life link breathalyzer

144
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.940
James: It's fine with me. It keeps me sober.

145
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:52.590
James: Like I was actually thinking about it. The other night I was like, You know what, this is actually a good thing that I have this because then

146
00:14:53.400 --> 00:15:07.200
James: I can't cheat them. And plus, they know on I'm staying sober shows as pictures. It has my BA sea level. So like, I'm Terry and even Monica my PO told me she's all you've been doing good on the soberly and keep it up.

148
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.300
James: Like I actually prefer the sobering more than

149
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.760
James: Yeah yeah

150
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.120
James: More than any other solution that they had before. I don't know what the fuck they didn't give me the shit in the first place.

151
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible that this fucking shit part is the counseling.

152
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.680
James: Know the fucking shit part is the breath breath lives in soberly.

153
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't give me this stuff first

154
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.920
James: When I first got on probation. They gave him the sober link. When I first got on probation. I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

155
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.730
James: I wouldn't have gone through the bullshit. I went through this

156
00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:57.510
Yeah.

157
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think people

158
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Like Monica.

159
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't apply that intervention first

160
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What do you, what do you think the logic is behind that.

161
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.070
James: Um, I'm

162
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.390
James: I'm not sure all I could say is that she may

163
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.260
James: I don't know.

164
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.910
James: I really don't know.

165
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with it for a minute. Think about it.

166
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:36.960
James: Maybe more than likely she wants to see if you can do yourself at first, if not maybe for give you that extra kick in the ass that to me.

167
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not right. So, in, in, in our world and behavioral health is called the least restrictive.

168
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah. And then we say, let's see if it works.

169
00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if we went, what if we went, you know what you got yourself a DUI. Let's put you in six months, residential treatment and it wasn't a locked facility. Imagine how that would feel

170
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: A little heavy handed isn't it.

171
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.000
James: Yeah.

172
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. So that's what this is, this is what real real real light just to say, let's see how he does. And you have to find out because there's no amount of telling you

173
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna have a hard time resisting your

174
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Problem. Yeah, you would seem the type that needs to feel it to know it to believe it like I gotta, I gotta, I gotta kick it around. I got to feel it in real time to make sure this is true for me. Right.

175
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. It's like, yeah.

176
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.740
Yeah.

177
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that's yours. That's your truth. No one can take that from you. I needed this kick in the ass.

178
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.430
James: Yeah, no, I did.

179
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.160
James: I definitely did

180
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.120
Yeah.

181
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be, you may need another one.

182
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. We'll see. Right.

183
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.040
James: Yeah, no, I don't think I need a second one, because I've been drinking

184
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah. So for two weeks. So you're you're feeling pretty proud of yourself for two weeks of clean right

185
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

186
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And if someone was, let's say,

187
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding down a job for two weeks they would feel pretty proud about it. Right.

188
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.900
James: Yeah yeah

189
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Should they feel proud after one week.

190
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.590
James: Whatever progression counts.

191
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever progression. Yeah. Well, what do we call it when you've put together two years of clean. What do we say that

192
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.110
James: Fucking awesome, man.

193
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you want to feel fucking awesome, man.

194
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.090
James: Yeah.

195
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.610
James: You do what

196
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Happened. What's the reward, what's the possible game of you feeling like that.

197
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:07.050
James: One. If I don't drink anymore. I'll make it into the Navy, the Marines.

198
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Even yeah

199
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. There's that positive rewrite there.

200
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.740
James: Yo, yeah.

201
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And

202
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what gets aside from the the tele health

203
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What else do you think gets in the way I think of your being able to benefit from from this service here. What do you think goes on in here between you and I

204
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:46.290
James: Mean it's like any other therapy session basically a counseling session or yeah yeah

205
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you the same as in person.

206
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:51.000
James: Yeah.

207
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you get out of past counseling.

208
00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.920
James: The past counseling. I see.

209
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you get out

210
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need to know what did you get out of it.

211
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.940
James: I'm

212
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:14.820
James: I'm trying to think, in all honesty, because the last time I went to counseling was a little bit before I went to jail and

213
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.830
James: I mean,

214
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:28.380
James: The only thing I really got out of it at the time was like more in depth about relationships and shit like that. That's about it.

215
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got more in depth. So that's not actually any kind of information. It sounds like that's what the therapist did was asked more in depth questions about maybe dynamics with Mother dynamics with Father dynamic I'll friend.

216
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's about this particular professionals questions I'm asking, what did you get out of it.

217
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.200
James: That shit, really.

218
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Not shit. Okay, so we have that might be happening now, much like what happened in person.

219
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's very possible that you might not get shut out of this.

220
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.600
James: Me, maybe, I don't know.

221
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:13.110
James: I mean, sometimes there's sometimes ones that I have gotten knowledge from and wisdom from

222
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what did you do to make that happen.

223
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:29.640
James: It wasn't really me. Because at first I didn't even like the therapist. I had he kinda I got I warmed up to him, basically, cuz

224
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

225
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

226
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a Tuesday. Yeah, so, um, no. We found one. So let's take you in order for you to warm up to someone in the summer in this time was me. But first, I want you to think about this gentleman first. You didn't like him.

227
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But you warmed up to him.

228
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, he showed up. Same guy. Same guy. Same guy. Same guy. Same guy. Same guy.

229
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What changed about you that you can warm up to him.

230
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.690
James: It was the way he conducted himself in the way he spoke to me and

231
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:18.600
James: I don't know what the once he told me to. Once he told me he was in the army and some of his stories and nobody's passed to

232
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.910
James: It was like

233
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.960
James: A new, I don't know, like, just something about veterans that I trust them automatically. Most of them. A lot of them, then we will have half of my family's veterans.

234
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I could see that.

235
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's automatic.

236
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm in that that I I respect that group I write this like up. I can connect on that level.

237
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

238
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:47.550
Yeah.

239
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And did he shared his own personal stories about being in the army.

240
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.070
Yeah.

241
00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you were like, Oh, I like those stories. And did you start to trust him.

242
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.440
James: Yeah, that's when I started trusting him. That's an ounce. Tell him.

243
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:15.510
James: Like I'll tell him some of what what's been going on and she like that at the time when I was younger, and then he would tell like you'd basically it'd be like

244
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:27.660
James: A verbal contract without even notice anything that like he would tell me a story and then I'll go tell me how my day was and how life is she like that in the next day he told me another story and just go back and forth.

245
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.590
Yeah.

246
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um, do you think he's like that with all of his clients.

247
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.800
James: I'm not sure maybe

248
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it was just for you.

249
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

250
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I would wager that there is no one in this program.

251
00:23:53.490 --> 00:24:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And these are people I've been seeing for years that would probably tell you that they trust me implicitly

252
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't know a thing about me.

253
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And wonder what they did to warm up to me. I wonder what they did.

254
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, dude. How on earth did I earn their trust. How can I earn yours that interest me

255
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.640
James: I don't know. That's a good question.

256
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, isn't it.

257
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.930
James: Like I have. I'm sorry. I have fast trust you.

258
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And I see it. I see it.

259
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.170
James: Yeah, there's a half as other part of me that's like, nah.

260
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, is the natural part because there is it's connected to the Court.

261
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.610
James: Yeah.

262
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

263
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.860
James: I thought. So that's a big major factor involved in this.

264
00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so why don't let's keep let me keep offering some reassurances. Um, let's see if this if we can get getting any steps forward on this. So I want you to know, again, even though I said it. I think it's worth saying. And again, the things that

265
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I report, you're in a unique kind of model and a Drug Court program. And it's even though it's a really loose one, it's not

266
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, I won't go into this, but I don't say anything about what you talk about in here and I don't say about what you're talking about. And group I'm pretty pretty just. This is the data service either attended

267
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:35.970
James: Thank you.

268
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I, or someone I know says

269
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Guggenheim, I'm like what is that

270
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.180
James: Thing.

271
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.340
James: Thank you.

272
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:48.990
So,

273
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't report content.

274
00:25:53.850 --> 00:26:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky bit for you and this, this is probably could see this being a real challenge. Maybe there'll be points when you think you know what i want to tell this lady.

275
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: How hard it is, or I want to talk about the dynamics.

276
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe with what's going on with family and alcohol or whatever. Maybe you worry. I'll take it and throw it out in public, like in in the court. The only thing I write is whether you're showing up for services or not.

277
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether the but the problem in this piece about

278
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A decision to not trust. It is literally the piece that makes therapy, which is a social medicine right i'm not handing you a pill, am I

279
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Know now therapy psychotherapy is talk medicine and right now because trust isn't there, you're not actually taking the medicine.

280
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you believe it.

281
00:26:55.650 --> 00:27:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's like it basically is like this, let's just say that this funny looking object is you can hear people in groups, if they're taking buprenorphine or whatever, right, they're taking medicine.

282
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like what's happening with us, is they pick up the prescription. They bring it home. They said it next to them and they just stare at it.

283
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And they kind of hope that it will help

284
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.150
James: Hey,

285
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I picked it up. There's a document that I picked it up. What's your problem, lady.

286
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.020
James: Yeah.

287
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is a lot trickier this medicine in order to ingest it means

288
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to develop trust or we won't get anywhere I can be as funny as charming as honest as disclosing I can be all of these many things, but if you still don't trust what's in here will get nowhere.

289
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

290
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know this is a very unique relationship.

291
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just for you.

292
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's i don't i don't need something from you. This is for you.

293
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.040
James: Yeah.

294
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're wasting your time in here.

295
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Think about that time wasted. Why would you want to go go somewhere and waste your time, don't bother.

296
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll reassure as many or as little times as you need about the content of what goes on in here. I did your bio psychosocial so I know your history, and I didn't record any of that. And I'm not going to. I'm a very conservative person when it comes to disclosures.

297
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.670
James: Right.

298
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So my invitation to you is to see if you can carve out time where you are not disrupted by being at work and listening for the cars. I can't change your time right now. I can't change your time.

299
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But I definitely see

300
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When you show this therapeutic relationship that you're putting you first that you actually will take this dose of

301
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Medicine by doing your part by attention because you found it. You know what it is. It's like my attention is kind of maybe half ass. It's kind of over here with the cars and I'm not really taking it for real.

302
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: not serious. Yeah, I can see that. But I've got to pace with you. I can't, I can't make you see the value in your healing when you see it.

303
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it a fair shake because I show up ready fully ready

304
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not distracted by anything. I'm really available and ready for you.

305
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But I know that trust takes time and I'm willing to wait it out. But if you could do that part, creating time if it's in the morning.

306
00:29:50.490 --> 00:30:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I can pull it, I can pull it a little earlier, if it's before work, but I can't dip in later, not this month. If you can put together consistent attendance and you're actually attending 100% and it's not halfway in between work half here half there.

307
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I can say, you know what he's got investment. He's got his own recovery and his own treatment and they're starting to develop some trust with us.

308
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I could see later on. It can't happen right away, but I'll keep my eye out for time during the week I'm booked. But I'll keep my eye out for us. I know that's something that you want.

309
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.190
James: All right. Thank you.

310
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome.

311
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.080
James: No, I got you though.

312
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, it's me. Yeah, James, listen.

313
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

314
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you feel strongly

315
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you've got this all figured out. There are many people straight out of prison spent some 17 years in prison.

316
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: They got ink up to here. Okay. And they look at me and they're like, what could this lady possibly have. What could she possibly relate to me. What does she got to give

317
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And they end up

318
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: They end up changing their first impression, because they can see that I want you to get everything every, every school. I've got every resource. I've got, I want you to have it. I give it freely, it's all for you, but first we got to work out our trust piece.

319
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:20.970
All right.

320
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll get there. Today was a good day. I feel like we got in the match, right, we got in the ring, didn't we

321
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.250
Yeah.

322
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We got in the ring together, hey, listen.

323
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I hope we're both fighting for you. I know I'm fighting for you you fight for you too.

324
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:39.780
I know

325
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm glad you made it in here today.

326
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:43.830
So,

327
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about setting your alarm for that group. I am noticing more engagement and group. I don't know if you're feeling that to where you're, you're kind of turning a little bit more attention in. Are you listening, a little bit more in group.

328
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

329
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're going to get more out of it when you're leaning your attention in and you're kind of trying to hear what people are saying and thinking about what people are saying and try it on and thinking is that how I am to

330
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you can see how you have in common with other people. It's the sense of a bigger support system like dang, I don't, I'm not doing this alone.

331
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.290
James: Yeah.

332
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I'm really, really glad this quote unquote kick in the ass with this.

333
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: With the breathalyzer a thing. I'm glad that worked. I'm thrilled, right, because you

334
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Think you could have gotten so pissed off at that. Oh.

335
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet you were at first when

336
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:52.710
James: I was first I was like fuck. Another thing to add to my list of shit to do and then afterwards, I was like, You know what, this isn't that bad.

337
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. Right. I'm thinking you could look at me, something like that.

338
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's this medicine that if you give it a chance. And you don't have to jump in full body slash just dip your little toe in traffic test me out, you know, you can

339
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a little disclosure. You can talk about something, maybe you know you and your dad talked about and you can you can hear me and

340
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what this lady's gonna say about that. What's her opinion. What's. How would she have done it differently. Hmm. You can test me. You don't have to full blown talk about early childhood Raja Raja. You don't have to dive right in like that.

341
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you wouldn't want to anyway we trust is is developed slowly and you can test me and see. Am I judging, am I, you know, I mean, got to find out from Jackie.

342
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, mostly I'm just playful.

343
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Most I'm this other piece. I'm very playful. You've seen it in group to um but I'm also i really hold people accountable, don't I do kind of two things at the same time, it's like, Oh, what is that

344
00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like how does she do that it's both. Yeah. And part of it is this bigger concept and we'll end with this. This is the way I kind of think about people.

345
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: When they're growing up, I think. Okay, we've got to have really clear boundaries and rules.

346
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So that the kids inside can feel safe. And that's kind of the way treatment is to

347
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: If clients know what the rules are. Notice that the kick in the ass breathalyzer is like, I got it. Cool. Is this time, this time. This time, this time. Well, guess what, you get to do in between, you get to do you you get

348
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So basically we show up on time. You show up to group you show up to individual and then in here. You and I get to play.

349
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.440
James: All right.

350
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.840
James: I know what you mean.

351
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'll earn it. I'm ready. I'm, I'm willing to be tested. Okay.

352
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.360
James: All right.

353
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I will see you in group. I'm so glad you made it here today and you weren't. I don't know what time you arrived when it did see something about 753 someone messaged me did you make it in there at a quarter of

354
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.900
James: Yeah, I made in

355
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the cool way to be, what do you all do like

356
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.890
James: This the dab. Can we adapt me

357
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.960
James: Yeah.

358
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the anti cool. I'm like, I'm like the non Coolest thing on the planet, but

359
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: At least I know it, and that gives me some half credit cold point

360
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.340
James: Yeah. Does it good.

361
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.500
James: Luck you're working your way there.

Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, have a safe weekend. Okay. And I look forward to seeing you in group.
