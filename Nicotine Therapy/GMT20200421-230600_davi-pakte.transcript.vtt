00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.530
Duane Godbout: There is

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.530
Duane Godbout: Hello. Hi, Dr. How you doing,

3
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.810
davi pakter: I'm doing well, how about you. Hold on, let me close out some of these windows. I was doing something else. Okay, so

4
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.130
Areas.

5
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.100
davi pakter: Long time no talk

6
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.180
Duane Godbout: Yes, sir.

7
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.620
davi pakter: What is your deal

8
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.710
Duane Godbout: I'm just struggling like crazy.

9
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.190
davi pakter: Okay, are you ready to make a commitment because it feels like we're just like one step forward, two steps back.

10
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.140
Duane Godbout: Yeah, it's just been how I just moved it just, I mean, I consider making all kinds of excuses, but I just, it's been hard. You know, you know,

11
00:05:49.170 --> 00:06:02.640
davi pakter: It's, it's been hard. Okay. Well, I mean, I think that the bottom line is, are you in a headspace where you're ready to make a commitment to recovery or is it going to work for you. I mean, I have no judgment, but I just want to not waste anybody's time, you know,

12
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.090
Duane Godbout: Definitely no. I'm I need to do this. It's just

13
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.200
Duane Godbout: I definitely need to do it. I mean, I'm not any trouble or anything, but, um, I don't want to get in any trouble. You know what I mean.

14
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.920
davi pakter: Yeah. Okay, so tell me where you're at, then

15
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.850
Duane Godbout: As in a place to live, or where I'm at, in my head.

16
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.220
davi pakter: No, we are with the with the opiates, or the or the drugs, whatever you're using

17
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.210
Yeah.

18
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.760
Duane Godbout: Just real heavy. I was shooting a lot more, you know, I was smoking it but I'm kind of shooting a lot more than I was before.

19
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.290
davi pakter: Why is that

20
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:45.930
Duane Godbout: I don't know, it's just I just felt a little bit deeper into more and more use of my my tolerance has gone way up. You know, so when my tolerance when

21
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.200
Duane Godbout: I started using I started shooting more, you know, because smoking it so just wasn't cutting it, I guess.

22
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.040
davi pakter: Uh huh. Okay, so, so, how much are you using right now.

23
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.490
Duane Godbout: It varies, but I'm thinking about a couple two to three day maybe

24
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.680
davi pakter: Two to three grams a day.

25
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.370
Yeah.

26
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.840
davi pakter: Okay. And then what else with it math.

27
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.680
Coke. Yeah.

28
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.140
Duane Godbout: No, nothing else but

29
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.060
davi pakter: Man okay match and is it heroin or is it that other stuff. The Red Rock or

30
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.500
Duane Godbout: It's a Red Rock here.

31
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.310
Okay.

32
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.530
Duane Godbout: Just because it's a lot cheaper.

33
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.160
davi pakter: What what is in Red Rock is it fentanyl

34
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.060
Duane Godbout: No. Yeah.

35
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.310
davi pakter: fentanyl and what

36
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.550
Duane Godbout: That about sure how they make it. I'm really it's just, um, this is the only place I've ever even seen it is up here.

37
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.700
Duane Godbout: Is okay what's California. I've never seen anywhere else.

38
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.590
davi pakter: Okay, so

39
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.960
davi pakter: Hold on, let me

40
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:54.120
davi pakter: Bring up your fat failure. So I think the last time we talked. I had given you that specific way of sort of cross tapering the

41
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.680
Duane Godbout: Yes.

42
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.700
davi pakter: The medicine and how did. Were you able to do that or how did it work out.

43
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:09.660
Duane Godbout: I wasn't able to, I didn't even like I said I was getting to moving and a lot of stuff was going on, again in my life. Everything settled. Finally, so we take one of these things out.

44
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:10.650
davi pakter: Okay.

45
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.210
Duane Godbout: It's kind of hard here with both of them in

46
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:21.120
Duane Godbout: For me, so anyway, um, it was just a hard time for me to do anything at that point and the kids. I was dealing with and just too much was on my plate to even

47
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:32.850
Duane Godbout: Handle it all at once it's ready to do the, the whole see that we were trying to do just a lot for me to do at once. So now for me to do now is the best time because it's coronavirus is kind of perfect, you know,

48
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.500
davi pakter: Are you out of your other job.

49
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.140
davi pakter: Yeah, so you're not working.

50
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:37.920
Duane Godbout: No.

51
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:44.580
davi pakter: Oh man, I wish I had called me in the beginning of this, we could have gotten started. Alright. So when did you move to this current place.

52
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.890
Duane Godbout: We've just been here a month now a little over a month, you know, maybe it's been a month, a full month now.

53
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.940
Okay.

54
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.460
davi pakter: All right, so

55
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.160
Duane Godbout: Humans are humans. Yeah.

56
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.690
davi pakter: Okay, I'm just looking through the old notes.

57
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.490
davi pakter: So,

58
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.350
davi pakter: What do you think is gonna be the best way for you to get off of it. Do you have a sense

59
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:25.020
Duane Godbout: Well you know I was we just been I read a lot of stuff with my wife reads a lot of things about everything. You don't mean whether it's true or not. I don't know. So I'll throw it by you a little bit

60
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:34.200
Duane Godbout: We were reading on, what does that I'm not Suboxone but the cyber side effects sober sober and then

61
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.550
Duane Godbout: He knows that he knows that. But don't do this. He already knows we already went through that whole thing. But anyway, um,

62
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:48.600
Duane Godbout: So be taken, I was reading on it it, said he, like that one time I went to complete withdrawals what I just did that number and I took it, it should happen or whatever.

63
00:09:48.990 --> 00:10:00.390
Duane Godbout: But I was reading on it and it also said, you at least want to be four hours or longer minimum four hours or longer to before you're taking it. You know what I mean to for it to be okay or whatever. I don't know.

64
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.820
davi pakter: I didn't know much were you up. I'm going to do. Wait.

65
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:12.000
Duane Godbout: Oh well, I thought it was okay to take it right away. You know what I mean. I was thinking in my head. It was because it doesn't have that whatever in it naloxone toward make you sick.

66
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.850
Duane Godbout: Yeah, but they didn't take

67
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.320
davi pakter: You take a very small amount. You can do it that way.

68
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:26.880
Duane Godbout: Yeah, and I did. I took it right away after using only maybe an hour. So that's what I wouldn't complete withdrawals so mad.

69
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.080
Duane Godbout: That dying.

70
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:40.200
Duane Godbout: So anyway, my, my thought was going to do what we were planning on doing. I mean, that stuff. So I would you know gradually bring it in and then I go to some boxing, you know,

71
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.430
davi pakter: Okay.

72
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.940
Duane Godbout: Because I knew the blocker and all that. So, yes.

73
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.440
davi pakter: Okay, so

74
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.450
davi pakter: Trying to find my note when we were going to do the

75
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.800
davi pakter: The Burmese method.

76
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.490
davi pakter: Let's see.

77
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.370
Duane Godbout: What it was also that whole thing that we had regimen that we had on that paper.

78
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.050
davi pakter: Yeah, it's all good and everything. And that night trust you just signed so paranoid about that sick.

79
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:23.100
Duane Godbout: Now I got sick that one day it freaked me out. I mean, I was like, whoa. Okay, first I thought I was tripping on acid, it kind of it was just such a weird, weird feeling. I've ever had in my life.

80
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.860
davi pakter: Yeah, okay.

81
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.260
Duane Godbout: Yeah, and I have really bad anxiety mood. No.

82
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.770
davi pakter: Root of anxiety big to begin with.

83
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.780
davi pakter: Yeah, okay.

84
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.380
davi pakter: Yeah, so

85
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:48.150
davi pakter: I think our best bet is to try this, this method again of as you decrease the

86
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.880
davi pakter: As you decrease the the hair or the opioids we slowly increase the CW Tex.

87
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.250
Duane Godbout: Yeah, I was it

88
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:10.770
davi pakter: Would you like to try that versus trying to just take. I mean, wait wait eight hours or so and then start the Soviet Tex. Do you have a preference.

89
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:22.740
Duane Godbout: You know what, doing the eight hour thing. Does it bother me. I can go a whole day. I could I could buckle down for a whole day. No problem. You know, it's when it comes to the third day or second or third day that I did starts getting really screwy for me. You know nothing.

90
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.560
Duane Godbout: But a day. It doesn't bother me at all. I can go, Dave.

91
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.440
Duane Godbout: That probably cuz I got someone shit my system. It's like

92
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.320
Duane Godbout: Yeah, no, no. So, so

93
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.580
davi pakter: Okay, so are you.

94
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:48.060
davi pakter: Are you more leaning towards doing the cross taper where we slowly decrease you while we ramp up the sub you text or are you more interested in stopping for eight hours and then going switching over completely to the Savvy Tex.

95
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:59.010
Duane Godbout: I don't mind doing the tapering part I was even if we went to the just wait eight hours. I'll probably wait one a week eight hours anyway, even the paper just because

96
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:07.650
Duane Godbout: I'm so scared to doing it. You know what I mean, I don't know. I just don't want to get sick again like that going to freak me out. So, but I'll go with what you say. I mean,

97
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.680
Duane Godbout: I think that'll be. You don't think it'll really do too much damn too much to me like it did that one night. I don't know.

98
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.590
Duane Godbout: Yeah.

99
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:28.470
Duane Godbout: Oh yeah, sorry. My wife was telling me I am the other day, I also, um, I went through some really bad seizures.

100
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.730
Duane Godbout: I did I intravenously. I did some math with it with their with the red rockin

101
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:42.720
Duane Godbout: And next thing you know, I started walking around a sort of feeling a little weird. I went outside and I just my whole body went into

102
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:49.740
Duane Godbout: Tightened up like my whole from my head to my toe and it just started just sort of been building it would last for a few minutes, it would release.

103
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:57.390
Duane Godbout: And then everybody, every minute. It did this for hours every just tighten up so bad, or foaming at the mouth, and it was freaking me out. I was

104
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:07.830
Duane Godbout: My wife was freaking so we went over to the hospital and sat outside and didn't want to go in because the whole Corona thing I was tripping Natalie I'm going there. So just sit in the parking lot. And if I get too bad. Then we'll go in, you know, I mean,

105
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.520
davi pakter: Uh huh.

106
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:22.080
Duane Godbout: So it finally let loose about she almost one o'clock in the morning. So, it lasts for like five or six at night like one in the morning, go into the seizures of some sort and and that was it. I just wanted to throw let you know that this happened just recently.

107
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.640
davi pakter: When was that

108
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.380
Duane Godbout: What day was that bad.

109
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.800
Duane Godbout: Oh, five years ago.

110
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.360
Duane Godbout: Friday night. Okay. Friday night.

111
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.690
davi pakter: Okay.

112
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.460
davi pakter: With

113
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.660
Duane Godbout: That matters about anything.

114
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.490
davi pakter: Yeah, I mean I think that sounds like something related to the method was in there.

115
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.290
Duane Godbout: Too.

116
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.230
davi pakter: Yeah. Alright, so we're going to

117
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.870
davi pakter: Try this again.

118
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:52.680
Okay.

119
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.140
davi pakter: With the buprenorphine.

120
00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:03.000
davi pakter: I think do you do want to write this down or

121
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.680
Duane Godbout: Okay pad right here.

122
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.480
Duane Godbout: Already

123
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.050
davi pakter: All right, I'm

124
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.400
davi pakter: Trying to figure out how we're gonna make this work because

125
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.580
davi pakter: They want you to take point two milligrams

126
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:37.530
davi pakter: Of the buprenorphine but that it only comes in to. So that'd be one 10th of a of a strip. I don't know how you're going to do that.

127
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.920
Duane Godbout: would advocate of stripping wood floors are

128
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.290
Duane Godbout: intense, intense

129
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.510
davi pakter: Work.

130
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.020
davi pakter: Let me see what else I can prescribe it for you.

131
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.140
davi pakter: Hold on a second.

132
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.460
davi pakter: Okay. When did you last us anything.

133
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.560
Duane Godbout: Hour and a half ago.

134
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:11.790
Okay.

135
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:49.890
davi pakter: All right.

136
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.190
davi pakter: So I don't think we're gonna be able to get it that small 2.2

137
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.130
davi pakter: But if you take

138
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.440
davi pakter: One quarter of a tablet. That'll be point five.

139
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.410
davi pakter: Okay, which is pretty close to that.

140
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.910
davi pakter: So day one is going to be one quarter.

141
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.250
davi pakter: And you've already used about 2.5 grams today.

142
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.500
Duane Godbout: This morning with that one. Yeah. Pretty close.
