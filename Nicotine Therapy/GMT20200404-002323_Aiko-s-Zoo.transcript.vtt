00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:32.430
LIsa Anderson: And about, you know, work out there, see what's going to happen with your truck driving schooling and get that maybe going online.

89
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.820
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so that's kind of up to the school right now.

90
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.590
LIsa Anderson: As far yeah to get that

91
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:38.760
Stevenk Campbell: I was

92
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:50.700
Stevenk Campbell: Job was actually just on just on with them this morning of transferring transferring to a location out there. But, right, like I said, like right now everything is online so

93
00:11:51.210 --> 00:12:03.420
Stevenk Campbell: You know, there's a few opportunities that I do have an LA, which is I'm going to take one of those and just do it from here for right now is just being we do all the paperwork and everything, because a

94
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:20.730
Stevenk Campbell: Census viruses. You can't really be out there with trainers and and you know that social distancing thing really has a toll on what what it is that I'm trying to pursue and, you know, we already own a trucking business and my family so

95
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.610
Stevenk Campbell: Then that's based out of Texas, you know,

96
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.950
Stevenk Campbell: Originally from Fort Worth, Texas.

97
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.510
Stevenk Campbell: Okay.

98
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.850
LIsa Anderson: And then your son. How old is he now.

99
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:37.650
LIsa Anderson: 15 okay so that's still still your goal to try to get, get some contact with him.

100
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.400
LIsa Anderson: And we'll put that on the radar as well. Okay.

101
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:55.140
Stevenk Campbell: Well, we obviously we stand contacting and I mean that's that's that's an every week thing we have to be in contact. You know, I have to talk to him. But as far as like him. Staying like staying with me.

102
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:06.630
Stevenk Campbell: That's where, that's where it is cuz you know his mom is, you know, very, very insecure when it comes to that and very, you know, positive

103
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:14.580
Stevenk Campbell: As towards me being in his life. But as for him like leaving her house again because he stayed with me for seven years.

104
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:33.450
Stevenk Campbell: So since he was a baby like he was with me until he started going to school and she can collect taxes. So that's where she came in Step back in, you know, and I gave her that opportunity and now I gotta fight for him to to to have him come back into like my household so

105
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.300
LIsa Anderson: Okay and and would you say your sobriety really ties into all of this.

106
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.230
Definitely

107
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.530
LIsa Anderson: Sort of hinges on your recovery. Right.

108
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.400
Right.

109
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:58.470
LIsa Anderson: So, um, you know, you mentioned your girlfriend being a really positive person in your life. Sounds like your extended family to that that you help care for you mentioned your aunts and uncles and and your grandparents are local as well.

110
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.360
LIsa Anderson: And then that since your brother and sister have a lot of kids.

111
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.940
LIsa Anderson: They rely on you a lot.

112
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.050
Yeah.

113
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:20.670
LIsa Anderson: Let's kind of, um, I had looked back, um, Mr. Campbell at some of your previous notes and just kind of what some of your previous goals for, um,

114
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:29.370
LIsa Anderson: You know, I know you had talked about your music as well. Is that something that you still feel like you're pursuing or is it kind of on the back burner.

115
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.510
Stevenk Campbell: Whether it's on.

116
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:39.240
Stevenk Campbell: It's on the back burner. I, I actually do my music whenever I have like, you know, a little bit of free time, you know, I write my poetry and then

117
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:46.980
Stevenk Campbell: Just recently I wrote like three songs. You know what I mean, you know, they got to be protected, but you know they're rough draft says as a right now.

118
00:14:47.340 --> 00:15:00.360
Stevenk Campbell: So, um, but like whenever I have a little bit of free time out of everything to clear my mind. That's my meditation is doing my my news. Okay, you know, writing down my feelings and thoughts in it, you know.

119
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:09.390
Stevenk Campbell: Like song titles and and suddenly meanings to solve it stuff and you know go from there and build on that.

120
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:21.060
LIsa Anderson: So that's your poetry and that's kind of your meditation. So would you say that's a good coping skill for you that you're able to kind of process emotions process thoughts that way.

121
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.020
LIsa Anderson: Yeah.

122
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.570
Stevenk Campbell: Okay, yeah. And it all comes out on paper.

123
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.100
Stevenk Campbell: You know,

124
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:39.420
LIsa Anderson: Well, let's let's keep that one there. What about you know you mentioned your meditation. What about like any spiritual factors or considerations that that I can help help you navigate or help

125
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.990
LIsa Anderson: You know that you'd like to work to address.

126
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:56.550
Stevenk Campbell: As part of their spiritual factors, not, not really, you know, I am a spiritual guy you know what i mean i i do you know condone any and all that. But as far as like, I don't

127
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:09.450
Stevenk Campbell: Do like the church thing so often I do my own. I do my own reading into the Good Book, you know, let me. So it's like, it helps it helps is why is talking to my family members like my grandma and

128
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:18.300
Stevenk Campbell: My parents. They're, they're really into that. So, you know, just talking with them. I get. I get that comfort from that, from, you know, learning from like

129
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:27.660
Stevenk Campbell: Because we're Baptist. So I get that comfort food from them from that. You know what I mean. But as far as like getting out there and going to church and all that I

130
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.370
Stevenk Campbell: Was

131
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:37.140
LIsa Anderson: Talking to your grandparents. That's a big aspect of of what it means to you and how you kind of practice spirituality and

132
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.120
Stevenk Campbell: Right to you.

133
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:39.750
Okay.

134
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:48.330
LIsa Anderson: So definitely, you know, keeping in touch with your grandparents, keeping in touch with family, you know, doing what you can do to help out.

135
00:16:49.860 --> 00:17:02.850
LIsa Anderson: You know, that's no would if you would say was that be a goal or maybe just something that's just so as we're kind of talking something that's important to you, but also something that sounds like these are really positive people in your life.

136
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:04.410
LIsa Anderson: Really good.

137
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.460
LIsa Anderson: What are

138
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.780
LIsa Anderson: Your

139
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.840
Stevenk Campbell: What I wouldn't take it as a goal right

140
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:23.310
Stevenk Campbell: And I mean, that's the because I you know don't pursue it enough for that, um, you know, but I do, I do, you know, look into it. And when I feel like you know the man I need to to to do my

141
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:35.370
Stevenk Campbell: Prayers and all that I do those every night. I do those most of the mornings. So you know I do keep that like really close, but it wouldn't be like a goal. You know what I mean.

142
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.600
Stevenk Campbell: Like more like

143
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:42.420
LIsa Anderson: So just, you know, maintaining, you know, maintaining your relationships with your families.

144
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.590
Stevenk Campbell: Right, you know,

145
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.120
LIsa Anderson: Which, you know, of course, things are are different now than we're used to.

146
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:56.460
LIsa Anderson: But you know video chatting or just being that emotional support you to them and they to you as well.

147
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.630
Stevenk Campbell: Right.

148
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.240
LIsa Anderson: You know, kind of those people, places and things

149
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.670
LIsa Anderson: You've heard about that.

150
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.660
Stevenk Campbell: Of course,

151
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.090
Stevenk Campbell: You can take both the

152
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:16.050
Stevenk Campbell: Us so many ways, the people, places and things. And I mean, they can trigger a lot of a lot of emotions. I can trigger a lot of drug drug induced

153
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:28.620
Stevenk Campbell: backtracks and memories and stuff like that. But as far as like with the family and all that. I'm, I'm here and I'm like, they're in the next couple of rooms.

154
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:43.260
Stevenk Campbell: So unlike that close to them right now. You know what I mean. So I sold like i said i we sold our house and moved her out there and I came back to the house to help them build and make sure they're stable before I leave here so

155
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:51.690
LIsa Anderson: So what about places. Are you feeling like you're you're living in a safe environment you're living in a sober environment.

156
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.730
Stevenk Campbell: Oh, I'm in. I'm in the safest environment that I can be in like

157
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.530
Stevenk Campbell: Right now I'm in the

158
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:04.830
Stevenk Campbell: More safest environment that I can ever be, you know, so I'm surrounded with, you know, the loving

159
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:16.650
Stevenk Campbell: Family Care of my parents. My parents, been there for me to do all the horrible shit I didn't skews my language. All the, all the stuff I've done in my life. Like, I mean, and they've been there so

160
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:28.740
Stevenk Campbell: You know, they know we we have a very good strong bond to that. So, you know, I mean, and they're, they're all for my recovery and everything, you know, they helped me through my recovery, they

161
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:47.580
Stevenk Campbell: They give me the give me the tools and and the strength to get this stuff done. Even though when I don't want to do it they they pushed me to do that. Regardless, you know what I mean. So yeah, I'm in a I'm in the stable this environment that I can ever be in besides my own house.

162
00:19:49.050 --> 00:20:01.230
LIsa Anderson: But, you know, you really have that support right now when when you're still, you know, still kind of working through things so. Excellent. Okay, and what about things like any any things that are

163
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.920
LIsa Anderson: Coming up for you right now that have

164
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:12.270
LIsa Anderson: You know, brought about triggers or negative thoughts or or any issues around those sorts of things.

165
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:22.470
Stevenk Campbell: Um, as well right now is the only thing is like being secluded like be like being stuck.

166
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:35.130
Stevenk Campbell: You know, being stuck in this quarantine thing that's my yeah that's that's a big trigger for me because you know I've done a lot of I've done a lot of jail time. So when I'm stuck in the house for too long. I get to

167
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:53.550
Stevenk Campbell: I get to Wigan out a little bit because I got to move around another man I I sat down. So many times so many so long. You know what I mean. So that's, that's one of my basic triggers, if I'm, if I'm secluded for too long. Then I get to thinking other bad things.

168
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.360
Stevenk Campbell: But being in this environment that I am in

169
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:06.150
Stevenk Campbell: At the house that I am at I'm not able to do the things that I normally able to do when I'm secluded

170
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:14.610
Stevenk Campbell: So though those are those are pretty much basically not triggers anymore. It's just a fact. I could just go outside and and meditate and

171
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:26.430
Stevenk Campbell: And drink my coffee and and read a couple verses and I'll be I'll be straight in about an hour to do my sunbathing you know workouts and all that good stuff. But as far as

172
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:42.390
Stevenk Campbell: Danes is is I lost my car and I left a car and out in Arizona, which is, I don't know if it's still there. You know my cousins are very they're not responsible. So who knows if it's still there.

173
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:59.010
Stevenk Campbell: But the car that I had out here. I don't have any more. So, you know, I'm having to walk in right now walking in and use my parents car. I don't like that. That's a, that's a I always had a car like

174
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.510
Stevenk Campbell: Literally that's that's a

175
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.010
Stevenk Campbell: Very bad trigger. So if I have to call somebody for a ride and stuff.

176
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:15.480
Stevenk Campbell: That's, that's pretty bad because most of my friends are you know they're they're in the gang life they're there. They are criminals, you know, I ain't gonna lie, and I mean

177
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:23.250
Stevenk Campbell: They're, they're fresh out of prison, most of them. And those are my like my real real solid friends. You know what I mean, I don't have really

178
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.500
Stevenk Campbell: Like regular friends. You know, I don't live that regular life. You know what I mean.

179
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:44.100
Stevenk Campbell: It's just far as like my co workers and stuff like that. But we don't see each other, cuz we're not we're not working away. You know, I mean, we can't go to work. So, you know, and so I pretty much stayed to stay solo stay solo by myself. Yeah.

180
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:54.360
LIsa Anderson: So yeah, maybe transportation situation, maybe stabilizing that would give you a little more confidence, just as far as feeling like you know

181
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.980
LIsa Anderson: You're landing on your feet.

182
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.890
LIsa Anderson: And definitely you know a lot of a lot of things have changed. There's some uncertainty. So like you said, as far as as being cooked up

183
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:20.040
LIsa Anderson: You know, that is tough. And that, that certainly can be triggering but I really, I really appreciate it. Some of the things that you said as far as going outside. You know, drinking your cup of coffee, maybe just kind of gathering your thoughts, getting some fresh air.

184
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.640
LIsa Anderson: Okay, you're there with your family. So you have them. You guys have each other.

185
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.950
LIsa Anderson: Okay, I'm getting out when you can do exercise. Do you

186
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.670
Stevenk Campbell: Know,

187
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.190
Stevenk Campbell: You said you walk out. Definitely. Yeah.

188
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:49.200
Stevenk Campbell: I do. I've got a weight bench out there. I also am a boxer I do boxing one. So we have the whole setup. My dad was a global global champion. SO I'VE BEEN BOXING since I was what

189
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:58.230
Stevenk Campbell: 10 years old so you know I do my training and all that I run the backyard in circles. But you know, I mean, it's that social distancing

190
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:07.800
Stevenk Campbell: So you got to keep yourself active, you know, you got to keep your health glory, because I like to run a lot, you know, I mean, so I do my runnings my laps in the back and

191
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:18.270
Stevenk Campbell: I do my training like my Golden Globe train in the back, you know, to me, my kickboxing in the back so you know I do stay active. That's one thing I do do

192
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:32.490
Stevenk Campbell: And I'm pretty much more basically a as a as a as an eater wise I don't eat too much meat, you know, the main i don't i don't really like too much meat. So I eat a lot of vegetables and I drink a lot of

193
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:40.860
Stevenk Campbell: Waters and juices that I make myself you know i mean like my VA to me. Most of those myself, besides the one I just went to God. And I mean, cuz

194
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:50.790
Stevenk Campbell: I gotta get a new recipe to it, I'm trying, I'm trying something new. What a different set of stuff. So, but, um, yeah I eat more vegetables and plants than anything, you know,

195
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.240
Stevenk Campbell: That's, that's how I pretty much basically keep myself going and keep my health there so

196
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.010
Stevenk Campbell: That was

197
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.430
LIsa Anderson: That's a big kind of piece for you for your recovery.

198
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.160
LIsa Anderson: Is your physical health, you know,

199
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:17.760
LIsa Anderson: The things outside. You know, you know, some of the people to avoid like you know some of your old friends if they're just getting out of jail, you're kind of knowing, maybe they're not the best people for you to ask for a ride.

200
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.340
Stevenk Campbell: A rubber ball.

201
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:29.220
LIsa Anderson: Yeah yeah well and and so you know you're you're aware of that. So that's, that's huge. That right there.

202
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:36.360
LIsa Anderson: Is huge and and I'm hearing you know your awareness to around kind of how you're adapting. Some of the things that you used to do.

203
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:49.530
LIsa Anderson: Versus okay you know you can't go to the gym. But maybe you're going to do boxing in your yard or, you know, work out in the garage. So okay me, keeping your physical health, you know, yeah, doing your juices.

204
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.300
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

205
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:57.660
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Well, for those you know those people, places and things that we talked about.

206
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:06.990
LIsa Anderson: You know that we talked about some of those kind of triggers as far as, you know, being cooped up or people that might be triggers for you.

207
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:19.080
LIsa Anderson: Um, what about, like, any, any emotional stuff that comes up for you. I know you mentioned if you if you feel too cooped up for too long, that that gets you going in a in a bad place.

208
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:20.940
Stevenk Campbell: So,

209
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.900
LIsa Anderson: So that's what are some of the emotions that come up for you around.

210
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:41.310
Stevenk Campbell: Like when I'm like when I'm secluded and it feels, it feels like I get cluttered. So everything like you're not. I mean, I have too much to think about on top of what I'm thinking about. So when I'm like, you know,

211
00:26:42.120 --> 00:27:00.300
Stevenk Campbell: When I'm just posted I I have those uh those like bad thoughts of, you know, what's going on in my life right now. You know what I mean, like, is my relationship going to work. You know what I mean it's, it, it just triggers a lot of negativity.

212
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.500
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean.

213
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:13.140
Stevenk Campbell: As far as it is as far as like the the positivity that comes out, you know, I mean, because I wake up and say it's a beautiful morning every day. Do my prayer, real quick. And I mean, thank you for waking me up. Good deal.

214
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:22.170
Stevenk Campbell: Um, but if I'm like posted by one o'clock and I'm still in that same spot. I'm like, what am I doing with my life. You're not. I mean, like,

215
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:32.310
Stevenk Campbell: What am I going to go with this. Do I have do I have anything to do today to stay move stay active or no, I don't have anything to do today. So you know what I mean. What can I do to

216
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:48.870
Stevenk Campbell: Keep those things from popping up and it's mostly it's mostly the relationship. The most thing my son. I think about my son a lot and it's like, Man, I need to call them. I'm a girl over there, you know what I mean. But I can't do that in. And I mean, so, and it's like, and then

217
00:27:50.580 --> 00:28:02.220
Stevenk Campbell: Sometimes, sometimes like during certain parts of the time of the year is basically like from from my birthday, which is in October to January.

218
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:16.560
Stevenk Campbell: Um, that's when all that stuff happened to me as a as a as a 17 year old. So those times of the year are just basically really the worst is times in a year, like, you know, especially, especially

219
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:25.560
Stevenk Campbell: Thanksgiving, cuz I usually was, you know, from 17 like from let me say it from eight years old to

220
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:38.280
Stevenk Campbell: 24 I was locked up every single every single Thanksgiving. Every single one. And most of most of the time, probably about 80% of the time I was in there on my birthday.

221
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:49.560
Stevenk Campbell: And then another 80% of those. I was in there on Christmas and New Year's. So those are just really the worst times but like through right now. I just got done with you normally done with

222
00:28:50.160 --> 00:29:00.510
Stevenk Campbell: The January stuff. So now it's like, I really don't have too many emotions that pop up is just negative thinking as far as when I'm cooped up just negative thinking

223
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:11.430
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean is it. What can I do instead of doing this. Oh wait, I can go grab a bag and go sell it, you know, I mean, in the street and and you know bug out a little bit. But no, I can't.

224
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:23.460
Stevenk Campbell: No, I can't do that. I'm jeopardizing too much. I worked hard too hard for the things that I got now and the people that I have in my life. So no, I don't know, and then you

225
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.430
Stevenk Campbell: Know that's that's basically what happened that's

226
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:34.560
LIsa Anderson: What happens. Okay. And, you know, I can see that this could be a really good opportunity for you to, you know, that we can you know give you this extra support.

227
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:43.650
LIsa Anderson: That it sounds like you do have some good skills that you've relied on in the past but you know we're all adjusting to kind of this new reality so many

228
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.910
Stevenk Campbell: Things that

229
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.690
LIsa Anderson: You know worked for you in the past, you know, we can't do now. So, so we kind of want to adjust those

230
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.180
LIsa Anderson: You know, you talked about

231
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.390
LIsa Anderson: Some of those negative thoughts that come up, which

232
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:04.770
LIsa Anderson: You know, sure, totally, totally natural, you know, totally natural to have those thoughts you're you're human.

233
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.810
Stevenk Campbell: You know, we're only no man cry.

234
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.070
LIsa Anderson: That you can

235
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.870
LIsa Anderson: Give yourself that grace.

236
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.330
LIsa Anderson: You know those concerns are those those fears are those worries so

237
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:26.490
LIsa Anderson: I think one of the things that you know I would want to support you with is, you know, when those thoughts and when those natural thoughts or or if they start to, you know, be around to the side of

238
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.510
LIsa Anderson: You know what we mean by like irrational thoughts.

239
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.160
Stevenk Campbell: Right. Yeah, I do.

240
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.280
LIsa Anderson: You know where those natural worries just sort of spiral.

241
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.450
Stevenk Campbell: And they

242
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:46.380
LIsa Anderson: Just take you down that that spiral. Um, so, you know, I think kind of working with you to use some of those skills that you know that you already have that you've already been doing to kind of

243
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.940
LIsa Anderson: interrupt your thoughts before they kind of

244
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:52.950
Stevenk Campbell: Allows

245
00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:04.560
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah. And, see, that's what I told. That's what I was telling Dr. A bro, um, you know, like most of the skills that you know most of the skills that people take for granted.

246
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:14.310
Stevenk Campbell: I'm one of the ones that take like I take those two heave you know cuz I've been living it for so long. You know what I mean. Sorry, I gotta plug up my phone.

247
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.370
Stevenk Campbell: You know, under man. I'm like,

248
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.900
Stevenk Campbell: One second. Yeah. A lot of people

249
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:34.260
Stevenk Campbell: In our group have, like, you know, negative, negative thinking and then they'll, they'll ask me, you know, I mean, I've been in the group for what almost a year now. So, and it's been going to

250
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:46.800
Stevenk Campbell: Those group meetings for about a year and you know it's been probably about one at once or twice, where I just want to say anything, like, you know what I mean, I'll just sit there and listen.

251
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:57.390
Stevenk Campbell: But, you know, more than half the time. Everything is everything is beautiful to me. You know what I mean I I had so much negativity and so much bad things happen in my life.

252
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:09.630
Stevenk Campbell: I can understand what most people are going through, because I've been through half of it. You know, we can never understand exactly what what's going to a person's mind or through their heart or, you know,

253
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:23.100
Stevenk Campbell: What they're actually really feeling, but I can actually really, you know, kind of take it into here and what they're doing with it, you're not. I mean, if they're thinking negative, I will, you know, I'll

254
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:29.310
Stevenk Campbell: I'll tell him you know i mean there's, there's, there's a better way to think about it. Because if you think about it too much.

255
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:42.600
Stevenk Campbell: Then you start to think wrong, especially if you're already thinking wrong you think way worse. Or you know what I mean. So it's like I've been through most of this counseling and end up canceling my my counselor.

256
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:55.920
Stevenk Campbell: I don't know how that happened. But it did. But, you know, we're like we said, we're only human mama. You know what I mean, and what we can do is just take the tools that we know from each other and and build on that.

257
00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:07.170
Stevenk Campbell: So that that would be the best thing really basically it's just a person to talk to as a regular person that you know what i mean that we don't see. We don't see that has problems.

258
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:23.430
Stevenk Campbell: We see that we can actually build off of each other. That's what kind of person. I actually really am. You know what I mean. And that's what I use the live by. It's just positivity and if something's really wrong. I'll let you know. And I mean, and we'll go from there.

259
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:24.930
Stevenk Campbell: And

260
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:34.230
LIsa Anderson: And I can certainly appreciate that. So I think that, you know, that could could really kind of seems like that's worked well for you in the past and

261
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:49.950
LIsa Anderson: I think that's something we can work together on as far as you know when those thoughts you know they're they're natural, normal thoughts, you know, we can we can work through processing those we can work through you know do negative emotions come up with those thoughts.

262
00:33:51.030 --> 00:34:03.030
LIsa Anderson: Let's talk about that. Let's flush that out, you know, let's see. And then, what's your response, you know, what's your, what's your next step, you know, are you going to take that and and go outside and have your cup of coffee. Are you going to take that and

263
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:12.270
LIsa Anderson: You know, go do a lap around the yard, you know, keeping those those really, you know, good choices. Those sober choices focused

264
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.350
LIsa Anderson: And go okay I'm in it, man. How are you, Stephen, do you go by Stephen

265
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.430
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah yeah

266
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:29.190
LIsa Anderson: Um, so let me ask you something. Um, you mentioned you mentioned that you've been going to the medication groups for about a year now, right, so that's that's going well for you.

267
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.860
LIsa Anderson: As far as, as far as those those monthly groups.

268
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.590
Stevenk Campbell: Weekly. Yeah.

269
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.550
Stevenk Campbell: They, they do.

270
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:53.610
Stevenk Campbell: They do you know they they do help you know i mean to, to, to actually be in a group that's online and in virtual reality that that's a really new experience.

271
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.020
Stevenk Campbell: To me, when I mean

272
00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:04.320
Stevenk Campbell: But as far as like, you know, some, some, in some way, they kind of push people to, to, to, like, you know what I mean.

273
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:13.920
Stevenk Campbell: To try to advance and not a little bit too much. You know what I mean, which is it's a goal to get off of your, your medication and everything.

274
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:27.570
Stevenk Campbell: But it takes that person to actually really you know downsize themselves so it so there's I haven't really figured it out because I started really looking at it just recently.

275
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:35.790
Stevenk Campbell: From cuz I was, I was actually absent from the group for like three weeks. You know what I mean, because I was having to do some things

276
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.050
Stevenk Campbell: Some personal things that I had to take care of in a in my life so

277
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:52.680
Stevenk Campbell: And I was right before this this stuff happen. And then when I get back and I you know I let them know you're not. I mean that I haven't used or anything. You know what I mean, I haven't had the urge but you know

278
00:35:53.550 --> 00:36:09.540
Stevenk Campbell: You know, I'm still I'm still coping with those skills because you know I have stopped on my own multiple times. And I mean, and then it just arouses and pops up around October. Yeah. And I mean, and then I'm going again for like a year or two.

279
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.010
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I'm saying. So

280
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:22.980
Stevenk Campbell: Those are like one things that I need to to actually recognize and And around that time. It's just been like that. There's i don't i don't see no other way of it changing

281
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.760
Stevenk Campbell: You know, that's just been, you know, those are the times that I blanked out in on. I mean, and and that year and

282
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:39.240
Stevenk Campbell: Next thing you know, I'm a, I'm a gangbanger I'm a drug dealer. I'm a fucking violent criminal. I'm in jail every other week. You know what I mean. And, and when I

283
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:54.960
Stevenk Campbell: When I actually started realizing that it was when I was 24 you know I'm 42 now so you know what I mean. I'm like, What the hell was I thinking. But why, why in the world does this keep coming back and back every, every year.

284
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.370
Stevenk Campbell: It's a traumatizing here.

285
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:06.900
LIsa Anderson: There. Yeah, let's put that out there for something that that we can explore together, you know, as far as interrupting that pattern. You know, you've made it through that that half of the year.

286
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:16.230
LIsa Anderson: And now we're, you know, we're on to kind of a fresh start. So let's keep you up with, you know, of course, with the groups of course with your medications.

287
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:25.590
LIsa Anderson: Are you doing or, you know, before all this kind of happened. Were you doing any sort of meetings or or support groups or anything like that.

288
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:41.730
Stevenk Campbell: I was actually running a group. I'm a in a CA group, you know, um, I was actually running a few groups at the time. That's what actually kind of helped me and sponsored a few more than a few people, you know,

289
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:55.980
Stevenk Campbell: So yeah, I was doing the group meetings, but I wasn't really seeing it as a group meeting. You know what I mean. I was actually seeing it as just, you know, those were people that actually started to care about for

290
00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:03.870
Stevenk Campbell: For a while, you know what I mean. And and and look at as a friend, instead of as a, as a user, you know, so

291
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:10.890
LIsa Anderson: Right. Yes. As a person that you know you gain some support from and they gain support from you.

292
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:24.690
LIsa Anderson: So I guess you know from everything you've been telling me just that that support and kind of that connection to people is really important for you. So, um, yeah. And I would encourage you to use, you know, the weekly groups to

293
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:36.210
LIsa Anderson: You know, to participate, but also you know if there's times that you're, you know, listening and participating, you know that you're getting, you know, you're hearing that feedback, you know, from everybody else.

294
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:49.650
LIsa Anderson: So yeah you know i i feel like, you know, setting up some individual times for us to keep chatting can really help you, we can work together to, kind of, you know, keep you on the path.

295
00:38:51.210 --> 00:39:02.580
LIsa Anderson: You know, some of the things that we've talked about as far as you know, the isolation or, you know, the distancing kind of kind of helping navigate that figure out some ways to kind of

296
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.040
LIsa Anderson: Modify that

297
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.830
LIsa Anderson: And then also kind of looking at those

298
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:13.230
LIsa Anderson: You know recovery skills that you've, you've already been using, you know that you've already

299
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.470
LIsa Anderson: Sounds like you've even shared with others.

300
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.510
LIsa Anderson: But

301
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:25.890
Stevenk Campbell: You've got to put them into your daily habits, really. And as soon as you do that, then you know you can actually

302
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.510
Stevenk Campbell: Tell some you will not tell them, but give them, give them that.

303
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:39.780
Stevenk Campbell: upbringing. You know what I mean that that that positive energy from that, from your experience because you can only talk about yourself in that you can't. You know what I mean.

304
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:48.900
Stevenk Campbell: Let them know that you don't understand that they're doing wrong. No, you're not. You know what I mean, you're, you're only human. We make mistakes daily every other second sometimes every other hour

305
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:58.950
Stevenk Campbell: Will knows. But you know what I mean. You can just tell them your experiences. And that's what I use the basically do is use most of our my experiences from my programs and

306
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:10.260
Stevenk Campbell: My groups and the good book to, you know, because some people spend more spiritual than others. And some people haven't never had counseling and one on ones. You know what I mean. I

307
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:20.640
Stevenk Campbell: Really didn't condone one on ones at one point in my life. But as soon as I started opening my eyes up. And because I'm, you know, I see, I see a lot of things as a prism.

308
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:34.590
Stevenk Campbell: So there's so many wonderful ways you can actually ingest something and take negativity and turn it into a positive. There's always just not that one route you always have a choice. And that's how I see things now is is

309
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:42.390
Stevenk Campbell: I have a choice. What, what to do with it. I can conceal it and keep it for myself or I can let it grow by itself.

310
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:50.580
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean. And that's what I like to do is actually, you know, if I hear something I can relate to. I'm gonna give them some good feedback, you know, that's just me.

311
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:59.160
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean. And if I don't think they're gonna take it. I won't say anything. You know, I mean, why waste my breath. I have I have feelings too.

312
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:13.530
Stevenk Campbell: So you know what what we can also like just build on is is sometimes I don't want to say anything unless I'm on stage. You know what I mean, unless I'm actually, you know, making a PowerPoint.

313
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:23.340
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean, I, I'm I used to be a very shy person. I wouldn't even I wouldn't talk right now. You know, I mean, but as you see, I've been working on different things to

314
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:37.680
Stevenk Campbell: To bring that out as as far as my recovery. And as far as my music is and getting it out there so people can actually really hear it is one of those goals, but I gotta be stable in here, first to do that.

315
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:49.290
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean, because I don't want to put out that negative message or any kind of way towards negative messages all positive. You know what I mean that it has to be beautiful so beautiful, so

316
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:56.850
LIsa Anderson: And I hear you know in in your perspective and you talked about, kind of, you know, waking up and having that prayer of

317
00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.580
LIsa Anderson: You know thankfulness and

318
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.550
LIsa Anderson: You know, choosing your outlook.

319
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:12.210
LIsa Anderson: So you know I want this to be a place where we can talk about all of that, you know, we can talk about the good. We can talk about the bad we can talk about the boring.

320
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:22.560
LIsa Anderson: You know, we can talk about all of that and just for this to be a safe space for you to feel supported you know there's there's no judgment. There's no

321
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:30.360
LIsa Anderson: You know, so let's just, kind of, you know, you, we can be real and and kind of, you know, get to that stuff.

322
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:32.130
Stevenk Campbell: Sounds good to me.

323
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.210
LIsa Anderson: Okay, let's

324
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.380
Stevenk Campbell: Try and see how it goes.

325
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:46.770
LIsa Anderson: Okay, great. Wonderful. Um, and, and like I said, I apologize for that technological glitch earlier. So you got CC room and then were you just waiting for a while.

326
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:52.980
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. We all three were after a minute. You know what I mean, because they had he had to

327
00:42:53.430 --> 00:43:06.840
Stevenk Campbell: Pull people on to like try to get in touch with you and time. You know, I mean, because it was already past time plus they're waiting time. Right. That was like 15 to 20 minutes so you know before you even get into that room and then you go from there.

328
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:07.650
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

329
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:14.640
Stevenk Campbell: You know, but that's just how it is. Right now, everybody has a lot of things going on when and plus, they're, they're more

330
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:30.030
Stevenk Campbell: Alone now so now they can actually get online and confront every little single thing that's going on with it. Even if it's not big. It's not bad but all things are taken in consideration. That's the same so

331
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.300
LIsa Anderson: I apologize. I know I was just sitting here waiting I thought

332
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.720
LIsa Anderson: Boise, so I apologize for that glitch on my end.

333
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.460
Stevenk Campbell: And I really appreciate your

334
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:46.260
LIsa Anderson: Patience. I know a lot of people, if there are some outages, I think, is a lot more people are on zoom now so

335
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:58.860
LIsa Anderson: We can always find a way to chat by phone if we do experience any difficult technical difficulties. Hopefully we won't have to, but I think I'll get the hang of this. Next time I'm in

336
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.130
Stevenk Campbell: I'm allowed to give you a login. We've been doing this.

337
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:07.920
LIsa Anderson: I'm, I'm a licensed clinical social worker. So I've been a social worker or 10 years now.

338
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.060
Stevenk Campbell: 10 years

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.320
LIsa Anderson: Ago. Yeah.

LIsa Anderson: I've worked all with adults. I worked with

341
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:27.750
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, mostly men I worked with veterans. I've worked with veterans who have been involved with the jail and court system, helping them to, you know, work their program work their recovery.

342
00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:39.210
LIsa Anderson: Work with that. So, so we want to keep you keep you out of that realm, but I've worked with yeah with adults around, you know, addiction issues around

343
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:53.580
LIsa Anderson: You know, emotional issues mental health issues, you know, navigating depression and in trauma and things like that. So I'm really kind of glad that I can help people now in this in this realm.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.260
LIsa Anderson: By doing virtually so you know this seems like

345
