00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:03.929
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.630
Nick Graham: Are you

3
00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:13.799
Doing

4
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Any issues.

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: In virtual clinic this morning.

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.690
Nick Graham: No, not really.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.850
Nick Graham: You know, general

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.740
Nick Graham: hassling for paying and stuff like that so

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.650
Nick Graham: That's a work in progress.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. Well, you're here, and I know you've got some sort of tough decisions to make. Right. Um, you know more about what is possible, as far as right that x waiver. Did you any inroads there.

11
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.370
Nick Graham: Yeah. So, all I know is

12
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.100
Nick Graham: I was my friend had a similar issue with with their psychologists and

13
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.260
Nick Graham: They were like, We switched insurances and suddenly it's not accepted.

14
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:20.070
Nick Graham: I guess I have to call in in this person, she's having like some severe problems and was without care for, like, a few weeks. So I'm gonna have to call signal and do a whole lot of

15
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.750
Nick Graham: A lot of research and a lot of work to try to figure something out. If

16
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.370
Nick Graham: It's possible to make an exception, like, but

17
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.960
Nick Graham: I don't know this way is so much more convenient like being able to

18
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Use this way. I know. So, oh, it's coming back to me too.

19
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you also think okay

20
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe budgeting 105 once a month, I could rationalize that it's you know about 25

21
00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know dollars there and then there'll be this fourth week where you would go into group, you'd meet with the doctor, she would assess how you're doing. And then those other weeks, you and I could be meeting for individual therapy and I have seen her agree to that so

22
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.100
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I think one one group over like a month in place of individual

23
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.820
Nick Graham: Uh huh. Yeah, I think, I think that could definitely work.

24
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you don't have to do this big change. Now you could say, Okay, I'll do this you commit to it. Let's say the next couple months. And you could be investigating slowly. If you want it to into what other alternative. She had at least, it takes the pressure off.

25
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:47.760
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. That was definitely discouraging. Now, like, you know, you know, I was all excited for insurance forever finally get it and it doesn't work.

26
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.320
Nick Graham: Like

27
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds familiar. I had another client say something like that to

28
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.020
Remember,

29
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.520
Nick Graham: Genki there so Genki

30
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.240
Oh,

31
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I think that that sounds like a similar one I'm

32
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.890
Nick Graham: Thinking of a client same situation.

33
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if I can, if there's any notes leftover to Katrina. She might work for them. Here's my money, Gail.

34
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the names disappear if you haven't texted them in a while or messaged them think she's gone.

35
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay well let's let's get to it. Let me get into your

36
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Your file here and let me see where we left off. But while I'm pulling the record up every up to speed on

37
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Intensity of cravings any slips with alcohol Xanax other mood altering substances just kind of get into that world of how you're handling.

38
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The need to reach for something by yourself.

39
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.690
Nick Graham: Well, you know, you still I'm the only thing and i don't i would not consider this a slip

40
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:20.100
Nick Graham: I have like add right like diagnosed and I haven't been treated for a long time, but I had a bottle of I've and and so I have been taking like like small amounts of events like on a really Tivoli sort of routine basis.

41
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:29.370
Nick Graham: I'm going to get into psychiatry, so that I can be prescribed to that. But I didn't consider it a slip because I'm not using it for any kind of like

42
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.480
Nick Graham: Reasons that they then like it truly does help me.

43
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.330
Nick Graham: So I don't know.

44
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll check in and see why you weren't taking it before.

45
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.690
Nick Graham: Yeah, let's think.

46
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:57.120
Nick Graham: Well, so the first time in reason that I wasn't taking it was because I was in the Navy and we, I didn't. I never liked told them that I had add because it would be a disqualifying

47
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:17.100
Nick Graham: Isn't really yeah yes disqualifying once you're in. If you get it. Well, then you can get medication for you, but I never told him before I went in and then obviously, I can use it because they've come up on it on a screen. So it was like from a, from a really long time ago, but

48
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.770
Nick Graham: I was thinking about it because like

49
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:38.220
Nick Graham: One of the guys in my office was talking, and he's also like prescriptive I've ants. And he was saying like, it helps him like do all the things that he like normally doesn't do because of like distractions and my calls family and like even things like that like

50
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.520
Nick Graham: I just find myself like getting like weirdly fixated on certain things at certain times. And this kind of helps

51
00:05:48.720 --> 00:06:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep me like I and there's no disagreement there. But see how you kind of deviated a little bit. See if you can answer the question I'm asking your fine love what you're telling me you can identify why you weren't taking it.

52
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

53
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:17.850
Nick Graham: Yeah, so I didn't, I didn't know where it was, it was when I was moving stuff that I that I finally found it so half of my positions are Sydney's place and half of my positions in my current home. So I didn't really know that I had it.

54
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.990
Okay.

55
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a bit of a peripheral self management its secondary it's taken aback.

56
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible that over the next couple weeks that you really prioritize that because it sounds like you're seeing. It's important because it affects ability to connect with family, it affects

57
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.660
Other life skill.

58
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.860
Nick Graham: Yeah, I get I definitely think any. I don't really know if there's like a general

59
00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:04.770
Nick Graham: A general like psychiatry. I don't really know what that could help like with my substance abuse problems and that or do I have to see different people. I don't really know how this works.

60
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um,

61
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell you how it works, you'll have

62
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To but it would I can, I can certainly see that a psychiatrist could have that that special training.

63
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it would all line up and you could get everything from that particular psychiatrists, that would be awesome.

64
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But if not, we have a short term plan in place for the next couple of months, at least to sort of do this budgeting and then you show into to group and etc. But yeah, you can investigate. Sure. Why not psychiatry.

65
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: She goes from medical school and their videos and MDS. And now the specialized training and psychiatry, so they should certainly be able to have that special training and therefore that x waiver, I guess, huh. So yeah, go for it. Yeah.

66
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.940
Nick Graham: Okay.

67
00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me get in here. So I heard about the vibe bands and how um any other substance use any other mood altering substances.

68
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.550
Nick Graham: I might like a like a marijuana thing the other day.

69
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:09.960
Nick Graham: And

70
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: When you eat it. What was the context.

71
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.340
Nick Graham: So one of my

72
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:20.310
Nick Graham: One of my friends like just like brought me like a cookie like a marijuana cookies in my work.

73
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:29.190
Nick Graham: And I'm like, you know, I like hearing. They're like take marijuana like every I think the last time was probably

74
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:39.000
Nick Graham: A few months back, like just very sparingly, just when it's like presented to me and then I do it. And every time I like I react weirdly to marijuana and I like

75
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.970
Nick Graham: Get really emotional and I always cry. So it was like shit like it. It almost sounds like

76
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:56.610
Nick Graham: Like weirdly therapeutic but I cried. And I was like, I don't want to do this again because like I always like think about stuff and cry about it. So I don't know. Okay.

77
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So part of you likes it a part of you doesn't

78
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:06.210
Nick Graham: Yeah, pretty much. I face things that I sometimes don't try to face.

79
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.740
Nick Graham: Okay.

80
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So it gives you a chance to feel things you don't normally feel and it feels weirdly therapeutic. Yeah.

81
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else

82
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.360
Nick Graham: I don't think so. Just some alcohol sometimes

83
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me about how much and how often

84
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:36.210
Nick Graham: Maybe one beer at a time, maybe two days a week, maybe three days a week. I have like meetings at

85
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.990
Nick Graham: A place after work, and I usually like to be

86
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: A meeting like

87
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:52.350
Nick Graham: We meet. Yeah, so I have to, I have to meet individually with all of my staff every week for 30 minutes at a time. And usually we do it after work, because it's the only time which is at about 1030

88
00:09:53.130 --> 00:10:00.150
Nick Graham: The only places that are open. Is this pizza place in your bag and I like will I go get a beer or a water or something.

89
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, it's not three beers. It's

90
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.220
Nick Graham: Not. It's not us. It's one beer. Yeah.

91
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's go down in here and see

92
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How many milligrams, are you at right now.

93
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.750
Nick Graham: six milligrams

94
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.880
129

95
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you, how many days. Have you been at that dose and any withdrawal symptoms present

96
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:40.590
Nick Graham: Not, not, not really like a little bit of restlessness and I think probably five days I've been at that dose. Okay.

97
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you I would think by yesterday or today that should be starting to level out now.

98
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:57.180
Nick Graham: Yeah, I'm feeling right now. I was feeling like rest was history a little bit of like sleep issues, but nothing nothing crazy. I mean, it's not a substantial drop

99
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.090
Nick Graham: But I'm feeling fine now.

100
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days have you happy. I feel fine. Now, how many days.

101
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.400
Nick Graham: Probably, yes. Today, and today. Okay.

102
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to see it longer, so that we can. You can go oh yeah this is this is OK, I can do this.

103
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, more days if that's possible for you.

104
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many days of six milligram dose, do you have left.

105
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.830
Nick Graham: See

106
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.470
Nick Graham: Two days left. Personally, I don't think my bottle, but I think I have about two days left

107
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Any chance you could

108
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can do it this way.

109
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If we make next week, your group week where you go on February.

110
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: 4

111
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I can ask the doctor bridge over to that appointment and you show up in there and we kind of move forward.

112
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that sound like a plan.

113
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.150
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think I could do group next week. Okay.

114
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you sound uncertain. So here's what's going to happen. You've

115
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Been then, in a sense, able to get away with not going. Yeah, because we're seeing each other and then I let the doctor know

116
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But that won't happen. They'll be a real oh my gosh moment. I don't have any buprenorphine. So I heard you. I really want to be careful. Yeah. Are you going to attend because you had something come up right there was, I don't know what airport thing or I don't know what. But my point is

117
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the possibility of you're not having medicine. So there's a lot at stake.

118
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:51.750
Nick Graham: Yeah.

119
00:12:52.620 --> 00:13:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So really think about it. Let me tell you, groups are Monday at nine Monday at one Tuesday seven Thursday 11 and Friday 12

120
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.650
Nick Graham: Yeah, I can do Tuesday seven. So here's here's where that uncertainty comes in. So for one like

121
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.260
Nick Graham: I always know you emphasize group.

122
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.080
Nick Graham: I didn't know you emphasize group because it's mandatory. I did not know that group was mandatory.

123
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.340
Nick Graham: So like

124
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:30.450
Nick Graham: You're saying that right now. So I'm sure I signed something saying that but I just, it's been a long time and I have no clue. So that's why when you say

125
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:41.010
Nick Graham: Do group. I'm like, cool group you kind of sit there and, you know, yes, it's a nice time to connect but truly for bang for buck. I get considerably more out of individual therapy.

126
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:50.760
Nick Graham: So this is why I'm not prioritizing group and why yesterday when they say, Oh, you don't have insurance. I'm like, well, I'd rather do this today for half the price.

127
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.820
Nick Graham: That's, that's where that comes from. Okay.

128
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of it like this.

129
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.010
Nick Graham: You're doing

130
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: doing two things you're getting ma TT and your physician needs to check in with you. Your physician is prescribing medication. I'm not. I'm checking in on

131
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Clients with medication. I'm checking in on relapse prevention and we're working on, if it's relevant underlying trauma triggers in our current life and concerns and fret over the future. So we're really

132
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking at behavioral health and

133
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your doctor needs to see you.

134
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.970
Nick Graham: Okay, yeah.

135
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.280
Nick Graham: Well done. Now that that's being said

136
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.640
Nick Graham: Like if it makes sense. And I will comply. I just like

137
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.830
Nick Graham: I really thought I had a choice.

138
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I know well you know you do. But the painful choices. You won't have

139
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.600
Medicine.

140
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just and I tend to be, you know, I'm not so you know this is a therapeutic relationship. I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm just going to say it kind of cash and maybe I needed to say it a little bit more succinctly to. So there you go.

141
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:07.440
Nick Graham: Yeah i don't i don't get like I don't get better. I'm sorry, I don't get upset over like if I'm not getting something just, you know, feel free.

142
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a bath and

143
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.690
Nick Graham: That's how it has to be sometimes

144
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for us. You know, it's

145
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to

146
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what you're getting. And what you're not. I'm thinking you're just making a choice and

147
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.910
Nick Graham: So,

148
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're clear now you see

149
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:23.550
Nick Graham: Our career.

150
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Physician my prescribing physician needs to see how I'm doing hasn't tapering

151
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to see if other than this is so it's not group therapy. The truth is it's not sometimes we are the only therapeutic gain for people is addressing maybe some social anxiety. Sometimes I get a little nugget that I can throw out there. Um,

152
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't. It's not group therapy.

153
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.820
Nick Graham: Right, exactly.

154
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.850
Nick Graham: Yeah. Alright, cool. I'm glad that it

155
00:15:50.910 --> 00:16:05.310
Nick Graham: Put that way. It's just part of all right, because that's why cuz like you go there and you wait in there like how's everyone and then maybe someone says, a couple things like I've gained like a little bit from it. But yeah. Alright, cool. It's clear. I don't need

156
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A doctor's office right like

157
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a plan. So now when you revisit this idea of the level of commitment for February 4 at 7am knowing that and

158
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you'll be there. Okay, so then that's what we'll do. So let me I'll start with that. And then we can

159
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just already get a message off to the physician. Here, let me get into slack. That's this program where I could message something she's up yet. But yeah, she's but I can say you're here. Okay, so, and we can. I can start this conversation and see if she's amenable so she

160
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.750
Is here for his

161
00:16:50.430 --> 00:17:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you can correct me. I'm going to read out loud when I'm writing you can tell me to write something else. He can only afford due to Cigna

162
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.360
swoops signal.

163
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.130
Carrier

164
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.440
Coverage

165
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.780
Limitations.

166
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One group one ma ti grew medicated assisted therapy. That's what you're getting.

167
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A month

168
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And

169
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Depending on how many weeks there are. So then, and then

170
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd say, let's say, three times.

171
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A month

172
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.040
During

173
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.940
The tour five weeks.

174
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you bridge to to what I just say for seven and

175
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: He is at six milligrams

176
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I would, I would say, you know, this is up to you know a conversation with her. But again, I've watched success when people have a flake at least a week of success, right, a feeling good. So maybe that's not too far away. It's only Tuesday. If you want to taper again.

177
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.610
Nick Graham: Then maybe start on Monday.

178
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say, hey, I'd like to take four to five milligrams, or maybe, whatever. Would you want to go to half a milligram or not.

179
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, well, pretty quickly. If you go one milligram at a time at about a week and a half or two weeks or something, it'll

180
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be down to that one milligram pretty quickly. And that's the one where your, your brain will start to clear up you're going to start to feel a little sharper. But truth be told,

181
00:18:51.180 --> 00:19:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep and fatigue, those two are there, you know, they can take months once even you come completely off of it. It can take time where you really come back to normal. So you're gonna have to really have some patients around that, too.

182
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.460
Nick Graham: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

183
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.510
Nick Graham: It's time. It's definitely like getting time to

184
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:21.420
Nick Graham: Be done escaping the scary feeling, you know, I mean, like, well, I won't have this to depend on anymore but like i will be

185
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.080
Nick Graham: Clear because I haven't been clear for a while.

186
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what you're doing is you're adding something I'm watching and you're saying, I'm going to reinstitute something else. So you

187
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Not completely.

188
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Going without your institute by advance, you're going to be having this ritual of taking something each morning

189
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

190
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There is something already in place that can feel like I'm still doing this ritual of taking something in the morning.

191
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.900
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I guess it but that that in itself even seems like

192
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.130
Nick Graham: Not like a great thing. I don't like

193
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.160
Nick Graham: The reliance on anything. And so to think that I'm just going to jump into something else that I will be reliant on like

194
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.280
Nick Graham: That also in theory seems kind of

195
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.670
Nick Graham: Not good. Like, I guess.

196
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:25.350
Nick Graham: I don't know. I was living my life without that for a while like yes, it's got its benefits, but I don't know.

197
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, look.

198
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to address.

199
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.110
everything all at once.

200
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We take we take one behavior and we start to really work on that. We say, how we doing, we do another one.

201
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: About the only one that I kind of like at the same time is if there's an interest if you're a tobacco smoker to maybe explore cessation, because the buprenorphine light has a has has this mitigation of

202
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.030
Training.

203
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's kind of convenient time for some people to maybe

204
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep both of them, but other than that I like, you know, because then you get to say, oh, look how it's different. I address this.

205
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do everything all at once. It's hard for you to get behind. Well, I don't know what what the action of change was or what was effective here. So I changed so many things. I don't know.

206
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.510
Nick Graham: It was easy for us to be learning will we just take one piece and we remove it and we say, okay,

207
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So as far as I'm concerned.

208
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't diagnose you with ADD clearly have that from another time, you have this prescription. You're going to go meet with psychiatry is one of the step just the I'm going to just secure a psychiatrist meet with this individual, and I will talk with that person.

209
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's your image you have of continuing addictive behavior you and I'll keep talking about that.

210
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.170
Nick Graham: addictive behavior is

211
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Not following your doctor's orders you did deviate from the doctor's orders. So if you find yourself. Okay, I'm going to follow the prescription this time.

212
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to see how I do, I'm going to see if it's true, do I connect with my family more or was that not true. Is there something psychological going on under there.

213
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or am I really on task or or maybe it's about the same. What am I doing this is more about addictive behavior us. It's silly or I'm doing it right. It's a stimulant for

214
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, you know, the downside is after that there may be some depression that comes after it. But so, and maybe

215
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking very clearly with the psychiatrists about that depression I would really like you to see a psychiatrist anyway for medication management around the severity of your depression because the frequency that you have that suicidal ideation is problematic. Yeah.

216
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:55.800
Nick Graham: Yeah.

217
00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Which how how recent. Have you had that

218
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.950
Nick Graham: Um, let me take it.

219
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.030
Nick Graham: What day was it. There was a

220
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.500
Nick Graham: Quick down but very quick, dude.

221
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.500
Nick Graham: They're becoming less frequent

222
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.940
Nick Graham: In number and intensity

223
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.660
Nick Graham: Like considerably so

224
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:41.970
Nick Graham: I think Monday was not great. I don't think I had ideations I just felt like depressed like really depressed mood, like it's almost always like on my early days, like when I get off of work. And I'm like, shit like

225
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:50.340
Nick Graham: Was do I do, but I have these like really cool like support system in my house, you know, and

226
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.860
Nick Graham: I went home and like kind of talked it out with like one of my roommates and

227
00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.650
Nick Graham: Because it was like I just like lose like a lot of people in my life.

228
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:03.150
Nick Graham: Time.

229
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.190
Nick Graham: And

230
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you're saying us last

231
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.480
Nick Graham: Not like death. So Monday was depressing because

232
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.820
Nick Graham: My like x and I stopped talking my step mom and I stopped talking and

233
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:29.940
Nick Graham: Another friend was like, kind of being weird to me. So I kind of felt like a little bit alone, like a lot of the three people that have been support systems are all like

234
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:48.000
Nick Graham: Gone at once. And so I felt really bad about that, like, super bad on Monday. But then I went and kind of just started talking and you work. You know, like not being alone not isolating myself actually helped. Yes, yes.

235
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to actually add a couple of names I've got people like and call it good Jason and especially supportive with my growth and faith. Who else can you talk with

236
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.310
Nick Graham: Only Josh

237
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:04.380
Nick Graham: Right.

238
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone else

239
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.840
Nick Graham: Really cristiana

240
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So a real important piece is the isolation, not having something to do right after work, and we we've known this that what I would call right this the sublimation where you just work, work, work. You don't have to think about you.

241
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

242
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to feel just focused on work.

243
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let me start here. Let me hear a little bit about one of the things you wanted to incorporate was

244
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting into nature. I got a little sense through texting that there was some improvement there. Can you

245
00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.290
Nick Graham: Definitely

246
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how often because what you wanted to do is I would like to be out in nature more often. That's the goal.

247
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.980
Nick Graham: Um, see five days last week. So that was pretty good.

248
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, that's great.

249
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:22.320
Nick Graham: Yeah, that was good. Just not yesterday and today, which whatever but I fell off. But yeah, it's been really, really.

250
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.990
Nick Graham: Nice centering

251
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but notice right

252
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The depression was on wasn't it on Monday. So you're not going

253
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To make a difference.

254
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:36.930
Nick Graham: Yeah, so that's the weird

255
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.030
Nick Graham: Thing, because the I went out like Monday morning, what is today thursday right

256
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.670
Nick Graham: Wednesday. Oh shit. Wow.

257
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:45.690
Yeah.

258
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:47.910
Nick Graham: I tell you,

259
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:59.790
Nick Graham: Monday I went out in good stuff. But then I had a bad night. And I didn't go out on Tuesday, and now it's Wednesday, and by the time we're done here. I won't have time. So,

260
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.050
Nick Graham: I guess like I never thought of, like, maybe

261
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.030
Nick Graham: Maybe the reason I didn't go yesterday was because of the night before, like still feeling down and maybe there was some residual

262
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:14.820
Nick Graham: I don't know.

263
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.500
Nick Graham: I don't know what you asked, but it sounded like what, like what I don't know. It sounded to me like

264
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.660
Nick Graham: Why did you ask them, say,

265
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You can come in a different way on the days that you were outdoors.

266
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Variance, the same degree of loneliness.

267
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.980
Nick Graham: I did actually add

268
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me, while you were out for like when

269
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:52.800
Nick Graham: When did you strike. It was like right while I was out. Every, everything was great. And then at work. Everything was great but I get like really depressing the sunset sometimes could say

270
00:27:53.430 --> 00:28:01.680
Nick Graham: It so early, and I get off work in the sun is like just it was like an early day which is still 6:30pm with center set

271
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:04.590
Nick Graham: And

272
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that you got stuff going on.

273
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:09.630
Nick Graham: Yeah.

274
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing that

275
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.260
Nick Graham: Yeah, for sure.

276
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:14.970
Nick Graham: That'd be a good move.

277
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.170
Okay.

278
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We already know you do well with connecting with the people that you you moved in with that's great information.

279
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be making plans with them, you know, your schedule for the rest of the week you can plan out Thursday can plan on Friday. You can be looking ahead and start planning those things.

280
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, of course, right. The that I'm going to forget this conversation and I won't do it may come up, but you can be on purpose about it. We could right now stop what we're doing. You can plug in

281
00:28:49.890 --> 00:29:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Reminders in your phone. That's something very doable if you think, Oh, I'm just going to blow this off, or I'll forget, then you could do it like using the the right now approach.

282
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's talk about what you would do. What are some things you would you invite people

283
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.340
Nick Graham: To

284
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A dinner.

285
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or an activity you kind of want to do out in the community that be kind of fun.

286
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.120
Nick Graham: Yeah um well today is

287
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:24.780
Nick Graham: Actually made a plan. We're doing like a house like a house movie night like after I get off work okay so

288
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.990
Nick Graham: Something like that and then

289
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.840
Nick Graham: I normally go to my

290
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.950
Nick Graham: Go to my parents and times are like hanging out with my sister.

291
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.330
Nick Graham: But

292
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.600
Nick Graham: It's like real weird like parents right now.

293
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:47.640
Nick Graham: And so maybe I could like link up with my with like my stepsister

294
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:49.860
Okay.

295
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that Christiana

296
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.240
Nick Graham: Yeah, it's Christianity. Yes. Okay. All right. There we go.

297
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So think about what is coming up for you think about

298
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want to bring to the conversation today what's what's sort of a

299
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that's on your mind if we could focus more about

300
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.950
Something that's important to you.

301
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.950
Nick Graham: Obviously I think I've alluded to it, maybe like a couple times in the conversation.

302
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.660
Nick Graham: They some stuff going on with like family right now. I like

303
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:58.170
Nick Graham: Kind of made in well i don't know i'm political discussion literally is like started to tear my family apart. Interesting.

304
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:21.420
Nick Graham: I was talking about the abortion sensitive topic, generally in like I'm personally like way pro choice anyone wants to do that. That's fine. I personally would not want to like if there was a person in my life who I was the father. I would not want them to have an abortion, no matter what.

305
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:25.110
Nick Graham: And so

306
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:32.730
Nick Graham: My step mom and I were talking about Bernie Sanders and he says, I like personally, but he said

307
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.390
Nick Graham: I want to health care for all in abortion is healthcare.

308
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.410
Nick Graham: And I kind of made it. I like made it not like well

309
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.640
Nick Graham: I understand that, like, but I don't think that

310
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:53.610
Nick Graham: Personally like abortion should be covered under free health care because abortion is elective

311
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.500
Nick Graham: And it is not

312
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:03.600
Nick Graham: Like something that is medically necessary and if it is medically necessary like do for health of child or mother.

313
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.260
Nick Graham: Then it should be covered under healthcare.

314
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.540
And

315
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.000
Nick Graham: I guess like she my step mom asked me, What do you mean by that.

316
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:16.590
Nick Graham: And I said, well,

317
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:29.250
Nick Graham: Abortion is something that is, um, and here's the way I like to frame the phrase it incorrectly is done out of convenience and not out of necessity. I didn't know the word falling in the middle of there was

318
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.080
Nick Graham: I saw it is like it's a choice like

319
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.540
Nick Graham: You cannot have a kid at that time it is inconvenient to have a kid. So you have an abortion.

320
00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:47.820
Nick Graham: And I guess I over simplified it. And so my step mom like, evidently, I didn't know that she had had an abortion before

321
00:32:48.540 --> 00:33:04.980
Nick Graham: And it evidently had some like left some severe trauma and she like freaked out and like really freaked out like physically like when while I've never seen her like she's level headed. She's like a really level headed chilled out like

322
00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.020
Nick Graham: She's like a pharmacist like really calm, like, and I just watched your flip

323
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

324
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.830
Nick Graham: So it's like a weird thing going on my family, but the lesson I learned was

325
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.780
Nick Graham: Any subject. I'm ever talking about I should talk.

326
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:32.190
Nick Graham: Whomever I'm talking to. I should speak about that subject as if the person I'm speaking to has been personally impacted by it like almost makes me feel like I need to be more like

327
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:44.160
Nick Graham: Thoughtful insensitive about any discount any topic because you never know who you're talking to. That might have been impacted, such as a weird little thing. I don't know.

328
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so you're learning. You're not. You're learning about yourself, you're young, you're also you have a right to share your opinion because that's how we get to find out how strongly we can feel

329
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.890
Nick Graham: You know, we go

330
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Off we say the words should, you know, as if it's an imperative and you get to hear your own voice, and you got a reality check that it may not be right, just this black and white thing it's conference.

331
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Complex. It's got human beings with their own stories behind it.

332
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.400
Nick Graham: Yeah.

333
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So to see just check it in inside and see there's family dynamics going on. Why do you think that is the most pressing let's say issue going on right now. But that's what we're going to talk about today. Check in inside

334
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.210
Nick Graham: I don't know what's important for you.

335
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.060
Nick Graham: I guess I'm just not sure what

336
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:48.960
Nick Graham: Only just recency probably like that was just a couple days ago, I think that my family's in somewhat of a support system and then like potentially losing that could be

337
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:51.240
Nick Graham: Alarming

338
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.250
Nick Graham: In terms of like

339
00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:55.920
Nick Graham: Support Systems.

340
00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.350
Nick Graham: Beyond that, like,

341
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.720
Nick Graham: I don't know. It just seems like it like it's been a pretty white bread week

342
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:12.600
Nick Graham: And I can't really think a much else to focus. I don't even know me now. Okay.

343
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

344
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to do a little bit of preparation work so that down the line, you know, be nice if you were

345
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:24.720
Nick Graham: In

346
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: In a room where we could kind of have a little bit more structure. I haven't able to do it in the car. But let's just do a little preparation work for what possibly we may be doing some MTR work together. If you decide that. That's okay.

347
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show the screen for just a second, so you can see what I'm doing. I have this. Now of course this is something I was starting in a group and I'm continuing to work on in an individual

348
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like to do is develop this with you, which is this I referred to it as the sun subjective.

349
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Press sounds very sort of robotic but it can be useful when I check in and say, well, how, how are you doing what what level of distress to you at all have a reference point.

350
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So just picture that zero is a relaxed state. It isn't necessarily the ideal because some people down at this state of relaxation have experienced that disrupts a dystopia associative experience they have fainted have had such sort of this dangerous threat response.

351
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost leave consciousness. Right. That's part of the

352
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: stress response the some of the other ones, of course, are fight.

353
00:36:48.990 --> 00:37:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And flight. And then there's this freeze response. So I don't make this assumption that the ideal is zero for some people that can also be a stressful thing is being in this relaxed body but just for now I want you to take for a moment that zero is

354
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: really relaxed a relaxed body and 100 is the most

355
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Stress stressed event that has happened to you want you to think for a moment what is in the middle of that. What say about a 50

356
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could still think you could still reason you're not out of your mind. You haven't dissociated you're still in your body, but it was not a 50% stress. It was upsetting.

357
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What what memory comes to mind around that.

358
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.430
Nick Graham: Around 250 so something that's upsetting.

359
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.230
Nick Graham: It's not like going in the black like losing

360
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we don't actually get in a fight or have rage or right

361
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.840
Nick Graham: Somebody like

362
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.290
Nick Graham: Any, any memory anytime like you would say

363
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:15.810
Nick Graham: Yes. Yeah, like that actually kind of happened yesterday there was like just a reasonably stressful work event that happened.

364
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:30.420
Nick Graham: Yeah, it was just like, I, I'm like alone right now in the office, like a meeting running the office because I the only person above me is gone right now and

365
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.190
Nick Graham: I wasn't like fully well equipped to

366
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.170
Nick Graham: Run things

367
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.070
Nick Graham: And so I was encountering a lot of like

368
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.110
Nick Graham: New situations that I did not know how to respond to

369
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:46.500
Nick Graham: And so

370
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.300
Nick Graham: What I did was, I was like, agitated.

371
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:59.250
Nick Graham: And a little yeah I was like agitated and I finally like work through it.

372
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.490
Nick Graham: With, like the help of some people but

373
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.100
Nick Graham: I was like, kind of like

374
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:11.880
Nick Graham: Shoulders like tense. You know, like, tighten the chest kind of

375
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.540
Nick Graham: Some time like that it was not a big deal.

376
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So please, it's we have the agitated was the emotion. Yeah.

377
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.320
Yeah.

378
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We have

379
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: tightness in the chest and you have the circumstance of kind of what was it not knowing

380
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it I wasn't trained in what to do with this.

381
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Situation or not enough resources, what was the, what was the

382
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:47.370
Nick Graham: Yeah, they're, they're both they're both President yeah I wasn't training. I didn't have the resources in

383
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.430
Nick Graham: Wasn't receiving help from those who could help.

384
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.960
Nick Graham: Oh,

385
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.630
Nick Graham: It was kind of annoying.

386
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this last parts a little harder to get to, to hold that in your working mind and your consciousness of agitation and I don't know what to do. I haven't been trained. I don't have the resources. They're not helping. I'm agitated.

387
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: tightness in the chest.

388
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning does not have about you, about who you are, belief about you.

389
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be able to get there.

390
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: By finishing the sentence, I am

391
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning to solid that have

392
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it say about who you are.

393
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.970
Nick Graham: It probably says that

394
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:52.080
Nick Graham: I think

395
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief about you.

396
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

397
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:00.660
Nick Graham: I am

398
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.550
Nick Graham: Patient maybe or

399
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.180
Nick Graham: Resolute one of the two. I'm not sure which

400
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

401
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.580
Nick Graham: Yeah, I would say, I'm impatient when they something yeah I'm impatient.

402
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And in moments like that you'd like to be thinking about yourself.

403
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.480
Nick Graham: I would like to reframe it

404
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.870
Nick Graham: And look at it is like

405
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.650
Nick Graham: Not like

406
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.980
Nick Graham: Can I accomplish this, but like I want to look at it like I can accomplish this.

407
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.630
Nick Graham: Is less of a questionable thing like

408
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.530
Nick Graham: Have more confidence in my ability to

409
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.140
Nick Graham: Make decisions.

410
00:41:59.220 --> 00:41:59.430
Nick Graham: To

411
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.440
Nick Graham: Make good decisions.

412
00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice that they're not exactly opposites that patience isn't right. So check and see what you actually believed about yourself at the time. See if there's more to it than impatience.

413
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you believe about yourself.

414
00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:39.660
Nick Graham: I remember

415
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.320
Nick Graham: Believing that whatever this specific task was could like I couldn't accomplishment. I could not accomplish it.

416
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.430
Nick Graham: But that's not really

417
00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.070
Nick Graham: Like a self thing.

418
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's find out.

419
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

420
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm capable I'm

421
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.060
Nick Graham: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think a big capable

422
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: At the time, do you remember thinking something like I'm not capable

423
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.540
Nick Graham: Yeah, totally. Okay.

424
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: As you try that on. Now what happens when you have that thought.

425
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:36.840
Nick Graham: It doesn't feel great to believe that

426
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it feel what's the emotion.

427
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.440
Nick Graham: Yeah, it's kind of like a

428
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.530
Nick Graham: Like a disappointing opinion to have

429
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

430
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:54.780
Make

431
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel disappointed.

432
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:02.700
Nick Graham: Yeah, I was disappointed if, like, if that was like my worldview.

433
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it was yesterday.

434
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:10.500
Nick Graham: Getting

435
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.220
Nick Graham: In like elevated

436
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.310
Nick Graham: Times, there's like stress and stuff.

437
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.310
Nick Graham: A lot of times, it goes straight to

438
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.600
Nick Graham: futility.

439
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To me more about that. I want to understand what you mean.

440
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.480
Nick Graham: Yeah, I am.

441
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:40.650
Nick Graham: Probably the worst thing that I can I, that I do that, I would love to change.

442
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.410
Nick Graham: In terms of like

443
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.710
Nick Graham: Anger and stress like

444
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.350
Nick Graham: I react.

445
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.590
Nick Graham: Like let's say, I'll give you an example like

446
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.780
Nick Graham: For like in a relationship or something if I

447
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.810
Nick Graham: Let's say I saw

448
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.980
Nick Graham: In example my accent like

449
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:14.940
Nick Graham: Done something like to talk to someone in it in like said something bad about me and made me feel really bad. But what I do is

450
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.740
Nick Graham: Just go ballistic like I think

451
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:29.100
Nick Graham: Just because there's a bad moment my entire reality is fixated on this bad moment.

452
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:36.450
Nick Graham: And every decision I make is, is if there is no moment after this moment.

453
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.780
Nick Graham: And so I fly into a rage. Like, I don't, I'm not physically abusive.

454
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:54.990
Nick Graham: But I say some fucked up shit to people like nothing like mainly to people who I deeply care for, like, in my life, like I say, to just anyone

455
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.980
Nick Graham: But I have a hard time reframing

456
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.370
Nick Graham: Negative times negative emotions.

457
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.810
Nick Graham: And they seem like all that matter. All that matters is that moment.

458
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I got that.

459
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you want to change in times of anger and significant stress, especially around people that you care deeply about is you. I think you'd like some choice.

460
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To be able to move differently and what we don't like is the fact that after right you can kind of reflect back what you remember is you were in a rage, as if

461
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no other way to be as if making your point was the as this life critical like how like you have to hear this. You have to see this have to understand this. So tell me where I'm off track.

462
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.740
Nick Graham: Now that sounds, that sounds pretty accurate, um,

463
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.110
Nick Graham: And I remember

464
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:16.560
Nick Graham: Like my dad would always tell me like your mom in times of anger will just spew venom that was like the way he put it, and

465
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:26.790
Nick Graham: That's how I feel. It's like a defense thing like I'm feeling hurt so I fly off the handle, like I say some things like

466
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:35.220
Nick Graham: Just really bad things to try to you know the best defense is a good offense is like the way that I would get only describe it.

467
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.290
Nick Graham: And I'll say things like

468
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:43.410
Nick Graham: Like my like my ex was not like like she was intelligent in her in our own ways, but not

469
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.010
Nick Graham: Really into, I would say things like

470
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:56.400
Nick Graham: It's like you're like talking to a five year old like for the last three years of my life. It's been like talking to a kindergartener like really hurtful things

471
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so working from the outside in what you're doing.

472
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is showing someone

473
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feel that's what venom does

474
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The different the freedom and it does take

475
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Concentration and it does take effort and rehearsal of new communication skills. Okay, where you express how you're feeling versus showing it. Okay, no doubt that will have a profound impact.

476
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If you

477
00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Go on a detox and you say, I cannot act out how I'm feeling anymore. Instead,

478
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a right to share it.

479
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I may not be able to change the outcome. They may not understand, we can't control what other people think and feel, but I can do this one thing

480
00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can share and I feel statement, I can say it. Honestly, I can say it. And that's it. I can detach from outcome, but

481
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all out here. That's all our way out here. But first, now we come a little deeper, we say that might be a solution. But if we haven't addressed what's going on inside of you.

482
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In her personally when when you are being misunderstood that one.

483
00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the one is that the critical piece.

484
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:31.830
Nick Graham: co founder, I think.

485
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it about being misunderstood.

486
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.330
Nick Graham: In those kind of situations.

487
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.480
Nick Graham: Yeah, like basically if the person doesn't like

488
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.660
Nick Graham: totally on board and like

489
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.180
Nick Graham: submissive Lee like

490
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.360
Nick Graham: Like apologetic.

491
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.130
Nick Graham: Then

492
00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.760
Nick Graham: It's just, yeah.

493
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.740
Nick Graham: Then it's not like

494
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:12.870
Nick Graham: An end even then it's not it's not enough like. So to go back to what you're saying. I was doing this. This just happened Saturday, where

495
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:21.630
Nick Graham: I was like upset because I saw some, like, whatever. And I said, I feel because and I tried it. I did it.

496
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:27.750
Nick Graham: But then one thing like like I was like going to hang out with this person.

497
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.270
Nick Graham: Like throughout the night and then

498
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:41.040
Nick Graham: Like her friend called and then suddenly she's like, Well, I got to go in and out in suddenly it went from like like actually like progressive discussion about like

499
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.440
Nick Graham: Things to like

500
00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.390
Nick Graham: Rage like

501
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.850
Nick Graham: Okay, right. I guess because

502
00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you have a guess about why why is that

503
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.360
Nick Graham: Expectations okay if if things don't

504
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:05.070
Nick Graham: I basically, I guess, like the way I put it, I act like a toddler, that doesn't get his own way.

505
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.220
Nick Graham: In that situation.

506
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:15.090
Nick Graham: Like to me it's like we both communicated. Hey, here's a plan and then suddenly

507
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:21.870
Nick Graham: For this person a better plan comes up and then our plan is gone. So a few things there like

508
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:25.320
Nick Graham: expectations for me.

509
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.900
Nick Graham: The feeling of disrespect from like

510
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.350
Nick Graham: Two people on the same page, and then suddenly

511
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

512
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.170
Nick Graham: They're not yes

513
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you actually hear what you actually said

514
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.020
Nick Graham: I said,

515
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.270
Nick Graham: Oh shit. Yeah. All right. I said, I'm

516
00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.050
Nick Graham: Something along the lines of

517
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.050
Nick Graham: Like it's kind of fucked up because we are

518
00:51:53.370 --> 00:52:00.420
Nick Graham: We have plans and then at the drop of a hat you will go to a party at any time. And I said, like

519
00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.640
Nick Graham: You don't have

520
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.080
Nick Graham: Any like

521
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.150
Nick Graham: What I say

522
00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.850
Nick Graham: Everything you do is to please others and like you

523
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.360
Nick Graham: will do anything to like fit in.

524
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't even have to carry on.

525
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's, I want you to hear back what what happened. So you said to your therapist. I did the I feel because

526
00:52:38.700 --> 00:53:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And then your therapist checked in on what you actually said and what you said to this person that you wanted to go have a good time with that you care for was what you're doing. It's fucked up. You always want to please people you are the problem you attacked neighbor.

527
00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You showed so so in your mind. Do you think you used the therapeutic format of I feel because

528
00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:17.430
Nick Graham: Yeah, so I feel because was earlier in the conversation so

529
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to hear.

530
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:25.290
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. So, and that's like kind of what I'm, what I'm getting at is like I used to. I feel because

531
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.130
Nick Graham: We had a progressive discussion where we talked like

532
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:40.620
Nick Graham: If it's truly like getting somewhere. And then one thing and then I'm sucking fly like flying off the handle like instantly and it's like

533
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.440
Nick Graham: That's not where I want to be like that's not healthy like that so unhealthy.

534
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But you literally I got you this just indulge me. I want to hear your I feel statement would you say were specifically

535
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.300
Nick Graham: Yes, it was, um, what was it, what I'm

536
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.790
Nick Graham: It was like, I feel

537
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.170
Nick Graham: I'm trying to think what the context was we're basically talking

538
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.230
Nick Graham: Oh yeah, I feel like

539
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.410
Nick Graham: Yeah, it was. I feel upset that we only

540
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.070
Nick Graham: Hang out with each other when it's convenient in were essentially like

541
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.300
Nick Graham: Fallback options for one another, like with our plans.

542
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.070
Okay.

543
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me more about upset. What is that I don't feel upset upset for different people means something different. What's upset. Maybe fine tune that

544
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.930
Nick Graham: Yeah, I probably. I'm trying to think. The exact context of the discussion, but at the time I felt

545
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:52.920
Nick Graham: Yeah, I guess I could use like

546
00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:03.390
Nick Graham: And I guess. Yeah, it was really, you know, it was really, actually, I feel sad that like you and I use like used to be like

547
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.220
Nick Graham: Greatest best friends. And then it's like devolved

548
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:20.190
Nick Graham: Into us just like hanging out when it's only convenient for either of us and not prioritizing each other.

549
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

550
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And

551
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you hear that you were getting across a boundary. One hand if you had just kept it with I feel sad that I call on you when my other plans.

552
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Have fallen through or I feel sad when the story I makeup is on your backup plan when your plans fall through. But you didn't do either one of those

553
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You got inside her head and made up a story about what what's going on for the both of you.

554
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ask her a direct question. Am I someone you want to spend time with

555
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.860
Nick Graham: No, definitely not.

556
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So you went inside. Imagine we all do it. We naturally will come up with a story. We will fill it in.

557
00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:25.650
Nick Graham: That's what our brand.

558
00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't mean it's correct.

559
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and

560
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece about

561
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That you really told her how you feel. I don't know that you'd fully did because if instead you had said.

562
00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't feel important.

563
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't treat you.

564
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: As if you are a priority.

565
00:56:57.150 --> 00:57:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's different than summarizing for the both of you. And she not hearing it, and then you get pissed off about it because she goes and does the very thing that was upsetting made you sad.

566
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But it wasn't quite as clean and direct as really because she went into analysis with the whole, this is what we're doing. Well, maybe she doesn't agree.

567
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's clear on your part. But I think the next time we meet, I think we could talk about

568
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This word disrespect you felt disrespected heard that earlier on in there to there was this disrespect. And I'm wondering if this being valued, that part is a big one for you.

569
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.070
Nick Graham: Yeah.

570
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.970
Nick Graham: Yeah, like, really. Okay.

571
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's um

572
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me. I'm gonna write a little, little note about that and we're at the top of the hour went by quite fast.

573
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And I did get one item in here. You know, I got this. This piece of the 50% I want to continue to build. I want to know more about what 100 is I want to know what

574
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, sort of this being able to be in this window of distress. That's kind of where we're going to want to do our work. It's not going to be too upsetting, not to relax and kind of

575
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So that it's we're doing some important work. And I think we got we got into a good place in here and I'm thinking,

576
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That

577
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Feelings of

578
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you tell me what do you think it's at the core of this

579
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, emotion, yeah.

580
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.020
Nick Graham: I would, I would think like

581
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.370
Nick Graham: self worth in

582
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.060
Nick Graham: The I feel like I'm

583
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:53.730
Nick Graham: Others, you know, valuation of me like

584
00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.000
Nick Graham: defines my own self worth, maybe here.

585
00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you do, right, is then you go into analysis and you attack them.

586
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.190
Nick Graham: Around that so you

587
00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Little problem. And yes, of course, it is a great defense mechanism. And then you never have to sit with I feel undervalued right now.

588
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do that if you're criticizing some someone else's low self esteem and people pleasing behavior and you show up angry all they're going to see is that anger and you're going to push them away.

589
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:33.270
Nick Graham: Yeah.

590
00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:35.130
Nick Graham: I definitely did that. Yeah, yeah.

591
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you don't have to deal with this self worth stuff. This one you just ran across the self worth is probably a core

592
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative belief that I think can be very useful for us in the MTR work. I like a written it right here. I think it's a big one. I'm guessing only know and when we get into it, but I'd like to revisit this one.

593
01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:00.810
Nick Graham: But you

594
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:01.830
Say,

595
01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a guarantee that just because you said I'm sad. I'm upset.

596
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's just this windfall of harmony that happens in communication because it broke down.

597
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it broke down a little bit, because you started to project your own analysis under her side. And if you're doing it to me. I said, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

598
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's for me. I'll tell you how I feel seeing yourself.

599
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling about my blowing you off.

600
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Rejected right something like that unimportant.

601
01:00:53.010 --> 01:01:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Sitting with your own self worth is hard. Okay, I get that. So maybe it's not that much more complicated. Maybe it's just, I've got to have the courage to sit with my own feelings.

602
01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And not try and self protect with all that rage and anger and blaming other people in and throwing analysis Adam Right unsolicited. They didn't say, hey, what's your analysis of how I treat my friends.

603
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I don't know why we should all right let's let's talk about next week, you're going to go to group as much as I do want to follow up with this work with you.

604
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, really, really deliberate. Can you create time to be in a room with if you can't pull off the iPad or laptop and we want to have

605
01:01:49.620 --> 01:02:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue containers or something where I can get. I can have you be able to look at these two two spots. Normally, I've been using this light system that goes back and forth, but

606
01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to do some desensitization with you around some of that negative cognition install some positive stuff, there's lots to do, and I want to. We just started where we just got into the sun's just now got a little piece want to continue this work with you but

607
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It'd be nice to have it set up. Well, what do you envision your

608
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:33.660
Nick Graham: Dream. Do you think when I can post. I guess I could probably go to my because my house, my walls or two then for any kind of privacy, I wouldn't even feel comfortable

609
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:36.810
Nick Graham: But

610
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.340
Nick Graham: Maybe I can go to like my office or something like that.

611
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Look around there today and think. All right, what would February 11 be like, you know,

612
01:02:50.010 --> 01:03:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you don't like that timing could be even earlier. Can you know that if we go ahead early. I can create seven in the morning. Right. And then, nobody's there or so just investigate what would work. Okay.

613
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:05.340
Nick Graham: Yeah, if it's your kid. I can like see about I'm

614
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:19.920
Nick Graham: Getting like just doing it because maybe what I can do is like one week, I can pull off like a group and an individual, but like I agree that I want to go down this path. So I'd like to do it next week appointment. If you have one

615
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.460
Okay.

616
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like somebody I've already got here at eight in the morning. On February 4 um let me just see if I can just a Wednesday.

617
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we can meet on February 5 which is it'll feel like this.

618
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday, February 5 at 8am.

619
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.170
Nick Graham: To 8am.

620
01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have some things ahead of you, that you mentioned, just to review if you're interested. It's too.

621
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If you wanted to the I feel it would be saying the feeling and

622
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

623
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Analyzing just exactly

624
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Facts. When you said you're going out with Sarah I felt rejected, I felt unimportant. That's a fact. Doesn't mean it's going to be perceived the same. But what's not a fact is that

625
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We both

626
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Are not a priority. That's, that's that that's not what's going on.

627
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right okay that invitation. There's also reaching out to psychiatrists. There's also if you want to check out

628
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, more into insurance. Go for it. And there's also really

629
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Calling ahead arranging not just movie night. What about Friday, you know, what about Thursday. What about Saturday. What about Sunday.

630
01:04:54.300 --> 01:05:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe Monday night, even more so like that might really those those days where you have time off maybe those are the priority to make sure you have plans put together, even if it's

631
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like an out in the bowling or a new activity, maybe, I don't know what a police class or something, but just really be on purpose and get some planning in place to protect yourself protect that time.

632
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:21.180
Nick Graham: Okay. Good idea.

633
