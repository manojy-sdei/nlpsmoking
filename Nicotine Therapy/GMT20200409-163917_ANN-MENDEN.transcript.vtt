8
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Etc, etc. And certainly will be time for for questions and we'll kind of see where we'll go for for treatment for you. Okay.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.320
Pixel 2: Am I going to be able to get any kind of a prescription today.

10
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.060
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. What, what is your drug of choice what you've been using

11
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.170
Pixel 2: I was I was, I used to use started with opiate pain pills and it was

12
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.310
Pixel 2: All kinds of different opiates, but I've actually been I was seeing a doctor in

13
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.980
Pixel 2: Santo day and I was

14
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.200
Pixel 2: On he was prescribing me some tax. And then what happened was I moved back to this area. I'm originally from here.

15
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:10.320
Pixel 2: Uh huh. And I haven't been able to find a doctor here so I'm kind of like in a weird Limbo. And then I went to the to like an emergency room, a couple times and they gave me a refill. And then they didn't want to do it anymore. So I'm like,

16
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.520
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh yeah, no.

17
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.740
ANN MENDENHALL: panicking, or we don't we don't want to see. I mean that the risk of relapse. After you've been on Suboxone

18
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.160
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, for a while is pretty high. So yeah, no, I, you know, we'll go through the whole thing and then we'll discuss the methods that you know I prescribe Suboxone

19
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:45.480
ANN MENDENHALL: Either the films or the tabs, whichever one you prefer. And usually it's kind of whichever one your, your insurance will cover some of them cover both some of them cover one some cover the other and they will substitute the generic. But yeah, definitely will do that.

20
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. Yeah, no, I can understand. So, so, you know, rest assured, we're gonna we're going to take you out.

21
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so let me get into your, your chart here.

22
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.450
ANN MENDENHALL: And

23
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.120
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

24
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.410
ANN MENDENHALL: move things around just a little bit side. See this little better.

25
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.470
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so

26
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.880
ANN MENDENHALL: For starters, I like to go into kind of

27
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.130
ANN MENDENHALL: Your history with opiate use any, anything else you might be using. So currently, I'm

28
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.620
ANN MENDENHALL: Are you using any opiate pills or heroin or just a subset semi text or you're out of everything.

29
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:47.220
Pixel 2: I've done completely out of everything I've been taking the subway tax. I think it's the tablets like probably the last six months or so.

30
00:03:47.430 --> 00:04:01.650
Pixel 2: Okay, and then I just like i said i i when i came moved back out here. I had maybe half of a month supply and then I ran out. I started a new job here so it's been like two days.

31
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.030
Pixel 2: Since I since I ran out. That's the only thing that that I have been taking or using for

32
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.190
Pixel 2: You know, at least eight months or so is

33
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.480
ANN MENDENHALL: Though, okay.

34
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.870
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, let me just kind of jot that down.

35
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.090
ANN MENDENHALL: So you were only able to get some like at the ER here or was that back wherever you were living

36
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.920
Pixel 2: It was in Modesto to Modesto

37
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.090
ANN MENDENHALL: But desktop. Okay.

38
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:45.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, they'll give you some for a while, but then they they kind of good, especially now with everything that's going on. They just don't want anybody to come into the ER for much of anything but coven

39
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.390
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and so you said that you've been out for two days. Yeah, okay.

40
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:10.650
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and what kind of symptoms are you feeling now just since you've been out for two days.

41
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.410
Pixel 2: I just I I like

42
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.140
Pixel 2: I went to work yesterday because it was the first day I thought I'd be all right. But I was

43
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.690
Pixel 2: Just barely got through the day. And then, and then I didn't sleep really last night, and then

44
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.310
ANN MENDENHALL: I woke.

45
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.960
Pixel 2: Up. I woke up this morning and called and i just i just don't just

46
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.300
Pixel 2: You know, sweaty and didn't sleep and I just feel like a nauseous aches and

47
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.850
ANN MENDENHALL: A lot of withdrawal symptoms that sounds

48
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.090
Pixel 2: Like so.

49
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.610
Pixel 2: Much for hello

50
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.450
Yeah.

51
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.790
ANN MENDENHALL: What, what was your dose on that the semi Tex.

52
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.140
It was

53
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.600
Pixel 2: eight milligrams twice daily. Okay.

54
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.520
ANN MENDENHALL: I can do that.

55
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:12.930
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, have you had in the past when you were using the pills or in. Did you ever use heroin or was it strictly just pill.

56
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.890
Pixel 2: Yeah, I did. I did. But it's, it's just been it's it's been a, you know, years really since

57
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.530
Pixel 2: I did there was a time when I

58
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.920
Pixel 2: When it was a when I was using that

59
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.760
Okay.

60
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:40.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, I mean, most people as things have changed. You know, in medicine in terms of being able to get prescription so many people will provide a pretty high amount of opiates.

61
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:50.370
ANN MENDENHALL: For you know musculoskeletal pain or whatever. And then, you know, as we've been told us providers, not to prescribe that much anymore. You know, it's

62
00:06:50.850 --> 00:07:05.820
ANN MENDENHALL: Which I think is a good thing. On the other hand, and left a lot of people hanging that, you know, had become addicted really through no intention or fault of their own, so you know it's it's it's definitely been a rough time for for a lot of people

63
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:18.510
ANN MENDENHALL: So, you know, and when I asked you questions about the use, there's no no judgment here whatsoever. I just want to do whatever I can to help you. So, but it helps me to kind of know what your history is so

64
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.460
ANN MENDENHALL: We can do it. Yes.

65
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:28.650
Pixel 2: I did. I used. I used to have used, you know, heroin for a number of years been probably

66
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.150
Pixel 2: In my late 20s AND EARLY 30s, I

67
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.910
Pixel 2: Definitely did

68
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.780
Okay.

69
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.700
ANN MENDENHALL: So, and you are 39 now so

70
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.430
ANN MENDENHALL: Maybe you 10 years use more or less.

71
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.530
Pixel 2: I would say around there. Yeah.

72
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.310
Okay.

73
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.760
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

74
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.190
ANN MENDENHALL: And

75
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.430
ANN MENDENHALL: Have you ever had any overdoses on. Okay, okay.

76
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.920
ANN MENDENHALL: We had to go to the ER for that.

77
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. And so the withdrawal symptoms. You're having now.

78
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.770
ANN MENDENHALL: So you're sweaty, you can't sleep. Are you are you feeling sort of anxious agitated.

79
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.690
Pixel 2: Yeah.

80
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.270
Pixel 2: Yeah.

81
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.410
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

82
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:45.570
ANN MENDENHALL: Any consequences of opiate use and that could be something you know like legal like DUI arrests, or it could be work related or you know relationship related

83
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:57.900
Pixel 2: I would say, you know, right now it's kind of a, it's kind of a situation where I'm like, man, I like this, you know, I called in to work today and it's like

84
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.170
Pixel 2: You know and like I just

85
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:12.240
Pixel 2: Did the age on Matt to still be calling into work for this kind of stuff kind of stupid. So, you know, work. It's probably work related issue right now going on.

86
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.040
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, but

87
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.440
Pixel 2: It's not an issue is that it's not an issue yet.

88
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.340
Pixel 2: But

89
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.370
ANN MENDENHALL: But it could become if you keep calling it and probably

90
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:30.030
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, well that's, you know, good for you for catching that, you know, pretty quickly and realizing, okay, I need, I need some help here.

91
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.580
ANN MENDENHALL: And and finding

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.170
ANN MENDENHALL: What do you do for work.

94
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.570
Pixel 2: diesel truck shops, a lot

95
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.520
Pixel 2: Of hard work, you know, labor's labor is kind of work so

96
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.380
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, exactly.

97
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.030
ANN MENDENHALL: And a dangerous were to if you're not feeling well, sure.

98
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:17.460
ANN MENDENHALL: How about any other substance use and that could be alcohol benzo math anything

99
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.790
Pixel 2: No.

100
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.510
Pixel 2: Really, I just, I

101
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.800
Pixel 2: I drank.

102
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:34.980
Pixel 2: I drank like occasionally when I was when I was younger. But then when with the with the opiates and stuff. I just, I kind of went

103
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.740
Pixel 2: Okay. Ever since then I just really train or anything much after that.

104
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:47.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and no no math or ends and asked me, it's like Xanax or Valium or anything like that.

105
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.420
Pixel 2: No. Okay.

106
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.380
ANN MENDENHALL: All right.

107
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.730
ANN MENDENHALL: What's the longest amount of time that you've been sober where you've been, you know, off opiates.

108
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.490
ANN MENDENHALL: Or on this side, be tax.

109
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.080
Pixel 2: On the on the subjects. I've been on them for

110
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:12.930
Pixel 2: Price six to eight months. And I've, I've had, I've had year like, you know, two, three years when I was clean.

111
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:14.580
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

112
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:25.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Great. Have you ever gone to a treatment facility like residential treatment.

113
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.520
ANN MENDENHALL: Or a or in a or anything like that.

114
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:39.630
Pixel 2: Yeah, I went to. I went to meet a couple meetings before. I know, I know I have some families a brother and cousins and stuff that are go there involved in that.

115
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.010
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

116
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.920
Pixel 2: A community. So I went with them.

117
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.990
Pixel 2: You know, what have you meeting.

118
00:11:50.520 --> 00:12:01.140
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, I think that's really helpful. I might my son is sober for oh it's been about seven years right now from alcohol and he at first.

119
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:07.590
ANN MENDENHALL: We had two meetings every day now. He doesn't go to as many, but I've gone to several with him and

120
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:21.000
ANN MENDENHALL: He has I think it's really important to have a sponsor, because then you know if something happens, like, you know, thank God you caught this before you went back to the opiates, because that could have been a real risk for relapse.

121
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:33.630
ANN MENDENHALL: So, you know, good for you for doing that. But having a sponsor you know when something comes up or, you know, I think for a lot of people right now everybody's so stressed out about what's going on with this pandemic.

122
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:41.790
ANN MENDENHALL: That having a sponsor, it can be really helpful to just kind of get you through any rough patches or periods of anxiety. So

123
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.510
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, that certainly is not something that we say you have to do, but I just you know personally recommend it.

124
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:58.530
ANN MENDENHALL: And going to meeting. So in, you know, and going to meetings to particularly if you just sort of moved back here actually might be a good way to meet other people that

125
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:10.440
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, you could, you know, enjoy spending time with that are also sober won't be sort of a risk factor, although it's kind of hard to spend time with anybody right now. But you know what I mean.

126
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.690
Pixel 2: It's true.

127
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.300
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. So what about

128
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:30.030
ANN MENDENHALL: past medical history, do you have any history of things like arthritis or gout or asthma or COPD or diabetes or seizures or anything like that.

129
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.310
ANN MENDENHALL: I don't. Okay.

130
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:33.990
Pixel 2: Yeah.

131
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:45.930
Pixel 2: I mean, though. The only thing I've like been seen like made appointments for was a migraines. I was getting migraines for a while there. So I was going to get an imitrex and but I don't really

132
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.040
Pixel 2: manage them up kind of figured out how to manage them over the years.

133
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Good for you. What do you do for them.

134
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.620
Pixel 2: It's like a

135
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.760
Pixel 2: Date, they pop up when I

136
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.480
Pixel 2: Like get set on a certain schedule sleeping, eating and then break down.

137
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.580
Pixel 2: You know, stay away or

138
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.590
Pixel 2: Eat start eating junk food weird stuff like that. You like a person who's a lot of preservatives and stuff like that.

139
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:27.510
ANN MENDENHALL: Uh huh why that's, yeah. You nailed it because I get them sometimes too and it's it's usually the sleep thing, you can certainly trigger them, but the food too. It's so important. So you're not on imitrex anymore.

140
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.370
ANN MENDENHALL: Already

141
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.320

ANN MENDENHALL: No. Okay.

201
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:07.320

202
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:08.430
Pixel 2: I can

203
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.350
ANN MENDENHALL: Just occasional yeah

204
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.810
ANN MENDENHALL: And now this is kind of

205
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.550
ANN MENDENHALL: More or less head to toe things whoops want that.

206
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.520
ANN MENDENHALL: So do you have

207
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:50.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Any. This is kind of things that are happening to like right now. It's called review of systems. So we kind of go, you know, head to toe briefly through things that might be

208
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Symptoms you're having. So currently any fever, night sweats chills fatigue.

209
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.870
Pixel 2: I would say pride chills and 50

210
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.160
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, which is part of that withdrawal stuff. Okay.

211
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.140
ANN MENDENHALL: No fever, though.

212
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.120
ANN MENDENHALL: No. Okay.

213
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.150
ANN MENDENHALL: How about are you starting to get a runny nose.

214
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.980
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah yeah

215
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.820
ANN MENDENHALL: So,

216
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.150
ANN MENDENHALL: And

217
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.540
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, how about a cop shortness of breath, difficulty breathing wheezing.

218
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:42.240
Pixel 2: And I can, I think, that has to do with that too. I've noticed when I like the withdrawal symptoms. I kind of, I think it raises my blood pressure a little bit or something.

219
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.760
Pixel 2: And I still like my chest starts feeling

220
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:46.710
Pixel 2: It's kind of

221
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.910
Pixel 2: Like cardiovascular something's going on you know what

222
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.620
Pixel 2: Yeah, a little easier.

223
00:22:53.400 --> 00:23:03.030
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, you know the other thing that that could be too is, you know, because you're going through withdrawal, that raises your anxiety and oftentimes anxiety.

224
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:17.970
ANN MENDENHALL: Really presents in a lot of people who are starting to have a panic attack or certainly Oh for sure think they have a heart attack and it's just, that's kind of what happens. You get that chest tightness and it's uncomfortable and pretty scary, but any

225
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Palpitations,

226
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.580

ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, that's pretty common.

233
00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.050
ANN MENDENHALL: This

234
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.680
ANN MENDENHALL: Muscle pain back pain.

235
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.420

236
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.430

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:08.070
ANN MENDENHALL: I wouldn't expect that either. Okay enough of all those. And let me

256
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.460
ANN MENDENHALL: Just put something in here.

257
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.420
ANN MENDENHALL: And you have no history of any suicide attempts, either.

258
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:39.840
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and are currently are you taking any medications, other than you were taking this IV tax.

259
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.280
Pixel 2: That's it.

260
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.150
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

261
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.290
Pixel 2: Just, just though.

262
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.480
Pixel 2: I had a by her my

263
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.150
Pixel 2: I hit my knee or did something at work.

264
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.530
Pixel 2: And it started it started swelling up kinda and I went in there and they

265
00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.940
Pixel 2: They were like, Well, you know, we can give you a

266
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:11.730
Pixel 2: We can treat it for cellulitis. Yeah, but I think they just did that because I told them that I didn't remember exactly how I hit it.

267
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:22.320
Pixel 2: And then so they gave me the antibiotics. And then the next day. It just went away. And so I didn't really I took him took him one time, I don't think it was any kind of infection. I took him one time and it just went away. It's fine now.

268
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.280
Pixel 2: Yeah, it was a precautionary thing maybe right

269
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:35.130
ANN MENDENHALL: And you usually don't get silly cellulitis. Usually it takes a little longer than that, you know, and that is definitely serious and you definitely need antibiotics.

270
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:43.710
ANN MENDENHALL: For it. But yeah, they probably will being precautionary and, you know, and I would say, you know, when you are prescribed antibiotics.

271
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.750
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, don't stop in the middle. If you only took it once, then I don't think it's that big a deal.

272
00:26:49.740 --> 00:27:05.520
ANN MENDENHALL: But if you take a half of a prescription and you stop then you risk becoming resistant to that particular medication and it won't work in the future. So, just FYI, but I don't think just taking it once and it doesn't sound like you had cellulitis to me.

273
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.350
Pixel 2: As what I didn't think I had

274
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.890
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, how about, do you have any drug allergies.

275
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.960
Pixel 2: No, I don't.

276
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.070
Okay.

281
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.590
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, I think.

282
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.490

286
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.160
