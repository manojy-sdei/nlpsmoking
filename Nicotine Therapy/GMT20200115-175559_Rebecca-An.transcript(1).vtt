15
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.070
Brice johnson: And when I finally got better. I was physically addicted to it. So when they, you know, quit PRESCRIBING IT TO ME. I got sick and then

16
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.350
Brice johnson: That's when I learned I was physically addicted to it and ended up going to rehab. When I was 18 for it to just get off of it. And that was it.

17
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.630

57
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.940

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. Okay. And it's just you and your wife that live in the home.

78
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:26.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah okay, going back a little bit to your two surgeries. Can you can't just kind of give me a little brief history of when you had your first surgery, what age and

79
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.460
Brice johnson: Yeah, so I have my first surgery when I was

80
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.510
Brice johnson: 13 after I'd had about 14 shoulder dislocations.

81
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.240
Brice johnson: Had that surgery, it was good for about two years.

82
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.710
Dislocated my shoulder.

83
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:52.860
Brice johnson: They did a quite a bit of damage. They did another surgery I dislocated my shoulder again had another surgery.

84
00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:08.700
Brice johnson: Went four years without dislocating it dislocated it three more times and severely injured it and then they did something called the Bristow procedure where they took cadaver bone and screwed it into mine, my

85
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.330
Brice johnson: My socket and

86
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.190
Brice johnson: That was probably the most painful and I had, and that one I was off work for about a year.

87
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.870
Brice johnson: So,

88
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kim, when was that

89
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.600
Brice johnson: When I was 18 I think now.

90
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me about your thumb. What happened with your thumb.

91
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.080
I

92
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.930
Brice johnson: I helped with helping my neighbor sure pig got loose and it was 1000 pound pig.

93
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.430
Brice johnson: And it was on the freeway at 11 at night and I ran to try and push it out of the way, because it was going to get hit by a car.

94
00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:05.160
Brice johnson: And it turned at 10 and to me as I was pushing in it snapped my thumb sideways and I popped it back in and I worked for about eight months, like that. But it just kept popping out. And finally, I went to the doctor and they they said I had a ruptured a

95
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.020
Brice johnson: Owner collateral ligament, I think, is what it was called

96
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:21.450
Brice johnson: And so they did surgery and they put a few screws in. And some cadaver ligaments and I wish I never would have got that surgery.

97
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.900
Brice johnson: It her way worse than the actual injury.

98
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: mishap.

99
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:34.350
Brice johnson: I was about seven months ago, I think, and they told me. It might take a year to heal. But I didn't

100
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.340
Brice johnson: I didn't really think they were serious. I guess.

101
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:48.120
Brice johnson: Yeah, it's, it's probably the most painful surgery. I've had. Because it, it just never stops hurting. It's a constant.

102
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pain throbbing or sharp pain or

103
00:08:52.440 --> 00:09:04.740
Brice johnson: Um, it depends on if I'm using it or not, it's kind of more throbbing if I'm not using it too much. But while I'm working. It can be stabbing burning, it's, it's a

104
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.310
Brice johnson: It's starting to get better though. I can feel it.

105
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're the buprenorphine helps with the pain level.

106
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, I'm

107
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

108
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The next piece is, can you tell me

109
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was the very first drug that you're ever exposed to.

110
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.030

Brice johnson: Norco

112
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.760

116
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:55.890
Brice johnson: It's known for that, you know, I tried it, it wasn't really my thing. I didn't like it. It makes me feel like an elephant sitting on my chest.

117
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when did you try it.

118
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.040

Brice johnson: Nothing really. I just, I was just on it more for the pain treatment and

131
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:15.090
Brice johnson: I'm hoping within the next couple months, I can be off of the buprenorphine. I'm hoping my thumb. Oh, I mean, I'm getting close to that year mark so I'm hoping that they're right in that pretty quick here. I should start feeling significantly better

132
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:15.870
Yeah.

133
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:26.310
