Lindsay Short: Um, it's been a pretty rough week

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.960
Lindsay Short: I don't know if it's just moodiness from

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:38.280
Lindsay Short: Detox media moodiness and whatnot, not like I'm having any physical symptoms, but it's just been like feels so depressed last few days.

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.270
Lindsay Short: And then

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.580
Lindsay Short: Just stupid stuff at work.

11
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.460
Lindsay Short: That's been contributing to

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.010
To it. Yeah.

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With a doctor that you work for.

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.430
Lindsay Short: No patient died and

15
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.120
Lindsay Short: I may have played a role.

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For some reason, I don't think so.

18
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.900
Lindsay Short: No, I'm pretty sure

19
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.570
Lindsay Short: Like it's my responsibility to keep people alive after surgery and

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.190
Lindsay Short: He died of something that could have been prevented by

21
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.820
Lindsay Short: Starting a blood thinner sooner than we did and

22
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you processing that

23
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a horrible place to be. And especially with

24
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know if fear still detoxing and going through, you know, the emotional rollercoaster.

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, which is a part of the detox part of it, you know.

26
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.860
Yeah.

27
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.190
Definitely

28
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.950

29
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.370

32
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.440
Lindsay Short: I can't

33
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.910
Lindsay Short: Function stop.

34
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.510
Lindsay Short: Taking it

35
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

36
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.030
Lindsay Short: I don't know.

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.880
Lindsay Short: I mean I've cut down and I'm already like all I want to do is sleep and eat. Yeah. You know, like we talked about last time I have to

38
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.550
Lindsay Short: Figure out some leave of absence, which is basically going to get me fired from my job. I think

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.710
Lindsay Short: I don't know what to do.

40
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So are you down to just using like once a day or in a

41
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.220
Lindsay Short: Little like capsules.

42
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.490
Lindsay Short: Take it as a pill and just take one in the morning.

43
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

44
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And as a getting less and less the amount you're putting in the capsule or you stay in at a certain level.

45
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.570
Lindsay Short: No, I just feel a bunch of like at a time, about the same.

46
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how long has it been since you used heroin.

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.040
Lindsay Short: Since I started here when I was

48
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a few weeks.

49
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.610
Yeah.

50
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, it takes

51
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About it can take up to about a year for your, your emotions mental state for everything to find its normal again.

52
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

53
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to remember. I know, I know.

54
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The after withdrawal, there's something that's called post acute withdrawal.

55
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and that's all that roller coaster emotional roller coaster stuff and

56
00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:03.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, if you could just when you feel yourself, you know, going down and feeling down understand that that's what you're experiencing, you know, that's a part of it all.

57
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:14.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just not just, you know, while in us. And of course, you know, still having that on the plate kind of pop

58
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably offsets it a little bit.

59
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, not 100% but a little bit

60
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.240
Yes.

61
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.070
Lindsay Short: I don't know if I can do it or not. The point is, right now it feels like

62
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.880
Lindsay Short: Forget why even started this

63
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.210
Lindsay Short: Is doing much better on

64
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.110
Lindsay Short: Heroin and everything just shooting up all day.

65
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:56.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know what we talked about. I mean, I remember you telling me the reasons you know and why you chose to do this.

66
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you have your boyfriend right for stuff that doesn't know your family. Right.

67
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And those were the reasons, your job, you know, if you

68
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.610
Lindsay Short: Lose all those anyways, just from being so

69
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.830
Lindsay Short: Depressed and miserable, especially if it goes on for a year.

70
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.150
Well,

71
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't the way you're feeling right now doesn't go on for a year, but you have, you get to this normal and then you have this

72
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:42.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you're like, Hey, what's going on, you know, why am I feeling this way if things have been going great for, you know, for so long, but you have to realize that in the first year of recovery, you know, is the toughest

73
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The toughest it gets better. It gets better every day, but you still have those. You know those times.

74
00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:01.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's not about how you feel right now because there's a lot more than just your you know what you're experiencing and being off heroin.

75
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got stress from work. You've got stress from you know what happened. You've got all these other issues that are playing a factor to, you know,

76
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.000
Yeah.

77
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can do this.

78
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.670
You know,

79
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's worth it in the end. It really is.

80
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I do know.

81
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

82
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're worth it.

83
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.270
That's not

84
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

85
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have a partner and you have a family that loves you and I know they certainly feel like you're worth it.

86
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.290
Lindsay Short: Even though you don't if they knew what I was doing.

87
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.270
Lindsay Short: They knew the truth. They wouldn't

88
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be somebody there.

89
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. Okay.

90
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not pointless. It really, I know it feels that way right now.

91
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's not it's not pointless.

92
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And tomorrow. Hopefully you'll feel a different way later tonight. Hopefully your feelings will change.

93
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:56.010
Lindsay Short: You know, like this, like straight through since Saturday, and I can't break it, like, all day at work. I haven't had a moment of relief and I don't

94
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.720
Lindsay Short: Know what fits just chemical or what

95
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.640
Lindsay Short: feel shitty is

96
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.750
Lindsay Short: The only reason I haven't

97
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.140
Lindsay Short: Got more heroin is just because my goes up in Orange County and then

98
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.670
Lindsay Short: I figured it wouldn't work right away. Anyways, with Spock's

99
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that you won't feel the

100
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The physical effects.

101
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See idea right is to block those receptors.

102
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that even if you were to to use that you wouldn't get the

103
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The, the euphoria that you you know that you're looking for.

104
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.640
Right, you know,

105
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's just about figuring out what is, what are you willing to do

106
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are you able to do and what are you willing to do you know

107
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.600
Lindsay Short: And knowing idea what I'm either

108
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.120
Lindsay Short: Just living like kind of moment to moment right now.

109
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.340
Lindsay Short: Yeah.

110
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes you have to

111
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes you have to

112
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.270
Lindsay Short: Just like being around my boyfriend. You know, I have to just tell him I'm having like

113
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.950
Lindsay Short: My

114
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.770
Lindsay Short: Depression like has been more or less gone for

115
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.250
Lindsay Short: I mean hasn't reemerged to any significant degree for many years.

116
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.170
Lindsay Short: Telling him.

117
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.670
Lindsay Short: That that's what has been going on the last few days because I came in. I did.

118
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or you want to. Can I asked her, you want to pursue medication.

119
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.130
Know,

120
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.590
Lindsay Short: I've been on everything under the sun. At one point, but not anything

121
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and what doctor do you work with with us.

122
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.450
Lindsay Short: Over for a neurosurgeon.

123
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know it bright heart.

124
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.210
Lindsay Short: What Dr. D word. Oh, Dr Hawke

Lindsay Short: Oh. PACHTER factor. Yeah.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you mind if I email him and and

127
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:22.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just give them a little info you know that you're struggling with your depression right now, and maybe

128
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.250
Lindsay Short: Even

129
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.580
Lindsay Short: I don't want to go on any more medication. I've tried everything.

130
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He might have different ideas on what and how you can that could help you know he's a doctor. So you might have it and he's really into alternatives to, you know,

131
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

132
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.590
Lindsay Short: Yeah, you can email them. Okay.

133
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm gonna definitely

134
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what is your boyfriend say about it.

135
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.080
Lindsay Short: Just kind of like freaked out.

136
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.500
Lindsay Short: He doesn't really know what to say. He's never

137
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:15.210
Lindsay Short: Been around anyone that's been like depressed to any you know me crying like again.

138
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.220
Lindsay Short: And

139
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.540
Lindsay Short: I'm able to control it for most of the day, but

140
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.290
Lindsay Short: Like Saturday morning I woke up and it was just like

141
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.430
Lindsay Short: Pure just like devastation. I don't even know where it came from. That was before I found out the patient, I

142
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.570
Lindsay Short: Couldn't even blame it on that.

143
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.120
Lindsay Short: But it certainly hasn't helped

144
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. I can see how it wouldn't

145
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

146
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:49.860
Yeah.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are you doing for for self care for you.

149
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.860
Lindsay Short: Know I'm working a lot. I don't really have time for.

150
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.650
Lindsay Short: Trying to get plenty of sleep.

151
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.380
Lindsay Short: This week I haven't done anything

152
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.950

Lindsay Short: angry at myself for this.

156
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.410
Lindsay Short: That's up at work and

157
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.180
Lindsay Short: Just in general.

158
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, what I know is that

159
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:54.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It has, you know, at some point, it has to, it has to be there. You got to take care of yourself. You know, you're working on sleep that's self care.

160
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about food. What are you eating.

161
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.310

199
00:15:50.460 --> 00:16:02.040
Lindsay Short: It's not like I'm thinking against mess. It's just that I've been on every end of depressing every mood stabilizer every anti psychotic medication like in the book and nothing has helped

229
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.530
Lindsay Short: Probably in the last few weeks. I've never listened to them before that.

230
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.890

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working you know

236
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:16.800

237
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's hard not to when you're in this kind of state of mind to revert back to a weight.

238
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was listening to this, I remember that sentence that he said, or I remember that. You know what he talked about, or she talked about about this, this type of stuff.

245
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.570

250
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.880

Lindsay Short: Power of Positive Thinking right now. I don't even want to

252
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about it.

253
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.080
Lindsay Short: It's just stupid.

254
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.700
Lindsay Short: It seems impossible.

255
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

256
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.560

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's doable. You know what I mean.

258
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.870

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.380
Lindsay Short: Yeah, that

267
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.420
Lindsay Short: makes me nervous though just going into a state of mind and yeah

268
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.240
Lindsay Short: Especially after what just happened.

269
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.810
