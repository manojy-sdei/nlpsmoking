00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:35.430
Dawn Abriel: So let me put you on gallery view. So you are right up here. And so I kind of need for you to be awake for this.

33
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:23.010

34
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.690
Dawn Abriel: So it is

35
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.640

36
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.370

37
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.530

Dawn Abriel: Okay, great. Okay, now john we need to talk about the program.

397
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.410
John Guzman: Okay, what

398
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:54.240
Dawn Abriel: What you're signing up for with Bray heart health is a commitment of two hours a week one hour of group therapy one hour of individual therapy.

399
00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:13.440
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Each week, every week. Those two hours. So I don't arrange the individual therapy, but you will do that with the therapist and we will know which therapist after we agree on. When your group is are you a morning person, a night person.

400
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.210
John Guzman: Gets kind of kind of night person, I guess.

401
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.000
John Guzman: Version.

402
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.560
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

403
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.050
Dawn Abriel: So,

404
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.910
Dawn Abriel: We have some night groups there. They're pretty full on

405
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:36.360
Dawn Abriel: If you're self employed, perhaps we can put you in like a noon.

406
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.700
Dawn Abriel: Group with that.

407
00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.390
Dawn Abriel: Then on

408
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.900
Dawn Abriel: One. Why don't we put you in

409
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:55.110
Dawn Abriel: The I can put you in Friday at noon or Tuesday at noon.

410
00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.140
John Guzman: Tuesday.

411
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:09.360
Dawn Abriel: Tuesday at noon. Okay, that'll be me. I will be the doctor and the therapist is going to veer off brielle so I'm going to

412
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:16.350
Dawn Abriel: give her an email that says that you're a new patient because she's going to have to meet with you to do.

413
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:28.170
Dawn Abriel: A treatment plan and she'll ask you a bunch of psychological questions and then she will arrange the individual appointment to get to the group therapy.

414
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:45.180
Dawn Abriel: It's a lot like I mean it's all done on zoom like this and like this this amount of lighting where we can see your facial expressions, right, because we're limited. We're not in person. So we really have to be able to notice facial expressions.

415
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:53.280
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and they're absolutely positively, no exceptions. Can there be anyone walking around behind you.

416
00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:09.090
Dawn Abriel: Because if someone were to accidentally see someone they know on your screen. That would be a huge violation of privacy and you wouldn't want that to happen to you right someone sees you on the screen is as it is in treatment look there.

417
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:29.220
Dawn Abriel: So we if that should happen. We would just knock you out of zoom and you wouldn't be able to get back in. And that's a drag because you only get your medicine, when you show up for group you show up for group you get your medicine, if some if something happens, you know, life does happen.

418
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:40.560
Dawn Abriel: You have to contact the virtual clinic, the people that bright heart health and say, you know, my horse kicked me again to give us a little

419
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:50.820
Dawn Abriel: And then I could, you know, write for for your medicine. I would make an exception. But I got to hear from you before the group.

420
00:34:51.240 --> 00:35:00.900
Dawn Abriel: It doesn't work to hear from you. After because this is a treatment center people drop out. So I don't write for medicine. If I don't know that a person is not going to make it to group.

421
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:17.070
Dawn Abriel: Before you come to group, you have to do a survey, similar to the one you did to get in to see me called the brief addiction monitor. We call it the BAM and

422
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:30.090
Dawn Abriel: I look at every single patients, bam, every single week because you can't tell us everything that's going on for you, but I there a certain things I want to be watching for

423
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:39.660
Dawn Abriel: Like if your sleep starts to get worse and worse. But you don't remember to tell me about it. I'll see it on the band and I might text you or right

424
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:49.950
Dawn Abriel: email you and say what maybe we need a one on one for sleep issues. So let's get together and we'll arrange appointment and we'll do a separate zoom like this for you to

425
00:35:51.750 --> 00:36:05.370
Dawn Abriel: Get some help with whatever it is that showing up on your evaluation and where it says goals. We want your goals for treatment. You know, I'm thinking about tapering soon or I'm looking forward to

426
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:16.770
Dawn Abriel: You know, expressing myself more fully in group, whatever it is. But the goal comment is about your therapy and recovery.

427
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.460
Dawn Abriel: But you can do the BAM. An hour before a day before

428
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:32.880
Dawn Abriel: You just if you do it at the last minute. When you go into the virtual clinic to check in, because the virtual clinic is a lot like going into the doctor's

429
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:40.950
Dawn Abriel: Office and there's that front office. The front staff meeting that check your insurance and get your copay and that sort of thing.

430
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:51.450
Dawn Abriel: So the care coordinators in the virtual clinic will check you in and then they will give you the zoom room number for group because it changes every week.

431
00:36:51.990 --> 00:37:07.320
Dawn Abriel: It's a different number every week. So you have to check in with the virtual clinic and they'll make sure you've done your urine drug screen that you've done your BAM and get your insurances up to date and then they'll give you that group room zoom number. Okay.

432
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:18.210
Dawn Abriel: The, you have to go get labs drawn and in Albuquerque there right heart health has a contract with quest so

433
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:19.980
Dawn Abriel: Quest

434
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:26.280
Dawn Abriel: Has protocols for safety right now and get an appointment.

435
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:41.790
Dawn Abriel: They, your name is on a national list. So you call and you say i'm john Goodman. I'm with bright heart health. My name should be on the list if dot tell them to well

436
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:53.670
Dawn Abriel: If you call bright heart health and say this is the quest. I'm going to they'll fax the order over there. But usually, by this time, your names already on that list. Okay.

437
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.100
Dawn Abriel: And you have to get it done before. The second group.

438
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:13.050
Dawn Abriel: Because I want. Right. It's like practicing medicine with one hand tied behind my back. I got to have those labs. I've got to see what your baseline. I'm giving you serious, medicine, and I want to have the labs to

439
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.100
Dawn Abriel: Regulate

440
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.390
Dawn Abriel: How I prescribed for you.

441
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:24.660
Dawn Abriel: And I prescribe using electronic prescriptions. We call him he he prescriptions.

442
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.160
John Guzman: So good. If you

443
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:33.660
Dawn Abriel: Call the pharmacy for some reason you want to be sure and tell them my doc submitted an E prescription

444
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:43.020
Dawn Abriel: If you don't they go looking through a pile of faxes, or you know pile of hand, you'll never get a piece of paper with the script on it because it's all done electronically.

445
00:38:43.950 --> 00:39:02.430
Dawn Abriel: And I strongly, strongly recommend that what when you pick up your prescription that you sit there you fold your hands you hold on to yourself. You do not grab the bag. You say, Please count my my films in front of me.

446
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:14.070
Dawn Abriel: That counter. There's a mirror out Mina a camera, looking down, and I've just recently too many people have been reporting.

447
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:23.460
Dawn Abriel: The Wrong number of films or tablets and but once you touch that bag. It's yours. They will not take it back.

448
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:37.050
Dawn Abriel: That's why I do this silly drama of, you know, hold on. Don't touch it. Because once you touch it, they won't, it won't take responsibility and if you're short, there is just nothing I can do.

449
00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:49.050
Dawn Abriel: Except I mean sometimes I can write for more but insurance won't pay for it. You got to pay cash. So it's really worth it. And what I recommend is that you call the

450
00:39:50.160 --> 00:40:02.190
Dawn Abriel: Pharmacy and you say, I'm about to come in and get my E prescription and I will be asking for the films to be counted in front of me, because if you do that, then you know they're not going to short you

451
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:03.810
John Guzman: Right, okay.

452
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.320
Okay.

453
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:20.160
Dawn Abriel: Every month right heart health will send you a cute little manila envelope. When you get it in the mail. Do not open it. If you open it, they won't let you use it.

454
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:31.140
Dawn Abriel: You get it in the mail, you see that it's from Braveheart health and you go to the virtual clinic, just like you did the check in with me and you say, Hey, I got this in the mail. What do I do with it.

455
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:40.710
Dawn Abriel: You will open it in front of them on camera, and then you will take this out and then you'll open this in front of them.

456
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:48.690
Dawn Abriel: And then you'll take the urine cup and you'll toggle off to the bathroom. Do not bring your phone with you. We do not need to see you pee in a cup.

457
00:40:49.260 --> 00:41:02.370
Dawn Abriel: Bring it back, and then you're going to hold it up to the camera and you're going to really slowly turn it and they'll read the results. And that's the whole rigmarole for a monthly

458
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.650
Dawn Abriel: urine drug screen.

459
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:15.480
Dawn Abriel: It, it is up to you to notice how I didn't get my urine drug screen because that means something went wonky right

460
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:24.240
Dawn Abriel: But you won't be allowed to get into group, you won't be allowed to keep your individual appointment until this is done every month so

461
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:29.400
Dawn Abriel: If you notice you've gone in a more than 30 days without a year and drug screen.

462
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:38.100
Dawn Abriel: Go to the virtual clinic and say, Can we check my address and make sure that it's got the right zip code or the right, my around whatever it is.

463
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:50.850
Dawn Abriel: It's weird, even people who've been getting it for a year of a sudden they're not getting their urine cups in and they wait around and wait around and then blame us. I mean, it's always our, our fault but

464
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.420
Dawn Abriel: It's really, it's your for your protection. So get get the urine drug screen.

465
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:04.470
Dawn Abriel: And if you do move make us the first people who know your new address. Okay.

466
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.130
Dawn Abriel: You said, how often do you check your email.

467
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.690
John Guzman: It's, I mean you regularly. I can start checking it off to the guests.

468
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:31.020
Dawn Abriel: As long as its daily because that's how we mainly communicate is by email. So in the email that you gave us, for instance, right after we're done. I'm going to send you an email that has

469
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:44.880
Dawn Abriel: All the important numbers on it and it will have Tuesday at noon, and it'll have your therapist name and it'll have her texting phone number. So you want to save that email that you get from me. Okay.

470
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:52.020
Dawn Abriel: I'm also by law. I have to send you a prescription for Narcan because

471
00:42:54.180 --> 00:43:10.620
Dawn Abriel: Well, it's the law. I'm not ordering a narcotic. So I have to order Narcan and they're 11 refills I you know it's you guys who are around people who are overdosing so make sure that you have it around and I knew and

472
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:15.030
Dawn Abriel: We have had many people save lives.

473
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:28.410
Dawn Abriel: Big because they had our camera on them and it's real easy. It's that nasal spray thing. You take the top off you go. Squirt, squirt. That's the whole thing. So it's pretty easy.

474
00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:41.670
Dawn Abriel: I think that's Oh, when you get off with me. I want you to go back to the virtual clinic and I want them to show you how to do the BAM.

475
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:56.010
Dawn Abriel: And I want you to do one more survey called the adverse childhood events. I want to know. It's only 10 questions. It's one time. It's not the one you repeat every time, but it gives us a

476
00:43:56.730 --> 00:44:08.820
Dawn Abriel: Good idea of the early childhood traumas that you might have had. So you're going to go back right now. And they'll they would they give you is the computer address for

477
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:14.760
Dawn Abriel: Doing the BAM. So you can do it on your own. You don't have to be in virtual clinic to do it.

478
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:25.800
Dawn Abriel: But the virtual clinic is your go to place if you had any problems. These are called care coordinators, they will coordinate whatever kind of care you need

479
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:36.720
Dawn Abriel: You need to talk with the therapist if you need to talk with the doctor say, you know, this is really urgent, I really need this to happen soon they know how to get ahold of us. Okay.

480
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.510
Dawn Abriel: So that's where you go.

481
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.450
Dawn Abriel: So when's your group.

482
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.440
John Guzman: Tuesday.

483
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:48.030
What time

484
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.660
John Guzman: At noon. Okay, so

485
00:44:51.810 --> 00:45:01.380
Dawn Abriel: Let's talk about your buprenorphine I give the generic because insurances otherwise make a big fuss and make it really difficult to

486
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:12.660
Dawn Abriel: Get the medicine. So it's just easier to start with the the generic. How much were you taking when you were on Suboxone before

487
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.700
John Guzman: I just, it was just, I just tried it for a few days.

488
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:19.410
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

489
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.840
John Guzman: Yeah, so I really get very far on it.

490
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.230
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so about how much heroin. Are you doing a day.

491
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.430
John Guzman: It just depends, like a gram to three grams, I guess.

492
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:37.200
Dawn Abriel: Whoa, buddy. Okay. Well, that means I have no idea what I'm doing here and we're going to have to kind of take it.

493
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:46.200
Dawn Abriel: It takes about two or three days to get your blood level up on the long acting opioids, which is buprenorphine.

494
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:52.260
Dawn Abriel: So you're, you're still going to be on an opioid. This is a long acting opioid

495
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:56.370
Dawn Abriel: So let's start with

496
00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.320
Dawn Abriel: One strip and let's check in.

497
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.840
Dawn Abriel: On Saturday.

498
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:15.630
Dawn Abriel: If you come here to this same well first you go to the virtual clinic and it can be real quick. You can just say, but really pay attention to how long the sub is lasting you

499
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:27.720
Dawn Abriel: If it's you know 21 hours. Well then that's wonderful. We can stay with the eight milligrams and you will eventually get used to it. And in the last

500
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:39.990
Dawn Abriel: Because the medicine was designed to last between 24 and 36 hours. There's some countries where they give this medicine every other day, or every third day so

501
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:52.170
Dawn Abriel: It's a it really stays in your system, a long time if you get enough of it. What we're looking for is for this long acting opioids to bind to you all the receptors, because at

502
00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:04.650
Dawn Abriel: You know, three grams of heroin. You have a lot of extra receptors on yourselves. Okay, and they need to be all covered in order for you to not have withdrawal. That makes sense.

503
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:05.370
It's been

504
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.750
Dawn Abriel: And in a month, two months we'll see when it is

505
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:22.410
Dawn Abriel: But you'll be stable, you will have been stable on a steady dose and long acting opioids. You don't develop tolerance, you're not going to need more and more and more like you do with short acting opioids.

506
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:29.490
Dawn Abriel: So you'll get stable on this and then you've been making appointments, you're really solid in the program.

507
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:45.570
Dawn Abriel: We can write for longer prescriptions. But for now, it's from group to individual therapy to group individual therapy. That's the only way we have a corralling people in and making them come to their appointments

508
00:47:47.400 --> 00:48:02.760
Dawn Abriel: And then we will start tapering and the tapering that I do is very, very tiny amounts over a really long time to give you the confidence that you can do this.

509
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.400
Dawn Abriel: So I support you with other medicines, but you will start tapering

510
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.860
Dawn Abriel: Okey doke. Do you have any questions.

511
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:20.730
Dawn Abriel: Oops, you muted yourself. You must have gotten a call when you get a call in, it needs.

512
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:34.050
Dawn Abriel: Not yet. See the little microphone. The red microphone with the line through it. You have to touch that. And then this you can talk to me again.

513
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:38.970
No. Yes.

514
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.820
Dawn Abriel: Maybe you have to have your finger near it for it to show up.

515
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.100
John Guzman: There we go. Yeah.

516
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:51.570
John Guzman: Okay.

517
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.630
Dawn Abriel: So do you have questions.

518
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:56.040
John Guzman: I don't know.

519
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.590
John Guzman: Okay, there's enough your

520
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:05.040
Dawn Abriel: It was nice meeting you. And we will see you on Saturday at nine o'clock somewhere in there.

521
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.970
Dawn Abriel: as I can with the virtual clinic and they'll let me know that you're there.

522
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.310
Dawn Abriel: And it

523
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:21.900
Dawn Abriel: Will be really brief just pay attention to how long the buprenorphine is last so so you know that when you take the subs. It has to be under your tongue right

524
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:37.500
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it has to be there for at least two or three minutes, get a mouthful of slobber it gets absorbed from the network of vessels under your tongue. So it's very, very, very important that you don't have any tobacco product.

525
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:42.000
Dawn Abriel: 2030 minutes before you take your son.

526
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:56.130
Dawn Abriel: Because all tobacco products cause your blood vessels to cramp down right they go and then you don't get the absorption. So no tobacco products before taking your buprenorphine your film.

527
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.750
Dawn Abriel: All right.

528
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:00.840
Dawn Abriel: We'll see you Saturday.

529
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:02.340
Okay.

530
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.830
John Guzman: Thank you, man. Appreciate it.

531
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.300
Dawn Abriel: Yes. You're so welcome.

532
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.110
John Guzman: Thank you.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.330
John Guzman: Thank you sir Right

534
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.160

Steve Holtsford: Thank you very much for that. That was great.

538
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.890
Dawn Abriel: You know, you're the first person. A lot of people have asked to

539
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.810
Dawn Abriel: Do an intake and it hasn't worked out so

540
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:51.180
Dawn Abriel: It feels very, you know, mundane to me but i just i can i there's a place in pulse where you can see how many intakes you've done. I've done over 4300 and now this is 63

541
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.670
Steve Holtsford: And my gosh I

542
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.770
Dawn Abriel: Could do this blindfolded.

543
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.870
Steve Holtsford: That's amazing.

544
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.020
Dawn Abriel: Anyway, do you have any questions.
