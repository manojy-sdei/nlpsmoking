76
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.940

K Mize: Yeah.

78
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.740
Moses Nasser: Yeah, so that was

79
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.340
K Mize: It for me.

80
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.960

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.080

Yep.

84
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.170
Moses Nasser: Okay. And have you had about. So have you had significant periods of sobriety in between them.

85
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.780
K Mize: Yeah, I was on Suboxone for a really long time.

86
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:06.210
K Mize: Yeah 2009 until probably 2016

87
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.560
Moses Nasser: I didn't

88
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:15.330
K Mize: I didn't ever stopped Suboxone I was on Suboxone a little time and then I got this wild idea that I wanted to get off of it. So,

89
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:27.030
K Mize: I go down in dosage I'd get off of it. And then I'd get crazy wrestle slake withdrawal and go back on it. So, back and forth, back and forth for about four or five years and then

90
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:45.420
K Mize: I got off of it in January or no in the summer of 2017 and I had that's when I started getting really sick with the seizures and stuff. That's why I started getting f&e the neurological disorder I have

91
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.180
K Mize: So,

92
00:07:49.980 --> 00:08:03.900
K Mize: From that point, I was taking opiates for pain because I had pain everywhere. I was having seizures, so I I had painkillers that were prescribed to me, but I would just go through them and then run out and be a withdrawal.

93
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.330
K Mize: So yeah, it's just been kind of a bunch of years of just back and forth.

94
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.990
K Mize: Using them not using I'm trying to stop.

95
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:28.380
K Mize: I think now I realized I'm good with Suboxone just just even even, you know, I don't think I can go without it because my brain is just feels like it's just changed.

96
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.060
K Mize: And I don't feel normal ever

97
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.000
K Mize: And I'm not on them, even for X. I've been off for extended periods of time. And I'm just a wreck.

98
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:48.600
K Mize: And I mean I got my master's degree on Suboxone I've had my kids through all of that and I was steady, like real doing very well.

99
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.110
Moses Nasser: Wow.

100
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.790
Yeah, so

101
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.710
Moses Nasser: You were on the Suboxone how many milligrams, were you taking

102
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:05.580
K Mize: anywhere from eight to 12 when I was audit steady. OK. And then my psychiatrist from about

103
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.210
K Mize: On he kept wanting me to get down to two milligrams. He wanted me on a maintenance dose of two milligrams

104
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.540
K Mize: And I'd get down to that and say what I would have cravings and and be very uncomfortable so

105
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:27.330
Moses Nasser: How long were you, how long would you be on the two milligrams for, like, Were you ever on the two milligrams for like a month or two, where you really

106
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.950
Moses Nasser: hardly got used to it and everything.

107
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.930
K Mize: And he was still be getting craving. Yeah.

108
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:37.680
K Mize: Yeah, I was I. Yes. And then I'd end up just taking more at the Suboxone and not telling him, because I was just

109
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:55.320
K Mize: I didn't, I didn't have a real good relationship with them as far as how I trusted him because he would make jokes and a sarcastic and rude about when I'd make a mistake or something and called me a hot mess and yeah and looking back, I should have suffered that relationship, a lot sooner.

110
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:03.720
K Mize: It was not a good working relationship for me. And he was very demeaning, and sometimes. Oh.

111
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.240
Moses Nasser: Sorry. So, yeah.

K Mize: Okay, so I was in withdrawal.

260
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.830
K Mize: I wasn't withdrawal. I put myself into withdrawals. So I was hoping crossing my fingers that they would help me.

261
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.580
Moses Nasser: With it.

262
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:40.740

K Mize: Okay, so

269
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.620
K Mize: They, they wanted me to do it that way because I like to take something

270
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.760
So,

271
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.050
K Mize: It works well for me to have it broken up.

272
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.930
K Mize: Rather than take the whole part in the morning.

273
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.310
Moses Nasser: Got it.

274
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.240

K Mize: On that dosing

277
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.350

278
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:34.830
Moses Nasser: Okay, well, yeah. So we want to shoot them. I'm sure you know, we'll, we'll shift that time, I know you know it's not the one of you looking forward to, obviously.

279
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.610
Moses Nasser: But I get it.

280
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.690
Moses Nasser: It's the drought.

281
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.550
Moses Nasser: It's not, you know, but yeah position stateside good yeah um

282

283
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.220
Moses Nasser: No, not at all. So, you're good.

284
00:21:47.820 --> 00:22:00.000
K Mize: Yeah, I, I mean, no. I had one one period this more this a couple hours ago where I was like, wanting create them for some reason. And I'm like, I don't even want that. But I thought of it.

285
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.260
K Mize: Is that a craving.

286
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.340
K Mize: Thinking about it.

287
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.380
Moses Nasser: How longer the last

288
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.740
K Mize: Maybe 30 seconds and then I was like,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.660
K Mize: What are you doing,

290
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:10.740
K Mize: You know,

291
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.250
K Mize: And it's hard because it's so easily accessible.

292
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.980
K Mize: Um, now you just walk into a smoke shop and buy. It's like ridiculously easy to get

293
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.820
K Mize: Well, yeah, but I'm not going to do that.

294
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.520
Moses Nasser: You want to stay on the 10 milligrams a day, or do you want to just go up to the 12

295
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:43.860
K Mize: Um yeah i mean i think i mean i'm not drowsy not groggy at all. And so I could probably do 12 and do to two or two pills pills pills.

296
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.270
Moses Nasser: Right. Or you have to milligram pills.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.720
Moses Nasser: How much alcohol. Are you drinking

316
00:23:52.320 --> 00:24:06.210
K Mize: I'm like couple glasses of wine, two, three glasses of wine, but not frequently, and I haven't been recently because it's not helpful for me and it really messes up my system like because the offending it causes my muscles to spasm and Twitch and

317
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.660
K Mize: Makes me depressed. So I really I have plans to stay away from all our morning

318
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.400
Moses Nasser: Okay, good.

319
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.850
Moses Nasser: Yeah.

320
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.490
Moses Nasser: I mean, I spoke about cross addictions and how you know all addictions, or go to the same place in your brain. So like

321
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:25.620
Moses Nasser: Your drink, you know, it makes you feel that little bit of a high and then I want to get high. You know, and so

322
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.900
Moses Nasser: One thing can lead to the other drug

323
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.330
Moses Nasser: I was not your drug addiction.

324
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.200

K Mize: Yes. And the other thing is I'm working on quitting smoking and if I drink that's really going to mess me up.

327
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.750
K Mize: Yeah, so I'm very motivated right now to not

328
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.490
K Mize: Not use anything that's going to hurt my system because I'm very sensitive now to everything.

329
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.300
Moses Nasser: Awesome.

330
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.390

K Mize: I smoked early like when I was younger, here and there.

339
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.400

Moses Nasser: So are you doing as far as quitting smoking, are you using any nicotine replacement

354
00:25:53.220 --> 00:26:00.150
K Mize: Yeah, I'm doing. They put me on a program for the patch and the GM. So the doctor and the

355
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:08.280
K Mize: Addiction specialist said to do the four channel on the 14 milligram now so I'm doing that for six weeks.

356
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.920
K Mize: And then the seven milligram for two weeks.

357
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.680
K Mize: And the whole time chewing the gum when needed.

358
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.750
K Mize: And then once I'm done with the patch. I still to the GM for

359
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:30.210
K Mize: Two to four weeks and then at the, at that point, I'm starting to switch alternate between one nicotine gum and then the next GM it too is a regular GM

360
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.260
K Mize: And then yeah intersperse them like that. So it's a very

361
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.850
K Mize: It's very much tapered

362
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.000

403
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:27.780
Moses Nasser: 1130 group which kind of a mixed group with kind of some more mixed things going on. And I don't want to say advanced, but maybe

404
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.260
Moses Nasser: More advanced

405
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.270

406
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:42.690
Moses Nasser: Well, when it is it's actually, it's, it's a group, Inc. And it's, yeah. It's, um, first I do a medication check for everybody.

407
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:49.080
Moses Nasser: And then after that. There's also a therapist in the group with us and so

408
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.470
Moses Nasser: Like one teaching point and go around and and talk

409
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.710

414
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:12.480

415
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.080

416
