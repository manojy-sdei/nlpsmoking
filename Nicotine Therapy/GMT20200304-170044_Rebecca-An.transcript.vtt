11
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.350

13
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.170
Anthony Martinez: I don't know, just

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.900
Anthony Martinez: I guess.

15
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.570

Anthony Martinez: You know I'm 69 years old I just turned 16 I don't even like to remember that my birthdays.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.660
Anthony Martinez: I guess from idle time is not good for me so I know it, and it means that I probably need to find something to do. So I don't have

19
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.080
Anthony Martinez: So much idle time

20
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.280
Right.

21
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What kind of

22
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What kind of things do you like to do

23
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.010
Anthony Martinez: It's hard to explain, helping people i i was accounted for so many years.

24
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.020
Anthony Martinez: But

25
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.700
Anthony Martinez: I was just having problems, you know, just

26
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.240
Anthony Martinez: What's your title your counselor or

27
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Am. Yes.

28
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.600
Anthony Martinez: You sometimes I think I'm already called Kleptomaniac. You ever heard of that club.

29
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.390
Anthony Martinez: Don't think I'm having problems.

30
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.000
Anthony Martinez: taking things from stores.

31
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.720
Anthony Martinez: That that's worrying me

32
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that a direct result of you being bored and not having enough thing.

33
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.810
Anthony Martinez: But I think so. I think so.

34
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.090
Anthony Martinez: And

35
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.940
Anthony Martinez: You know, like he dropped one device and another vice pops up.

36
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.230
Anthony Martinez: Meaning, you know, I used to, I don't drink or anything, you know,

37
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.020
Anthony Martinez: And I'm taking

38
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.750
Anthony Martinez: The call it

39
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.210
Anthony Martinez: The medication. I'm taking a beautiful morphing

40
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.970
Anthony Martinez: The mega us. That's why I'm with bright heart because of the

41
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.520
Anthony Martinez: They took me off. And I was on Norco for like 15 years

42
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.350
Anthony Martinez: And they dropped me the, the new role new laws. You can't have that anymore. Right.

43
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.370
Right.

44
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:39.450
Anthony Martinez: I really put a damper on my life. Even worse, because I was so used to taking it, then they put me on this body. Say it one more time, morphine or I don't know what it's called.

45
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Up north

46
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.730
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, that really doesn't help, but

47
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.440
Anthony Martinez: I don't know. I guess it just, I don't even know what it's supposed to do.

48
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have chronic pain.

49
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.980
Anthony Martinez: In my back.

50
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.690
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, that's I have arthritis.

51
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.930
Anthony Martinez: I guess I don't know if it's helping but

52
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.640
Anthony Martinez: I guess it's better than nothing, not the Norco helped a lot.

53
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.700
Anthony Martinez: And it also

54
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.310
Anthony Martinez: It also not only helped with the pain and helped me

55
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.300
Anthony Martinez: It helped me with motivation.

56
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.800
Anthony Martinez: Got me up to do things. I was very active with it.

57
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.580
Anthony Martinez: And you know, I just felt more happier with it. It put a happy face on me.

58
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.970
Anthony Martinez: And without it, it's like God like this morning.

59
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.160
Anthony Martinez: If I was taken Norco I'd be in a real good mood right now.

60
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.540
Anthony Martinez: You know what I mean, but without it without it. I'm in a terrible mood and don't want to sometimes get in the shower.

61
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.590
Anthony Martinez: So I think since that I, you know, just things in this taking things from stores is gotta stop.

62
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.360
Anthony Martinez: It's got to stop.

63
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.240
Anthony Martinez: And the scared me. Not that I've been

64
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.830
Anthony Martinez: This coming close to get, you know, I'm going to get arrested.

65
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

66
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm not gonna be good.

67
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:31.950
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, that's why I'm that's the main reason I think why I'm talking to you is, I gotta stop doing that. I really do. And I need to figure a way how to quit doing that.

68
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:43.860
Anthony Martinez: It's not like well stop that I'm don't have the money to buy it. I have the money to buy it but my thinking is, I could save money. If I don't buy it.

69
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.120
Anthony Martinez: You know what I'm saying.

70
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.620
Anthony Martinez: And I, it's just not. I need to stop.

71
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.100
Anthony Martinez: And I don't know if, what if, you know, talking to you about it. At least I don't know if it's gonna help

72
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.180
Anthony Martinez: But it needs to stop for get arrested.

73
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:14.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, if you play that tape forward and think about it in the short run, you might save money, but it's inevitable that you will get caught eventually

74
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of course, and it's going to cost you triple the amount of

75
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.210
Money.

76
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly.

77
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.180
Anthony Martinez: Exactly, exactly.

78
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They'll know you're actually

79
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Saving money if you don't do it in the long run.

80
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.980
Anthony Martinez: You're right, you're right, because there is a big bucks to get a you know a lawyer.

81
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.950
Anthony Martinez: Plus they make you pay courts will find a big time.

82
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.830
Anthony Martinez: Yeah.

83
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Court finds there's restitution. There is if you get put on probation. There's probation fees. I mean, all of that.

84
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Turns out to be 10 times bigger than your original yeah and the original money you know that

85
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You think you're going to save

86
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so really it's about changing that thought process, you know, inside your head when you start thinking that you're going to save money, play the tape forward and realize that you're gonna you're actually putting yourself at risk.

87
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be paying a heck of a lot more money.

88
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're caught

89
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know exactly, you know,

90
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you don't have. If you're not on probation right now or you don't have any legal issues that surely they can you know when you play the tape forward.

91
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And think about it all the way to the end.

92
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're running W. Some of the things that you like to do that.

93
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:58.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are fun that you could get engaged with that would help you with your boredom.

94
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.200
Anthony Martinez: A lot of things, but I don't get out. I don't

95
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.430
Anthony Martinez: Like to work around the house.

96
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:27.990
Anthony Martinez: You mean going places. No, I don't. I don't want to know. I don't go anywhere. I just have so many things to do around the house. I like I like working outside of my house.

97
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.130
Anthony Martinez: I don't like going to concerts or anything anymore.

98
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:34.830
Anthony Martinez: But

99
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about like support groups.

100
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.070
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, like what

101
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, I don't know what would be something that

102
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: would interest you to be able to get engaged in

103
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.050
Anthony Martinez: Court

104
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.430
Anthony Martinez: Oh yeah, what's the support group.

105
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Support Group is like

106
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you've got a you've got you've got

107
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.880
Anthony Martinez: I think about that.

108
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.180
Anthony Martinez: I've been thinking about going to a meeting.

109
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.420
Anthony Martinez: That would at least get me some socialization, you know,

110
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:24.120
Anthony Martinez: I need socialization. I think I need to because I had some when I used to go to work I had people to talk to

111
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.740
Anthony Martinez: You know, it kept me busy.

112
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.660
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, support groups probably

113
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.170
Anthony Martinez: Something that I could

114
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.330
Anthony Martinez: Get involved with

115
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:45.030
Anthony Martinez: Yeah I don't know which one though. I just the Heron, I live in Stockton.

116
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:57.390
Anthony Martinez: Are probably like to go out of town, probably you know my nearby like Lodi or, you know, some place near stock and I don't like to be in stock and because I might run into somebody I know.

117
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:08.250
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, I'd rather do it out of town like in Lodi or something. Yeah, I need to look up for support group. I don't know what support group there is though day

118
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.060
Anthony Martinez: I don't drink no more. So I mean, but I still need to

119
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.330
Anthony Martinez: You know, catch it. You know, it's good to be proactive with the

120
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.770
Anthony Martinez: With my biases, you know, and

121
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.490
Anthony Martinez: Before you know before like right now. I'm not in trouble.

122
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.200
Anthony Martinez: But

123
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:43.050
Anthony Martinez: Usually when I'm in trouble. It's too late. And then you want to go to support groups. I want to catch it before it happened, you know, before that happens. So I wanted proactive.

124
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:57.630
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, I need to look for a support group that's probably number one the support group A, you know, they talk about alcoholism, but I don't drink, though no more.

125
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They also talk about the compulsion of it and when

126
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you're bored and you don't have anything to do and your mind goes to go in and and convincing you to, you know, go to the store and something, you know what I mean.

127
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got to get some other things going on inside your head to get you off of that so that you don't turn out to get up into a bunch of trouble. You know what I mean.

128
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:40.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and and just because you're not actively drinking doesn't mean that you wouldn't benefit from going to some kind of support, support groups and developing, you know, a

129
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Support System and getting engaged and and there are there's service work. There's all kinds of things that you can do. You know, in that realm that can help you stay out of your head people you can talk to you know on and all of that will help you

130
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stay out of your head when when your thoughts start going towards

131
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: doing those things.

132
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.550
Anthony Martinez: Exactly. I just need to look for the right one, you know,

133
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.660
Anthony Martinez: I don't know where they have. I have. I have to start here in my town.

134
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.770
Or in Lodi

135
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.000
Anthony Martinez: I guess I look for a meetings on the computer, right.

136
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. And, you know, if you don't want to leave. There's also online meetings that you can go to

137
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.800
Anthony Martinez: Oh really,

138
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:32.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

139
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.760
Anthony Martinez: Like I'm talking, you know, like I'm talking to you right now.

140
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.770
Anthony Martinez: Uh huh. Oh really.

141
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:52.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. And you just put in your search bar online self help groups and you'll get a whole list of different ones that you can engage in. Well, just like we are right now and

142
00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's something that you can do while you're at home and you're not wanting to go out and but yet, you're still having those thoughts, you know, you can get engaged with that as well.

143
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:06.930
Anthony Martinez: Right.

144
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:16.230
Anthony Martinez: I used to go to the meeting. I used to have those groups with the bright heart but my insurance won't cover.

145
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:35.940
Anthony Martinez: So yeah, so I only see them once a month, I only go to bright, bright heart. Well, not I don't go, but on the phone. I see bright heart once a month, because I have to pay out of pocket. I couldn't afford to go for it four times in a month.

146
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:44.100
Anthony Martinez: Right, my, my insurance you I guess used to cover it. I don't know. It just my insurance don't cover it. So they told me

147
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:57.090
Anthony Martinez: That at least since I'm paying out of pocket. I do once once a month on March 10 I talked to them again. So they used to help. I used to go there every Thursday.

148
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.710
Anthony Martinez: With bright heart with their therapists.

149
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, no.

150
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.180
Anthony Martinez: They I used to talk to

151
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.180
Anthony Martinez: I forget the person's name Dr. Jackson and

152
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:20.550
Anthony Martinez: Forget the other doctor but we used to have meetings with them about 10 people

153
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

154
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:29.220
Anthony Martinez: But they cut me off because insurance don't pay for it. My, my Medicare and my

155
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.550
Anthony Martinez: Blue Cross cover.

156
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:42.270
Anthony Martinez: I don't know why, but it don't it covers a lot of other things like it covers this meeting with you right now, but it won't cover. I don't. I have no idea why.

157
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: insurances are strange and they definitely are changing every day on what they're willing to cover on what they're not willing to cover, but the great part about is if you get engaged with eight. It's free.

158
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.000
Yeah.

159
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.030
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, but sometimes as some pretty raunchy people those meetings, you know, but

160
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:15.960
Anthony Martinez: That's why I want to go to a different town. I know I've heard of other people say they used to make drug connections going to in a meeting. You know what I mean.

161
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:24.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you're gonna you're gonna find definitely all types all walks of life, but it's about who you socialize with

162
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally.

163
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:34.380
Anthony Martinez: Alright guys a little better town stock and so that's why I'm saying it. I think it'd be better for one to Lodi

164
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:48.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good idea. So there's a game plan for you to do for the widows get engaged with meeting. So find some go to a couple find out which one you like the most and

165
00:15:49.890 --> 00:16:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, start engaging in it to help you get out of your house. Have you get out of your head and help you get away from you know the compulsive behaviors that you're

166
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:02.940
Anthony Martinez: Using

167
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:11.070
Anthony Martinez: And definitely compulsive behavior. I don't know what makes me do that, you know, after I stopped drinking and

168
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.750
Anthony Martinez: Then

169
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:25.440
Anthony Martinez: You know, quit saying people. And after I retired this this kleptomaniac thing just popped up. I have nine. It's like, I don't know what it is like a thrill.

170
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:33.150
Anthony Martinez: To know you you conquered, you got it without paying for it. That's a weird

171
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.870
Anthony Martinez: I don't know. It only lasts for about a day and it's over the next day, you know, to me,

172
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.010
Yeah.

173
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.530
Anthony Martinez: It's just a weird thing you know and and I just want to catch it before I get in trouble.

174
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.920
Anthony Martinez: definitely got to do something about it and and as a support group is what I got it.

175
00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:15.720
Anthony Martinez: Again involved with. So it will instead of because idle time. I can't think of nothing to do but go to a store and look and start looking around like a Home Depot or Lowes, and I want to start looking for things for the house and that's when it pops in my mind to take it.

176
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.880
Anthony Martinez: You know, and I can't do that. No more.

177
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.690
Anthony Martinez: So instead of going to the store. I can go to, with support group right

178
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.670
Anthony Martinez: That's at least two hours out of, out of my day there, you know,

179
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.540
Right, yeah.

180
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

181
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.110
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, I think I'll do that, you know,

182
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.120
Anthony Martinez: But

183
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.770
Anthony Martinez: For some reason, I just haven't looked on the computer lately to find a

184
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.760
Anthony Martinez: Group. What town are you in right now.

217
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:44.880
Anthony Martinez: We

218
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.200
Anthony Martinez: Have a master's degree.

219
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.460

221
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.110
Anthony Martinez: school counseling.

222
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're familiar with a lot of the tools that you need to

223
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Control these things that are going on inside your head right

224
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:22.230
Anthony Martinez: Supposing Leah. Yeah, so I don't like to talk about it because it's embarrassing. You know, sometimes I don't even like to talk about what I did or my my college. I don't like to talk about. But I you know I let you know. But I don't like to talk about it because

225
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:31.770
Anthony Martinez: Because if people I don't want people to know my education because I saw because then they're gonna say, well, you, you got an education. I can be doing that.

226
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's not about the education. It's about the tools for me. You know, I want to know what kind of tools. Have you learned so that we can pull them back up and you can start utilizing them in your own life.

227
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:55.410
Anthony Martinez: So I'm very familiar with all counseling techniques and and I know I can even analyze myself so I know exactly

228
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:05.700
Anthony Martinez: What's, what's wrong with me, it's and it's boredom idle time getting older, it doesn't make me feel good, you know,

229
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.150
Yeah.

230
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And right now, you should be living the, you know, you're the best life ever. You know what I mean. You should be able to

231
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: go fishing. If you want to go fishing. Go and do things that go golfing if you like to golf, you should be hanging out, playing chess doing things with you know with other people and just being able to live right now, you know,

232
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:46.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that our society is went from working to live to live to working and you know you have this opportunity to actually be able to live, live when he'd help

233
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:54.840
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, I don't like any of those things you mentioned, you know, but there's some other things I could do, you know,

234
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.240
Anthony Martinez: I don't like golfing

235
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.650
Anthony Martinez: I don't like fishing.

236
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:13.260
Anthony Martinez: So that's what gets me in trouble. That's what gets me in trouble because I should like those things and but I'm not interested in in that time.

237
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:27.390
Anthony Martinez: I'm not interested in any of those things. But I'm interested in and and just socializing and talking to people talking about politics and things like that. I get involved with all those things.

238
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:43.050
Anthony Martinez: I think, you know, it's just that when you find yourself alone when you get old, you find yourself alone and you can't think of things to do, you know,

239
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:49.890
Anthony Martinez: Yeah. Or you can think of things to do but you don't do it. You don't do it. It's just

240
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.160
Anthony Martinez: With something, you know, you got to do it.

241
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.380
Anthony Martinez: I can't just I'm locked up in my house, not knowing what to do.

242
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.190
Anthony Martinez: You know, besides cleaning my house and I gets boring.

243
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.830
Anthony Martinez: Clean the outside of it. You know, I can't just do that.

244
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the rest of my life. I gotta

245
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.880
Anthony Martinez: Get out socialize. I'm not socializing at all zero.

246
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:23.910
Anthony Martinez: And that's what's causing all this. That's what's causing these terrible thoughts, you know,

247
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.560
Anthony Martinez: And

248
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:37.470
Anthony Martinez: I'm trying to catch it before something happens is all I'm doing today. That's why I guess that's why I'm talking to you. So I can catch it before something bad happens.

249
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, when it's a perfect time

250
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.210
Anthony Martinez: You know, definitely. Right.

251
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.730
Anthony Martinez: I could be talking to you and I could have got arrested and

252
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.810
Anthony Martinez: I don't want to

253
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:56.700
Anthony Martinez: Be in that predicament Cochon de about I got in trouble, you know. So it's better than I'm proactive.

254
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.630
He

255
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely better

256
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.420
Anthony Martinez: And so I will, I will look into a support group.

257
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.560
Anthony Martinez: And I don't know, just other things.

258
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.990
Anthony Martinez: In my life is

259
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.580
Anthony Martinez: Kind of it's kind of boring really

260
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:19.920
Anthony Martinez: I don't know.

261
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:22.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

262
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important that you get yourself intertwined in

263
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:42.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a support system so that you have, you know, connecting with with other people, you'll be able to go out for coffee or tea with somebody, you'll be able to engage in different picnics and different

264
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, other events that give you that socialization piece that you're lacking right now and keep you out of your head, you know,

265
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:52.800
Anthony Martinez: Exactly.

266
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:55.980
Anthony Martinez: So that's your

267
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:56.850
Okay.

268
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.490
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, I'll do it.

269
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.400
Anthony Martinez: I mean I'll look. We'll see what you know where they're at the meetings.

270
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.530
Anthony Martinez: You know, see what happens. A or na

271
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

272
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.650
Anthony Martinez: In a meeting or appropriate for me but

273
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Either which which whichever whichever one you know

274
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:23.940
Go to both

275
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:32.700
Anthony Martinez: Of them if they if they have a problem. You know, I guess they still have meetings. Right.

276
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.530
Anthony Martinez: All the time. Right.

277
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.430
Mm hmm.

278
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.040
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

279
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.350
Anthony Martinez: Even

280
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.900
Anthony Martinez: You know, Sacramento is

281
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.060
Anthony Martinez: Unfamiliar Sacramento quite a bit more than the stock really

282
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So getting so you can even venture out to Sacramento and see what you can come up with. I mean,

283
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's definitely support groups everywhere all the time you know at anytime I'm sure that you can find something when when you need it to be able to engage in, you know, to get you out and get you socializing with other people, you know,

284
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

285
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

286
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really fast.

287
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you can go to

288
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Say, you can't go to your group anymore through bright heart because insurance won't pay it.

289
00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:03.930
Anthony Martinez: I used to get I want every Thursday and they just cut you off this though. You can't even go but you have to pay out of pocket, you know,

290
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.890
Anthony Martinez: And I can't afford that, you know,

291
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.610
Anthony Martinez: Everything's about money, you know that right

292
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:23.640
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, they don't care about your mental how this is all about money. And if you ain't got the money insurance doesn't cover us while we got a good job. Stab on

293
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's ridiculous.

294
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:36.150
Anthony Martinez: That's the way life is, even if it's just it's just with illnesses, the same thing, you know, your health, you know, they don't care how if you're dying, you know if your insurance don't cover. Sorry.

295
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.690
Anthony Martinez: That's the way it is.

296
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It really is. It's just a tragedy, you know,

297
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:51.120
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, well, like that's the same thing with the, you know, they talk about insurance for everybody, which is should be a right you know

298
00:27:53.340 --> 00:28:05.220
Anthony Martinez: Instead of a luxury you know they they figure if you don't work well. You can have insurance, you should have went to work, you know, you'd have insurance, you don't have, you know, that's what all these politicians talk about right.

299
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.870
Anthony Martinez: So, right. And I think that's true, you know,

300
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.460
Anthony Martinez: They should have insurance right everybody

301
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but I

302
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it should be.

303
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: More readily available and affordable.

304
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.950
Anthony Martinez: I mean, you know, it's just

305
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:35.490
Anthony Martinez: I don't

306
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.090
Anthony Martinez: I guess I'm fortunate that I have insurance, but what little it covers

307
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's definitely a problem. It's a problem for a lot of people, you know,

308
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.060
I'm looking at

309
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You were saying, looking for support groups in what area.

310
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.820
Lodi

311
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.200
Anthony Martinez: mantega

312
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.520
Anthony Martinez: Mostly Lodi because I live close to Lodi

313
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.020
Anthony Martinez: I live in North Stockton.

314
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.120
Anthony Martinez: Right off hammer lane.

315
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a whole bunch of there is

316
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Support groups for codependency for emotions.

317
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Marijuana for alcohol for substance abuse food.

318
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.440
Anthony Martinez: What did you Google it, or what

319
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.220
Yeah.

320
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.460
Anthony Martinez: What you Google just

321
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Support groups and Lodi California

322
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.850
Anthony Martinez: Oh, okay. And that pops up.

323
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

324
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To see grief grief recovery.

325
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:29.010
Anthony Martinez: Yeah, that's true, that's another issue. My mom passed away four years old, almost four years now so I'm the it shouldn't be great. And ever since she passed away that things got bad because

326
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:41.580
Anthony Martinez: I lost my mom and she was my rock, so to speak. So I lost my rock meaning. My mom was my everything you know my counselor everything

327
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.490
Anthony Martinez: Yeah. Cuz I'm the youngest in the family.

328
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:49.200
Anthony Martinez: I was spoiled rotten. Then I lost her and wow

329
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.230
Anthony Martinez: everything just fell apart for me.

330
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.090
Everything.

331
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry that

332
00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:57.930
Anthony Martinez: That's a

333
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.820
Anthony Martinez: tough road. Yeah.

334
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:12.960
Anthony Martinez: So I forgot to mention that to you. But that's another reason why things got bad, too bad. I lost my mom and I'd sit here. We've talked my house. She lives with me.

335
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.270
Anthony Martinez: And I never Oh no she kept me see kept me steady

336
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

337
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.480
Anthony Martinez: And without her.

338
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.850
Anthony Martinez: I got no discipline. There's nobody here to discipline. I needed somebody here that

339
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:35.130
Anthony Martinez: I need, I need structure and without structure. I'm screwed because i i'm not a structured person.

340
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.630
Anthony Martinez: Ryan was

341
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.660
Anthony Martinez: Was structure. My mom pretty much was my structure coach.

342
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.970
Anthony Martinez: And she kept me she kept me straight

343
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.860
Anthony Martinez: And when she passed away was just on my god

344
00:31:54.060 --> 00:32:03.630
Anthony Martinez: Just everything fell apart. And that was the one that was in 2016 and you got to go on with life, you know, she wouldn't want me to be doing this. No way.

345
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.880
Anthony Martinez: So you know I think about her all the time. And I said, you know,

346
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.850
Anthony Martinez: Myself talks to her.

347
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:31.710
Anthony Martinez: You know, as I talked to her, you know, I do I go to your grave side and tell her you know what I need to stop. Mom, you know, I tell you know it sounds crazy, but I do. And I'm sure a lot of people do it talk to their gray side partner or relative I do it all the time armor drop

348
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:34.620
Anthony Martinez: So,

349
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you do

350
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's good.

351
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.990
Anthony Martinez: I talked to her all the time.

352
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:46.620
Anthony Martinez: And

353
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:57.930
Anthony Martinez: She would probably tell me the same thing. You're telling me get involved with the community to get involved with a group, she said. But don't get involved with your friends. That's what she said.

354
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.390
Anthony Martinez: I am I, when I grew up as a kid I had

355
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.510
Anthony Martinez: I had friends that were just all alcoholics is what it was.

356
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:19.800
Anthony Martinez: All they did was DRINK, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK at the bar. And that's why, that's why don't have any friends because I

357
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:30.420
Anthony Martinez: Because I'm not in order to to socialize them you have to go to a bar and drink with them. You know what I mean.

358
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

359
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.540
Anthony Martinez: They don't know how to

360
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.850
Anthony Martinez: They don't know how to

361
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.930
Anthony Martinez: That having their problems to right now at home.

362
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:59.160
Anthony Martinez: I'm sure a lot of them are trying to do what I'm doing, which I stopped drinking and they know they always, you know, I know they're interested in stopping drinking and I think some of them have so they talk behind my bag. You know, Anthony by think he's too good.

363
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:12.960
Anthony Martinez: Hey, quit drinking on but that's exactly what they're doing right now because one of them got put in jail for a lot a year, one year in jail for this fifth DUI.

364
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:15.690
Fifth,

365
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:17.790
Anthony Martinez: And

366
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:30.060
Anthony Martinez: I'm sure they're they're doing exactly what I'm doing right now looking for things to do. So they they could stop drinking. But you know, I, I've conquered that I think

367
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.620
Anthony Martinez: I think I don't I don't even have the urge to drink alcohol.

368
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.210
Anthony Martinez: I mean,

369
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, the motivation that you're on helps with all of that to you know

370
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really Uh huh.

371
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.730
Anthony Martinez: Yes. What is the morphine is

372
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.620
Anthony Martinez: The opiate

373
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Derivative it's Suboxone

374
00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.240
Anthony Martinez: And what is it is it is it an opiate

375
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it is an opiate based

376
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.490
Anthony Martinez: Not a strong

377
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.000
Anthony Martinez: But not strong. It's not strong. I don't feel no

378
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.870
Anthony Martinez: I don't feel happy with it, you know.

379
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

380
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.700
Anthony Martinez: When Norco made me feel happy.

381
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:20.880
Anthony Martinez: You know,

382
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

383
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:23.460
Anthony Martinez: It made me

384
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.430
Anthony Martinez: It made me

385
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.560
Anthony Martinez: Want to do things.

386
00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.790
Anthony Martinez: And I mean good things that made me want to

387
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.340
Anthony Martinez: Get involved with the projects around the house.

388
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:47.400
Anthony Martinez: And when I quit taking it. It's like, oh my god, that was what is the don't pep in my step at all without it.

389
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:54.630
Anthony Martinez: With it. I have a lot of pep in my step. You've heard of that. I'll say no pep in my step right

390
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.560
Anthony Martinez: Yeah. Well, that's exactly how I feel. Without it,

391
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:06.690
Anthony Martinez: You know, those are the side effects. That's why they give you this this Suboxone

392
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:17.580
Anthony Martinez: It helps with those feelings that helps not what it helps with the side effects from withdrawing right

393
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.480
Yeah.

394
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:30.060
Anthony Martinez: No, I'm sorry. We know why take it. Sometimes I forget, take it. So it's not that good. I forget to take it.

395
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.320
Anthony Martinez: I don't even know. I don't feel anything. Nothing.

396
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.350
Anthony Martinez: It doesn't help with the pain.

397
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure, sure. No.

398
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go ahead. Have you told the doctor.

399
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.480
Anthony Martinez: That you're still having

400
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.320
Pain. Yeah.

401
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.120
Anthony Martinez: Yeah.

402
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.180
Anthony Martinez: Me increased it still don't do anything.

403
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.560
Anthony Martinez: Everybody knows that. I mean, the narco help

404
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:07.680
Anthony Martinez: People, but I'm not, you know, I guess they even heroin addicts even take this right

405
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes.

406
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.460
Anthony Martinez: I don't know why.

407
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.790
Anthony Martinez: These the, I think they used to take methadone, years ago, right, yeah.

408
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.620
Anthony Martinez: They don't take them. They don't give methadone, no more. I don't think today.

409
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's Methadone clinics.

410
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.810
Anthony Martinez: As far as probably stronger than then Suboxone

411
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that everybody has a different

412
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:51.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Experience, you know, with it. And the idea is to cover those receptors that the opioids attached to so that you don't detox and limit your cravings for the opiates.

413
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, is really what Suboxone does and it helps with pain, you know, definitely. There's

414
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hundreds of people in pain management.

415
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:08.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Program that are on this medication that is helping with their, you know, pain management so

416
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:20.700
Anthony Martinez: All the complaint and the meanings was one girl was just in tears saying that this doesn't help me. And she was really Amin

417
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:42.420
Anthony Martinez: Crying and she wanted back on Norco you know it's like this doesn't help me and making me nuts sleep and I can't you know I'm blah, blah, blah. Basically saying I it's not it's not the same market what she was crying about

418
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's not. It's definitely not

419
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

420
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:54.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know this is kind of the alternative of what we have. And so, you know, unfortunately.

421
00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:05.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Norco isn't something that's readily available. And so there's got to be alternative you know means and methods to help people with their issues, you know,

422
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:12.720
Anthony Martinez: I, I didn't even ask for Norco what had happened back many years ago back in, though, I guess.

423
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:19.080
Anthony Martinez: Night in the 90s, is how it got put I got put on it by my neurosurgeon.

424
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:25.050
Anthony Martinez: And my back pain was pretty strong. I was saying, My back is hurting

425
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.730
Anthony Martinez: And all of a sudden he described

426
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.310
Anthony Martinez: It was by, couldn't he prescribed me bike it in. So I started taking Vicodin

427
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:41.910
Anthony Martinez: And then my data Norco they switched it to Norco. I don't know why.

428
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:49.440
Anthony Martinez: I don't even know the difference between Norco and biker didn't the bike good dens a little bit better than narco

429
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.650
Anthony Martinez: And anyway.

430
00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:08.760
Anthony Martinez: That's how I got put on it. I didn't even know anything about that. And I, I took it and me know nothing was no big thing and the pain was manageable and then for you know it within a year, six months, I started

431
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.180
Anthony Martinez: Knowing I started

432
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:22.170
Anthony Martinez: Feeling good, you know, with this came with this Vika in our car started filling. Wow. You know, it's making me

433
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:29.280
Anthony Martinez: Happy it's making it pretty pep in my step but it took a while for me to realize

434
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:41.460
Anthony Martinez: What this was in this this opiate was doing to me, but I didn't know it at first and then for you know what it was like I had to have it. You know, I didn't

435
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.180
Anthony Martinez: Make it

436
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.310
Anthony Martinez: The doctors put me on it.

437
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:51.600
Anthony Martinez: You know, not I had no idea. So the doctors are the ones that got me addicted to it right

438
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. Good.

439
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.790
Anthony Martinez: They're the ones that gave it to me. I had, I didn't ask for it.

440
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.780
Anthony Martinez: I didn't have. I did not ask for it.

441
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:01.620
Yeah.

442
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.120
Anthony Martinez: But it was

443
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.110
Anthony Martinez: Back in the night.

444
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:14.400
Anthony Martinez: Back in the 90s, they didn't care with a prescription. They just filled it for you right now that now they will not even prescribe it. I mean, if your doctor.
