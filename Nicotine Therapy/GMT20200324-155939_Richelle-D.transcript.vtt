00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:08.880
Jessica Tate: Hi.

2
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.490
Jessica Tate: Okay. Bye bye.

3
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.180
Jessica Tate: Yes, I can hear you.

4
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.170
Okay, I'm here.

5
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.440
Richelle Direny: Alright, so thank you so much. I was just about to send you a message.

6
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.520
Jessica Tate: Yeah, sorry about

7
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:13.080
Jessica Tate: No, no, I sent here to I got ready, got my daughter fed earlier than normal, and then set here like a dummy until 512 and then got on the virtual clinic. I don't like. And then I went back and look those texts like really Jessica.

8
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.780
Jessica Tate: I don't. And literally, you're just text me like four hours before so sorry about that.

9
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
Richelle Direny: No. No, you're good, you're good. Um, it gave me some time to unwind after I got home.

10
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.830
Jessica Tate: Right, so

11
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.570
That's fine.

12
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.520
Richelle Direny: So,

13
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.180
Richelle Direny: In reference to what you were saying to me.

14
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.020
Jessica Tate: You were

15
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:46.950
Richelle Direny: You were sending. I know. So this is the thing I know with the doctor Jamison, she does things a little bit differently and in all honesty I really truly kind of like her style because she kind of follows the model.

16
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.480
Jessica Tate: Right.

17
00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:02.280
Jessica Tate: And I and and I understand that, but that's not what she said. When Dr. Malik was still here. That's why I don't get that. Like, and that if that's how she was going to do it. Cool. Say that, but that's not what she said. Like when

18
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.910
Richelle Direny: Well, she is kind of maintaining she is kind of maintaining and that's the reason

19
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.780
Richelle Direny: She in her defense because, you know, it's kind of like

20
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:21.090
Richelle Direny: If I leave and someone else takes over, they are going to try their best to maintain what was already established and not necessarily disrupt it but then over time is going to kind of

21
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:33.630
Richelle Direny: Restructure it in a better setting or what have you. And I do know that Dr. Malik, like if you notice, like the groups are done differently. Dr. Malik used to have you guys come out of the group.

22
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.380
Jessica Tate: I like that better because I don't like people knowing how much I get because like there was people from my town.

23
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:52.590
Jessica Tate: That was literally in the groups with me, which I do like that, that she changed it where those people that I know in my town or in my group because they didn't know how much medicine. I got and there was a certain

24
00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.950
Jessica Tate: Boy, his name is Zach Giffin which thank god. He's not in my group, he found out that I take two a day and he would. And he never knew that before, because I never

25
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:12.120
Jessica Tate: Told him, but then Dr. James and like literally is like, okay, you're on two strips a day in front of the whole group and then he started like, Hey, do you have some. Do you have some I'm sick.

26
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:22.800
Jessica Tate: Someone stole mine. Like he started doing stuff like that. But she finally took care of that and put him in a totally different group but i i like the privacy that he gave I really like that.

27
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:32.730
Richelle Direny: And so and so some people would prefer that. Um, I think what what I really appreciate is that like she does, she does kind of like a whole check in with everyone.

28
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.150
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think, like you, you have to like specifically saying, Hey, Dr. You know Jamison, I prefer because don't you meet with her individually. No.

29
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:52.230
Richelle Direny: Oh, you don't meet with her individually, but I do know that she does have some individual appointments, but you can just send her a message on the if you notice on the bottom, there's a chat.

30
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.070
Jessica Tate: And yeah.

31
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.310
Richelle Direny: And just take it off of everyone and just send it directly to her.

32
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.550
Richelle Direny: If there's something or you can say, hey, you know what, at the end, can I meet with you by yourself so that

33
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.330
Richelle Direny: You right

34
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.140
Jessica Tate: So I'm not, I'm not worried about it now. It was just

35
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:18.120
Jessica Tate: I like I said people literally living in my town. I did not want them to know that because like we were drug addicts, we used to, hey to so and

36
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:27.030
Jessica Tate: so and so has 10 Percocet. Do you want any type stuff. So I didn't. And I like the people from my town. I'm the one

37
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:41.910
Jessica Tate: That said, hey, you should get clean. This is a really good program and I gave them the information. So, yeah. So, but she she took care of that was back and put him. I have new spoke to him anything since she separated us, which I really like that.

38
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.990
Richelle Direny: Row like that.

39
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.390
Jessica Tate: Yeah, so, so it's, um, it's good.

40
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.630
Jessica Tate: Man, I don't. I mean, I don't, I don't care. Now if she says

41
00:04:48.810 --> 00:05:03.360
Jessica Tate: Stuff because no one. I don't think there's even anyone almost in my state or if they are. I don't know them personally. So I don't, I don't care. Now, it was just like the people that I knew I didn't want them them to know. Yeah.

42
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.890
Richelle Direny: And then I think

43
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.930
Richelle Direny: You know it and I get. I get the definitely the concern because now everybody's really often

44
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.920
Richelle Direny: Somebody's business went

45
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:31.830
Richelle Direny: Yeah vacation piece of it. But, um, but I think more over in terms of kind of her style of doing it, it's more staying true to and and in no means am I saying anything you know about Dr. Malik because I really didn't like him when I started with him. But what I like. It's just the whole

46
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:47.580
Richelle Direny: Program or what the Suboxone maintenance is all about where you're not just taking the medication or you're not just being prescribed a medication, but at the same time, if you really truly are.

47
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.230
Jessica Tate: On this road to recovery.

48
00:05:49.680 --> 00:06:05.130
Richelle Direny: Are you just taking a pill or or are you doing what you need to do while you maintain some degree of stabilization and working on the issues that kind of got you on this roller coaster in the first place.

49
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:19.050
Richelle Direny: Right, that's kind of what her thing is, and while she doesn't, because I know you were one of a lot of the the batch of patients that we kind of started with Dr. Malik, and you were working with Angie long before

50
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.800
Richelle Direny: I started

51
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.490
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

52
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.730
Richelle Direny: Well, I do know that there are some people who see a therapist in the community and they don't see the do the individuals with

53
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.460
Richelle Direny: Bright heart and that's fine. And she maintains that and I think part of what she's doing now is saying.

54
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:44.820
Richelle Direny: Even if you're not if you're getting therapy in the community. That's fine. Like, I'm not about to say no, you have to come here again you have to really develop a rapport and you have to feel comfortable who it is that you're meeting with

55
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.610
Richelle Direny: Right at the same time, I think her what she believes in as a doctor.

56
00:06:51.030 --> 00:07:06.030
Richelle Direny: I really truly respect the fact that she's saying, not only am I meeting you for mid management. But I also want you to see someone and talk to them, whether you set it up once a month, once every other month at least as long as she has that knowledge that you are doing something

57
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.080
Jessica Tate: Yeah yeah

58
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:19.920
Richelle Direny: Your identity for two years. I mean, do you need to see. I mean, I mean, unless you didn't really start seeing a therapist and whole and you're just taking because there are people who, that's all they do. They just want a script and they don't want to do anything else.

59
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.210
Jessica Tate: Was a I've been

60
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:29.250
Jessica Tate: I've. This is like my fist program and none of its ever worked. And I did that every single week and

61
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:46.890
Jessica Tate: Just listen to the counselor. I don't know. There's something different about this. And that's why, that's why when people try to talk bad about Dr. Malik. And he did it wrong, like I got clean because of him, like the way he did. Shit. And he and he was he was he was hardcore with it. I

62
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.450
Jessica Tate: Didn't counseling every week.

63
00:07:48.660 --> 00:08:03.390
Jessica Tate: I had to do group every week and I had to prove myself and work myself up. It's not, it's not just like he was like okay you tested positive or you you were good one time. So, okay.

64
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.950
Richelle Direny: Because I don't have

65
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:16.590
Jessica Tate: anything ever again. I think it was consistent like it was four months and then and then he worked me up to two weeks and then three weeks and then that's how he did it and

66
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:35.070
Jessica Tate: I've never been able to stay clean until this program. I've never had two years since I started using it'll be two years, the day after Easter that I've been clean and it is that's never happened in my since I got in my wreck in 2009 it's never happened.

67
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:43.770
Jessica Tate: I sometimes drug every, you know, every day since I was in that car wreck. Yes.

68
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.930
Richelle Direny: And. And yes, I do know that that was part of their their their kind of the system is that

69
00:08:49.410 --> 00:09:00.030
Richelle Direny: You had to have been on in the program for a few months, and stay consistent, like you said before, you didn't have to come to group weekly or, you know, but

70
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.360
Richelle Direny: Again,

71
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.340
Richelle Direny: Like I said, I know with

72
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.750
Jessica Tate: Dr. Jamison

73
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:14.580
Richelle Direny: As it's related to the counseling. She is just more about if I noticed that with her chickens. She asked everyone. Are you in counseling. And if you're in counseling in the community.

74
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.150
Richelle Direny: Then she'll just kind of jot that down and just leave it that way. I know that's kind of the system that she has going down.

75
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:29.340
Richelle Direny: Again, you know, like I had some made the suggestion and partly why I say monthly. It's because there is also the

76
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:46.860
Richelle Direny: Treatment plan, please, because being in a program. Are you following through. And having that check in, depending on how the treatment plan is written, it's checking in to see, are you on track. Are you doing are you maintaining and are you following the plan as it's written and I know

77
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.420
Richelle Direny: The thing.

78
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.410
Richelle Direny: Is I'm the only outside of john I'm the only clinician.

79
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.990
Richelle Direny: That does do groups out. Like I said, outside of john

80
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.250
Richelle Direny: So if

81
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:09.780
Richelle Direny: There are some people who they see a different therapists. So with me. You're on my caseload and I mean you see john so I really truly never ever see you. I think

82
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.710
Richelle Direny: The last time I seen you was with Dr. Malik, wasn't it

83
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.700
Jessica Tate: I it's been a long time I, um, do you mind if I smoke.

84
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:27.720
Jessica Tate: Okay. Um, I do see someone but I quit outside because they tried to get me on medicine. So I wrote her

85
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.670
Richelle Direny: Outside of what you're doing now with

86
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:42.510
Jessica Tate: Very hard. Yes, yes. But, like, just for mental stuff not not Suboxone. I don't want to be on more medicine. I'm they said it was a it was just like for depression and

87
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:52.980
Jessica Tate: And I just don't want want to be so I just stopped going and they I felt like they were pressuring me to be on medicine and I don't I'm afraid I don't want to be

88
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.060
Jessica Tate: Addicted to another thing I just don't

89
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:05.970
Jessica Tate: And so like I went three times and then I quit going. It's like right literally a mile down from my right. It's called six counties.

90
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.400
Jessica Tate: They do counseling, just because I was feeling like depressed and I can't sleep the sleeping pills that I take

91
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:21.840
Jessica Tate: Dr. Malik said you were not supposed to take those with Suboxone but Dr. Jamison said I could. So, I still have been taking those

92
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.580
Jessica Tate: My husband hates that I take them. But if I don't take them. I don't sleep whatsoever. And they were. I don't know. They were just trying to get me on

93
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:40.050
Jessica Tate: Like these, I don't even know what the medicines were I forget now it's been a while but i i don't like I take the sleeping pills, because they're over the counter.

94
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:47.730
Jessica Tate: But I just don't want to be on any more medicine. So it's been like two months since I seen them there.

95
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.460
Jessica Tate: At the counseling place.

96
00:11:51.150 --> 00:12:04.800
Richelle Direny: Amen. You know what I have to say that I do. And again, I always tell everyone I am not, I will never ever say don't take them as if it's prescribed to you. I tried to educate or that is concerned.

97
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:16.680
Richelle Direny: That medication is really truly to kind of get you to a place of stability. So it's like can I speak to. Can I have a logical

98
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.410
Richelle Direny: Conversation when a person is high.

99
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.760
Jessica Tate: I think under

100
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.900
Richelle Direny: Process anything. No.

101
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.530
Jessica Tate: Okay, right.

102
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:29.340
Richelle Direny: So you can't talk about first of all in the middle of them being high or you. It's like you're trying to have a logical conversation when a person is super drunk like

103
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.440
Jessica Tate: A car seat. It's not happening.

104
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.120
Richelle Direny: It's not happening. So once you

105
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:46.980
Richelle Direny: Get that person to a place of stability where they're able to process what it is, then that's when you kind of now explore and talk about like okay well what was going on. What, what, give me the sequence of events. Let's process this together.

106
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.970
Richelle Direny: In that once you start learning your effective coping skills and then you can talk to your

107
00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:05.070
Richelle Direny: Provider about, hey, can we taper down off of this medication because now I'm learning the skills and the tools that I need where I'm no longer dependent on taking a med

108
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:16.110
Richelle Direny: Now the same with the Suboxone therapy. You know, I've talked about it in some of the group's I'm like you know what is your ultimate plan is it to eventually

109
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:26.040
Richelle Direny: Not be be dependent upon taking this Suboxone and be eventually not having to go to the pharmacy to take a hook to get a medication.

110
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.210
Jessica Tate: And just live

111
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:36.180
Richelle Direny: Free of any form of chemicals in your body, even if it's in a pill form or strict form, it's a chemical that you're putting in your mind.

112
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:36.870
Jessica Tate: So addicted.

113
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:45.540
Jessica Tate: My, my problem is I have severe pain every day. So I don't know what I'm going to do. And that scares me and I've been at a clinic rouse taper down and it was not good.

114
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.810
Jessica Tate: I was taped as I was taper down. I was buying

115
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:54.960
Jessica Tate: Set off the street because I was getting now that that first like quarter I didn't

116
00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:03.330
Jessica Tate: I didn't notice at all. But as we started getting down when once I got to a quarter I was

117
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:20.040
Jessica Tate: sweaty palms. I mean, the whole nine and I couldn't, I couldn't do it. And I was forced to at this clinic I was I was forced to and that's that's what I'm afraid of. I don't want like I don't want this, but I don't know how

118
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.690
Jessica Tate: Like if

119
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:28.830
Jessica Tate: I don't, I don't know how to deal with my my pain like I can't take ibuprofen anymore because I've took it so much.

120
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:38.670
Jessica Tate: That my stomach is a live like it's like at the dentist. I can't take it. So now I take Tylenol, but I tried to kill myself with Tylenol, so that

121
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:46.470
Jessica Tate: Scares me even more because I had to be life flighted and everything because and they gave me some medicine that would help.

122
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:59.910
Jessica Tate: The Tylenol like go through my liver and not heard it, and I had to like lay still for three days and they shipped my legs and all kinds of crazy shit. So I like that's what scares me because like

123
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:08.280
Jessica Tate: We haven't had water in five months until, like, three, three days ago we finally came up with the money and they had to like dig.

124
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:17.190
Jessica Tate: Holes all around our house. Anyway, we finally got water. So I have a lot of cleaning to do. I stood for two hours that might sink.

125
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.120
Jessica Tate: Yesterday, like doing dishes and I could barely like my husband had to help me sit down.

126
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:33.030
Jessica Tate: So I'm really scared of that I'm really scared of that because like i still her with the medicine, but not near as bad. I'm

127
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:46.350
Jessica Tate: not near as bad. And without it, that's what scares that's what scares me and knowing that I can't take ibuprofen. So now that's what scares me. But I do want to be off of this at some point.

128
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.810
Richelle Direny: So part of the reason why

129
00:15:50.130 --> 00:16:00.540
Richelle Direny: When it's kind of like you have a medical condition and you go to the doctor and you go to the doctor, whatever schedule it is weekly, monthly or every other month or what have you.

130
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:08.100
Richelle Direny: Right. And each time you go, they ask you okay what's. Is there anything new is still the same. If it's your pain level you're gauging it

131
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:17.820
Richelle Direny: I'm saying, you know, is there an activity that you do that increases your pain level lowers it, you're kind of, it's kind of like I took my daughter to the doctor. The other day

132
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:26.460
Richelle Direny: And I, they're asking her a question. And she was like, well, not really. But then when she comes home. Then she decides to tell me like I'm the doctor.

133
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.270
Jessica Tate: Right.

134
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:34.980
Richelle Direny: And I'm like, No, when you go don't dummy it down and then when you come home. Now you want to unleash the deal.

135
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:47.460
Richelle Direny: Right, because I can't do anything to help you. And so you. It's like explaining when you go, you have to tell them every little thing because I doctrine knows nothing unless you tell them something and

136
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:47.790
Jessica Tate: Tell

137
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.720
Richelle Direny: Them to go and research to try to figure out what the problem is that

138
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:58.140
Richelle Direny: They are, they're pretty much researchers, let me research your body and see what is really going on. And let's see if we can identify it.

139
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:11.040
Richelle Direny: And so I say all that to say it's I know like some people take Suboxone like it curves. The craving some people says it helps with pain and different people says it does different things, they find that it does different things for them outside of the main

140
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:23.160
Richelle Direny: Reason why you're taking it. So if you find that you know what, I can't see myself like I want to come off of the sock Suboxone but I can't see myself doing anytime soon, because I know in the past I've

141
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.280
Richelle Direny: Kind of lowered it. Now the question is having the conversation with a doctor, what is the dose.

142
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.120
Richelle Direny: Is the doctor taking you down the doses.

143
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:40.440
Richelle Direny: Is it drastic or is it very minimal. And then as they're doing that identifying

144
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:54.210
Richelle Direny: Is the pain more in the morning is the pain morning to evening, because now there could really truly be an underlining issue there that they haven't discovered that is really causing you the pain.

145
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.280
Jessica Tate: I actually assess also

146
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.780
Jessica Tate: But I broke my neck and back.

147
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.710
Jessica Tate: And they said, I'd have paid in the rest of my life. But as I've got, it's been

148
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:15.960
Jessica Tate: It was Christmas Eve 2009 a semi hit me. And I was like, What to grant hospital in Columbus, I was there for like 15 days and

149
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:34.290
Jessica Tate: After like I healed neck brace for almost a year after I healed. I was, I mean it, her, her. I mean, I found it. It hurt. Why was in there I found out I had scoliosis my spine is literally like an S.

150
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.310
Jessica Tate: And I don't know, since I've had my daughter. I have an 18 year old son. I don't know if you know and then I have a two year old.

151
00:18:42.540 --> 00:19:01.020
Jessica Tate: But like if I stand for long periods of time, and it's weird if I sat down and it still hurts. But if I've been over there or not, like, I find crowd today on like I'm popping a squat. That's what stops them my pain that's anytime, it'll stop it if it's like really hurting bad

152
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.580
Richelle Direny: Do you wear a brace it anytime where they say that appraisal help you know

153
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.030
I

154
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.600
Jessica Tate: I had a brace for a year.

155
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.170
Jessica Tate: And then I just have it back.

156
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.950
Richelle Direny: Did the brief hope when you did it for the year.

157
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:28.140
Jessica Tate: I mean, I was my bones were still healing. So I had to. But it. I've never they never offered me therapy. They just said hey pain pills and

158
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:37.590
Jessica Tate: When I find like when I did time I tried to kill myself. I called in and I was like, hey, like I'm addicted to this shit.

159
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:50.730
Jessica Tate: I don't want to be on it anymore. And she said, well, he's busy with other patients, basically, I called your prescription at the pharmacy and I just had it like I had been I had heard about

160
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.250
Jessica Tate: I'd heard about Suboxone

161
00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:06.180
Jessica Tate: And I had been at that time like waiting list for like a year or two. It was a long time to get and I had been for a year and I knew I was addicted, because I was like, man, I'm tired of taking this shit.

162
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.800
Jessica Tate: And I did. I took a how it's supposed to. And I was just like, I'm tired of taking it.

163
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:17.610
Jessica Tate: So, like, one day I just didn't take it. I was sick as fuck. I was like, What the hell, like I thought

164
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:33.540
Jessica Tate: This whole time, like if you take it, how you're supposed to. And I'm taking it because I have pain and I won't be physically addicted to it. And I was, and the nurse just told me go pick up your prescription. So I went home and took a whole bottle of Tylenol PM.

165
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.340
Jessica Tate: And so you're

166
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:41.910
Richelle Direny: Not really. You never really so because it sounds like she just completely avoided what you're really calling about too.

167
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.060
Jessica Tate: Yeah, yeah. I literally said I'm addicted to

168
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:52.350
Jessica Tate: This medicine. And I'm like, it's scaring me. I don't want to be on this anymore. Like, I need help. I, I thought they would say,

169
00:20:52.890 --> 00:21:06.600
Jessica Tate: Okay, we're not don't go get your medicine. Let me talk to the doctor and get back to you. She totally blew me off and said, your medicines up emergency. I'm not what happened. And at that point, it had been a year.

170
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:14.850
Jessica Tate: Since I had got when a waiting list and I had a I was just like, I'm not living like this anymore because like if if I

171
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:16.680
Jessica Tate: If I

172
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:28.200
Jessica Tate: Say, I had to go to work. I used to do hair I that's gone. I'm still paying for that too. I'm still paying for my hair, I can't do it like I do my friends of

173
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:37.050
Jessica Tate: Friends and family, but they'll like set on the floor and I'll cut their hair I which that just makes me wanna cry, thinking about it, but

174
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.470
Jessica Tate: I can't

175
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.110
Jessica Tate: Shit, I should talk about

176
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.600
Jessica Tate: Where was once I talked about

177
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.620
Richelle Direny: That you were saying that what you can't do because of the addiction to the pain pill.

178
00:21:52.680 --> 00:22:00.180
Jessica Tate: Oh, yes, yes. Like when I would if I go to work and they had not called in my stuff yet or the pharmacy wasn't ready like

179
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:08.310
Jessica Tate: First of all, I was hurting. And second of all, I was sick. I couldn't go to work and cut someone's hair and second

180
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:17.970
Jessica Tate: But as, like I said, as I've got older sense. Okay, this has been 11 years now since it happened. It's got worse. So, of course, when it's cold.

181
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:32.430
Jessica Tate: It hurts more when it, when it rains, it can be hot outside, and if it rains, I would just ache literally from the top of my ears clear down to my hips. I would just take all day and I lay

182
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:50.640
Jessica Tate: I sleep on the heating pad 24 seven I took the pad off. I know it says not to. But I took the pad off and I put it directly on my skin like this thing is so old. It looks black where I've had it so long. And that's how I've lived for like 11 years so

183
00:22:51.900 --> 00:23:01.560
Jessica Tate: I don't want, I don't want to be on this medicine but i what i don't want what I know what's coming because

184
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.420
Richelle Direny: I hear what it will be like

185
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.070
Jessica Tate: Oh yes, I'm, I'm so scared because now if I could take ibuprofen.

186
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.700
Jessica Tate: I think I could deal with it.

187
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.470
Richelle Direny: Or factors.

188
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.170
Jessica Tate: No, I'm afraid.

189
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:23.790
Jessica Tate: When I got I got in a actually a wreck like probably six years after that and

190
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:37.380
Jessica Tate: The insurance or the people that was represented us because the drunk driver hit us and the people that were like the lawyers are presented us they send us, they are basically like

191
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.070
Jessica Tate: Let them check you out.

192
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.570
Jessica Tate: And you'll get more money back. My friend did, and I'm like setting in the room with her and he was cracking shit like

193
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.480
Jessica Tate: Like it bothers me for people even Cracked my fingers that freaks me the fuck out. I cannot

194
00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:10.440
Jessica Tate: I do not want people cracking shit on my body. And after I saw them do that. I was like, hell no, you're not touching me. So my friend got like four more thousand dollars. I mean, I, I just, I don't want to be cracked now it's like you go to a chiropractor and not be cracked on cool

195
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.180
Richelle Direny: I don't know. Now,

196
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.790
Richelle Direny: I can't worry. I know, I know, but

197
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.870
Jessica Tate: It freaks me out.

198
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:28.560
Richelle Direny: Every healing process you're going to experience a little pain. Now, now, now I know I'm not letting you go to a chiropractor. He's like, you walk out of there with more pain than anything else. However,

199
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.910
Richelle Direny: Given that gone to the chiropractors in the

200
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:39.930
Richelle Direny: In the how they crack you up. You're just like, I'm about to die on this table I'm literally about to die on this thing now.

201
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.830
Jessica Tate: That's what it looked like what she was going through as I was like

202
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.920
Richelle Direny: When they get ready to crack here and they think it

203
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:58.620
Richelle Direny: Feels like they're snapping and kill you. But when you walk out of there. They'll tell you listen, you're going to be in pain tonight, take this. But let me tell you something, Jessica.

204
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:07.650
Richelle Direny: The next day, you feel like a brand new person because what they're doing is they're relying realigning your body

205
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:23.700
Richelle Direny: Now granted, we're asymmetrical but like when you're kind of out of whack there realigning their readjusting everything now the sounds of course sounds like off and just kind of the see the whole process is just like, I don't know why I want to do that. However, it is something to consider.

206
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:32.850
Richelle Direny: You know, again, sometimes your mind makes things more it blows it up more than it really truly is. But they

207
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:41.280
Richelle Direny: Think about when you get a cut it goes through before it finally heals you go through a little bit of pain in the process as if

208
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.020
Richelle Direny: It hurts.

209
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:52.230
Richelle Direny: And it was like oh my god this hurts. But it's going through the healing process. The nerves are reconnecting and everything is going on. So you're going to go through a little pain in order

210
00:25:53.160 --> 00:26:00.030
Richelle Direny: For you finally heal and that's why I use it like sometimes we have scars to remind us of what we went through.

211
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.020
Jessica Tate: Saying

212
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:07.440
Richelle Direny: I don't want to go back down that road because I remember what I had to go through to get there. And the thing is,

213
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:19.830
Richelle Direny: With and again I am by no means don't please, don't get me wrong, I am not saying no Suboxone is not good, or no other medication for that matter is good. It's there. We use it, we take it, it serves a purpose. However,

214
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:27.720
Richelle Direny: To some degree, remember, it creates it, it becomes somewhat of a bandaid to your core issue.

215
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.120
Jessica Tate: That's exactly what it is. I, I agree with that 100% that's exactly what it

216
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.020
Richelle Direny: Becomes a bandaid

217
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:45.180
Richelle Direny: On until you go through the pain of taking your time and removing the band aid so it can get exposed. So you can get to the core. Because if let's say if

218
00:26:46.350 --> 00:27:02.070
Richelle Direny: There's something else going on there because of the fact that you're taking the Suboxone. The doctor will never ever able to get to the core because they're always dealing with the surface issues until you bring yourself to say I'm a think about. Have you ever taken a super cold shower.

219
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.500
Jessica Tate: Well, yeah.

220
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.030
Richelle Direny: You jump in.

221
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.590
Richelle Direny: You kind of test it out, you're gonna like

222
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.820
Richelle Direny: Running real quick. When you're like,

223
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:20.280
Richelle Direny: It's the same thing when you have to think about the pain is just like, Okay, I gotta sign my mind, I'm gonna set my mind to it. And then after it, you realize

224
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:29.940
Richelle Direny: The best person I can and I use my daughter a lot because like I take her to the doctorate. Listen to Africa, you know, like how when they get to a certain age, they have to get a little injections for school.

225
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:30.690
Jessica Tate: Will

226
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.150
Richelle Direny: The girl will get an award for

227
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.900
Richelle Direny: A girl would get an award for

228
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.850
Richelle Direny: The best

229
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.620
Richelle Direny: For drama in getting your shock for school.

230
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.230
Jessica Tate: That was me. And that's, to me, that's to me.

231
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.890
Richelle Direny: She so we'll go to the doctor and she's like, I tell her what that's where we're going. So she's like, Am I going to get a shot.

232
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.070
Richelle Direny: I mean legit since I had, I know.

233
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:02.700
Yeah.

234
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.740
Richelle Direny: I don't want, I don't know.

235
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.390
Jessica Tate: Let's just

236
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.720
Jessica Tate: Go right

237
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:18.480
Richelle Direny: Then they'll come in with something we're gonna and then it's for. And so then they're like, okay, they'll come in and they're like, okay, and I'm like, excuse me.

238
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:30.300
Richelle Direny: That's all the nurse, excuse me, I'm gonna need you to get a couple of people coming here to help you. Oh, listen to me. Go get a couple other people to come in here to help me hold her down because I am telling

239
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.340
Jessica Tate: It to be held down to yeah I

240
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:32.820
Richelle Direny: Said,

241
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.350
Jessica Tate: I understand, right Jackie.

242
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.910
Richelle Direny: You need to go get me off.

243
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:54.090
Richelle Direny: And so she's carrying on. She's carrying on. She's carrying on. And then after the little pinch goes in and then she stopped and I'm like wasn't even all that bad, was it even all that. Oh, but but she can't get over the fact that she so she has to continue with the

244
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:54.630
Right.

245
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.430
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

246
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:57.780
Come on.

247
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:12.660
Richelle Direny: What your mind blew up the situation to be and it really truly isn't that bad. But the thing is, if you want to live a life with

248
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:19.440
Richelle Direny: Not to say that you're no longer going to ever have pain, but not the intensity of the pain that you've been dealing with

249
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:28.170
Richelle Direny: And you're learning to retrain your mind because the reality is our mind is a very, very powerful tool. And I don't think we know how powerful our mind is

250
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:38.670
Richelle Direny: It's like you have a cut on your hand and the cook has been there for a whole week. And that is, I just told you is there, all of a sudden. Oh, I gotta hurt that if you if I tell you that was there, you wouldn't know.

251
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:46.680
Richelle Direny: And that's kind of the whole concept of our mind blow things away more than it really truly is, again, I'm not

252
00:29:47.790 --> 00:30:05.040
Richelle Direny: Minimizing what you're feeling, but sometimes we have to stop and really sequence of events. And really, truly, analyze, when do I feel this pain, do I feel this pain more when I think I'm going to be trading down

253
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.120
Richelle Direny: Then I say, Okay, then this is really truly a mind thing, do I feel this pain more at night.

254
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:18.840
Richelle Direny: What was I doing, what do I find myself doing around the time that I'm getting ready to settle down.

255
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:27.060
Richelle Direny: I've been up and down. So you have to really truly walk through the sequence of events. And that's how you can start working on identifying

256
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:38.490
Richelle Direny: Turnover things now. And as you said when you go to your doctor you are your biggest advocate because, you know, at the end of the day, listen, nothing, nothing in granted. We're on a recording session, but not for nothing.

257
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:45.540
Richelle Direny: Doctors are all about. You're going to give you a they're going to give you a medication for every little thing that my eyebrow and going up, right. All right, I got

258
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.480
Richelle Direny: You know this.

259
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.920
Richelle Direny: We got a pill for that.

260
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.760
Jessica Tate: You're right.

261
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:59.850
Richelle Direny: The reality is, like, no, let's explore other things. Let's try other things and then we can use this medication as absolute last resort.

262
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:10.890
Richelle Direny: Because you have to teach yourself, can I do this without a particular medication. And if I can then I'll continue but if I can't. All right, I'll take one.

263
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.200
Richelle Direny: We're not gonna, we're not going to get too happy with it. If I find that then

264
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.890
Jessica Tate: We can

265
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.290
Richelle Direny: Up a little because when it's all said and done,

266
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.400
Richelle Direny: They're not going to be a mess of their art. If you don't allow them to be that way because you're in control of you.

267
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:32.910
Jessica Tate: Right. I think I wouldn't freak out, like, all right, wouldn't. And I know my brains doing it, but like

268
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:41.850
Jessica Tate: When I was at the other clinic and they were like, Okay, we're going to start putting you down. I had no problem with it. I didn't feel any different, and then

269
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:53.220
Jessica Tate: When I started filling those withdrawals that freaked me out. And that's all. When I think about that. That's, I can't get that out of my mind how I felt.

270
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.180
Richelle Direny: And

271
00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:10.530
Jessica Tate: It probably wouldn't even bother me because I didn't I, I love my daughter dearly. But I didn't even think my husband could have children and I'm old. I'm almost 40 years old I didn't like I had my son. I was done.

272
00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:28.770
Jessica Tate: That freaks me out. I am her like he works 24 seven, why not now because this damn virus. He got laid off but um I take care of her all the time and it scares me thinking about trying to or being sick and trying to take care of her.

273
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:38.760
Jessica Tate: Because she has to, and she is wild and like I'm chasing her constantly and that's what like

274
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:47.100
Jessica Tate: Just thinking about because like I said, they, they did it in quarters and once I got down a half I

275
00:32:47.880 --> 00:33:00.780
Jessica Tate: was sick, and I now. I don't know if it was in my head that I was having diarrhea and the whole nine and that slipped me out, not being able to take care of her, and my pain.

276
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:10.200
Jessica Tate: And I wish I could get that out of my, I wish I could get out of my head, but I can't. That's the first thing I think about when I, when I think about it, but I don't

277
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:24.180
Jessica Tate: I want to eventually be off of this. This is not where I want, I don't want to do this my whole life. Like, I've had to cancel. I got to have my husband say we're not going on this trip because I can't pick up my medicine was day like

278
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:32.940
Jessica Tate: Like, thank God. Dr. Malik was able to talk to him because he was not a happy camper about it, he just thought

279
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:47.550
Jessica Tate: It was like a Tylenol, basically in his mind and quit fucking taken the shit and we want with your life and he like he explained it to him. But like he was at first he was not happy about it. He was not happy about it.

280
00:33:49.050 --> 00:34:07.680
Jessica Tate: Because it did it. I mean, it still rules, our life. If we get halfway up the road and I didn't take my medicine, we have to turn around, because I'm I'll be fine for the first few hours, but as the day goes on. I'm going to start feeling it and it just, it rolls my life, just like the building.

281
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.200
Richelle Direny: How long were you using the pills prior

282
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.880
Jessica Tate: From the day of my rack December 29 or December 24 2009 and to

283
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.930
Jessica Tate: See, I tried to kill myself in May of 2005

284
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:34.020
Jessica Tate: Yeah, May of 2009 2015. Sorry. I said, May of 2015 is when

285
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:42.600
Richelle Direny: So, therefore, you were on these, you were on pain meds and been a and had developed an addiction to these pain pills for years.

286
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.070
Richelle Direny: Yes, so

287
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:51.840
Richelle Direny: So I use this example in this very minute. But in my mind when I heard the concept of big to apply to a whole lot of other things.

288
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:53.520
Richelle Direny: Yes.

289
00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:57.750
Richelle Direny: Okay.

290
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:15.600
Richelle Direny: So it was more so I remember after I had my last child. You know, like during pregnancy. Some people experienced and and some people don't, where you have, you know, like when you're looking towards the end of the pregnancy, your foot starts swelling up

291
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.800
Richelle Direny: With a man

292
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.330
Richelle Direny: He had like a little elephant.

293
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.250
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I remember that used to happen where sometimes it will get so big that elevated

294
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.650
Richelle Direny: Support go down and you can really wear shoes.

295
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:38.280
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. Towards the end of my pregnancy, maybe about like six, seven months MIT and my feet started tolima and it would really swell up more towards the end of the day, or what have you, because I'm up and down or what have you. So then

296
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:46.380
Richelle Direny: After I had my baby. I noticed the same things kept happening. So I said to the doctor, like, Listen, I'm not pregnant wife, my footsteps.

297
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:55.710
Richelle Direny: And he said, well, when did it starts falling off during the pregnancy and I told him, and he said, so for that whole time I was showing up every day and he said, Yeah.

298
00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:07.320
Richelle Direny: He simply said, well, then what you think you think he's just gonna stop immediately. He's like, No, it's gonna take some time for your body to get readjusted to something new to this.

299
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.310
Jessica Tate: Okay.

300
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.780
Richelle Direny: Yeah, understand what I'm saying.

301
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:22.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah, those hormones are still it's taking its time to come out of your body. So it's gonna take a little bit of time for your foot to not swell up anymore. I use that example. And I remember that example and I use it.

302
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:31.950
Richelle Direny: Because the reality is if you were on these addictive pain medicine for so many years, your body became dependent upon this medication.

303
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.660
Richelle Direny: Any little pain.

304
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:43.950
Richelle Direny: Your body was like, oh, we need something we need something because it was so used to anytime something pops up, you gave it to it. So it really used to that.

305
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.460
Jessica Tate: So,

306
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.570
Richelle Direny: You're just trying to say, oh, I want to stop cold turkey, your body's saying

307
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.000
Richelle Direny: I know what I don't know what you're going through.

308
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.530
Richelle Direny: Right now.

309
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.330
Jessica Tate: That's exactly what it is exactly what I said.

310
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:10.230
Richelle Direny: Because if it for 10 years you've been doing this, your body, your body is going to get real Tai Chi karate, and it's going to kick your butt to be like nine going just change on me like that.

311
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:10.830
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

312
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.510
Richelle Direny: This for like we've been doing this for 10 years. You just can't break up with me.

313
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:16.380
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

314
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:25.020
Richelle Direny: So you're gonna have to slowly get your body back to our right, friend, we're gonna have to slow down a little bit the same working

315
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:38.010
Richelle Direny: And so you slowly start weaning yourself off of it, even if it takes two years, it's a slow gradual process because in that time as you're slowly doing it.

316
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:48.840
Richelle Direny: You're also teaching yourself how to live differently, without putting something in your body because you're teaching it. Okay. When I feel this. I tried this.

317
00:37:49.500 --> 00:38:02.820
Richelle Direny: Organic process. I tried these natural remedies you're slowly getting your body used to not depending on a chemical, but depending on something more organic and you're really teaching your brain not to

318
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.620
Jessica Tate: Tell you to reach for that and

319
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:11.040
Richelle Direny: In that time, it's decreasing your anxiety because a lot of it really is anxiety going wild in your

320
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:17.130
Jessica Tate: You know it. It's where that you said that because like when I first started taking them. They had like gave me the pills and like

321
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:24.660
Jessica Tate: I if I took it under the tongue. I felt like I was going through withdrawals and I knew I wasn't

322
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:35.940
Jessica Tate: I knew I wasn't and I had like an overwhelming to snort it because that's what like in the end. That's what I started doing it hit me quicker. And that's why, like I'm

323
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:47.880
Jessica Tate: so thankful. They made a generic because for a while for a walk, because I was, I told my husband. I was like, I like I don't, I can't do these pills. I was like I it's like

324
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:58.800
Jessica Tate: I don't know, like I feel like I'm going to withdraw and I've had. I have medicine in me and I think it was my mind trying to tell me like crush that up and snort it

325
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.750
Jessica Tate: And I

326
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.190
Richelle Direny: Because he needed a quick

327
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.700
Richelle Direny: Fix

328
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.450
Richelle Direny: And yet.

329
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.790
Jessica Tate: So for about four months.

330
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:11.670
Jessica Tate: My husband bought the which was oh my god so expensive. The actual

331
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:23.700
Jessica Tate: Like, not, not the generic but actual strips because my insurance wouldn't pay for it. So he he bought it and it was costing us over 500. It was like $559 a month.

332
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:36.750
Jessica Tate: But in I think God day he did that, and we were able to do that at that time, but he did it for like four months until they got the generic and like I like the pills.

333
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:45.990
Jessica Tate: And it's you know it's been so long stay with I go to someone's house. And I'm sitting there and like they set their purse down and I hear that jiggle like

334
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:59.670
Jessica Tate: It goes in my mind like my mind will say they probably have perk set in their purse. Like, why the hell is that that. I mean, I can understand if I was like, if I had used, but I've had an actual pain pill.

335
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:11.550
Jessica Tate: Since 2015 so that's been almost well in in May will be six years since I've had an actual pain pill and it still does that I went to my mom's my mom does not

336
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:26.250
Jessica Tate: Like my mom had surgery and took Tyler know I know there's no narcotics in her house whatsoever. I she walks in sets her purse down and it J goals and my mind told me it was like an uppercut say in her

337
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:35.640
Jessica Tate: In her purse and then I'd like no, your mother doesn't take anything like that. Like why like is that I'm crazy that

338
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.520
Jessica Tate: Is I know I know my mom doesn't have that in her purse.

339
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:47.010
Jessica Tate: So why would my mind automatically like I just had an overwhelming feeling like they're percocet inner parts. That's crazy. To me, that's

340
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:58.320
Richelle Direny: And that's quite normal because it's, it's, kind of, you know, so there's, to me there's like a deeper sense but it kind of depends on what you believe in. So

341
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:07.980
Richelle Direny: For me it's looking at it like everyone knows you know those cartoons, where you have a little angel you in the little red pitch for

342
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.880
Jessica Tate: You right

343
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.890
Richelle Direny: And the little yeah

344
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.090
Jessica Tate: Yeah, that part.

345
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:20.010
Richelle Direny: That part just like speak louder in your ear. Then the little angel you the angle us look like Jessica. Don't do it. Don't do it.

346
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:34.470
Richelle Direny: And then the little devil is just like, girl. You remember how much fun we was having when he was doing it, you wouldn't even feel in none of this. You remember you guys just chilled and relax and all of this and it's reminding you of this false sense of fun, you're having to

347
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.190
Richelle Direny: The reality it is it brought you down to destruction and brought you were

348
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.920
Jessica Tate: Everything and life was just

349
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.050
Richelle Direny: Horrible and but it ain't telling you that

350
00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:50.370
Richelle Direny: It was just like, girl. You remember them ties into sitting there, he was just chiming in. And everything seems good. And does that that's what it's telling you

351
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.120
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

352
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:59.700
Richelle Direny: Keep giving your mind this false sense of reality, it's not telling you, you got to hit rock bottom. And you probably you probably going back

353
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.940
Richelle Direny: It's not going to tell you that angel us right Jessica.

354
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.260
Richelle Direny: Don't

355
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.870
Jessica Tate: You have things on call for you, but

356
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.490
Jessica Tate: You see how come I'm talking

357
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.680
Jessica Tate: Yeah, nice things going for you.

358
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:21.360
Richelle Direny: You have your hulsman you have this little girl and Life is good. It may not be a better roses, but it's good, you're not having to be in any trouble. Yo, that nothing. You said, I'm saying

359
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah, little angel you

360
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:34.380
Richelle Direny: But this side speaks louder. At some point in time, you have to make that conscious decision and choice to say no, the scar. Look at your scar.

361
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:37.410
Richelle Direny: Can remember your star all that you went through.

362
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:41.400
Jessica Tate: You think it's going to do that forever like even after I lost a medicine.

363
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.270
It is

364
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:50.460
Richelle Direny: I don't. I've never taken it but I go through it as human beings we all go through it because we sit

365
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:59.250
Richelle Direny: And sometimes it's not good to necessarily stay in our heads because our head brings us back to this false sense of fun that we were having

366
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:09.000
Richelle Direny: This in life. It's kind of like I personally don't care for reality shows. Because you and I both know you're a housewife. You know what, what real housewife wear stilettos.

367
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.100
Jessica Tate: None. None.

368
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.440
Jessica Tate: Housewives wires.

369
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.880
Jessica Tate: This House wife wears

370
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.320
Jessica Tate: You

371
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.010
Richelle Direny: Don't think

372
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:24.810
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that have kind of what this side of you makes you think that this life is wonderful and I

373
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:34.620
Richelle Direny: Wanted, but it doesn't tell you what it's not really telling you is what you have to do to get this false sense of reality of fun and excitement

374
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:48.150
Richelle Direny: I always say the blurring like people who live a boring life. You never hear them got no charge. Anybody knocking at the door. They have half the stress that other people who's living this life of excitement is living

375
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:57.240
Jessica Tate: I say oh my news I saw my drug dealer since I've been playing these two years I saw my drug, one of my drug dealers go to jail.

376
00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:16.290
Jessica Tate: Raids and like all around not near my house, but in my town and I'm just like thank. It's just like a sigh of relief. Like I would be in that I would be right along in there and and i i love boring. I wouldn't change it for anything.

377
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.400
Jessica Tate: So like I can't believe I was doing shit like that. I was up in those houses.

378
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:29.130
Jessica Tate: I was doing all kinds of dumb shit and I just like it just blows my mind that but yes borings amazing to me.

379
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:36.060
Richelle Direny: But everybody makes you think you live the boring life. Well, you and I and getting into I'm getting in trouble. Like, you ain't my door.

380
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:36.750
Jessica Tate: You know,

381
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:43.980
Richelle Direny: I'm not sleeping with one eye open. And that's the reason. Sometimes that's what you have that, like most self talk, that's what you have to tell yourself all the time.

382
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:52.740
Richelle Direny: And we all have to do it. So it's not to say, oh, no, it's going to stop one day know life is life. Life is made up of good and evil. It's always

383
00:44:53.970 --> 00:45:07.800
Richelle Direny: You just have to make that conscious choice you have this life right now you have a husband, that's there to support you, though you have your past, but he's still there to support you, despite your past. He took you up, despite your past.

384
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.730
Richelle Direny: With you, he still has you despite your past.

385
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:18.180
Richelle Direny: He didn't see your past. He sees where you are today and what you potentially can be you have your daughter.

386
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:26.940
Richelle Direny: Now you're going to look at life through your daughter's eyes, you're going to look at your past and you're going to say, baby girl. I don't want you to live that life. Because it ain't right.

387
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:28.230
Jessica Tate: But

388
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:34.950
Richelle Direny: How can you teach her, you have to show that example and you're going to have to tell her boring is not that

389
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.930
Richelle Direny: Come on girl. Let's watch this cartoon together and let's laugh at these people together.

390
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:49.920
Jessica Tate: Yeah, right. Wait, I already know like I am, my I've already had an ultimatum from him like he's not

391
00:45:51.030 --> 00:46:06.630
Jessica Tate: I don't, I don't know if it's just him dealing with like all the stuff with the Suboxone but he's already told me, like, if you go back to that, like, one time. It's done like He already told me that he's like, um, it's like

392
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:19.920
Jessica Tate: Hey, he's just not having it he's putting up with that i i call it putting up with it because I after he was explain what it is and it's controlled

393
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:31.620
Jessica Tate: You know, and I have to take drug tests and all that stuff. But if I try to go back to that lifestyle. He's gone like we just bought a house. I'd never thought I'd be able to say

394
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:42.990
Jessica Tate: Say that but yeah that's that's in my ear. Also, I know that it's done, and he will take my baby and he'll have every right to so

395
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.430
Richelle Direny: Does that mean for you. What do you when he, when you think about that. What does that mean for you.

396
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.020
Jessica Tate: Um,

397
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:53.490
Richelle Direny: You can't afford it.

398
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.410
Richelle Direny: You can't afford

399
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.550
Jessica Tate: You know,

400
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.040
Richelle Direny: Look at your scar each and every

401
00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.580
Jessica Tate: Time.

402
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:09.420
Richelle Direny: That a thought or a feeling or a smell comes up. Look at that scar and says, I went through hell I refuse.

403
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:27.960
Richelle Direny: I refuse to go back to the way that's what that scar does look at that scar and you say to yourself, this scar is there for a reason. And I refuse. That's what you do. He took you for what you what your bosses where you are right now.

404
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:28.920
Jessica Tate: And

405
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:38.820
Richelle Direny: He says, Jessica. I know you have a pass, but I decided to make this journey go on this journey with you though I don't necessarily like the idea

406
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:45.150
Richelle Direny: Of the Suboxone but I understand it, and we'll do it together. And I'll be supportive of you. Yeah.

407
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:46.590
Jessica Tate: And that's where you saying

408
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.120
Richelle Direny: Because he's saying

409
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:55.980
Richelle Direny: you're realizing, like I said, that evil you and telling you that you got to lose this house this kid and everything that you got going on.

410
00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:11.460
Jessica Tate: And I lost my side. I don't know if I told you that where I he went to live with his dad. Basically, I was forced to give him too bad. I like I could not imagine that I've been away from her one day in her

411
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:23.430
Jessica Tate: She'll be three in June. I've been away from her one day so that I mean, at the time, it hurt me, but I just got higher so I

412
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:42.150
Jessica Tate: I feel more, you know, since I mean this when I first started taking Suboxone I loved it because I was like, hell yeah like this is legal and I so high as hell. And after two weeks. I just don't know like I don't get a high value from it and

413
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:58.530
Jessica Tate: I would tell me not saying I love her anymore and I loved him, but I was just, I just got higher and I dealt with it, but I don't I don't I don't know what it would, I don't know, I guess.

414
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:01.410
Jessica Tate: Do you think lives are as

415
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:06.420
Richelle Direny: If you were supposed to, let's say relapse and you go, whether

416
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:14.670
Richelle Direny: Off of the Suboxone you go back to life. Do you think you will die at this point, like is it like

417
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.800
Jessica Tate: A matter of life or doll. Yeah, so

418
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.390
Richelle Direny: That's all you need to think about. Yeah.

419
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:30.390
Richelle Direny: It's a matter of life or death to you, not just losing him or her, but it's a matter of life or death. And that's just kind of how you have to think about it. You were lost. Once you're saved, you don't want to go back

420
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.680
Jessica Tate: Into that darkness.

421
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.660
Richelle Direny: The light is good and I like the light

422
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:34.200
Jessica Tate: I can see

423
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.940
Richelle Direny: A whole lot of things. When I'm in the light

424
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:36.690
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

425
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:50.760
Richelle Direny: But she's gonna have to be a constant reminder for yourself like you have to constantly remind yourself and it goes without saying. When you asked me the question. Do you ever know. I mean, I'm not gonna give you false hope. Now, I'm not gonna lie to you, like, I love my dog.

426
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:54.660
Richelle Direny: But I

427
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.940
Jessica Tate: totally understand that my mom did that to me.

428
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.700
Richelle Direny: But I'm just saying, I'm not gonna lie.

429
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:17.490
Richelle Direny: To you will have to constantly remind yourself. This is life or death. And I love this whole life too much. I like the light better than I like the darkness, because that's the reality of what it is you were in the darkness. Now your

430
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.690
Jessica Tate: Life, that's

431
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:27.630
Richelle Direny: Kind of how you have to, you think about when people say, speak positivity tea into your life. That's how you speak positivity into not this false crazy gravity dogma.

432
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:41.340
Richelle Direny: It's this. This is life. To me, I like this boring life because this boring life on in the light, I have a husband that loves me. I have a house. I never thought I would have. I have a daughter that I'm with constantly and I'm getting to see

433
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:51.090
Richelle Direny: Go through everything in life. I like this life, and if it means that I have to say boring until the day I die. That's dog on it. So we do

434
00:50:52.410 --> 00:51:05.040
Jessica Tate: Have one of the girls that I got in the group. Her name is Cassie Pharaoh. We've known each other for years. We used to run together and like do pills. Well, she moved like before I

435
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:17.190
Jessica Tate: Like started trying to get clean, like she had moved to needles and I was like, seriously thinking about that. That's why. And I definitely afraid of needles still

436
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:28.260
Jessica Tate: Have to have my blood drawn like I tell them not to show me the needle and don't kill, like, just do it. And I was seriously thinking about it and

437
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.480
Jessica Tate: I'm glad.

438
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.080
Jessica Tate: If I were to go back. I probably

439
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:43.290
Jessica Tate: Like I'm afraid that that probably what happened and I would die like i don't i don't see her.

440
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:58.350
Jessica Tate: Like face to face because she has two babies and we do live in the same town but we support each other a lot like all of our friends X friends and say, friends, they still use but we like show

441
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:06.090
Jessica Tate: So text me like, hey, the baby is digging in his shit rub it on the walls, is that normal and like

442
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:23.880
Jessica Tate: I know that's crazy. But that's like that's not we used to talk about drugs and that doesn't even come up and it's nice. It's nice to have a friend that like knows that. But she's loving the board knife to she's a housewife. She's a mother. She's clean

443
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:37.650
Jessica Tate: And so at first it was weird not texting like saying, hey, there's Percocet and we're talking about our babies and given advice and, you know, stuff like that. So it's nice

444
00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.640
Jessica Tate: It's nice having, having that

445
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:43.590
Richelle Direny: My normal

446
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.010
Jessica Tate: Yeah, but I'm, I'm afraid to actually like see her stale.

447
00:52:48.240 --> 00:53:05.730
Jessica Tate: Because I don't know if it will. I haven't seen her probably a few years probably five years. I mean, I'm sorry, through Facebook and stuff. And we we text almost every day but i'm i'm afraid of heights, fear, like it will because I like she

448
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.010
Richelle Direny: For a long time, she was my using

449
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:18.450
Jessica Tate: Buddy, and she got clean before this clinic, but she was going like through her baby doctor and you know she had to pack the baby up there every week and I was like,

450
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:27.300
Jessica Tate: I gave her the information, like, Hey, why don't you try this. It's a lot easier when you have babies and they're amazing. And so she got to it, too. But yeah, she's

451
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:38.250
Jessica Tate: She wants to go like have a play date because her oldest son like 15 months and then she has a baby. It's like nine months or something like that. And I'm just, I'm scared I'm scared to say or yeah

452
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.250
Jessica Tate: And I wouldn't scare there. And if you're so

453
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:49.740
Richelle Direny: There's a little bit of vulnerability in there and mentally and emotionally you maybe are not at that place right now.

454
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:53.010
Jessica Tate: Yeah, I don't know what drugs to give to me but I

455
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.840
Richelle Direny: geek out about it. Yeah.

456
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.910
Richelle Direny: It's not about it's all about you and where you are.

457
00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.530
Richelle Direny: Until the end emotionally

458
00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:58.980
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

459
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:14.130
Richelle Direny: And I think that, you know, talking about it and working through it, then you get to that point where you say, Okay, well let's do a tester and let me see how I am a man if I'm in that position. And if you go there and you're like, Oh my God, and you freeze up and you feel like, oh,

460
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:24.210
Richelle Direny: Then you say, Okay, let me back up a little bit. Let me see, what is it about this whole interaction that put me in a bad place. And then you say okay now.

461
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.350
Richelle Direny: I'm at a different place.

462
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.190
It's kind of like

463
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.570
Richelle Direny: testing the water that's all you do you test the what he said oh

464
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:31.770
Jessica Tate: Yeah.

465
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.660
Richelle Direny: You're like, Oh, cool.

466
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:35.670
Richelle Direny: That's kind of

467
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:36.630
Richelle Direny: What you have to do.

468
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:46.290
Richelle Direny: But it's okay it's normal. You know, you're not different, simply because you're going through it. Everybody goes through the same thing, just in a different way.

469
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:59.580
Richelle Direny: And I think too. It's also important to like you said re evaluate your friends because everyone that say that they were your friend really was never your friend in the first place. And sometimes people come back in your life.

470
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.470
Richelle Direny: Act like your friend gain your trust and then they bring you right back down that road.

471
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.770
Richelle Direny: So sometimes finding new friends is best

472
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:21.780
Jessica Tate: Yeah, until she got clean. We had no contact what so ever. But like, when she got pregnant like that totally changed her like if it's it's were just saying her

473
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:43.920
Jessica Tate: Or just like just seeing her life on Facebook or like the stuff she she tells me like those I I believe there's babies saved her and I believe my baby is helping save me because I'm like I said, I've tried this before and it never worked in ever worked and I've never seen her.

474
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:53.100
Jessica Tate: She's been clean a long time too. And it's just I think it's maybe, like you said, just like knowing that

475
00:55:53.880 --> 00:56:14.070
Jessica Tate: If you have back to its best or you're going to lose your family and but i i under I do understand that what you're saying, too, but like I lost my family last time. So I don't, I guess what's confusing to me is, what's the difference and I wasn't okay with it. Like I would get high.

476
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.680
Richelle Direny: Because you're in a different time and cry.

477
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:25.080
Jessica Tate: And I would cry about it and I still wanted by baby but i i don't know i just didn't do anything to get clean or

478
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:33.210
Richelle Direny: Think about it, things are different things are different from back then. And I think that's where I find that people kind of misconstrue. They're like,

479
00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.800
Jessica Tate: What's different what's different.

480
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:49.830
Richelle Direny: Is that the way they're doing drugs now is very different from how they did it back then. Now it's the supply and demand. They're leasing it with different things they're doing a whole lot of more new and innovative things. So the next time might

481
00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.190
Be

482
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:52.710
Richelle Direny: Good night, permanently.

483
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.180
Jessica Tate: Or if it's not good.

484
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.150
Richelle Direny: Night permanently, you will be a shell.

485
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:08.220
Richelle Direny: You understand, you will be no good to yourself. It could be the whole lot different. You lose your house you lose your child, but now you're still alive.

486
00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:21.240
Richelle Direny: But now you're a vegetable, or you're confined to a chair or now you're left with your mind, but your functionality is not is it could be way worse than it could you understand

487
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.400
Richelle Direny: Yeah. The question is, do you want to go for

488
00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:23.700
Now,

489
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.100
Jessica Tate: Do you have a lot of people like gain weight on this.

490
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:44.910
Jessica Tate: Because they're not doing drugs and more because I fucking I'm not gonna lie. Fucking blew up. I've been 120 my whole life. I'm like 160 I mean of course I gained that because I had my daughter, but I can't.

491
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.590
Richelle Direny: But then the difference is the question is where you a little bit more active before your daughter.

492
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.110
Jessica Tate: Oh we out Jason drugs, but

493
00:57:52.470 --> 00:58:01.110
Richelle Direny: Either way, after you had your daughter did you stay had maintained a more inclusive life where you're not as active as you once were.

494
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.390
Jessica Tate: Even outside. Yeah, yeah.

495
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:04.980
Richelle Direny: Also a different thing, because

496
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:14.010
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's inclusive, you're really home, you're not really so everything you do. And if you eat later whatever the situation is and that could have beer impact now.

497
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.760
Jessica Tate: This is eating late have is that not good.

498
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:18.720
No.

499
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.870
Jessica Tate: I can't wait because I eat rice.

500
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.400
Richelle Direny: At like 11 o'clock at night.

501
00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:27.630
Jessica Tate: That's what I do. I don't eat during the day and then I eat at night, why everyone's asleep.

502
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.760
Jessica Tate: And then I'll have to share my food with her.

503
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.380
Jessica Tate: Son. Plus, I can have a whole sandwich by myself.

504
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.150
Richelle Direny: You want to transfer you

505
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:37.710
Richelle Direny: Know the difference

506
00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:40.080
Richelle Direny: I do go Hi to eat candy. Don't worry. I do.

507
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.210
Jessica Tate: So,

508
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.770
Richelle Direny: So that is a factor that is a factor.

509
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:50.400
Richelle Direny: But again, if there's any other medical things. I mean,

510
00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:52.500
Richelle Direny: More to Dr. James and as you can.

511
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.430
Jessica Tate: Tell what

512
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.040
Richelle Direny: Those are the simple things that I can think about like

513
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.480
Richelle Direny: Okay, I, I have

514
00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:03.930
Richelle Direny: just naturally gain weight after my child, but I'm not as active as I once was. And I'm like, you said you're eating late at night and you're eating.

515
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:05.430
Jessica Tate: Crap. Yeah.

516
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:11.610
Richelle Direny: So that is a factor, but if the medication has anything to do with it. You really have to talk to her to see

517
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.060
Jessica Tate: Okay.

518
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:21.990
Richelle Direny: You know what the issues are. But, you know, overall, I just think, you know, you have to really truly if your goal is to eventually

519
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.690
Come off of the medication.

520
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:37.740
Richelle Direny: I would definitely start working on looking at the sequence of events of when you feel the pain more and having more of an open dialogue with Dr. Jamison

521
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:51.060
Richelle Direny: Out it to see you know what you can identify and asked her. Is that related to the medication or could it be something else because there could be other things going on, and you would never know, simply because you're on the Suboxone

522
00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.170
Jessica Tate: Or right you

523
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.100
Richelle Direny: Never know.

524
00:59:53.460 --> 01:00:00.510
Richelle Direny: Yet people are getting this this coronavirus and then they're finding out. Oh, did you know you had this going. I know, I know I had that

525
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:01.530
Great.

526
01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:05.160
Richelle Direny: Because you were taking a medication that never allowed you

527
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:05.940
Richelle Direny: To find that out.

528
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.260
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so

529
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.030
Richelle Direny: That's just kind of where you are. Okay.

530
01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:13.830
Richelle Direny: All right. Okay. I'm moving forward. I would definitely

531
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:26.220
Richelle Direny: Encourage you you know if you ever need to check in, you can always just let me know. I know you're on the calendar for the 13th is one day rescheduled you for so I can remove it and you just reach out when you need to check in with me. Okay.

532
01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:35.070
Jessica Tate: Well, if she how, why did. Why does she recommended because whatever she wants us to see you once a month or once every two months.

533
01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.100
Richelle Direny: It's up to me. So we could do one someone

534
01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:40.200
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

535
01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:44.940
Richelle Direny: So if you want. We could just leave it on the 13th, I think, is whatever they would like to know us and the

536
01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.690
Cognition

537
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:46.980
Jessica Tate: Yep.

538
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:48.600
