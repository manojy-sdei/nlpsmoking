Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica Garcia.

2
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.160
Jessica Garcia: Happy Monday, I don't know what happened earlier.

3
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.580
Jessica Garcia: But I just log back in. I was like,

4
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So whenever that happens, it's probably me. What I do is I have to shut down one zoom and open up another one every single time.

5
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes I ought to bring you guys in and then I say, Okay, let's all long out sometimes I just shut the whole thing down. So, that was me. I apologize.

6
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.080
Jessica Garcia: Okay, I'm sorry, I just, I don't know.

7
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.770
All right.

8
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You did the right thing. He came right back. That's all. Okay.

9
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.570
Jessica Garcia: That's good.

10
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to open up a note. Do you have anything, sort of, she wanted to kind of focus on today.

11
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.740
Jessica Garcia: Um,

12
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.540
Jessica Garcia: No.

13
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you can

14
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.710
Jessica Garcia: See if you see me itchiness, because like my eggs are must coming back.

15
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.680
Jessica Garcia: Oh, but this time it's like on my legs.

16
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.510
Jessica Garcia: Oh yeah I suffered from a demo. When I was a little girl.

17
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010
Jessica Garcia: And then now, it came back for

18
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.740
Jessica Garcia: A different way.

19
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.170
Jessica Garcia: Like worse.

20
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's worse right now.

21
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.370
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

22
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.720
Uh huh.

23
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.220
Jessica Garcia: Yeah. Well, I think it's worse. But I guess I just don't really remember when I was young when I was younger, I would get a look on my arms right here.

24
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.750
Jessica Garcia: And then

25
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.130
Jessica Garcia: And then now it's like on my legs.

26
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.100
Jessica Garcia: Have been getting along.

27
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that just because you're keeping your distance and not expecting anything from him.

28
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.400
Jessica Garcia: I think so.

29
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.170
Jessica Garcia: I think so. And he's like,

30
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.020
Jessica Garcia: I don't know.

31
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What

32
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.470
Jessica Garcia: He's like more lighthearted

33
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.030
Jessica Garcia: Yeah. And so we're just our relationship. It's like

34
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.850
Jessica Garcia: It's not

35
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.860
Jessica Garcia: Like

36
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:35.700
Jessica Garcia: A couple. You know, it's like we're friends raising a baby together and I like to keep it like that. Yeah, I like to keep it like that, whenever we can, because there's times when we fight, but, um, because whenever we get romantically involved with each other just get so complicated.

37
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.910
Jessica Garcia: I expect too much from him and

38
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something

39
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That happens for everybody, though, you're not alone.

40
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.170
Jessica Garcia: Okay, good.

41
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: HOW YOU DOING, AROUND working about how you doing with your son being

42
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You know over people's homes like kind of you were starting to delve into some pretty tender areas in previous sessions. How you doing around that.

43
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.720
Jessica Garcia: So,

44
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.510
Jessica Garcia: The days that I do work.

45
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.800
Jessica Garcia: His dad doesn't work.

46
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:43.050
Jessica Garcia: And so he's here with his that, but then I work another job as well. I work with my grandparents taking care of or doing housework for them and stuff to do a company and I get to take them with me.

47
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:53.220
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, he goes with me and they just, it makes their day like they like it, but my grandma.

48
00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.040
Jessica Garcia: And grandpa really old. So they've regressed a lot and so

49
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:15.210
Jessica Garcia: So my grandma will get to fighting with him. Like if she's a little kid like she's a little baby, too.

50
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.240
Jessica Garcia: And it's just

51
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.590
Jessica Garcia: It's hard.

52
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that's nuts. That's my ice cream.

53
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.320
Jessica Garcia: Yeah. Oh, Dr. Or I when I'm when we're good on Saturday I went and bought a

54
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:47.100
Jessica Garcia: art supplies and then some like little wooden I'm picture frame so that we could all sit down and paint together.

55
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

56
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.260
Jessica Garcia: Maybe I my grandparents and me and my son, but my son was

57
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:12.900
Jessica Garcia: He was dipping the paintbrush into all different colors. And my grandma was getting so upset that he was doing that because he was ruining the colors. And so she was telling them to stop and he pulling in her hand.

58
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.710
Jessica Garcia: She painted. So she painted his hand back

59
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Funny. Yeah, he's putting he's creating the color brown is what he's joking.

60
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.480
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

61
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna find out soon. Everything's gonna be around. Yeah. Oh, boy. So how did that that interaction, how did it end

62
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.160
Jessica Garcia: I'm the baby ended up

63
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:56.460
Jessica Garcia: getting really upset and throwing all the pain and I just I just picked everything up and cleaned everything up because my grandma, my grandpa started getting really frustrated, too. So it wasn't what I expected, but

64
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.550
Jessica Garcia: It was okay for a while there.

65
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.170
Jessica Garcia: I just wanted us to create something together.

66
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.900
Jessica Garcia: I wanted to have something

67
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.580
Jessica Garcia: That

68
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.450
Jessica Garcia: Night good like just that experience that moment. You know, I wanted to create that. And I was so excited about it.

69
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.250
Jessica Garcia: But

70
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jessica. It's not over.

71
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not over. You can still have it.

72
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But that must have been confusing. You know, how do you, how do you

73
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Address a behavior from someone that's older than you, and and now all the sudden they're regressing to be in like a six year old or younger.

74
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you maintain yourself, you know, and you're the only adult in the room, basically.

75
00:07:59.370 --> 00:07:59.820
Yeah.

76
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.650
Jessica Garcia: Um,

77
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.680
Jessica Garcia: I just kind of try to like

78
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.610
Jessica Garcia: Try to

79
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:25.230
Jessica Garcia: Like coerce them like kind of calm my gramma down and then come my son down at the same time, and like you know like I don't know how to explain it.

80
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.250
Jessica Garcia: I try to convince them that it's okay.

81
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.900
Jessica Garcia: You know,

82
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So if, if we treat grandma. The same way we do, you know, a two or three year old, then we already know that a little boy doesn't know that when you next

83
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yellow and and and bread or orange and purple and things like that that eventually it's going to turn brown. He literally doesn't know.

84
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: He knows enough to dip the depression, like, Oh, now I want this like he doesn't know that this one has to be clean, in order to go into this other color so

85
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What if all it was was not really getting the limitations of development in that setting. Maybe it just means that we'll do the tree trunk. First, it's all going to be brown

86
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe grandma's part you know she'll have separate colors off to her side, and each one gets their own colors so we can get in and he gets to learn

87
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's all going to look around. Why is my no brown. Oh, cuz look, look what happens. And then we mixed it up. Look, we can even make brown what colors would make bread.

88
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And then she grandma can share her wisdom around that and she can keep her colors kind of separate too so she can have her yellow and orange. And it's not a bunch of brown, but he's he's going to have all the brown necessary for the tree trunks right to the road.

89
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To the birds, he'll have the right color for that he will have learned for those colors get mushy.

90
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: blended together.

91
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.970
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

92
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:23.550
Jessica Garcia: And then she tried to explain it to them him like she was trying to explain it to him. But by that time he was already peeled and over it and he screamed.

93
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But so, I mean, in other words, when you're going in. Let's say you wanted to still have this memory because I can tell us as a sentimental one

94
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to have this co created

95
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: art piece that will last forever.

96
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you think your grandma like a six year old.

97
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or seven maybe or something. Maybe a little older.

98
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Than you can be ready for it.

99
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You can place them certain places.

100
00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, push a little further apart. Each one has their own supplies. You can talk about what the rules are. You can be in the middle to be

101
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That sort of, okay, well we're moving on as picky. Let's use yellow everybody's using yellow. Let's everything that's yellow okay we got that brush or ever done with that brush.

102
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This one we're going to rinse it out. I'll be in charge of cleaning that one. Now just sort of was I would hate for you to miss out on a moment with them.

103
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But really it's it's really seeing that your grammar is sounds like she is regressing and so you have to six. Well, you have to, but you have young children in front of you. And that's just the way it is. And so are you going to

104
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Say like you need to pretend like it's not real. I wish it was something else, or you really need it where it's out, which is

105
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This a good thing actually to be around kids. So they're more spontaneous and it could could have turned into a finger painting if if there was an openness to it. Oh, I see how it is. And so they'll already find that and everybody's elbows up let's make

106
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's turn this one into handprint

107
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.140
Jessica Garcia: You know, that's a really good idea.

108
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But been waiting to be hot but when our expectation doesn't match reality, we can get lost in that frustration.

109
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But instead, to say, okay, let's, let's just see what what is reasonable here. What, what am I dealing with

110
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So your grandma is likely to have something like that happen again kind of being prepared for it and

111
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Can roll with it a little bit.

112
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really two kids.

113
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.980
Jessica Garcia: Three because my grandpa was over there.

114
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.760
Jessica Garcia: Making inappropriate jokes and

115
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't really funny. He is

116
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:55.950
Jessica Garcia: Good, yeah, it's a good time. It's a good time when we're all together. And we've been having a lot of good moments, but

117
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:07.890
Jessica Garcia: Just as much as there's good days, Bob, because we all get frustrated the baby gets frustrated. My grandparents get frustrated and then I get like upset.

118
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.360
Yeah.

119
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.260
Jessica Garcia: And it's hard being like their main

120
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.010
Jessica Garcia: Their main caregiver, you know,

121
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.850
Jessica Garcia: Like I have that responsibility, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

122
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.280
Jessica Garcia: It's

123
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of neat that you're having this time with them right now.

124
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.110
Jessica Garcia: Especially because they took care of me know

125
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.900
Jessica Garcia: They took care of me and now I got to take care of them.

126
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:53.400
Jessica Garcia: Even when I was on the streets on drugs that they literally drive around the neighborhood looking for me just to give me to pace to make sure I didn't need anything.

127
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.750
Jessica Garcia: Don't ever forget that.

128
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.360
Jessica Garcia: She didn't care if I wanted her to show up or not she would show up and shoot and make sure that all is good.

129
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's powerful. So she really gets this idea of dropping expectation and just doing what is right for that relationship right

130
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people would say, well, she's a drug addict and that's her problem and let her work it out. She's worried about your teeth and making sure you know you're getting

131
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Your basic needs.

132
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.600
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

133
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you could do that for her. And so you kind of hear how those stories are similar, how you can

134
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Meet her where she's at she's got a limitation. She's got maybe some regression going on. She's getting older. And that's, you know, our brains, we do are memories terrible and we shrinks after 30 that's exciting. Well, then, that

135
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.590
Jessica Garcia: That

136
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.930
Jessica Garcia: My friends, my brains already

137
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.250
Jessica Garcia: Fried like half prayer.

138
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.190
Jessica Garcia: Goodness. Drink some more.

139
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Good news, done. Oh.

140
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.850
Jessica Garcia: No, it's so funny.

141
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.590
Jessica Garcia: But, um, but, yeah, so I'm really

142
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:37.410
Jessica Garcia: I'm I just don't like the thing that worries me is that my son gets upset. Like, I don't know if it's normal for a baby.

143
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:47.280
Jessica Garcia: To get that mad to where he's like oh man has stopped breathing. His face turns red. And he screams really loud.

144
00:15:48.330 --> 00:16:01.110

Gwenevere Abriel: And what happens next.

Jessica Garcia: I just kind of like let him.

158
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.200
Jessica Garcia: Let him be angry.

159
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:13.290
Jessica Garcia: For a minute and then whenever I see that he gets that upset. After he does that, then I kind of pick them up and hold them try to collect. Calm down. I come, it's okay. Like, you know, you can come down.

160
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.500
Jessica Garcia: And there's times when hill.

163
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

164
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like, Don't touch me, or he says, Don't touch me.

165
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.870
Jessica Garcia: Know if he doesn't say he's just

166
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:52.800
Jessica Garcia: SCREAMS And then like if I try to pick them out. But if you want something so when we go to my grandma's he has a thing where he throws a fit because he wants to stay outside and um

167
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.980
Jessica Garcia: And so I have to bring them inside because we have to say hi to everybody and everything and then

168
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:14.880
Jessica Garcia: His main thing like his main concern or whatever, is that she wants to go outside. So if he does that. Then he screams and I tried to pick him up. He's like, trying to get away from me because he wants to go outside.

169
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:23.400
Jessica Garcia: Right. He's like, I want to go outside. I want to go feed the ducks because they have ducks that live in their swimming pool.

170
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you go ahead and bring them inside.

171
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.190
Jessica Garcia: Mm hmm.

172
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's funny, has a tantrum.

173
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.410
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

174
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This where this all that concern came from that maybe there was some inappropriate behavior at that house.

175
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.710
Jessica Garcia: No.

176
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:50.760
Okay.

177
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.900
Jessica Garcia: No, I just, I don't know.

178
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You had some suspicions about it. I'm just curious if it was at that house with those people, or if it was somewhere else.

179
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.690
Jessica Garcia: No, it's just I think it was just in general.

180
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it based on any facts that you may be we're not paying attention to before, and they're sort of becoming conscious for you, or was it more like

181
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing back your own experience and sort of wonder if this happened to my son. It was, I like that, too. And no one saw the signs that kind of thing.

182
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.590
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, it was more like an idea like, or like

183
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.650
Jessica Garcia: I guess my fears just

184
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:58.290
Jessica Garcia: Getting the best of my mind, you know, or or trying to figure out why or even if it's even normal for him to be that angry are like, you know,

185
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So where are you getting your, your information from who you talked to me besides me well. So you're talking to about this behavior.

186
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.810
Jessica Garcia: Um, my mom.

187
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's her

188
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom. She say

189
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.960
Jessica Garcia: She says that it that it's normal that kids get angry like that.

190
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you say when she shares that this is within normal limits and range.

191
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.670
Jessica Garcia: Nothing.

192
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:34.860
Jessica Garcia: Hmm.

193
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Except her answer.

194
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.010
Yeah.

195
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.880
Jessica Garcia: I do, I do, because she's had more experience with it than me.

196
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.910
Jessica Garcia: So I do like it's okay you know

197
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But isn't a difference what each of you did in the presence of that anger. What would your mom have done if you were angry like that.

198
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:26.250
Jessica Garcia: No idea. Haha, I will she probably would have like

199
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.900
Jessica Garcia: I don't know. I don't remember when I was middle, but I remember when I was like a teenager.

200
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.360
Jessica Garcia: She would just kind of ignore me or tell me to like

201
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.200
Jessica Garcia: Go to my room.

202
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.200
Jessica Garcia: Or a lot of the time she wouldn't even be there.

203
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's not even a memory.

204
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Of age two or three like there's no memory.

205
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the right thing most people can't think.

206
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Prior to, like, for most people, five, they can think back as bad as far back as five

207
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't

208
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.810
Jessica Garcia: Have like memories that stick out

209
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.860
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, like one or two or

210
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.690
Jessica Garcia: But that's it.

211
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.670
Jessica Garcia: Oh, and guess what

212
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you in

213
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.860
Are

214
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You in your new apartment.

215
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.180
Jessica Garcia: No.

216
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.180
Jessica Garcia: No, but it's gonna be, it's gonna be a

217
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: By this week. Oh, man.

218
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:44.280
Jessica Garcia: By the end of this week. Yeah. Yeah. And then also, too. I got headphones with two

219
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.620
Jessica Garcia: With two not well I don't have it in yet, but it's right there.

220
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.790
Jessica Garcia: Oh, so maybe we can start working on the

221
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Dr.

222
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, absolutely.

223
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Eaten and

224
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: He are

225
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting you mentioned oh you know i i have some memories here and there.

226
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't remember how my mom.

227
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Addressed my anger. When I was little.

228
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And then interestingly, you brought up the topic of the FDR, which of course ends to address those early memories, right, those we tend to I try to anyway, try to bridge one that's as early as I can. As far back as I can. The one that sort of set in motion a pattern.

229
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Of adaptation

230
00:23:45.990 --> 00:24:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess, would you say if you had to guess how your anger was respond to as a little 123456. Do you think it was positive like picking you up, letting you know everything's gonna be okay. Or do you think it was something not that

231
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.010
Jessica Garcia: No, I hear stories.

232
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the stories.

233
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.250
Jessica Garcia: I hear stories like

234
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.520
Jessica Garcia: They say that my grandma and my mom so that I used to cry.

235
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.100
Jessica Garcia: Really that I used to like throw those kind of fits whenever

236
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:32.910
Jessica Garcia: My mom would pick me up from my grandma's house after she got out of work.

237
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:41.940
Jessica Garcia: And that she would have to drive back and have my grandma get in the car and lived on diner and I fell, it fell asleep and then go drop her back. Oh.

238
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So let me get this straight. Your mom by herself didn't address you, she had grandma. Get in the car.

239
00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.220
Jessica Garcia: She said that she couldn't call me down.

240
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:16.350
Jessica Garcia: So that she do she drew drive back to my grandmas and call my grandma and Claire come get this little girl and stuff, pray for you on that. My gut model and get in the car and they drive around so I fell asleep.

241
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.790
Jessica Garcia: And then she dropped her back on.

242
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:25.830
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

243
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you have in common, without are not in common with that some to stay in that area a little bit longer.

244
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.180
Jessica Garcia: Don't know. I feel

245
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.150
Jessica Garcia: I feel like I'm in sync with my son is

246
00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:58.800
Jessica Garcia: Like

247
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.500
Jessica Garcia: Emotions like

248
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.970
Jessica Garcia: Like he doesn't even need to

249
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.410
Jessica Garcia: Say anything, let alone.

250
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.010
Jessica Garcia: And so I feel like that's why I picked them up and

251
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.150
Jessica Garcia: And try to calm them down.

252
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

253
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes he had to, and sometimes he does feel how you're feeling any calms down

254
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This after he picks you up. How long does it take before he regulates the same sort of

255
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Pace that you're out when you're holding him. How long does that take

256
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.630
Jessica Garcia: It's almost instantly.

257
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.480
Jessica Garcia: Whenever he does like calm down.

258
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.760
Jessica Garcia: It's just like instantly like he'll just stop crying.

259
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.980
Jessica Garcia: That or whenever he's like

260
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.920
Jessica Garcia: wanting something

261
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.820
Jessica Garcia: It'll take them a little bit longer.

262
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Like for example, the outside thing.

263
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Tell me one where he was hitting you, how long that lasted

264
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.020
Jessica Garcia: Like a good two, three minutes.

265
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you do any sitting there.

266
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.810
Jessica Garcia: I just tell them to stop at home. That's not okay.

267
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.830
Jessica Garcia: It's not okay, you don't hit mommy.

268
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:54.690
Jessica Garcia: Come on, I can lay him on my shoulder and pat him on his back and like rockin

269
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I just he stopped hitting you.

270
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.130
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

271
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.480
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, he just tells me that he wants to go outside.

272
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.340
Jessica Garcia: And I figure I figure that it's because he's

273
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:21.090
Jessica Garcia: He was so used to like being out and about everywhere and everything. And now we just keep them in the house, like a mess. I take him for a walk or something but

274
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.520
Jessica Garcia: So he's stays locked in the house, and he's not

275
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:35.220
Jessica Garcia: Like growing up. He wasn't used to that or like these. This past year, two years, he

276
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.370
Jessica Garcia: Is not used to that. And so I feel like

277
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.250
Jessica Garcia: Like he just wants to be outside

278
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.220
Jessica Garcia: Because he's locked in the house so much

279
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:56.310
Jessica Garcia: And so, like, so there's times like when he comes down or whatever, like, then I take him outside

280
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.150
Jessica Garcia: And I'll just follow him around, and he'll play and

281
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.480
Jessica Garcia: Play with him and stuff.

282
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.340
Jessica Garcia: But then getting him inside

283
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.100
Jessica Garcia: With another

284
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.880
Jessica Garcia: Another fit.

285
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there's a lot of directions to go. There's the question of whether his range of anger matches his developmental age. There's what it brings up for you.

286
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: There's how your mom handled you

287
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also just tricks to get the kids to go inside, right, you can start anywhere.

288
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But remember the last session was not about tricks, and hacks. It was what if this is a missed sign that's where your mind was last time.

289
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You just sort of sitting with that a little bit more and seeing is that, is that still here today. So there's still a concern that you're missing a sign.

290
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.290
Jessica Garcia: It's always gonna be in the back of my mind.

291
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:17.910

Jessica Garcia: I don't know, he said something about, oh, I tell him, gosh, you could never do anything for me. Right. And then he's like, You can do anything. Or you could never do anything or something like that. And when before that common

350
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:18.840
Jessica Garcia: Whatever like made me so upset. This time, I was like, Yeah, sure. Okay, I don't do anything, like, you know, even though before I was doing everything I was still

351
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.620
Jessica Garcia: Working hard and you know

352
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.200
Jessica Garcia: But now it's like

353
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:34.770
Jessica Garcia: I guess that's just the way I was always taught was like, you have to be hard working and and be able to like

354
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.310
Jessica Garcia: Take care of yourself, otherwise.

355
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.090

357
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish that otherwise not working hard, as in earning money working, then what

358
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.000
Jessica Garcia: Then

359
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.460
Jessica Garcia: Then you're not doing the right thing, then you're

360
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.060
Jessica Garcia: Not worth anything.

361
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.480
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, worth as much

362
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: As

363
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:17.460
Jessica Garcia: The value. Yeah, opinion, your pocket or something like that that single

364
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.290
Jessica Garcia: Flow.

365
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.500
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, so, uh,

366
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.990
Jessica Garcia: Huh.

367
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So on one hand, you notice you're not as defensive because you aren't earning money. So that's the upside, but it's also, it's still perpetuating

368
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That people's value is only come about when they are earning two that could be problematic if you're not earning or someone else is not earning right, it could be problematic.

369
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

370
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.410
Jessica Garcia: That's weird though because like

371
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:02.580
Jessica Garcia: Say if God forbid something were to happen, and he gets laid off of his job or something like, I wouldn't

372
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.430
Jessica Garcia: I wouldn't be like that.

373
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.510
Jessica Garcia: Or at least like to think I wouldn't like I wouldn't

374
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.240
Jessica Garcia: You know,

375
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:20.790
Jessica Garcia: judge him for ladder, I'd be more than happy to, like, take the role you know

376
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.460
Jessica Garcia: So,

377
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.410
Jessica Garcia: I don't know.

378
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

379
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.460
Jessica Garcia: I guess because it's because I'm more critical of myself.

380
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can

381
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus today. The remainder of today, sort of in sort of targeting where we'll focus next time.

382
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:57.840
Sounds good.

383
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Remembering to see this sick feeling in your stomach. When your mom even talks about her boyfriend. How is it up there at that 99 still

384
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Up distress. Yeah, it's still upsetting. As soon as it's like a yuck. Okay, got it.

385
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we can refine this from a little bit more

386
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: See if I can identify the negative belief that goes with that one.

387
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: See picture. You don't hear her talking

388
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

389
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: To him, and what is

390
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The is it, is it a recent image or is an old, old image that comes up, how old is that memory. When you think of a real salient

391
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When it brings you to that 99 distress level.

392
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.360
Jessica Garcia: I think it was

393
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.430
Jessica Garcia: I think it's like him getting in my face.

394
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:31.770
Jessica Garcia: And slapping me and then hearing him lie straight out lie to my mom.

395
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:33.600
Jessica Garcia: Said to me.

396
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.570
Jessica Garcia: Like being such a coward, saying that he didn't hit me when he did

397
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You made this

398
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: 717 16. How old were you at this originally happened.

404
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:38.280

406
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.120
Jessica Garcia: Now, my father murdered him.

407
00:41:48.660 --> 00:42:01.980
Jessica Garcia: I was like 23 years I had just had a baby. So I just turned 23

408
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Open up my ears a little bit

409
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get it the negative belief about yourself right then.

410
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So just be present with that a little bit. His yak disgust me

411
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief about you around that memory, what what what Mr to that inner dialogue that inner voice of I am what

412
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time with this one. These are really hard to get to. Okay.

Jessica Garcia: And

418
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.580
Jessica Garcia: So I guess that was like a lot of how I

419
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.610
Jessica Garcia: Felt about myself like that.

420
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.820
Jessica Garcia: I wasn't doing anything.

421
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.440

428
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And the belief about the self may have been I'm useless.

485
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:16.110
Jessica Garcia: The time my mom tried my mom was trying to put me or convince me to go to a

486
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.230

489
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have to hold on to thinking about that I've written a note about it. It's I put it up there in at 90 in our

490
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of scale, so that I can remember to bring it back up so you don't have to have it in your working memory, unless you want to process it, that's up to you. But I'll be able to bring it back up.

491
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to

492
00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so that might give us a bit of a target.

493
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: To work on next time. So hopefully we'll be able to have you seated with our two objects will be able to maybe do some desensitization around that memory or another one, whichever target you and I kind of both societies one

494
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.830
