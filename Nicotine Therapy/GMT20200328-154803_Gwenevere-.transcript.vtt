1
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh hey, how are ya.

2
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.180
Ariel Mirabal: Are you good

3
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to laugh. You know, we're sitting here and I'm saying, oh, I made this mistake. I didn't do this bio psychosocial I did too. I did too. I did it. I did the first time I met you. So I'm just

4
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.060
Ariel Mirabal: I'm listening.

5
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To this woman in the care Navigator. She's like, Yeah, you need to do the bio psychosocial and I'm like, I never make that mistake, right. Like, how can I do that what to do that. And I didn't make the mistake I did too. I did too.

6
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.720
Ariel Mirabal: I remember the questions. Yeah, I just thought that you probably had like another one or something for me to do. I wasn't sure.

7
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Know we get to just

8
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Be

9
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.010
Cool.

10
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's see.

11
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Physically

12
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Last 24 hours. Has there been any relief. Are you feeling good.

13
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.260
Ariel Mirabal: I'm feeling better. I had my medication on Thursday and yesterday.

14
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.850
Ariel Mirabal: I was feeling a lot better. I don't have anything for today, yet though, and until she calls right in after today. Yeah.

15
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And then as soon as you and I get in a groove, it's going to feel so much easier it'll just be bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. Okay.

16
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right up while everybody settles in and try tries to understand, you know, is it really, really, really have to go to any services or can I not you know people sort of settling into it.

17
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll feel a lot easier.

18
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's hard in the beginning.

19
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I start up a note here. And so, feeling better. How many days. Have you felt. Are you feeling normal

20
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.530
Ariel Mirabal: I do feel like I'm feeling normal. Yeah.

21
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: For 24 hours 12 hours someone or you had normal

22
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.820
Ariel Mirabal: I'm probably I'm starting to feel a little weird. Now, so probably just the last few hours. I've been up since about six this morning.

23
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.390
Ariel Mirabal: But before that, I mean, I felt normal all day yesterday. So, okay.

24
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.560
Ariel Mirabal: Now say

25
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Days, probably about you're getting your, your dose.

26
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.740
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, but I feel

27
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What time of day. Did you take your full dose yesterday.

28
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.780
Ariel Mirabal: Um, I take you it within the first hour that I wake up, so it's I get my cup coffee. Then I take it so it's about

29
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.120
Ariel Mirabal: On average, I wake up about seven in the morning. So I would say I wasn't exactly sure yesterday, but I'll say about seven. Okay.

30
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome, you know, you'd want to get in there pretty quickly. So, all right, I got you. So that might be what's going on here. Um,

31
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see what we talked about. I talked to you a little bit about

32
00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, the diaphragm matic breathing. I talked to you a little bit about this distinction between the voice of addiction in our head, the one that's like I grow, you can get away with it once. No one's going to know that one.

33
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.290
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

34
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

35
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus the

36
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.820
Ariel Mirabal: Mentor

37
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Which does something like, is this really going to get you the life you want, you know, is this good for you know role modeling health for our daughter and you know it it really speaks a very different message it speaks from your core values the authentic self is is you

38
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.260
Ariel Mirabal: Right. Um, so

39
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I was curious, I, I just

40
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't remember when I was teaching you the belly breathing. Did I do it from all the way from the beginning. Really formally explain the the poly bagel theory to you.

41
00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:03.630
Ariel Mirabal: Um, I think you said we were going to you're going to explain it after. But then we started getting into a few other things. I thought so. We did it. We doing it, but I don't. I don't know if you've explained to me.

42
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wonder if it would be better if if if we just sort of slow down and I was more thorough in my explanation and my modeling of it.

43
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can find out from you. First, to see if that's how it's a

44
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.010
good use of your time.

45
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people they come into the program already having sort of a practice in place, they already have this sort of breath work that they've learned maybe

46
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: From a friend or from a therapist or maybe you know yoga instructor or something.

47
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But

48
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The

49
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The actual instruction and originally I called it box breathing, because it was really formal and I'd like to restart and teach it that way, and see if

50
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: See how it feels for you. So I'm not going to do it casually I'ma do it really formally and I'm going to invite you to do it the way the instruction is

51
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then once you get it, then do it kind of whatever works for you, but something really interesting happens when we try to we do something new and we try to do it with fidelity.

52
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes all of our concentration and it can get us away from all of this sort of negative neural network.

53
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We're very focused on trying to do it just right we're concentrating on all these subtle pieces and it's effective in getting us out of an anxious thought a depressed thought or a fear response. So that's kind of a cool feature.

54
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I stopped calling it box breathing, because people weren't remembering the most important thing being that the that the belly gets pushed out when we feel all the air into the lungs. So I stopped calling it that. Now I just call it belly breathing so no one forgets.

55
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to give the instruction because

56
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It is the skill that people I've been seeing for years at this point are like, Nope.

57
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember the breathing. That's what gets me that's what gets me there. So now what may happening be happening. Afterwards, the cognitive reframing the change in their beliefs about confidence of the self and all those things.

58
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: They may not be aware that those things are going on. But what they're remember is the breath.

59
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's fine if everything else falls in line after that. Fantastic. That's great.

60
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do want to take my time with it because I'm watching over these years. It's that pivotal

61
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So the instruction is this. I'm going to teach it, then I'll do it. And you can do it with me or not. But then on purpose will do an activity where I'll invite you to pull up a tiny little distress moment, and we'll see if it's effective. Okay.

62
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So the instructions are these and I'll use the shape of my screen to sort of work, the squares of these four seconds. So it's like this.

63
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be I'm inhaling through my nose for four seconds. And as I'm inhaling through my nose. I'm paying attention to the temperature of the air, how it feels, on my nose. Here's an all the way into the bottom of my lung and I can feel

64
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That the lung is expanding down at the bottom that's going on for four seconds.

65
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I hold the breath for four seconds.

66
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I exhale out of the mouth, and I'm going to flat net belly flat and I'm going to pierce my lips in here. We do it you know like that in the real world. Obviously if you don't want to look like that. You don't have to, but in here.

67
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your choice.

68
00:08:52.530 --> 00:09:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's on purpose in here because part of it is being able to fear. Feel the pair slips feel the difference is that air goes out and you're really paying attention to the compression

69
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that long. And as even as the stomach flattens and it's not touching the fabric of the shirt anymore. We're literally paying attention.

70
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To as much as we possibly can. That's going to get us out of, oh, what's going to happen tomorrow. What about 10 years from now, you know, it gets us out of that rumination out of that fretful thinking

71
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And for a lot of people, they're having these panic moments and they want to get out of that they want to be in a regulated body. They want the muscles to relax. They want to be okay.

72
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so, so on the exhale. It'll be

73
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321

74
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321

75
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321

76
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321

77
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321

78
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A belly breath and then the hold it for

79
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.350
One.

80
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of get it right. It's like it's inhale for four seconds then you hold the breath for four seconds. So what, when we do it together. That was still the instruction part. Maybe you experimented with, I don't know. I have my eyes closed.

81
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:41.520
Ariel Mirabal: And

82
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You did okay Coco goal so

83
00:10:48.600 --> 00:11:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to try with your eyes closed. It's up to you. Really tuning into the tactile experience of it, the visceral like really feeling like how different it is to break down there and

84
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The holding of the breath is interesting.

85
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The instruction is four seconds I have a really hard time holding all my breath out for four seconds that's like our like what, so don't get hung up on

86
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Number, if it turns out, like if we have any kind of smoking stuff, it can be like, oof, or if there's any kind of asthma stuff. It can feel a little different.

87
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't get too too hung up on the seconds I say 44444 because it's easy to remember. But when you find your own group, you might end up doing something like this.

88
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.350
Ariel Mirabal: Went through like three seconds or something.

89
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And the exhale might be your longest piece where you just push it out for like six seconds. You can stretch that baby out and then you won't hold the breath for very long. Maybe only be to

90
00:11:51.660 --> 00:12:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that's neat about it is it's novel. It's new, it's, it's so detail oriented. It's difficult to do that. It gets your mind off of wherever it was before. And just to explain a little bit about the physio biology of it.

91
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I talk to you about the Vegas nerve.

92
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I probably talked about the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. Right.

93
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.380
Ariel Mirabal: I think so, yes.

94
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So the Vegas nerve.

95
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Has a I won't get into the dorsal Vegas nerve that it that has to do with the social regulation that it offers but this one the Vegas nerve where the activation is the

96
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Expansion of the belly when it does this, and it expands it smashes down the diaphragm, because the Vegas nerve. The Wandering nerve is attached to all kinds of organs, all the way down our body brain face heart, lungs,

97
00:12:53.100 --> 00:13:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach spleen kidneys, all of that. And because when we breathe that big belly breath as opposed to appear when we push it down that belly expands, it does push those organs below the diaphragm and it sends the message upward and says, Oh, we're taking a big deep breath.

98
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess we're okay. I guess we don't need to fight. We don't need to run

99
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We can slow the heart rate, we can slow the rate of respiration and we can have the progress. Okay. All right. We're all right so that's physiologically what's happened. You don't have to believe what I'm saying, in order for it to work.

100
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.300
It's interesting.

101
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right. It's cool. It's kind of neat to know there's some science behind it.

102
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The discovery actually of this that the Vegas nerve has the social the social wiring.

103
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That one is my eliminated ones on mile unaided, which means it has this fat coding, so that the nerves, the messages travel more efficiently. We'll get into another time.

104
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Which has to do with why we we benefit from talking to someone, why it feels good to finally like talk to someone finally understands us. We look at them and we hear their tone of voice, the property.

105
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And we feel known we feel cared for and we are no longer in distress. That's part of the Vegas nerve, but it's the ventral Vegas.

106
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.440
Ariel Mirabal: Part

107
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's pretty neat to know, why is it feels so good to finally talk to a buddy that really gets me

108
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.290
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

109
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:25.740
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

110
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's so cool. So cool. I love that science is catching up because it really legitimize psychology. It's like, well, we've known this forever.

111
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.770
Ariel Mirabal: reason behind it. Yeah, that's really interesting.

112
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.310
Ariel Mirabal: I know

113
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It is neat. But it gets to work, even though we we didn't know for a long, long time. Why is this, what is this feels so good.

114
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To be, you know, why is it important that this person that that I've established trust with that they really listened to me and I feel heard by them. Now you know why so

115
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So the breath is very important. So let's practice it doing it together for you what what so far. Seems the hardest part was it getting the air to the belly or counting what seems hard

116
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:29.370
Ariel Mirabal: I think I'm counting, everything was fine. I think that like I focus a lot on like expanding my my belly out because I noticed that a lot of times when I inhale really fast, like you said, yeah, it goes in like it doesn't expand my belly out, you know, I'm like,

117
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh good, I'm glad you told me. That's why I asked this question. So we're going to focus just on that part because it literally

118
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the one thing that makes this thing work. The rest of it. I don't even know how critical it is. It's just part of, I'm going to bring this

119
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a desk that allows me to stand on my feet for a few hours a day. So bring this puppy up

120
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So the part that's important is the belly breath. That's why I call it the belly breath. So let's um

121
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: One way is to expand that sort of chest as you can either do the lazy boy. Put your hands behind your head be chill. You can tuck them under your thighs and that yeah you already seem really open. So, that's perfect.

122
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: If you allow the seat to hold you up. And this is what we'll do first, we're only going to do. I don't care about timing. I just want you to

123
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you're going to get rid of all the air. You can have your hands on your belly.

124
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And the only thing you're going to concentrate on is that the air is coming in the top and it pushes those hands out. So if we if the hands don't go out because of the inhale and we're not quite there yet. So let's give it a try. Push all the air out and now in my hands went out.

125
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.440
And then

126
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So it really pressed your hands on your tummy.

127
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:52.290
Sorry.

128
00:16:53.340 --> 00:17:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then we'll exhale all the air out flat, flat, flat tummy and yeah we want with our inhale. That's the only way those hands are going out as if we're expanding a balloon in there, it won't go very big it'll only come out about like

129
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little. Nothing much. Not like it does when we do this heaving thing with our shoulders.

130
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.020
Ariel Mirabal: air out. Make sure all of your errors out right

131
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.500
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

132
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a good way to check some all the air out.

133
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then inhale through the nose expand a balloon down the bottom of the lung, the hands will come out, because of course there's a big chunk of air in there.

134
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll probably only come out like that far. It's not like this.

135
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll like it'll probably go like that. Just like a little so I watched this. So this is what you look like this might be helpful. So this is you watch my shoulders.

136
00:17:49.620 --> 00:18:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: See my shoulders. Move your shoulders want. That's a good cue that it's going up high. So what we do is we go okay shoulders. You guys can't move. You don't need to move. If the arrows going down low. So now, can you tell if my if my tummy.

137
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the one getting the air, watch, watch my shoulder. See if they move

138
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't move at all. Haha. That's how I know that's my trick. So you're, you're still doing this kind of stuff when you're breathing. So I'm getting the sense of the errors coming in here. So we want it to go way down low. So let's watch our hands.

139
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And then watch those hand expand on the inhale.

140
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.750
Are you noticing.

141
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.570
Ariel Mirabal: My shoulders not moving. I'm doing I'm doing a lot better with it.

142
00:18:52.410 --> 00:19:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's really different. And you notice the it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's that much air, it just barely moves, even down there.

143
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's all full here but dispersed all the way through this long. And so it doesn't really move the belly too much, but we'll you'll be able to see that the the shoulders are not going to be rising up and down.

144
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.710
Right.

145
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.060
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

146
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really different.

147
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice, right. I'm glad you mentioned that. That was, that was the challenge. So let's do a couple of them and your concentration, I would say, Keep your hands on your belly. So I'll do all do some counting

148
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't be counting on the inhale, or the exhale because I can't count breathe. At the same time, haven't figured out that technique.

149
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But I will, I will do. So I'll say, Hold 321

150
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

151
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's so let's exhale all our air out.

152
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's inhale through the nose.

153
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 excellent out your mouth.

154
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale through the nose into the belly.

155
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale it out.

156
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's hold 321. Inhale, big belly.

157
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's hold 321 exhale it out your mouth feeling the air coming out of your mouth. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat belly. Flat. Flat pull it out. Hold it out. And let's inhale through the nose when you're ready.

158
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly ice.

159
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold, hold, hold, exhale it out.

160
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good hold it out for 321 nice inhale. Finally, we get that Aaron yummy, yummy into the belly.

161
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to hold it in there with a full range and 321 push it all out. Feel that cold air warm air coming out your mouth feel it. Nice nice nice nice nice Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat hold it out out out. Inhale in. When you're ready, into that knows

162
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Hold it there. Hold it there. Hold it there. When you're ready, let it out.

163
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And now on your own on your own count just run some cycles through

164
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.660
Ariel Mirabal: Can come on air. Yeah, I can look

165
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Really different hot

166
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So did you notice that you were able to think about the breakfast you had breakfast you want anything else.

167
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:23.550
Ariel Mirabal: Just don't really come like I wasn't focused anymore. And like exactly every, you know, little move is yeah just

168
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Get your mind wander to your to do list.

169
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.940
Ariel Mirabal: No, not at all.

170
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why it didn't believe it or not, your mind does want to do one thing. Well, I know we say multitask is like the cool thing. And I'm so awesome at it.

171
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not we suck at two things at once is what we're doing.

172
00:22:48.540 --> 00:23:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain wants to just do what it wants the our, our brain be like, Oh, I've never seen one of these before it loves novelty, you're like, Hey, what was that, what's this it loves new

173
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Whoo.

174
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're learning something new. You're seeing something you're you're feeling something new. It had your full attention. So that's one thing that's kind of neat course. It's going to habituate over time.

175
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The newness of it. But the reason why I gave the instruction about fidelity, which means doing it exactly with the counting. We try to do it for four seconds. Hold it for four seconds. It's not because I think there's some magic in those that number four. It's because it's hard to do.

176
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.810
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

177
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's supposed to notice how you like it wasn't as hard. Well, I gotta be careful because if it's difficult. It means you're going to be concentrating on it.

178
00:23:47.220 --> 00:24:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a part of me that's like we don't lose that feature, whatever your Countess hold on to it and try to do it that way each time because it takes concentration. And guess what, oh, what about tomorrow. Well, my daughter, my little my sweetheart. What about where I'm living

179
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.490
Ariel Mirabal: Right.

180
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're concentrating trying to do this. Well, it takes your concentration and your mind will just

181
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:21.090
Ariel Mirabal: Exactly yeah zoned in on the stomach thing. You know, I was like, so relax. Definitely not thinking about anything else. But I wasn't so like

182
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:34.230
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know. I was just really relaxed and I was focusing on probably the biggest thing was just making sure that I wasn't like, you know, taking just a big gasps instead, you know, making sure my belly is going out of that so

183
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had this time you had lots of things happening novelty concentration you weren't have dual mind who are literally just concentrating actually on

184
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe you heard my voice. Okay, or something to try and do with this, ladies. Tell me what do these numbers on a train cars. Right. So your mind was all on all these things. I'm trying to sort of put in front of you.

185
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And no time to sort of be distracted by other things. And of course, you already heard the physiological impact the right the the nerve that's being activated there. So you had both

186
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: A top down effect, which is cognitive and we have a visceral bottom up effect, which is neat. So this is just like so amazing.

187
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.290
Ariel Mirabal: I'm going to teach my boyfriend today. Maybe you can count on.

188
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You you perfect it yourself and then pass it along. We do it for our kids when they're feeling just completely emotionally just regulated. Okay, we're going to solve this. But first, let's see if we can

189
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How can we expand that belly. Let's get a big balloon down there. We regulate our bodies we teach and pass this along to our kids know how to

190
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How to regulate their own emotions. It's really exciting. So definitely, we're going to pass that along love that you want to pass that to your, to your husband. Okay.

191
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.490
Ariel Mirabal: We that'd be awesome.

192
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so, um, there's more. But I want to dip a little bit into some some context, in your life, kind of get an understanding of some of your pressures. I heard

193
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard something about a move kind of want to know how you're doing.

194
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:28.320
Ariel Mirabal: I'm we're stable right now, I'm just very thankful that we have family. I'm a little bit of family here to help. I can't even believe we're in this position right now. I never thought that at the age of 31 I would be

195
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:35.460
Ariel Mirabal: With my four year old little girl and staying with parents, you know, it's just it was it was a shock to me.

196
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:44.580
Ariel Mirabal: Still trying to ease to that for a little bit, but things are going well. We're, we're really stable right now. I'm so thankful for that there is a lot of stress.

197
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:59.490
Ariel Mirabal: I just try to right now. I'm trying to stay busy around the house. Make sure you know I get my daughter outside so she can run off for energy, since we can't go anywhere, you know, but as far as the living situation. I'm just, I'm kind of stressed, we're a little

198
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:06.630
Ariel Mirabal: On two ends of what to do here with, you know, well, we have to wait out the coronavirus thing before we can start

199
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:22.380
Ariel Mirabal: You know, getting back into work. Thankfully my boyfriend is is still working. He's a solar installs lead solar installer. So some people rely on solar panels, you know, for their electricity, things like that. So thankfully it was deemed a necessity.

200
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good.

201
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:35.790
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, so we were very, very thankful for that his parents, though the ones we're staying with they're both actually out of work. So we're kind of going to be able to hold it down for them for a little bit.

202
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:46.920
Ariel Mirabal: I haven't been I got my insurance license. Last year I haven't been at work for a couple of months I'm hopefully going to start sometime in April. Crossing my fingers.

203
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:55.200
Ariel Mirabal: So I can start using my insurance. Insurance again. But until then, he's basically the only person working. So it's a little stressful.

204
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.660
Ariel Mirabal: But we're trying to we're definitely we're helping we're helping a lot. So that's makes me feel really good. We're kind of pulling the weight here and helping

205
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.950
Ariel Mirabal: We're just basically here for each other, it was the right time. I guess that this

206
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:17.940
Ariel Mirabal: Kind of happen. So the move thing is when we start trying to like crawl back out and get out there, you know, get our own house. I want to buy a house. I'm really tired of renting, it's really

207
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:24.330
Ariel Mirabal: It's like, you know, it's burning your money every month. So I hate it. I hate when a team. I'm tired of moving to

208
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:33.420
Ariel Mirabal: I just want to find a place to stay there. But that's it. I mean, just kind of waiting this whole thing out until we can start looking for places to rent again.

209
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:44.790
Ariel Mirabal: Unless my credit score. Right. And it was a 641 so it's not too bad. But I'm trying to get it obviously a little bit hired so that we can buy a house. This year I want to buy

210
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned, I'm gonna go grab a blanket. I'm gonna have my air conditioners turned up way too high. I can barely feel my nose. And then I want to, I want to talk to you a little bit about one of your goals that I saw in here and

211
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.190
See what you think about it, okay.

212
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'm gonna get to get to two blankets. Yeah. Yay ACS not so. Okay, I feel better. So, you sound like you're handling, you've got good reframe like okay yeah you know why am I

213
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The sage. I really be at this house, but you can see what also to be grateful for. It sounds like you're able to do both sort of some

214
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Some reframing some positive thoughts and you can find some gratitude. It sounds like

215
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:41.850
Ariel Mirabal: I try to be optimistic about everything because, you know, there's really nothing we can do to change the situation right and

216
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Goodness. I mean, honestly, I'm glad your husband's working

217
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.490
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, thank goodness. Thank goodness. My goodness. Yeah.

218
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to review some of the stuff we talked about when we first met, one of the things was

219
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase exercise. I want to become a gym member the timing on that for now might be a little off.

220
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, you know, I don't even know. Places like that, or even open because

221
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if we just amended it for a little while until our global crisis is over.

222
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What would feel like.

223
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What would feel like progress for you. In other words, you said increase exercise which we've gotta do.

224
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta be in motion. These bodies were made promotion that's supposed to lay in bed and kind of keep moving and grooving so many good things happen actually saw our brain continues to not atrophy. We've got to exercise. It's really important.

225
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Brain growth hormone so

226
00:30:53.790 --> 00:31:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: How much exercise do you do currently. So let's get a baseline and then I want you to see how you would be able to say, Okay, I think I could reach this much exercise.

227
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, let's say we said it for a month. And you could say, all right, I did it I reach this goal, how much you exercising now and how much would you like to exercise increase it to your weekly

228
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:30.180
Ariel Mirabal: Right now, and I basically I'm always on my feet around the house. I've got my daughter. So if I'm not cleaning doing dishes cooking or building clothes. I am playing with her. So I'm pretty active

229
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:40.680
Ariel Mirabal: With her. But as far as you know like jogging and stuff. I don't go running. I used to be a runner. When I was really young I loved it so it kind of

230
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:55.200
Ariel Mirabal: I feel like that's something that I want to try to get back to I know that running and cardio is really good for your heart and your health and things. I would love to start doing that. But right now I just every day, once a day, I take my dog for a walk. That's really

231
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to run, but maybe that might be something. Are you saying you might look at it in six months, maybe or something.

232
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:13.170
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, I could start jogging even like my dog always wants to run, of course, he's a boxer. He's always wanting to run. And I'm like, No, no, slow down. I just want to walk, you know, and I feel like why

233
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:18.300
Ariel Mirabal: Why am I like that. No, I'm just, I'm 31. Am I getting old. Am I just try not

234
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:32.850
Ariel Mirabal: Do I not want to run anymore. Like I just, I don't understand. I can't call myself lazy. I don't think I'm a new person, but I just feel like something's happened over time. I don't feel, you know, I just don't have the, what is that like the the motivation, the

235
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:42.060
Ariel Mirabal: Like the self discipline to just, you know what I mean, to just get up and run the day by myself. Maybe I need to have somebody with me to do it. I don't know. I don't know.

236
00:32:42.660 --> 00:33:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can further we can explore that. But remember, this is a goal you identified so it was increase exercise. What would feel like yep I did it I increase exercise, not the way I define it, not the way your husband, not a friend you, what do you want to see.

237
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:12.840
Ariel Mirabal: I want to see myself and again after probably after this crisis is over, I would like to see myself consistently going to the gym at least three times a week.

238
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.750
Ariel Mirabal: I would love to do that, see myself doing that at least three times a week. Okay.

239
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So as far as the this coming month I wrote that one down. Um, but crisis. I'm assuming we're talking about

240
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.160
The

241
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what the heck is that cold, the

242
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.580
Ariel Mirabal: Vaccine

243
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is discovered right I'm assuming that's what we're saying we're talking about the same thing. Well, that's an unknown right so I'm talking right now about you and your exercise. Currently, just do you want to see any change.

244
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:57.990
Ariel Mirabal: Um, well right now as far as being at home. I guess maybe trying to

245
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:14.730
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know how much change. I could really make as far as unless it's just running, you know, because I'm I do a lot here at home with my daughter. So I guess really the only change. I just want to start going to the gym. I can't really as far as exercising.

246
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:26.400
Ariel Mirabal: There's not really a lot more that I want to do here other than just continuing to maybe take my daughter for walks with my dog and things. Maybe we can just because we do it every evening so

247
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:37.890
Ariel Mirabal: We try to stay active. That way, but I don't know, maybe just trying to think about more activities to do at home with my daughter as opposed to it inside all the time because we're inside a lot

248
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:49.020
Ariel Mirabal: We're outside. But we, I kind of, I feel like we do, we do chalk when we're outside we she rides her bike. We have a few bikes. So she rides her bike that's another thing she does.

249
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:58.080
Ariel Mirabal: I'm just like, I need to expand my mind a little bit and try to do things because I'm always doing things with her that the same stuff all the time in the backyard.

250
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:05.190
Ariel Mirabal: That we normally do we paint and die. We do arts and crafts we polar, but I want to maybe expand things and try to do things with her that

251
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:15.810
Ariel Mirabal: Like, look up new things to do and get new ideas and try to do stuff with her, you know, like teach her how to play I we just did soccer. She hasn't really done soccer very often.

252
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:27.660
Ariel Mirabal: So we did soccer. The other day in the backyard. That was kind of new. But I wanted to do other things. You know, I'm just, I have a hard time expanding my mind ideas for

253
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be it. So I think for now we're going to pull these apart your goal as you stated it increase exercise. I want to become a gym member that is set for April 18 let's change that goal. I'm going to push it to like June for now.

254
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.320
And

255
00:35:50.790 --> 00:36:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So that when the topic comes up because I review these every month there won't be. This will have you got a gym membership, it won't be like that, it'll be more like this.

256
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to write a

257
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Write a new one, right, a new goal.

258
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.170
Ariel Mirabal: A goal to

259
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:10.740
Oh,

260
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.640
Ariel Mirabal: Oh wait till you're done though if you're

261
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to research, I think I heard you say want to research more fun.

262
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Activities to do with my daughter.

263
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.070
Pinterest.

264
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:32.880
Okay.

265
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, so we're gonna that's a goal. And then there's some actions which I would call a objectives.

266
00:36:43.170 --> 00:37:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And that objectives client will. So this is where it comes down to. Hmm, well what's gotten in the way of you using let's say the internet to look up things or is it talk to people about it. What do you think's gotten in the way of getting

267
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: More knowing more activities.

268
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:19.590
Ariel Mirabal: Um, honestly I think right now stress in my day to day life because when my daughter was first born I was that mom like I feel like when I say that. Mom, I'm still I still feel like I'm a really good mom. I'm a great mother.

269
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:26.460
Ariel Mirabal: I love my daughter and I'm always playing, you know, we're always doing something together but

270
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:37.110
Ariel Mirabal: I just, I feel like before I, excuse me, I got a little bit deeper into the alcohol that also got in the way. Was my addiction to alcohol and the opiates as well.

271
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:44.910
Ariel Mirabal: As much as I always thought that the opiates weren't changing me at all or getting in the way, for any reason, they kind of where they would make me a more tired.

272
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:50.400
Ariel Mirabal: And after a while, I started noticing that those things and how my addiction was getting in the way.

273
00:37:50.730 --> 00:38:02.610
Ariel Mirabal: My stress. I was just starting to get more stressed about things that I couldn't keep up on bills, you know, stuff like that. So, things just started going downhill. And I remember the way I used to be and I compare myself.

274
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:08.940
Ariel Mirabal: Right now to how I was when my daughter was about one years old, one year old because I was

275
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:17.880
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, I was the same person. And I was so much different. I was always just so i was i was so much more attentive.

276
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:29.400
Ariel Mirabal: And right now I feel like I'm very attentive but i like i said i remember how I was before I had these ideas of what to do with her all the time, new ideas. I was always on Pinterest and

277
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:38.040
Ariel Mirabal: Looking at things to do. I would make. I had a mulberry tree in my backyard. I went and picked him all berries and we made a mulberry pie in the kitchen. You know, I would do stuff like that. And it's like,

278
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:49.050
Ariel Mirabal: What happened to me. I'm not the same person. I don't. It feels like I'm not the same person. I don't do those things anymore, nothing fun comes out of me. Like, no new ideas like a religion that's

279
00:38:49.470 --> 00:39:00.420
Ariel Mirabal: It's always the same things every day, like, Hey, let's go outside religion ride a bike or let's go swing and let's go do chalk. I'm starting to feel like she's she needs something else. You know, so

280
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Why one way for us to look is we can say the goal is to get to research more

281
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What keeps you and I heard you. I heard you say stress, I heard you just had this recent move

282
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But what is something that you could do more of over the next couple weeks that might result in having some more creative ideas. What, what are some actions, you could take

283
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:36.450
Ariel Mirabal: Um, I mean, I don't get on Pinterest, because I feel like I'm always running around like a chicken with no head doing things. So maybe I can just try to

284
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:49.050
Ariel Mirabal: This is what I'm encountering blurred to I'm trying to slow down my mind. So I'm not always running a million miles an hour, and I, I need to be able to like we were just talking about with the breathing thing I need to be able to just like just

285
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:55.650
Ariel Mirabal: Just calm down sometimes and block out all of these running thoughts and like you know

286
00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:05.220
Ariel Mirabal: Not everything has to be done at once, you know, just take it day by day, just calm down, everything's going to come together. I just always want everything to be fixed. Right now, you know, like

287
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:15.180
Ariel Mirabal: It's just, I'm a very impatient person, I feel like. And that's another goal I have, I really need to patients with my daughter.

288
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:25.800
Ariel Mirabal: I don't want to be the parent that uses flies off the handle after she for five after five seconds, you know, and just yell at her, you know i don't i don't spank her. I'm not

289
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:34.470
Ariel Mirabal: That kind of a parent. I try not to. It's usually like a slap on the hand or, you know, things like that. But I've noticed that sometimes lately.

290
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:40.080
Ariel Mirabal: When I get. And I noticed, like if I'm stressed or not. It's like if she does something wrong.

291
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:48.180
Ariel Mirabal: I'm monitoring. It's supposed to be teaching them you know you did something wrong. Don't do it again. Now she's 14 and she's getting to the point where

292
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:56.100
Ariel Mirabal: You know she's got her little people call it the terrible twos, but I never had terrible twos with her. She has an awesome kid. The whole time until well now she's

293
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:02.820
Ariel Mirabal: Working she's starting to she's pushing the patients, you know, she'll do things immediately after you can learn how to do it.

294
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:13.620
Ariel Mirabal: And she'll push it and then now we're at his parents. So they're here to see everything. And it's, I think that frustrates me so much more sometimes because I'm trying to discipline my daughter. And then I have

295
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:20.760
Ariel Mirabal: Like his mom is over here I can see her just standing in the corner watching you know and I feel, I feel

296
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:31.320
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know, I just feel like embarrassed. Like, I don't want to. I don't want to discipline. My daughter in front of people. I don't want to be even. I don't even want to get angry at her.

297
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:40.920
Ariel Mirabal: But that's my problem is, I'm supposed to be showing her hey that's bad. Don't do it. I'm not supposed to be showing her that I'm mad at her. I don't want her to think I'm mad at her, you know,

298
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:48.960
Ariel Mirabal: I don't want her to feel that, but she does, because I do get angry at her. I just want her to know I'm not angry at you. I'm just what you did.

299
00:41:49.860 --> 00:42:03.960
Ariel Mirabal: And I have a hard time not getting so upset. I just, I don't know what it is, but even when I tell myself. Don't get so mad. Don't get so mad like two seconds later, I'm like, no, don't do that. Stop like and you know and I get so upset.

300
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:13.350
Ariel Mirabal: And right afterwards. I feel so bad. And I'll, I'll wait a few minutes, and she's in trouble and she's crying and then I'll go pick her up and give her a hug and kiss, and I'll tell her I'm sorry. It's okay.

301
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:20.550
Ariel Mirabal: You know, don't cry. I'm so sorry that I got mad at you, honey. But you got to listen to mom and I'll try to give her love and explained to her.

302
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:33.120
Ariel Mirabal: You know why I, you know, speaking to her, or why I got upset with her or something. But for some reason, I just feel so terrible inside for getting so upset. I always feel so terrible afterwards always

303
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.060
Ariel Mirabal: I just that.

304
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So the behavior that you would like to see less of what would it be

305
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.460
Ariel Mirabal: It would be

306
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.640
Ariel Mirabal: Me raising my voice daughter.

307
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.530
Ariel Mirabal: I want to be able to not, I want to be able to gain more patients with her.

308
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so behaviorally you'll be able to measure client will decrease yelling. That's the behavior you want to decrease. That's the one.

309
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:14.730
Ariel Mirabal: I was probably multiple I just can't think of the right words to use right now. Um,

310
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What about something you said something you do with your voice. Is there anything else you do with your body that you want us to decrease

311
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.540
Ariel Mirabal: Um,

312
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.690
Ariel Mirabal: I don't do anything else at raising my voice and maybe

313
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:47.880
Ariel Mirabal: The way that I look, I don't really know how to say that. But the way that I look the way that I express my emotions, even through my face okay mad at her, you know, like, I don't want to be scary. I don't want to scare her and be

314
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.340
Ariel Mirabal: You know, I just want to teach her. I want to teach her and I want her because I've noticed that

315
00:43:53.820 --> 00:44:01.470
Ariel Mirabal: She's very different with my boyfriend's mom and of course that's grandma, my mom, I get it. The kids are always different with Grandma, but

316
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:12.450
Ariel Mirabal: She is a little different. She has more patience and she has a different way about who when railing. My daughter's name is Caitlin been railing listener and she does something my grandmother will just

317
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:24.810
Ariel Mirabal: You know it. Okay, I'll leave you alone and you know she'll do things like that. And so when other things come up and railings and a big screaming fit or something and Arlene will have some kind of a way to calm her down.

318
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.440
Ariel Mirabal: A lot quicker than I can, because I'll go over there and try to calm my daughter down and tell her. Okay then, you know,

319
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:45.780
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know if I'm just not saying the right things, but I make her even more mad. She gets more mad, and she starts screaming at me like at her mom screaming at her mother right in front of grandma and grandpa. And I'm just sitting here like I just want to cry.

320
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.490
Ariel Mirabal: Oh, so my knowing I'm sorry.

321
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:51.870
I know

322
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:57.450
Ariel Mirabal: Has made her. It's like she picked it up and now she goes back at me.

323
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's

324
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.370
Ariel Mirabal: I'm feeling like it's I feel like it's my fault that she

325
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.330
Ariel Mirabal: But she acts like this. Sometimes

326
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:17.970
Ariel Mirabal: That's why some people can like even my wife and she did it last night and my boyfriend came out and he picked her up and he said, Honey, it's okay.

327
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:26.040
Ariel Mirabal: You know, you need to calm down. And for some reason, as soon as he picks her up. She just she called it down right away you know she knows she did something wrong. And she's in trouble. But it's like

328
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:39.780
Ariel Mirabal: She's okay but she hates me for whatever's just happened, you know, and then when I try to, for whatever anything else happened. She's mad at her Barbie doll or something she gets she gets really upset. She has a

329
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:52.980
Ariel Mirabal: short temper, just like I do. So she gets upset with something that happens with something and she gets really upset, like just brings it on the floor or something. And I'll go to try to help her. And like I said, I just, I just don't know.

330
00:45:54.030 --> 00:46:04.920
Ariel Mirabal: Maybe it's me. I don't know if I'm, I'm not. I don't have the right type of patients for when she's doing those things I'll say the right things to her. I don't know what it is, but she just gets more mad and she'll just start screaming

331
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:12.870
Ariel Mirabal: At me and telling me go away. Mom Get away from me, you know, and she she doesn't act like that with other people, very often, so

332
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's do a couple of those breaths and let's let's let that the magic of this work in real time. So notice that you're you're you're talking about something really important

333
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some of that breathing just on your own terms just breathing it into the belly.

334
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Making sure you're breathing again mindfully down into the bottom of the lung.

335
00:46:53.880 --> 00:47:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm and hold it for even a few seconds. And when you're ready, then just slowly exhale super slow

336
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:07.800
Hold it out if you can

337
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:09.870
Bring it in.

338
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:17.880
Ariel Mirabal: Already

339
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: deep belly breath. There it is.

340
00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

341
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So just even this amount. And yes, you had someone arrived, but just even, even where you were two seconds ago to where you are now just sort of falling back and forth and see see what's different between how you were feeling physically and emotionally compared to even now that tiny change.

342
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:57.900
Ariel Mirabal: A lot more. I feel better already. It definitely helps.

343
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I want to tell you what you what you're bringing up is obviously very meaningful for you, your relationship with your daughter, the importance of you.

344
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Teaching her something. And what if you're teaching her son, something you don't want to be teaching her. What if you're responsible somehow for this yelling and

345
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can hear all of that self blaming and now I've got witnesses to it. And what are they thinking about me and right us getting really complicated because there's these other people here.

346
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And why is she not crying with them and how she treated in that Barbie doll. And why can't I see with my daughter so lots. This is a complicated phenomena.

347
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not

348
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not worried

349
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, Well, I don't care. I know you, lady. A good for you.

350
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.190
But

351
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason I'm not worried is because you named it, it means it's not unconscious. It means you're saying is it me

352
00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it her look at the difference, you're conscious you're awake. You're seeing whatever pieces of this that you can, you're trying it on to see am I responsible for this and you came in here and said, You know what, when

353
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there might be some goals around. I want to be more patient. I know I want to teach this particular behavior to my daughter, but in reality.

354
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm short tempered, I find myself with a face that it's not what I want to communicate. I want to have a teaching face, but I have an angry face.

355
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK. So the reason I'm not worried is because you're already far along into the self awareness into the humility that it's going to take to quickly make changes.

356
00:49:48.180 --> 00:50:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you already are aware of your voice, you're already aware that your face is doing something that sending a message to her that you don't want that's already advanced

357
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so give yourself credit for that you have insight you, it may still feel like I can inhibit the impulse to urgently address whatever infraction, she's made. But still you're able to talk about it now. And that's a big deal. The fact that you're able to do that is really cool.

358
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the actual phenomenon, the etiology of it. I don't know yet. I don't know what it is. I don't know if what's happened

359
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be a combination of maybe some pieces of early childhood stuff some conditioning that we can we can delve into and it also could be that you've done.

360
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: neurologically some you've done a little damage with the with the alcohol and you download damage in there. So, but that heals. Thank goodness for neural plasticity. Our brain grows back. So it grows and we're going to get better and so that impulse control part

361
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

362
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you just learned something that will create time. So if it's about impulse. Let's say the carpet, you know, let's say it's that fast. I'm

363
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.070
Ariel Mirabal: Thought you were talking to your dog.

364
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.360
Right.

365
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in here.

366
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is out there making it up but but my I was role modeling and saying, yeah, our redirection is almost instantaneous as soon as we see an infraction, are you noticing it happens that fast like

367
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're cutting. Yeah.

368
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you just learn something that can be used all over the place. It can be used for our own emotional regulation, it can be used to

369
00:51:48.810 --> 00:52:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: prepare ourselves for a difficult conversation. It can be used for soon as you get consciousness in the morning, sort of this sort of meditative state. It can be used all kinds of places. The more you practice it during the day. Let's say you practice it 10 times a day.

370
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Three times, I'll take three you then you do 10 then you forget you're doing it, you're doing so often. So the more you do it, the more what this one because I'm only touching one new skill.

371
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This one thing can be used for what we're talking about right now, which is this relationship with daughter, it's

372
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Anytime you are about to walk into a room. Anytime you hear a loud crash screech any kind of sound you do at least one cycle. So let. Now if you think someone's bleeding, obviously, you know, you're going to go, you're going to go

373
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm not talking about that stuff.

374
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the kid falls, don't sit there and breathe. First is

375
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.390
Ariel Mirabal: Running. Yeah.

376
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not, I'm not an unreasonable.

377
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But

378
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you get my idea like, Oh, she just colored on the wall.

379
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, don't

380
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that so it's the colors already on the wall, the dishes already broken the food is already spilled. And if it's not glass and someone's walking in there. So if I can wait so

381
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can possibly pull this off as soon as the thing happens.

382
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The perceived threat is going to be almost instantaneous like this is going to be a problem. You know, this is the problem. She's doing something they shouldn't do. If you can get in the habit of breathing. So it would be about this much time so

383
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That much time just passed. I took a breath. It was a mindful breath I breathe in, breathe out. That's it. Too much time. I mean,

384
00:53:50.520 --> 00:54:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: She may have taken a couple extra steps, but by then guess what happens because I regulated my otherwise really activated body all the blood was rushing to my large muscle groups.

385
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it made its way into this part of my brain and also the left side, which is where we have stored information on

386
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You can remember things better. You're going to remember cool techniques up. Remember, remember, I want to be a teacher.

387
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I turn this into a learning environment. What it's going to do is it's going to give you this amazing thing called time

388
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Time to remember that breath does just

389
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey baby, and now I find my rest I find my sweet tongue at what's going on. What happened, I can find it.

390
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I come at it there. I come at it from concern.

391
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus

392
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger. Anger.

393
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.060
Yeah.

394
00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

395
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to we can get into the whole phenomenon of what's really the distress underneath.

396
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But this breath thing could make the difference because you may already because remember you said, I used to be able to be more patient used to kind of do this a little bit better before

397
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What the breath might do without even learning any new cognitive pieces or parenting skills or something you probably already have them in there.

398
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's remembering how mother in law sounded or did like this morning.

399
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey baby cakes. What's up, you know how much you want that breath will give you time to remember

400
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's all you need. And then, so you'll be you'll be in a relaxed body, the muscles will have relaxed your walk over your tone won't be as tense, you'll speak to her, probably in a little calmer tone and guess what your daughter will notice

401
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an interesting thing. We have also science has this these mirror neurons that have you ever been around someone who's kind of anxious and you're like, I do not like being around this person, I feel it. Oh.

402
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That yeah

403
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if you're some of that's really like confident and like kind of relax and you're like, I'm gonna I'm gonna hang out with them. Makes me feel good to

404
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: works the other way around to and children, children respond to our parents emotions. So, and we to them. So if we regulate

405
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be.

406
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What my daughter can feel I want my daughter to fill regulated. I'm going to, I'm going to be regulated around her. So she mirrors that so I'm going to be regulated. Then I'm going to go in the room and be like,

407
00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh do that mess. What's up at that, huh, you need some help. Yeah, I don't know how you talk to her. I sound just a goofball. So

408
00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of different lots of voices.

409
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.100
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I try to make her laugh as much as I can.

410
00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You supposed to have for cookies. The most to

411
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how to counter for. So lots of play. So you remember play, that's great. But you'll remember play. And that's your in

412
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's just another opportunity.

413
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To have a game. It's just another game.

414
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just stick with the mirror neuron concept. Let's just stick with that other people will say they'll call

415
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm an empath or they'll say, I am I'm empathetic. I have compassion. I really feel for other people. I'm very sensitive. So there's some other words that people sort of like, Yeah, I kind of get rich talking about

416
00:57:53.220 --> 00:58:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But children have it too. So maybe your daughter is on your tension, you're picking up on her. Is it just keeps you guys just back and forth and back and forth, and so she

417
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she can't regulate with you because somehow she sensing

418
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:19.860
Ariel Mirabal: All the tension me. Yeah. Like, I'm so frustrated and then she gets even more upset and starts like

419
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:30.870
Ariel Mirabal: Calling for her dad or something. She'll do that even sometimes and I feel like that's exactly what it is because she feels that I'm angry and it's making her more upset so

420
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm wrong about this hypothesis we can come at it from another angle. But that wouldn't surprise me because I'm we can do an experiment, if you want to you can be like, Okay, Imma try this freedom.

421
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.950
Ariel Mirabal: Thing. It sounds like that's exactly what it is.

422
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it can, if it's true, it, the, it will make it the change will be pretty quick, you'll start to see a real difference and you'll knock on the door like in a gummy.

423
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to come in, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, and you'll come in and

424
00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:06.960
Like

425
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, talking about something.

426
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:13.740
Yeah.

427
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I noticed that the toys are still on the floor.

428
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:23.850
Ariel Mirabal: Right.

429
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you are you

430
00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:25.830
Not enough

431
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Um, but, so then we we ask a question we we lean, we have the time compassion and interest, ask a question instead of needing to be right we lean into curiosity.

432
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We did, we still wanting to play with them. Is that why you didn't put them away, or did you have a plan, or I mean I know sometimes I forget. Did you forget because

433
00:59:52.920 --> 01:00:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm good at remembering sometimes kids aren't so good at remembering mommies and daddies are much better remembering things because kids, they want to go off and they play with the next fun thing.

434
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that you, is it that you forgot. Yeah, forgot. Okay, well let's go put them away together. Okay, so that's one piece. Now that could go sideways like many different drum

435
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:21.270
Ariel Mirabal: Sounds know like she's getting to the point now where she thinks it's funny to me know some when I tried to get her to do stuff. And it's really hard sometimes like she

436
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:32.190
Ariel Mirabal: She threw a fit yesterday morning, because, I mean, it's usually all the time and she hates one brush your hair. She hates it. Mom. I'll be really gentle, I promise. And she just hates it. He hates her hair being brush. She just hates it.

437
01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.890
Ariel Mirabal: So it's like a fight every day when I have to brush your hair.

438
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:41.880
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, every day or every night when we get out of the bathtub or every just every time I brush your hair. She gets set and it's always a no.

439
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:48.720
Ariel Mirabal: And that's when the fighting starts. It's like I feel like sometimes I'm literally fighting with my daughter fighting with a little four year olds, because I'm

440
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:49.860
Ariel Mirabal: Trying to get her to

441
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:59.520
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, I'm like, you know, what do I do, whether you like it or not, I'm gonna brush your hair you know it's getting to that point because she just so I don't even know what to do.

442
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:07.110
Ariel Mirabal: When it comes to, like, to the point where she has to do something, but she's not letting me do it. You know what I mean, like,

443
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.690
Ariel Mirabal: Let's hold it down.

444
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's

445
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have a lot a lot of time we move pretty quickly. We but hey, we got some good stuff here. So,

446
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: One part of this is if it's true that we're onto something with the I will be physically, emotionally, what I want my daughter to be

447
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I want her to feel in her own tiny little four year old body calm, confident, relaxed regulated. I'll be that. So we can start there. That's a big one, because I'm imagining right the additional pressure of having witnesses to your distress and all the stress was going

448
01:01:52.440 --> 01:02:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: On I get the embarrassment piece but you know with this you might like it. Now you'll have witnesses to. And they might say, well, what you doing, and I just work just taking a deep breath.

449
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of and I'm going to be teaching this to my daughter to, kind of, you know, learning how to really do it well myself wondering if maybe she's copycatting me so I'm coming at it a little differently.

450
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to go talk to her. So when you talk to her. And then there's calmer voices and there's a lot to do. There's a lot that comes after this. There's naming what you're doing, you know, mommy's taking a deep breath, you want to take one with me.

451
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.740
Ariel Mirabal: But my teacher also

452
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: gets old, though, so we got to put a pin in it, but that thing you said just now, about a good a brush your hair. Regardless, so

453
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I want to know.

454
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For you Arielle the importance of brushed hair seems to be really important

455
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something really important going on for your four year old, and I wonder right at that point.

456
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you guys clash something's really important to you and it's really important to her, and it seems to be happening around the brush hair.

457
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that it's she wants her hair tangled. I think she wants to feel something and saying no to you will get it for her. So let me say that again. I think your daughter wants to feel something. And so she's using know

458
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To brushing hair in order to feel something. And I wonder if it's

459
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: She gets to say notice something or she gets to feel independent or she gets to push back she gets to feel confident smart, capable, I have no idea.

460
01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But we human beings, regardless of our age, we want to feel a particular way. Happy strong something that's what we're motivated by your daughter's motivated by something obviously very unconscious, but you as an adult with the couple minutes we have left. What do you want to feel

461
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: With her hair beautifully combed. What will you feel

462
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:26.130
Ariel Mirabal: Well, I feel

463
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:26.940
Uh huh.

464
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.010
Ariel Mirabal: No, I mean,

465
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:37.890
Ariel Mirabal: Better accomplished and just want to make sure that she

466
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:45.150

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's your that's your part. So when you because you'll run into it the next few days. This is where your power can come from. It's a little fresh, it can be all breeze. And then this this kind of conversation might come to memory might remember it and think

482
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I know I want to feel proud as a mom. And that's my business. So watch this. This is tricky because you think a four year old what what know so I stay on my side.

483
01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to feel like a good mom my daughter will have this pretty hair. I'm good. I'm attentive. I helped her with your princess outfit.

484
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, she her heads all Raggedy she has a cute outfit. Oh, I don't feel like the best mom if she's like halfway costume job.

485
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch the difference. That's about you, Mom. So here's we put, if this is happening. I could be really wrong. It could be very off here. But if this is it. Then we back off and we were like this. She asked me to do her hair.

486
01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's me wanting to feel like a good mom right now that's about my agenda, me, me, me, but your daughter is feeling fancy dancy in our little outfit and she don't want to do with the hair so she might be having her own even though she's four years old. She's got her own need

487
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To know what's wild, but they do as little critters. Remember when you were little, you had your own opinion. You remember how people would be like, aren't you cute, you're like,

488
01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

489
01:07:59.250 --> 01:07:59.550
Yeah.

490
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, I'm not just here to be cared for you, let me alone. You don't we have our own. We actually have our own little opinions and feelings, even that little

491
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And so she's like fancy dancy beautiful cute look her up and you're thinking, well, I could do her hair like gorgeous. But that's not where she's at

492
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:27.180
Ariel Mirabal: She just wants to play and where her little dress. Yeah, I get it.

493
01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. So, so she's in the space. Maybe I'm guessing. I'm pretty look at look at I'm doing this and this and then you're like,

494
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:38.850
Ariel Mirabal: You know need to do her hair and yeah

495
01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it could be heard from a four year old. I'm not enough just just the way I am. I'm not enough just cute and wonderful just like this.

496
01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: With my hair.

497
01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this.

498
01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.120
Ariel Mirabal: I don't want to become and

499
01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's hard for us parents to say, whoa.

500
01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Make it better. I can make it better, better, better, better, better, better, but that's for our need

501
01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When we give our little ones permission.

502
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To be just right, even when they're kind of Katie Wallace the unconditional love that the shows them is just

503
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's such a gift, but it does mean that we have to stay on our side of the emotional fence and kind of in a sense mind our own business. Like, literally, like

504
01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Is this my knee or her Nietzsche and asked me to do her hair. Oh. Oh my gosh. Everybody's going to think of a terrible Mom, look at she's got two different thoughts on you know I'm right. That's our need for our daughter to look like good so that

505
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We just look like

506
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I don't know. I don't know if I'm on anything. Let me

507
01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just check in with you before we head out today. Once you to look inside and just notice this quiet rhythm, just see what came up

508
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's important for you out of this discussion today.

509
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:18.240
Ariel Mirabal: Oh good, actually. I think that you are a lot of that is right. It's not a huge thing for me too.

510
01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:26.160
Ariel Mirabal: I'm not I care more about the way my daughter feels then about the way other people think about me, for instance, I care more about

511
01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:30.930
Ariel Mirabal: Her feelings towards me when he feels about herself. I care more about that.

512
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:43.050
Ariel Mirabal: Than I do about people, but I do know that it is still a factor because the things you said about like, you know, I'm not going to get myself all dressed and ready inheritor and everything and let my daughter come out with me with her.

513
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:50.670
Ariel Mirabal: Hair all crazy and, you know, two different socks. I would never do that. Of course I would want to, you know, when we're going out somewhere.

514
01:10:51.330 --> 01:11:04.050
Ariel Mirabal: And it's true. You're right about that because she doesn't care about getting all dressed up fancy shoes hair. Perfect. Nice. She just want to. I'm sure she wants to just look you, and let's go have fun, let's go play, you know, we're going

515
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:20.190
Ariel Mirabal: You know co going all out and everything that's definitely part of me as a mom thinking, oh, she's gonna look so cute. You know, like everybody that sees her, you know, she's so cute. Of course, that's definitely something as far as

516
01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:37.080
Ariel Mirabal: Her though I do. I know that it's my main concern is just the way that she feels about herself and even in front of people. I want her to feel confidence and I want her to feel beautiful. And I want her to feel good about herself, you know,

517
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So she feels pretty

518
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I put put yourself in in her little shoes to picture aren't there days when you're like, I am just, I just want to go. Want to go and I don't have to get us up. Just want to go, you know,

519
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.950
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, absolutely.

520
01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, times, you know, because that that connection between what other people think hasn't really sunk into a four year old. So they're just like, I just, I want to go from point A to point B, what difference does it make, what I look like.

521
01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's us adults as socialized critters.

522
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:14.490
Ariel Mirabal: Right.

523
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And and every family is different and you'll find your comfortable space around that. But if she's happy and feeling good. We can name it. What is that what is the difference, you could play with that one, too. You know what

524
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be being a little, a little silly. Um, can we find an in between, you still have your jammies on

525
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Adults LOOK AT MOMMY'S kind of sideways like if we don't put our kids in close is there. You got two shirts. You got this, and closed ended choices are nice because then they only choose from those two things. Do you want to wear the pink dress or the blue t shirt and the flip flops.

526
01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We can name it, we can say this is about me, right, because we don't want to blame them. It's we name it and say this is my thing. It's like

527
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, when we go out

528
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Adults LOOK AT MOMMY'S when their kids are in jammies and they kind of look out and like, like I'm a bad mom or something. So can we pick between putting this on or that on and then they have to choose those two options, or do you want to do.

529
01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the low ponytail, just to sort of bunch it up or do you want to actually comment on the way over, and I'll put it in a ponytail forced choice so

530
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: See, there's actually a lot of other things to do in between, not getting done getting done. There's nuances in there. There's little tiny choices, where she can feel a sense of efficacy

531
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:48.660
Ariel Mirabal: And it all dances around patients. I really need to have patience to be

532
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.100
Ariel Mirabal: Able to slow down and

533
01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.450
Ariel Mirabal: Do those things. Okay.

534
01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll get it if the breath.

535
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because really,

536
01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:02.310
Ariel Mirabal: I'm really going to do that practice that today. I mean, all day. This just happened yesterday with

537
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:07.920
Ariel Mirabal: Some it's still pretty fresh in the mind and all that. So I'm going to be trying that today.

538
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it'll create enough time and by time. I mean, sometimes fraction of a second is on the

539
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.690
Ariel Mirabal: It really

540
01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens that fast, you're like,
