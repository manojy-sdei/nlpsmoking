00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.340
Jaime C: You

2
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.110
I am good.

3
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You are at home. It looks like right

4
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.010
Jaime C: So my my mess behind me.

5
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: any attention to that.

6
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.810
Jaime C: Oh,

7
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.210
Jaime C: You run around packing and stuff today so not looking my hottest or anything.

8
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Packing tell me, tell me about what the next trip is

9
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.370
Jaime C: So,

10
00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:12.300
Jaime C: Um, so I did apply for that Denver property and everything sounded very promising that regional over there said I was a good fit for it that the property has done nothing but bad get better since I was there. And so I applied for it and had total plans to go to Denver.

11
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.210
Jaime C: And at the same time I was the last week I was there in Denver, my, my boss from here. My GM and my regional

12
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.580
Jaime C: Said that they need that the airport property in Albuquerque. They needed that GM so that that property went on the market, a year ago.

13
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.240
Jaime C: They offered that JAMA severance package. He didn't take it. So he just found another job and and went to marry out somewhere. And that was a couple weeks ago so that hotel doesn't have a jam at all.

14
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.540
Jaime C: So I was in Denver. That's what they were talking to me about is when you get back, we might need you to cover that property.

15
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.640
Jaime C: And so

16
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.610
Jaime C: I thought it was just going to be, you know, like temporary coverage but what they're offering as an interim GM

17
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.860
Jaime C: But I told them. So, which is covering the property until it sells

18
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:18.420
Jaime C: But I told them. Instead, we do have to put it in the contract that I get to stay with the company and transfer that I'm not accepting a severance package and so they have agreed agreed to that. But it seems like my boss here.

19
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:30.630
Jaime C: At that's what they're pushing and so the next thing I know, after my boss says that she's had these conversations with both regionals and her boss.

20
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:45.840
Jaime C: That she said that I need to not count on Cherry Creek and that there's three floating jams in that other region that need permanent places. And so they're obligated to fit them in there first.

21
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.570
Jaime C: And so it was definitely a little disappointing. I feel like my boss.

22
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.310
Jaime C: Feel like she

23
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.420
Jaime C: Was not looking out for me in that, in that instance, I feel like she

24
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.000
Jaime C: I don't know what it was. I think that I don't think she was ready to not have an assistant yet.

25
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.730
Jaime C: As soon as I came back. She hasn't been on property since I've been back to Denver. She's been taking time off.

26
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.920
Jaime C: And so

27
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:33.270
Jaime C: I think that's, I never would have thought that she would do something like that. But that's how it feels right, it feels like she was pushing that airport property, even though that's not the best for, for me, I don't think, but

28
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But does it make her look good, that she saw a difficult problem with a really competent person maybe

29
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. She's not advocating so much for you anymore. Now she's kind of just kind of doing her own thing for herself.

30
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.700
Jaime C: Maybe

31
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.930
Jaime C: I don't know what it seems like to me it. That's how it feels. That's what it looks like, because I kept telling her

32
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:09.360
Jaime C: I understand there's a position open here, but I have my heart set on Cherry Creek I've grown to attach that to the attached to the team is attached to me. You know, I just that property has a lot of potential and we could have done a lot with it.

33
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.090
Jaime C: So,

34
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:24.660
Jaime C: I, I am going to take the the interim GM position here and but it's okay because I get the GM pay, so I'll be making quite a bit more

35
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.920
Jaime C: And when something does open, it's gonna be a lot easier for me to transfer laterally.

36
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

37
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm excited for you. I mean,

38
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.820
Jaime C: You're excited you're not exactly what I wanted. But it's still promotion and still bettering myself.

39
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.010
Yeah.

40
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, I wonder if you'll ever know what was going on with this woman. I don't know.

41
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.690
Jaime C: Right.

42
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: She may have some pressures that we may never be informed on no

43
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.910
Jaime C: I have realized, you know, the last couple weeks I realized how truly controlling that woman is

44
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:20.310
Jaime C: You know, her, her and her daughter weren't talking for a couple months because her daughter's 22 and started dating a 47 year old man look older than my boss.

45
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:30.600
Jaime C: But they quit talking for a couple months and then her daughter came around rotor this giant letter about how she wants her mom back in her life. But she said in these boundaries with her mom.

46
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:46.800
Jaime C: She when she's talking to me about this is when I realized how truly controlling she is and you know she was reading that letter, and I thought it was a positive letter, but she got so angry and just wanted nothing to do with her daughter, because their daughters, try to set these boundaries.

47
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

48
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.000
Jaime C: It's like I'm not going to just take the crumbs of her life. She needs to spend more time with me than just an hour a day like

49
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.030
Jaime C: I don't know. It just showed me a whole different side of her that I didn't really see this last year so

50
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you probably have seen it but to really have understood it from that perspective, something really different. Huh.

51
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:24.840
Jaime C: Yeah. And since I've been back from Denver, you know, the first couple days, it was a little odd TO BE BACK AND HER AND I BOTH FELT IT BECAUSE SHE her and I sat down and talked about it.

52
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:39.570
Jaime C: And she said, You know, I really, she said that I know that it's hard to go and run your own hotel for a while and then come back and be my assistant and she said, I want you to know that I appreciate you doing that transition gracefully is what she said.

53
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.090
Jaime C: And

54
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:54.090
Jaime C: And I told her, you know, I said, You know, I feel like I'm afraid to do things here because I'm stepping on your toes. Now I feel like you're my colleague and not my boss and

55
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:02.220
Jaime C: She said that she felt the same way and then. So since then, this last week. I feel like she's been doing things to kind of flex your muscles.

56
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:12.300
Jaime C: Like there's just random daily tasks that I know how to do you know with my eyes closed, but she's texting me saying, hey, don't forget to do this or, please do.

57
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.250
Jaime C: That kind of stuff.

58
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I wonder if you're having a missed opportunity. Maybe you're already doing it.

59
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're

60
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Like her daughter and you're not behaving the way she wants you to so she keeps my she likes that she liked that position clearly likes being the mentor. She keeps forcing forcing that back in

61
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's just really simple for her and you call it control and she is. She wants to be

62
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.030
Jaime C: On no boss and

63
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and then

64
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to be one step down for her to feel comfortable. She doesn't really

65
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Even with her adult daughter right her adult daughters trying to rise up mom keeps saying that's a crumb and pushing that down almost doing the same thing to you to

66
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.690
Jaime C: really realize that

67
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you did. Okay. Yeah, that's what it looks like. Out here. So it's really personal. This is just

68
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's but. But you do know it because you recognize it in the control. You can grab it on that word, but it has to do with she gets the control by knowing more

69
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and being the rescuer and being the hero and she gets that's where she gets her refueling it's, it doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for the rest of us to grow.

70
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

71
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

72
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you supposed to feel good about yourself. I means I have to stay small and ignorant. She's going to probably have a hard time being able to meet you on that colleague level you because you're more mature. I mean,

73
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.100
Jaime C: You've done some development.

74
00:09:53.250 --> 00:10:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have a problem because typically right I do this thing where we say the jobs over here it's it's not who I am.

75
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

76
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Today I'm just a little. I'm a case worker. I'm just gonna make calls

77
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the same clinician. It's just, I'm going to tell people, don't forget to put your appointment in your calendar.

78
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.150
Jaime C: Yeah.

79
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't go to graduate school to tell people to do that, but I'm not hung up on that. That's what treatment looks like today. That's what's needed today. I don't care. Money's just as green to me.

80
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.130
Jaime C: Yeah.

81
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't need. It's not me. He's having a hard time with that you can pop in and I'll bust some tables. The table needs bus and I'm, I'm sorry.

82
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a bus.

83
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.570
On the bus.

84
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

85
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if

86
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You would do that.

87
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: She would get really upset. Why is the staff not here and spend all our time bye bye bye life just bust the table work it out later these customers need

88
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:54.900
Jaime C: Money.

89
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You strike me as someone who would just get it done. If there was no one around to get it done.

90
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.910
Jaime C: Right. Yeah, and then figure it out later.

91
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, people help later like what, why, where is everybody

92
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Back or something.

93
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's hard to see when you grow it means you see see it all the more you evolve and really recognize toxicity and patterns of habitual behavior in yourself and others, you cannot see it.

94
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.290
Jaime C: Right.

95
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.470
Jaime C: True.

96
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm excited for you. I really am. I just

97
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, oh boy. And what that says what a testament. Anyone who, let's say, is in the know the folks that know how badly you kind of want the Eugene spot.

98
00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to be like wow you took this you crushed it. You did great in Albuquerque, and you really wanted this thing. I mean,

99
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You were very you weren't caddy you didn't start gossiping didn't bad mouth this gal you handled it beautifully you crushed it and you get to kind of say, Yeah, I did this thing. Now, I really want a lot of that. You know what I mean.

100
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Leverage down the line knows

101
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.170
Jaime C: Yeah, it could be, I mean every all the the the regional over there.

102
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:36.600
Jaime C: And her boss both said that they would be a reference for me it would vouch for me and how I ran up property. So that's huge.

103
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Huge

104
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.860
Jaime C: All right, let me

105
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I am remembering right now.

106
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That you and Greg had about a week or so ago had a breakup. And I'm wondering kind of want to touch on that and see how your, your hearts doing

107
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:08.430
Jaime C: So we still haven't really talked, we haven't talked. I don't know why somebody, but we started talked. Um, and it's been the last couple days that I feel

108
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.640
Jaime C: Better. I guess content.

109
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:26.820
Jaime C: I mean, I was definitely a hot mess the last week or so it was very hard to focus at work. I couldn't sleep very well. I never I mean just eating was not appealing it it was difficult.

110
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.460
Jaime C: But I did send him a message, letting him know that

111
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:40.050
Jaime C: I am perfectly okay with him with me with giving him his face that he clearly wants

112
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.290
Jaime C: And that I do want to work this out and I love him. I hope he's okay.

113
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.080
Jaime C: And so he read the message and has get to respond.

114
00:13:52.890 --> 00:14:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So late so you kind of said you broke up. And then in the quiet. You also say we're back together.

115
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:16.440
Jaime C: No, not necessarily. Got together. I just told him that I'm I just want to talk to him that I want to work it out because the message. The last message I just sent him was like by basically right i do

116
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:24.900
Jaime C: I know that I reacted off emotion and i and i said some things to him. I probably shouldn't have said.

117
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.810
Jaime C: I felt guilty about that. And I think a lot of that was eating at me.

118
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:42.180
Jaime C: I don't know this, this is something that I've done a lot in my life with relationships is I

119
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.140
Jaime C: Very quickly. Okay, we're done by

120
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.770
Jaime C: But this is the first time that I've actually like

121
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.800
Jaime C: Gone back

122
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

123
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.500
Jaime C: And wanted to figure out

124
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.130
Jaime C: If I don't know, I just, I guess.

125
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.120
Jaime C: I feel like I'm scared to death of rejection. Yeah.

126
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably sees you To reject someone before they reject us. That's a pretty common one. Yeah.

127
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.600
Yeah.

128
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.320
Jaime C: Yeah. And so I just with him. It just doesn't feel right. It doesn't. It doesn't.

129
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.670
Jaime C: You

130
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: caught yourself maybe using emotional reasoning, right, we think, well, if I'm feeling rejected. Why, then it must be true that someone is rejecting me

131
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's emotional reasoning, if that's what was happening you sounds like you caught yourself and you're checking out those initial assumptions. So does he write you back where you guys out with that.

132
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a slow slow boat between you two.

133
00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:08.040
Jaime C: He is acting exactly how I expect him to act. I really genuinely feel like he was hurt by the things that I said while he's out there working and this is this is how it expect him to act because that

134
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And and and expecting to act, meaning it. There's just no texting no calling know

135
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.620
Jaime C: You would show yeah he would shut down.

136
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Shut down. OK. OK.

137
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:39.300
Jaime C: So I do feel better after I sent him the last tags. I prayed about it and prayed about it, pray about it. And I was just a hot mess. And so after I sent him that text. Two days ago I just felt relieved I felt better. I felt. Okay. I feel like he's gonna reach out eventually he will

138
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting how

139
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:48.600
Jaime C: I just have I really need to learn how to control my emotion. I do.

140
00:16:50.250 --> 00:17:02.610
Jaime C: I'm speak out like it right. I just sometimes like when I'm feeling intense emotion like maybe somebody's hurting me or some I'm confused about a relationship or something. I just react instantly off my emotion and

141
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:11.760
Jaime C: I don't like it. It's hard for me to sit in that. And that's what I'm trying to remind myself is just to fit in that for a minute and let it have

142
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So we could definitely spend some time on that. Why don't we do your home. So we can we can kind of do maybe some some inner child working around that maybe let's let's see what comes up with this one.

143
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:31.740
Okay.

144
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to that feeling.

145
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: With Greg.

146
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: He said something or the absence of his saying anything you make up a story, maybe

147
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Is that what

148
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.020
Jaime C: I just my mind goes to the worst possible scenario where you go.

149
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but what was actual. What's the actual

150
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: activating event is it he did something said something or you said something and it was just quiet.

151
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.450
Jaime C: He

152
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:26.220
Jaime C: So yeah, I did. I text him letting him know I was worried about them thinking about him and he just ignored me for two days.

153
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

154
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.140
Jaime C: Yeah. And then when I looked on that one app. He was sitting there active so

155
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm remembering the story. It just hit me. He was talking to his daughter.

156
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. How could you, you said you couldn't talk, you were talking to

157
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your daughter, clearly, and you said, well, this is what this means.

158
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We're done. Okay.

159
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you.

160
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you're sitting with

161
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Owning that you

162
00:18:54.990 --> 00:19:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing him hurt his feelings and his style is to kind of get quiet and work it, work it out on this on.

163
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Ignored

164
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So that sounds familiar.

165
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's still work with it though. Even though it's something we've touched on before you can still hold a lot of energy.

166
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To see what comes up when

167
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You are left alone.

168
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To fill in the blanks. I'm going to come up with

169
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning is happening right now because no one is responding to me, no one's talking to me, explaining is my interpretation. Correct. There's no one to bounce it off of

170
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even the sense of any reasonable person.

171
00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be talking to me would be communicating. I feel ignored trackback. See how old. See if you can grab the most intense or the oldest of that I'm being ignored.

172
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:20.490
Jaime C: Instantly, as soon as you said that I had a memory pop up. I'm in the house. It was the same house.

173
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.160
Jaime C: That I was molested in

174
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.500
Jaime C: I'm ready, remember having a little red tricycle.

175
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:38.640
Jaime C: And and I had some go ahead in the tires. And so I had a little pocket knife, and I was poking up. I mean I had

176
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopes

177
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What just happened Yanks somebody text you

178
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.140
Jaime C: Have to have been probably for three you know later.

179
00:20:52.650 --> 00:21:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I just came back online. Okay, so, so I got lost with pocket knife. I don't know what you said between pocket knives and H3.

180
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:08.370
Jaime C: Are very soon. So yeah, I was probably three or four around there and I was taking the pocket knife, and I was poking pulling out the

181
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.540
Jaime C: The Go ahead, out of my tire and

182
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:24.960
Jaime C: I remember when I was pulled poking them out the pocket knife went into my in right here like as a little kid was very scary and

183
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:35.490
Jaime C: The way that I see it still is the pocket knife went in there very deep and I remember pulling it out and it looked like a big black hole right there. And my my hand.

184
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:47.940
Jaime C: And I ran to my mom and showed her what had happened, and she did not care. She just took the pocket knife from me. And that was it.

185
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see what didn't care. You saying she

186
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Takes it like this and just walks away.

187
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:14.100
Jaime C: I remember, I remember her saying I had the pocket knife in my hand. Still, and I remember showing my Mom, look. This hurts and on my hand right here. Yeah. And are you just remember her saying, Give me that. And she took the pocket knife keynote, was it

188
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were left doing what

189
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:20.940
Jaime C: It was good.

190
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Does the memory have any more details after that.

191
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.380
Jaime C: No more just remembers my mom walking off. I remember feeling, feeling

192
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.190
Jaime C: Like Why are, why are you not care that I have this hole in my hand. Yeah.

193
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you not

194
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:42.630
Care.

195
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's check and see how activating just even pulling up that memory is now.

196
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.960
What's it like for you.

197
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.600
Jaime C: Here I can feel it feel down

198
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.730
Jaime C: In the chest. Yeah.

199
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.330
Oh,

200
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do we label that let's let's name it to tame it what what do we call that emotion that physically is felt in the chest. Let's give it that

201
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give it a name that emotion. What is that this

202
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.850
Jaime C: Sad.

203
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't help it. Jamie, but I feel confused.

204
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

205
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.510
Jaime C: Yeah.

206
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.770
Jaime C: Yeah.

207
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not just me.

208
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.090
Jaime C: No, definitely confusing.

209
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you confused as a tiny tot just three and four.

210
00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:50.820
Jaime C: I remember

211
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.770
Jaime C: Just wondering like why she didn't care.

212
00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:04.560
Jaime C: But maybe it just wasn't that big a deal. And that's why maybe I'm putting too much weight on it. It's really not that big a deal.

213
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.690
Jaime C: That's why she didn't care.

214
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can't picture the blood and the pain. None of that stands out. I'm noticing, you're not sharing any of those details right

215
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so the emotional residue of that event is there.

216
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how

217
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The staying the physical staying isn't what you're focused on talking about

218
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:42.450
Not

219
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Just but there is the whole right there's that black hole that went through.

220
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And she wouldn't see it if she looked at it, she just seen that and gone through and done through

221
00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:59.730
Jaime C: Yeah, I was a little four year old and it was a pocket knife that just went all the way in there.

222
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

223
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Can look at it. You're setting God here.

224
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: How upsetting son scale 02 hundred are you at right now.

225
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.220
Jaime C: I'd say probably five or six

226
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.630
Maybe 5060 okay

227
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And the thought back then was

228
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be making a bigger deal out of it than it is because this trusted caregiver isn't making a fuss. I'm making a bigger deal out of it.

229
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.280
Jaime C: Yeah.

230
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe my deals not big. Maybe it's not a big deal.

231
00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.410
Jaime C: Yeah, okay.

232
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can. I want to get a sense of the setting that we've got here. I think you have a bed behind you. I think you're sitting on a bed and my right and I'm resting on a desk or some sort of

233
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.280
Jaime C: Side A barstool

234
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you have space in between barstool and seating.

235
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.410
Yeah.

236
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.040
Jaime C: And I'm on my laptop.

237
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Laptop. Beautiful. Um, I thought we would just something a little different, is there in that space, a chair that you can scoot sort of bring it on screen. So I can see it. You'd be seated there and the chair. I'd be able to see both

238
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.680
Jaime C: I'm not in here, but I could go get one.

239
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you, that'd be awesome. Alright.

240
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.170
Well,

241
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me see. Are you you sitting in the chair.

242
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.020
Jaime C: Yeah.

243
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what I'm going to want this is a little different here. What I'm going to want is the screen turn so that the chair is facing the bed so that watch this is what we might be doing. It's called the empty chair technique.

244
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you might be seated here and then we'll go here.

245
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to need to be able to see them both position. So you want to turn the screen so it can space. The chair in the bed just right where those two were the two flip flop, you go here and then. Yeah, you got it. That's the one that's beautiful.

246
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And today's an exercise day. So let's go stand up and now I want you to look at both. You're going to stand up and look at both of these seats stand back behind

247
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to look at the bed and I want you to look at the see

248
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. She just sort of say, all right,

249
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Where would my mom be going to have a conversation with my mom this therapist is going. Am I doing these kooky exercises and little me is going to be

250
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Either on this bed or maybe she'll be the one standing in the middle. There's going to be three characters in this will four if you count the therapist.

251
00:28:52.170 --> 00:29:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be a lot as a whole group of people in here. There's going to be parent whose mom. There's going to be little you and then there's going to be Jamie as an adult.

252
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll work that out later but for now I want you to picture where would mamby where would three four year old day

253
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.000
Jaime C: For my moment and share and me I'm little me on the bed.

254
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's put go ahead and have a seat you on the bed.

255
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.300
Okay.

256
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You got tissue, you're so smart, you're like,

257
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she got make me cry today and be like,

258
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we gotta laugh.

259
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So yep, there she is.

260
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, Jamie. As a little girl, you know, the message you, you had to absorb this Confusing. Confusing moment that

261
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to read a story right now.

262
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever comes up. That's what we want to go with. In other words, you may feel sad or you may feel scared. I'm going to want to know. Just because I can't read your mind.

263
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm going to guide you, you

264
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't expect you to know what to do. I'm really comfortable with this technique I really like it.

265
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: may go slow. We're fine with slow. I love slow

266
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't edit.

267
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever comes up, let me let me hear that because then I'll be able to say switch, and switch means you're going to switch chairs and you don't even have to wait for me. Once you do that, switch chair. What you do is you embody

268
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That person. Well, okay, well fine, mom, what might I respond to, if my little girl said that to me and you just sort of get into that character in a sense, and you say, you know, your mom might say, oh, knock it off. Toughen up. Right. We say it.

269
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.030
And

270
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:08.430

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What feels right for you.

337
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:47.520
Jaime C: I would, yes. So I guess I'm a little confused about this part because i would i would definitely I would absolutely. That's how I picture it is I would love my daughter to death. He had I don't, but my mom wouldn't

338
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we'll hold on to. Right. There's, there's a dissonance there.

339
00:37:52.740 --> 00:38:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's get through that. What does mom do. So I'll ask that again this is Mom, do you see your daughter's sad. Do you know, she said, do you see it at all.

340
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.640
Jaime C: Yes, you do. Okay.

341
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.950
Do you

342
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the ability to both

343
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel your own feelings and also care about your daughter's sad, can you be with both

344
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.490
Jaime C: Yes. Okay.

345
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: No more, no less. What do you have to give your daughter, little girl right now. Could you do

346
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:52.350
Jaime C: Just tell her, and show her that I care just hug her and let her know I love her.

347
00:38:53.730 --> 00:39:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Hug her and you you know her pretty well. I wonder how she could let in.

348
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The knowledge that you love her. The hug.

349
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.080
Jaime C: Yeah.

350
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then letting her know something, I wonder what you might say, would you say anything to her to

351
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hook. Okay, switch sides.

352
00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jamie, take your left hand and kind of put it kind of under your arm a bit under here here right hand around

353
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Around the left shoulder, and I want you to just now kind of sink into it. Let those shoulders drop into it. And this is kind of the cookie part and just just feel what it's like to have that arm held and to be contained and held

354
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to use that imagination and just picture that mom.

355
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Came over and hold, and she showed you

356
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And she sees your sound.

357
00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.680
She doesn't quite know what to say.

358
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: She showed you and she cares about your distress.

359
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense if you believe and trust that hug.

360
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a little girl taking in this hug. Is it believed, it's real.

361
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's coming up to not to edit this is real.

362
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Tender.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:40:59.250
Jaime C: Me.

364
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.890
Jaime C: I guess it's hard for me.

365
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture.

366
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You can like release the hug for just a moment. Let's get a little more understanding sounds is basically, it's hard to even imagine. Because right okay so let's let's pull in another piece of this which has to do with

367
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You are three four very young.

368
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.000
Jaime C: Now,

369
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have

370
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The life experience the knowledge and brain development that you have now as an adult.

371
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Which had a picture.

372
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you and I both do it will both stand up will walk behind these two seats.

373
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to now be the guide.

374
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: She just stand here and really take a look at this hurting little girl. You can see her there. She sad.

375
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: An earlier, there was

376
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:16.860

Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see, Mom.

380
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But this time, it can go down differently.

381
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do, what's the impulse here. You're the one that knows how to balance.

382
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The resource of a mother, the needs of a child you as an adult are in the middle, in essence,

383
00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What can be done here. What needs fixing what needs attention.

384
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.110
Jaime C: Your first thought is to just

385
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:05.460
Jaime C: Get angry at her and tell her. Look, that's your daughters. She wants you to love her.

386
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. And so why don't you that's really important. Notice how your hand went out to the little girl now.

387
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, hold your hand out to mom.

388
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

389
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But see, right, just not quite as comfortable. But see, because we have to balance the needs of all it inside of us. Okay.

390
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the psyche. So this is these are the different ego state. So if moms. You're mad at it. You're mad at her. Why can't you just look at her take just Tucker, take care of her.

391
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: When she just look right at mom and tell her.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And adult Jamie tell her. Again, if that's the truth. I don't know how I feel terrible. But I simply do not know how

415
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: To really tell her. Let's see what happens.

416
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.200
Jaime C: I don't know how

417
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, which now you stand up adult Jamie

418
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:57.690
Okay.

419
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell Mom what that's like to hear her say that just raw

420
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.560
Jaime C: I feel sad for you.

421
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Even in this state. Gotta be careful. So, let's go. It'll go back to know more role play. But let's do a little bit of processing, because I want to protect the emotional process here. So, have a seat. And you can just be you.

422
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Drama workshops over

423
00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

424
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't lose it. Still, still go there and review it. Play it through like a little movie.

425
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And through

426
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: See, see what comes up as we begin to lift to lighter sings at the end of the session we pick up on things that were important. Maybe things we don't want to work on, we can put in a container.

427
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.090
Jaime C: See what you notice and just feel bad for her.

428
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:44.250
Jaime C: I feel like it makes sense. And I could accept that answer. I can accept that she doesn't know how I just feel bad for

429
00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:47.190
Sup dancer.

430
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't know how

431
00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Terribly inconvenient for her family members.

432
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Terribly inconvenient and wounding to you.

433
00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's the fact. There it is.

434
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't pretend like it doesn't exist. She simply doesn't know.

435
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And without down there to compensate and try and show her go. Give the kid a hug.

436
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.460
Jaime C: Yeah.

437
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, he was there he knew what to do.

438
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:29.550
Jaime C: Yeah.

439
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And now she's got nobody to

440
00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell him what to do. And she hasn't and we already know right she needs some professional help weed.

441
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that common for those are adults to go. Get them. Get that help that you can accept the facts.

442
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I would invite you over the coming week to consider magically as if it were possible, but the this combination of of the adults in the little girl if there wasn't a knowledge that

443
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom simply can't

444
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Then maybe what maybe it's not my assessment of distress isn't off. Now this is a big freakin deal. You're not the right person to talk to clarify, because you are close but you questioning your own assessment of something at three and four.

445
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a big deal.

446
00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a big deal to to even have the knife to begin with. I won't go there.

447
00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:46.500
Jaime C: But right

448
00:50:54.300 --> 00:51:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see my point. I'm we're going around on us is, is you ended up questioning your own reality.

449
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did it again in that house when you were violated, you had to question, is this not a big deal. Where do I go to write

450
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It was big deal but you'd already gotten in the habit of questioning is this is this worth any buddies fussing over CAN, SHOULD WE fuss. Now,

451
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:26.010
It was a bit

452
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't register her barometers off, not yours.

453
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's end today with really go go immerse yourself in that after that breath right you just let go of that. So let's really be present with

454
00:51:52.500 --> 00:52:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The figures that have been in your life that did see Jamie does have the ability to tune in word she can assess right, wrong, good, bad, what she likes. She doesn't like know her own preferences. She knows

455
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And people reflect it back to you. Yep. Look, she does like this. No, she doesn't like that. And it's lovely to have that echo back at us to be seen and to be known.

456
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.200
Your mom can't

457
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's sad. It means she's not gonna feel love either

458
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That sad.

459
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.240
Very sad.

460
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: She has had a difficult time of it herself.

461
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Back here. We don't have to feel the raw wounding of it as if it's happening now.

462
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to bring in

463
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: These other figures that really do know how to validate you and say, you

464
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you you can accept what is

465
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to turn to other resources and you have you, you have your adult you now that knows. Yeah.

466
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's what makes possible for you to reach out for Greg again you're growing your resilience your tolerance for possible

467
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Rejection misunderstanding is growing, you are getting stronger.

468
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And although with, you know, you were saying, well, I need to work on that you are you're working on it.

469
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It just, it's not written out this dot dot dot this dot dot dot but in the psyche, in the stuff that you're doing in here. And when you're living your truth more and more and more as you're speaking it

470
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.000
Yeah.

471
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You're healing when you're doing that.

472
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.470
Jaime C: makes me happy to hear that. Yeah.

473
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.520
Jaime C: It's exciting.

474
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So whenever sloughed whatever negative charge might be left in the chest or the throat of the guy over the shoulders of the legs, the size the hands just gently put it in that box, send it away, you can

475
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.310
Jaime C: I don't feel like I have any negative feelings. Right now I

476
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:26.760

495
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.280
Jessica G: You know,

496
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:43.620
Jessica G: So I was making

497
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.840
Jessica G: Just only when

498
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:51.780
Jessica G: You know, whenever I have the trouble with the

499
00:55:55.230 --> 00:56:06.600
Jessica G: And more because it's more frustrating. I guess for me because I don't have a ride. So the only time I can go, I don't have specific times when I can go and that's after he gets out of work.

500
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:15.690
Jessica G: When he gets out of work like around 630 and between six and seven and then I cooked dinner. Okay.

501
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So, let

502
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.780

Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

504
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is dedication. Are you do have enough to get you to, I don't know whether we're at two weeks, or we're out. I'm a little lost myself, but are you right where you need to be or is there still some fine tuning that's needed around the prescription part

505
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.090
Jessica G: Well, I have enough I have enough for

506
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:48.780

Jessica G: Today and tomorrow.

508
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.810
Jessica G: So she gave me a week's worth

509
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I got one of my older kids returned home, I was like, oh,

510
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.720

Gwenevere Abriel: You've had some exchanges with Dr. Rob real is it. When's your next refill going to be when is your next order needed

514
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:48.450
Jessica G: So I have enough for today and tomorrow. She prescribed me a week's worth which worked out fine. You know, okay.

515
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's

516
00:57:50.250 --> 00:58:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Stick with that and whatever's going on with the pharmacist did that kind of get resolved, is it seemed like that technicians not there are things coming down at the actual pharmacy or do you need to change pharmacies.

517
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:10.800
Jessica G: Well, the thing about that pharmacy is that it's 24 hours. That's nice.

518
00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:15.900
Jessica G: So whenever I do get the chance to go

519
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.150
Jessica G: It's usually like around nine o'clock at night.

520
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't go at 630 because you're preparing dinner for

521
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For boyfriend husband boyfriend. Boyfriend

522
00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.450
Boyfriend

523
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's on my radar to talk about him to because there's some stuff going on between you two.

524
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really, it's on my mind like in a big way. But I want to make sure that this other pieces really clear.

525
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel settled like okay this is the plan.

526
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to go through days of not having medicine. We've got a routine in place now with with the prescriptions that failed more subtle.

527
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.960
Jessica G: Um, no, I just, I feel

528
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.280
Jessica G: I feel like we should still do to week if we can

529
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, um, and did you offer that to her. Do you want to talk about it like tomorrow morning, and I'll, I'll support you. Okay, I'll support that plan.

530
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.400
Jessica G: Yeah. That would be nice.

531
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do it. Let's do it. Alright.

532
00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears just started getting funky. So let's talk about the elephant in the room.

533
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.570
Jessica G: Okay.

534
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The pink elephant. Let's talk about the dynamics between you and your boyfriend.

535
00:59:53.400 --> 01:00:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're starting to hear right when I do these little activities in group or right you're starting to hear some things maybe where huh

536
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. What do you, what are you noticing in this relationship. Are you getting what you need. Are you really just accommodating what's going on.

537
01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.710
Jessica G: I'm not happy.

538
01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:25.170
Jessica G: I'm not happy, but it could be worse. Well,

539
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.450
Jessica G: Yeah, it can be a lot worse. And he's a good dad, and he's

540
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.910
Jessica G: A provider, you know, and everything and

541
01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:43.620
Jessica G: I kind of already have a plan set in motion of what I'm going to do. And I talked to him about it a little bit.

542
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.610
Jessica G: Like as far as me getting a job and everything. And that's just going half on everything.

543
01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.560
Jessica G: Can you show

544
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of more about the specifics of that plan.

545
01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:01.440
Jessica G: Like getting a bigger place and maybe having our own ruins.

546
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:04.590
Jessica G: And

547
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.720
Jessica G: Me pain has been him pain, half of everything.

548
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:23.220
Jessica G: Which which, if I think about it, it'll be way easier and way cheaper for us, you know, because I'm not happy with the way things are going between now

549
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If you, if you could change one thing tomorrow morning woke up and this behavior of his was either there because it's needed, or it was gone. What are we really talking about

550
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:45.840
Jessica G: You just

551
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.830
Jessica G: He just doesn't appreciate me it doesn't respect.

552
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.740
Jessica G: Okay.

553
01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. So if you woke up in the morning and he was showing you respect and appreciation, you'd notice that for sure. Right.

554
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.480

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:04.770
Jessica G: want my son to have a dad, and we get along just fine if we act like friends when it comes down to like us being friends and

568
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:19.440
Jessica G: You know, but when it comes down to like getting romantically involved emotionally involved. It just doesn't work out, because she's it's not fair for him. And I never have been

569
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know that.

570
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:32.910
Jessica G: Yeah, and he says it is. And, you know, and everyone else tells me that I'm just making this up. But I know I'm not

571
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:35.490
Jessica G: I'm not

572
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to bounce a couple things off just to see another pair of ears, just to see you might feel validated.

573
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.410
Jessica G: We had just gotten that he had just gotten out of a relationship.

574
01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:04.170
Jessica G: Remember Me and him started talking or they had been separated for a while. But he was still like talking to her, and

575
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:17.220
Jessica G: She was pregnant, and she had a boyfriend. And he wasn't sure if the baby was hers. So he was still there. He was still trying to be there after the baby was born.

576
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.890
Jessica G: I was already pregnant.

577
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:27.270
Jessica G: I was already taken on after that baby was born here to go pick up the baby and see shame and everything and

578
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.960
Jessica G: I just feel like he's never

579
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:36.990
Jessica G: Like I can never be her

580
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.420
Jessica G: To him, you know,

581
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

582
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, we'll get there. That's what we do. We start kind of kind of out here and then we work our way to some details.

583
01:04:50.670 --> 01:05:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you see, are you here that he's does with this woman that child, that you don't really see it happening in this home.

584
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:21.000
Jessica G: Like I've just always feel like he's I've always felt like he's always compared to me. He's always been comparing me to someone, I feel it. And I feel like I can never be good enough. And I just, it's weird, like he always has, always treated me like if he can do better, or well

585
01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:35.550
Jessica G: After I got pregnant. He always treated me like if he could do better and like you know because I was, I was really depressed. I had a lot of like sobriety way, you know, and I was really insecure and

586
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:40.770
Jessica G: So, so I

587
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But what was he doing because right there. That was just you, right, you're saying, Okay, I'm

588
01:05:48.690 --> 01:06:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling depressed. And did he say something, or maybe it's the way he touched you. The way he looked at you that you're picking up on some kind of message. What do you think those those signs were we picking up on

589
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.010
Jessica G: Yeah, was the way he treated me just the way he

590
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:19.080
Jessica G: Like he was real mean to me he was real like not mean but like cold to meet towards me.

591
01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:26.670
Jessica G: Explain it.

592
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.910
Jessica G: He cheated on me a lot because we were together. When I was pregnant.

593
01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.520
Jessica G: And he cheated me on me a lot while I was pregnant.

594
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.040
Jessica G: Um,

595
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, now go back in time.

596
01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you wonder to yourself. Hmm.

597
01:06:52.800 --> 01:07:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if he's someone I can trust my heart. I know I'm pregnant, but I wonder if I can trust. And do you remember thinking, anything like that.

598
01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.520
Jessica G: Hmm, again,

599
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you

600
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:14.460
Jessica G: Do I think, I think it was more like I knew that I couldn't

601
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.680
Jessica G: I knew that I couldn't by his actions.

602
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:29.970
Jessica G: Like I said, by the way, he treated me when I will when I went into labor. And this is something I just cannot get over

603
01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.870
Jessica G: When I went into labor. He slept the whole time.

604
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:41.010
Jessica G: I didn't I yeah he slept for three days straight. The only time he got up.

605
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.270
Jessica G: Was when he wanted to go home and change.

606
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:58.770
Jessica G: When the baby was coming out. And that's because his mom and my mom already were holding my legs up and his mom yelled at him and woke him up because I was already pushing otherwise he would have missed it.

607
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:03.090
Jessica G: When it was time to sign the birth certificate

608
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:05.580
Jessica G: And

609
01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:12.540
Jessica G: Whenever they would bring meals and

610
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:20.610
Jessica G: And the nurses, whatever, it would it would even like I remember I was having such a hard time

611
01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:33.510
Jessica G: Excuse me, and one of the nurses was helping me. And she was like, who's this like he was just sleeping on the new coordinator. You know, like laying down passed out.

612
01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.520
Jessica G: And I don't know if it was like, if he was nervous or what but

613
01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:43.320
Jessica G: Like he didn't help me. He didn't talk to me.

614
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.290
Jessica G: And I just

615
01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:48.870
Jessica G: That's how I knew

616
01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.270
Jessica G: You know, and

617
01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:54.720
Jessica G: Someone who loves you.

618
01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:07.830
Jessica G: And who's happy about you guys bringing a child into the world like good, they're going to be there to support you do contractions, they're going to

619
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.760
Jessica G: Be attentive to you, you know, attentive to you.

620
01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:18.540
Jessica G: And he just didn't. And that's kind of sums up our relationship.

621
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:24.960
Jessica G: On only whenever me and him, got together and we started talking and everything.

622
01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.840
Jessica G: Obviously he was more

623
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.140
Jessica G: Attentive but

624
01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:38.400
Jessica G: There was still red flags and my self esteem was so low.

625
01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:40.770
Jessica G: Like you know

626
01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:41.820
Force.

627
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:59.160
Jessica G: And I ended up getting pregnant. I feel like because I had just gotten sober and everything in my body was barely getting back to normal. That's why I ended up getting pregnant, which I. About the only thing. Good thing that came out of this.

628
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:03.300
Jessica G: And I try like around my son I try

629
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:11.160
Jessica G: Me and him tried to make him happy. You know, and we tried for him not to see a spy.

630
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.170
Jessica G: But he's just

631
01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.770
Jessica G: Never gonna see

632
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.360
Jessica G: A mom and dad who loves each other, you know,

633
01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not. This combination, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But love is love. Okay. It doesn't mean it has to be looked like this Earth Mother Earth father, but being around it feeling loved and safe. There's predictability. That's the stuff that sticks it makes a difference for your son. Okay.

634
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I get it now because you went into some details about it. Now I see what you're talking about. So you knew early on was was there.

635
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The I don't deserve anything better. Was it I'm too scared to be on my own. I did have a newborn baby, I'm going to stay with him. What do you think was the tipping point that you decided to go ahead and move in together and try to have a family together.

636
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:16.770
Jessica G: Um,

637
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:33.900
Jessica G: Well, when the baby was three months old. He wasn't okay so after the baby was born, she wasn't helping at all. I was on my mom because I was staying with my mom and he's the His mom was the upstairs neighbor.

638
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.810
Jessica G: He was working and everything, but he wasn't helping at all. He wasn't

639
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:58.320
Jessica G: Doing anything. He was just living his life and, you know, and then I had some issues there at my mom's house with her boyfriend and I was just like, I got a goal, like I have to, I need to go. I need to. I need to like do this on my own, because I just, I'm not happy and

640
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:05.940
Jessica G: My son deserves to see me happy. And so I decided to come back to Albuquerque and

641
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.840
Jessica G: I enrolled at Pima Medical Institute.

642
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:12.570
Jessica G: And

643
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:23.610
Jessica G: And it wasn't going to start for for a couple months. So I was kind of

644
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:27.990
Jessica G: At first I was saying was one of my aunts.

645
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:30.990
Jessica G: And then

646
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.600
Jessica G: My cousin, me and my cousin had a

647
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.740
Jessica G: My cousin had issues with her boyfriend.

648
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:52.680
Jessica G: And my auntie had left out of town, and she told she in my cousin was just something was off like something was off and

649
01:12:53.100 --> 01:13:01.320
Jessica G: My cousin ended up taking one other vehicles and my auntie called me if I didn't know anything. I didn't know that she wasn't supposed to take the vehicle and my

650
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:16.890
Jessica G: Auntie called me and asked me where she wasn't. I was like, Oh, she left, and she said she'd be right back. And I guess she took the vehicle without permission to go see her or to go fight with her sons and little kids stuff.

651
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:25.230
Jessica G: And she asked me to clean the house was messy to clean it up because he threatened to call child protective services.

652
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:30.480
Jessica G: On her and I started freaking out. And I was like,

653
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:41.190
Jessica G: Wasn't I have to leave because if Child Protective Services is coming. They're going to investigate all of the kids that are under this roof, not just her kids.

654
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:51.570
Jessica G: You know, and what if they, what if something happens, I couldn't. I can't, I can't risk it. And my auntie was like yelling at me and

655
01:13:52.350 --> 01:14:02.520
Jessica G: Talking about all they're only going to investigate her kids. It's not about you and this and that. And it's like, Okay, why are you acting so ignorant, you're a nurse, you know,

656
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:05.340
Jessica G: So that night.

657
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:14.880
Jessica G: My sister in law drove all the way to Roswell from Albuquerque to go pick me up because I was in Roswell and then I came and stayed with my brother.

658
01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:26.160
Jessica G: And I stayed there and everything was, I can't say everything was fine, because, I mean, it's the it was a abusive brother, and so he

659
01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:37.110
Jessica G: goes on like binges on the weekends and they fight and then just somehow, one of the weekends and ended up

660
01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:40.170
Jessica G: With me the fight ended up with me.

661
01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:46.770
Jessica G: And he ended up putting his hands on me again. And he called the cops.

662
01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:59.880
Jessica G: Know I called the cups I called the cops because he hit me. And he just somehow has always known how to manipulate the police to get me in trouble.

663
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:14.520
Jessica G: And I've always just been so emotional that I can't, I can't even express. I can't even deal with the police, like, you know, I don't know how to explain it. So then my auntie went to go pick me up.

664
01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:31.620
Jessica G: All this was my baby, my auntie went to go pick me up and I started staying at her house and I had stayed on. My auntie's house before when I was on the ankle monitor and it's the anti that I tell you about the crazy

665
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

666
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:38.460
Jessica G: And so me and her have had problems before and

667
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:47.370
Jessica G: I just knew how it was going to end up like it. It's a novelty for her. At first, you know, and you baby and everything.

668
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.310
Jessica G: And then at the end of it.

669
01:15:51.480 --> 01:16:00.630
Jessica G: It started getting to the point where they would tell me not to come that I COULDN'T COME HOME BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T HOME yet and I passed by their house and they'd be there already.

670
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:12.990
Jessica G: I'm an ED be like 10 o'clock at night. I don't mind you, I don't have a vehicle like I, you know, and I just close it up my grandparents and I'm

671
01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:23.340
Jessica G: They'd be there at home and just that would start happening to the point where like almost like okay I get the message, I get it, you know.

672
01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:37.500
Jessica G: I get it on top of. I was already in school. By then so on top of school work my baby and cleaning up because that's what is expected at their house. You know, it's just it was hard and

673
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:51.420
Jessica G: All this time it was only my mom helping me like he wouldn't he wouldn't like you know and and if he did, it was a miracle. Because I'm not gonna say that he didn't have a I would have to like

674
01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:56.580
Jessica G: Fight with him and be like hey look like you know

675
01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:04.530
Jessica G: So then I was like, I'm done. I'm done. Like I need my own place. And so

676
01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.980
Jessica G: I, I found an apartment.

677
01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:20.430
Jessica G: By myself I filled out all the paperwork by myself I filled out my mom's section, you know, because she had to co sign like I did it all by myself.

678
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:35.580
Jessica G: I had my mom like be on him. Like when he got paid to give me the money and she gave me most of it and he gave me some of it. I put down the deposit and I moved in the very next day.

Jessica G: I got all my stuff out and I moved in me and my son were stable.

680
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:47.280
Jessica G: All I have to worry about was getting right to school and finding somebody to take care of him.

681
01:17:48.690 --> 01:17:53.310
Jessica G: And and I did it. And I did it. And then finally, I was like, You know what, like

688
01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:34.170
Jessica G: I told him you know like we have our own house. We have our own room, our own car. Like, you know,

689
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:38.580
Jessica G: And so he moved over here.

690
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:45.480
Jessica G: And not didn't last very long because my car got stolen in July.

691
01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.590
Jessica G: And so that's how me and him ended up moving together. Okay.

692
01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you heard throughout this that you all along, you have been overcoming very difficult obstacles. Hope you hear that, don't forget that.

693
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that we wonder, can I do it again. Can I do this difficult thing. Can I find childcare that I trust these people can I work again. What will I do is I have extra money. What will I do. You've already done the hard part. You've already done it.

694
01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did a great job. Boom, you're a good mommy. Okay.

695
01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, Mom. Oh, yeah.

696
01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

697
01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It continues you right, you want to have your son see a healthy mom because when you're happy you're not thinking about using

698
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right that life is going to get further and further and further away.

699
01:19:56.070 --> 01:20:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get stronger and you're going to be available as a resource for your son.

700
01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know about his father. I don't know what to say about him. I think you're probably on to something very early on, you know, but you're paying attention to it. Now you're heading out of the sand.

701
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:17.850
Jessica G: Yeah.

702
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

703
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and you have us here.

704
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're happy to keep talking about you just forgot how strong we are and we do that we do forget

705
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you just described. Notice how you're like I did the paperwork. I made sure I was on top of this and this and this. You've already done the hard stuff. You had a baby with a man who

706
01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't there and you

707
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Still persevered and you went to school and you did all of these things girly the hard part. You already did the hard part.

708
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got everything it takes. Thank you.

709
01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not full of shit. I'm telling you.

710
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it because you you just gave me these amazing examples of what people when they really give up and say I'm defeated.

711
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't make sure money gets here that they position the right person to do this, that they get the paperwork that they get the London, but the fact that they don't do that you do.

712
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: All you really have in front of you is saying.

713
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to just face my fear. That's the big one. My not being with me.

714
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that the big one.

715
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

716
01:21:48.750 --> 01:22:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know how you're going to feel Jessica. It could be. Wait a minute. I actually trust this caregiver. I'm using my new skills of reading safe people. Now I'm not denying it anymore. I'm going to watch the cues.

717
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to give me good eye contact, they're going to be what they say you they are each time they'll follow through.

718
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not putting my head in the sand anymore. Not going to be in denial about whether people are credible and trustworthy. I'm going to pay attention. And if there's a sign.

719
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's a rash on a bottom if there's something some little thing. I'm not going to ignore it. I'm going to take care of it.

720
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You have you, Jessica. You have your insight you have your intuition, you're going to pay attention and little man can get love from other people to not just you. It could also be really cool. Wherever you decide whether it's a

721
01:22:47.550 --> 01:23:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Daycare maybe you combine it with daycare and your mom or something, I don't know what your decision is but little man can get love from other people to not just you while you work on your independence, your stability and your sobriety and you're not trapped

722
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We haven't talked about really going back to work, or maybe at school in a while we'll put a pin in it because I think it was scary for you to even think about it.

723
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:21.990
Jessica G: Yeah, yeah. I think I'm ready.

724
01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. But if that constraint. If the reality of the limitation of your boyfriend really seeing it for what it is if you kept denying it.

725
01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This depression of yours could have kept growing and growing and growing. This one.

726
01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to go out in the role and you're not going out into the world alone, you're in a program with us. We're going to keep saying, way to go. You got this girl. You're going to be talking to other people and saying this is what I'm doing.

727
01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're not doing this exactly the same way you did it before.

728
01:24:03.450 --> 01:24:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have your breathing skills. Okay, and you have someone you can come in here and you can complain about whoever you want to

729
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got somewhere to event.

730
01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We could do role play if you run into someone you don't like we can work on communication skills, about how to navigate. You're not doing this alone.

731
01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

732
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget how strong you are. You have done. You've done the hard part. You really have

733
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what

734
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The possible is just as likely as the impossible. Why can't it be that you really get excited where maybe you were feeling depressed for months, maybe you're going to get excited, again, maybe you like yourself.

735
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you bump into some cool friends. Maybe you'll meet sober friends that when you're staying at home. You can't bump into

736
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.670
Jessica G: Yeah.

737
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.010
Jessica G: Maybe I know

738
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:12.030
Jessica G: I know that I'm excited about it. I'm excited. I'm this whole time. Like, I've learned so much about myself.

739
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:19.380
Jessica G: I feel like I've changed a lot my interests have changed a lot. You know, and

740
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.450
Jessica G: I'm excited to get back out there and put my

741
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:32.040
Jessica G: My certificate to the youth, because I'm in a lot of debt and they need to pay back

742
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Okay, so how can I help. What do you think that sort of the therapeutic relationship can tell what's the biggest fear right now is it around daycare. Is it around. What will happen to my, like, what, how can therapy be helpful.

743
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.980
Jessica G: I think right now i just i

744
01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:56.910
Jessica G: I need to know how to deal with him.

745
01:25:57.690 --> 01:25:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, with this boyfriend.

746
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.680
Jessica G: Because he likes me.

747
01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, girl.

748
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:05.430
Jessica G: I natural for me.

749
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

750
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I got some ideas for you.

751
01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:14.400
Jessica G: And then he ends up telling you what I don't want to. I'm not gonna argue with you. And I'm like,

752
01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.660
Jessica G: You're the one that's being rude to me.

753
01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and right that's intended to make you go cuckoo.

754
01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we can opt out.

755
01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely opt out. So the biggest ones.

756
01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you make any notes. Remember we were doing that video. Do you remember because you watched about second time. Did you read any notes down from that.

757
01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:53.700
Jessica G: I wrote down yes or no. Oh, I don't, I don't think I may know okay

758
01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there are literally steps to it. If you follow these steps you're going to notice your power comes back.

759
01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.820
Jessica G: Oh, the other one. The gaslighting one. That's right. I did. I did. I did.

760
01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:10.440
Jessica G: More it

761
01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you write down. I want to repeat myself because I don't have them on the tip of my tongue.

762
01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.090
I know defiant

763
01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: anything's going to change completely let go. Okay. Well, I'm just going to tell you go to ones are these

764
01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:43.140
Jessica G: Okay.

765
01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:48.690
Jessica G: Remainder fine. I know that's one thing you just said.

766
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's any way that you can disengage.

767
01:27:55.050 --> 01:28:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say I'm going to get my own room, I'm going to have my own job. I'm going to have my own independence. Think about all the topics that normally have to discuss with him.

768
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: rent, food, when you have this collaborative life. You're always like, I got to talk to this person. If you want to disengage which is wearing his powers in

769
01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your taking back control because if you are not asking him to do anything.

770
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Not even. Thank you. Because what may happen is, he may start to be solicitous in a way like doing nice things so that you end up saying thank you

771
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are basically indebted to him in some way that's that's a move after if he really can't piss you off.

772
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the next step that some people will go to, well, look what I've done. You're so you're so ungrateful. Look, what I'm doing and you because you're a decent human being, you think, well, I gotta thank this person.

773
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But do

774
01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: No, wait a minute, I'm just thinking when I do something nice for someone, it's not with my other handout is it

775
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I'm thinking about, I am I don't guess like

776
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It was if I give a gift. I'm even able to give a gift anonymously. There isn't always a thank you at the end. No, you're doing something very on purpose. You're disengaging if you don't have to talk to this person.

777
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The frequency of arguing will go down really fast.

778
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop asking and expecting him to change is the biggest one. It's not going to

779
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.020
Jessica G: Be okay with him like

780
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.940
Jessica G: Okay, so he he did his taxes.

781
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:44.370
Jessica G: Um,

782
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:52.470
Jessica G: I never knew when he did his taxes. I didn't know how much

783
01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.560
Jessica G: He was going to get back. He claimed to me and my son.

784
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.570
Jessica G: And

785
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:06.540
Jessica G: And and I felt like I couldn't ask the same thing with every single paycheck.

786
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:21.090
Jessica G: Like this time I tried it, I was like, and I just let him like I just let him. I just I just play down like what am I supposed to do, you know, as long as the rents paid. I'm the one that makes sure that

787
01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:30.540
Jessica G: We have, you know, some things that we need like my mom still helps me financially, you know,

788
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:48.330
Jessica G: And I'm like, Mom, I don't have deodorant. Mom, I'm not a hand soap or stuff like that, you know, and then I applied for food stamps for us a long time ago, before he even got here. So we receive food stamps. So he doesn't have to worry about anything but the rip I'm putting that in this car.

789
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me what your point is

790
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:55.440
Jessica G: So my point is, like, I don't know.

791
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:04.230
Jessica G: I don't even talk to him about that, like, That's not even a conversation that we have, like, as far as about his money.

792
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And when is the hook you when. Is he okay let me see. Get to

01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:12.270
Jessica G: What do you mean, so

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're, you're like, I'm not even are you. You're the one that's complaining. You guys are actually exchanging communication at some point, when does that happen.

795
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.130
Jessica G: When you guys saw I'm

01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The more true, the more you'll feel this the efficacy of it.

818
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Try and pick a fight with me.

819
01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:08.520
See

820
01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, something he might say, then

821
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:12.330
I'm

822
01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:27.960
Jessica G: Something who might say your boyfriend. Oh wow, that's always complaining to him. I know not always telling him that he's

823
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:29.940
Jessica G: Messy.

824
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the that's fine.

825
01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So the work is going to be easy for you if you can do it, which is

826
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm done. If you're done, you'll stop asking, which is what a complaint is you're asking him to make a behavioral change, hoping that nudging and complaining will get them to do it.

827
01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't care about the same things you do.

828
01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You want your power back, you just

829
01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go pick it up.

830
01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Go pick it up, go clean it if it has to be clean.

831
01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to work on the compulsivity right that's a whole other kind of discussion therapeutically but

832
01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't care about the same things you do.

833
01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You taking that in as he doesn't care. He may not care. There's been signs that he doesn't care all along. If you haven't been paying attention to. So if you stop asking him to change.

834
01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: See what happens.

835
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because why bother.

836
01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your energy can go to those minutes that you spend trying to get him to show that he cares and respects you by cleaning

837
01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be searching the internet working on your resume studying up refreshing certification requirements focusing your energy on you.

838
01:35:56.610 --> 01:36:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Reading a little story finger painting with your son, whatever energy could go elsewhere that is refueling of the soul, that's not going anywhere. And that's not getting what you want. Get him to clean.

839
01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he'll show he respects you and cares by cleaning. I don't think he cares based on what you're telling me play with this play with this statement.

840
01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We know how earlier you were saying he was doing the gas lighting. I can't quite hear hockey gaslights. What's an example.

841
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:34.620
Jessica G: Um,

842
01:36:35.670 --> 01:36:37.620
Jessica G: Okay so yesterday.

843
01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.600
Jessica G: After church.

844
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:46.950
Jessica G: I made a suggestion that we should stop at an ice cream place.

845
01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:48.270
Okay.

846
01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.380
Jessica G: And he was like,

847
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:02.460
Jessica G: He kind of did was an interested and I was like okay assignment. Let's just go home.

848
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.080
Jessica G: But

849
01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:12.180
Jessica G: Then here. I made a U turn like a crazy you turn like Ben.

850
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:28.830
Jessica G: I was like, What are you doing, he's like, well, I'm going to that place. You said it was around the corner. And I said, Yeah, but you could have kept going the same way you were going, you know, she's like, Well, I don't know where I'm going. And he got mad and I was like, okay, whatever, you know,

851
01:37:29.970 --> 01:37:40.620
Jessica G: And so I started to talk to him about like all the issues. I'm having, you know, with the pharmacy and everything.

852
01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.570
Jessica G: And he just

853
01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:47.940
Jessica G: Like

854
01:37:51.330 --> 01:37:53.520
Jessica G: Like I just stopped talking

855
01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:59.520
Jessica G: I was like, she's not listening to me and I just stopped talking and

856
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:03.360
Jessica G: I don't. She didn't notice.

857
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.350
Jessica G: You didn't notice. And then I was, I said.

858
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:15.990
Jessica G: Okay, okay. Just forget me right but I said the other word

859
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:30.030
Jessica G: Yeah, yeah. So, you know, with me like you're like, I'm sitting here trying to talk to you and you don't even like you know like that. You don't even have the decency to like

860
01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:37.890
Jessica G: You know, pretend like you're listening and he was like, Well, I don't know what the F. I'm going and

861
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jessica your timing.

862
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:44.370
Jessica G: Yeah.

863
01:38:44.730 --> 01:38:45.540
Might have been a little

864
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:46.980
Jessica G: Bit.

865
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:49.740
Yeah.

866
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: He was already kind of lost

867
01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And so bringing up this other topic, but so you have your part in it. That thing you did might be labeled passive aggressive, we might say, Well screw me. Who cares about me right we get all like

868
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess I'm just chopped liver, but if you get to decide what you want to do. You can you can you can keep doing what you're doing. That's fine. If that's the only contact, you're going to have with him is having an argument.

869
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:29.970
Jessica G: No, no. Well, that's not the end of the story. And then he said he made a comment. I don't remember exactly what he said. He said something like

870
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.200
Jessica G: He said, I go

871
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:51.030
Jessica G: I don't know where I'm going. It's like I wanted to say to him, I got the type came up in my head because it was one of those conversations where I was just like listening to answer him.

872
01:39:52.680 --> 01:40:15.120
Jessica G: Yeah, which I know I've been working on that too. And like I knew where we were going and I was going to give him directions like it wasn't that big of a deal. And I feel like he was just using that as an excuse. And so I feel like you said he agreed with me something.

873
01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.170
Jessica G: And we had been having a good day and

874
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:21.420
Jessica G: You know,

875
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:33.840
Jessica G: And so I was kind of her. And I was like, so really, so you're like, that's how you're gonna treat me. So do you see how you're treating me and he's like,

876
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.150
Jessica G: I'm not gonna argue with you. Just because so I guess I was

877
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.540
Yeah.

878
01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:54.660
Jessica G: So, but it's i but i was in screaming at him or anything. I was asking him a question like, Do you see what I'm talking about when I tell you that you know you you're not innocent.

879
01:40:55.770 --> 01:41:03.000
Jessica G: Not innocent and that's how I feel. That's how I feel like he's like gaslighting me because

880
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:04.410
Jessica G: Like

881
01:41:06.450 --> 01:41:11.520
Jessica G: He's acting like he didn't do anything. And I'm the crazy one but when really you know

882
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You do want him to change.

883
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you want him to change, honey.

884
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What if he's not going to

885
01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:27.420
What if he's not

886
01:41:29.010 --> 01:41:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it would be convenient, but you don't know what beautiful life is ahead of you the freedom that will come when you surround yourself with people that really see how intelligent funny and sweet. Oh my gosh, you're, you're so intelligent

887
01:41:47.730 --> 01:41:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All that all that work you do to turn into a pretzel around him.

888
01:41:53.370 --> 01:42:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's not what you want to do in front of your son. I know what you want, but it might need. You might not be around toxic people for a while, you might have to learn. Wait a minute.

889
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I got to get myself together. I gotta love myself. I got to learn what that is. I'm not going to put up with shenanigans. I'm not going to do it again.

890
01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Now because I'm scared I'm working. I can do this. I don't have a lot of friends, but I'm going to start to look and see who can I trust.

891
01:42:25.110 --> 01:42:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But first you trust you. I think what you've been doing is just at least if he could just argue with you. Maybe it'll show at least he cares, because I don't hear I hear a lot of him carrying

892
01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I wrong.

893
01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:44.460
I just

894
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.930
Jessica G: Know you're not. And I see that

895
01:42:53.730 --> 01:43:00.150
Jessica G: And I'm just, that's why I'm like, to the point when I'm over it. I'm done. I'm ready to move on.

896
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.530
Jessica G: Everything's been said and done,

897
01:43:07.650 --> 01:43:09.120
Jessica G: That one.

898
01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That I just saw

899
01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's is grieving an expectation of this perfect family.

900
01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's breathing. It's not a small thing and that sadness might be there a while it's grieving expectation and this image of what it's supposed to look like.

901
01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you hoped it would. He would come on board, someone your mother, his mother might shake, shake it out of him. He might grow up, he might fall in love with the same image, you have

902
01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't sound like he is

903
01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're seeing it, and it's sad.

904
01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.720
A cheer don't know what's around the corner.

905
01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: JESSICA What if you meet people, men, women, whether they're romantic or not, that actually don't exploit you don't play games you then you don't have to feel passive aggressive. You don't have to mind read

906
01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do all those little tricks that you've needed to learn how to do to get a crumb of resource. Get that rent paid somebody change a diaper. You have been surviving on a crumb.

907
01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We are capable of more than that for you.

908
01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Healthy people have more to give

909
01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We can hear about how hard it is with the pharmacy and not make it about ourselves. We can hear it because

910
01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That stuff happens.

911
01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You can surround yourself with people that really didn't know how to love themselves know how to love you.

912
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not you. Don't be a blended family you maybe this person will have maybe a year from now or something course. You know what I do in the early part of recovery. I say let's hold off on starting relationships. Let's work on the self.

913
01:45:17.730 --> 01:45:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But down the line. You don't know what's possible, Ed, someone who has really done some soul searching themselves and has become a parent or

914
01:45:28.410 --> 01:45:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe had a difficult story in life to make really understand and relate right but they've done their work they've grown up, you might be ready for a grown up.

915
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.190
Yeah.

916
01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got a man that hasn't grown up yet.

917
01:45:50.310 --> 01:46:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean he won't, but we can't live in the potential of a future you've been kind of maybe living with a potential he could, he might he may I saw a sign. Maybe that's it. Nope, where he might tomorrow maybe he will maybe maybe

918
01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like yourself when you're around him are you proud of how you behave

919
01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:17.400
That's how I just ugly.

920
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, do you like you because I'm like she's passive aggressive. She's mind reading does she like it does she know

921
01:46:28.050 --> 01:46:30.150
Jessica G: I'm gonna blow my nose. Sorry.

922
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how we decide

923
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to end the way

924
01:46:58.290 --> 01:47:00.600
Jessica G: The way that I am. It's like I've never

925
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:10.440
Jessica G: I've never liked when anything else anything of my AG any of my actions on anybody else like I've always said that

926
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:31.620
Jessica G: I, I was on drugs because I chose to be addressed because I liked being on drugs and it's nobody's fault but mine so like, I'm always that person, like any of my actions have taken I try to take accountability for my actions and so

927
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:40.290
Jessica G: Like now this will take the way that I asked and really hard on myself like I feel like that's why I'm so

928
01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:43.590
Jessica G: upset because

929
01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, we don't need to do that. The needle that goes from self reproach right to blaming others. It doesn't have to swing that far.

930
01:47:54.510 --> 01:48:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We see how right now we're just kind of giggling about it. You think I don't know passive aggression course I know passive aggression. Again, don't know mind reading. I know.

931
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:04.560
Jessica G: Everything on those lists.

932
01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm not

933
01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I don't like me.

934
01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Me and my karma ledger, me and my higher power or whatever. However, anybody thinks about it. I don't like me. I'm holding myself accountable. But I don't use a whip to do it.

935
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're using a whip isn't the only option for self discipline. It's not being this cruel Inner Parent it's saying yeah well

936
01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Guilty, guilty as charged. I'll do better. Okay. Then you own it real quick. You quit. That's the difference between shame activation

937
01:48:51.360 --> 01:49:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And just healthy responsibilities. Yeah. Notice how you did it in here, right, he said, I did this, you own it. You're real good. That's all fine, but it's the punishment that you put on yourself.

938
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't need the punishment, all we do all the rest of us do is we just do the next right thing. That's it. That's it. I'm not kidding. Then the next time you bump into them.

939
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to try. I noticed I sent you that list.

940
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognize there will never be accountability. He's never going to say, I realize I wasn't there for you.

941
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: While you were pregnant. I realized I didn't tell you because maybe he needed to have said, yeah, we had, we had this relationship but

942
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to family he needed to embed accountable responsible and he won't on it. He's not an adult yet. That's a big one. But that's on him.

943
01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can see his limitations and get the head out of wherever it is.

944
01:49:56.250 --> 01:49:56.610
Jessica G: Yeah.

945
01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But we don't get mad at us, all of us go through denial every single one of us need to get our head out our for fun.

946
01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But we don't punish punish the punishment causes the substance use, because guess what happens I'm ashamed of who I am.

947
01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't stand it. I feel depressed. I want to use. No, we just say, Guess what I'm learning new things. I'm going to try it this way. I'm going to turn my energy into my new goals. I'm going to do one or two of them each day I'm gonna, I might cry a little because I'm grieving.

948
01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Grieving this image of what is this

949
01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:46.110
Jessica G: Is that why I cry like the other night I went to store by myself and on the way back. I just, I had this urge to just cry and I cried, and I cried on my way home.

950
01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:47.460
That's my guess.

951
01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:50.250
Jessica G: Yeah.

952
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're at the a couple minutes past the hour today flew by crazy fast. So just to review. Okay.

953
01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing the work that's necessary. You're owning it. You're saying it out loud. You're giggling just skip the punishment. You don't need to punish all you need to do is all right what

954
01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a pain in my stomach. I know I did something like, I don't really like myself, well, how can I like myself right now.

955
01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I can apologize, I can say sorry I was mind reading and passive aggressive. The other day I was actually withholding I knew the directions, but I was trying to get you to

956
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm really sorry.

957
01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, it's nothing. Get him to do anything is to get your power back is to say no more punishment. Just going to own it.

958
01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing bad about you. We all do that stuff. We can't

959
01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we act like we've got one nut and it's the nobody's gonna have this net and there's not enough to go around and we act out of this scarcity mentality.

960
01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:56.820
There's plenty

961
01:51:58.530 --> 01:52:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The freedom that will come when you say it and you name it. It just is like, I gotta keep my eye on that. I'm really sorry. I'm so angry.

962
01:52:05.850 --> 01:52:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this expectation about how this our family life was going to be. And it keeps leaking out in this a passive aggressive way Tony Benn whatever that your this man's name is I am sorry I'm keeping an eye on working on it and

963
01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Then he's got no play. He's just like, you know, wow, okay. Huh, but you're free.

Matthew Montano: That's fine. I'm Chad to

988
01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:43.110
Matthew Montano: At first I was like 12 would work better, because my dad's gonna have to take me to the bank concept to get the loan and whatever and but now I was gonna ask the switch, but oh well. This will work. But so often make this work. Okay.

989
01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.160
Um,

990
01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: How has your mind then. Has it been positive, negative, nice little balance. Where is your little mind of interest and off to and you've been burning and it back.

991
01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:00.990
Matthew Montano: Um I sold my car.

992
01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:09.270
Matthew Montano: So I'm just going through the excitement and I'm getting a nice nice car. So that's just tough stuff.

993
01:55:11.610 --> 01:55:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How exciting.

994
01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:20.100
Matthew Montano: Um, I saw I had like a classic 88 Chevy. It was like all redone like the motor and all that stuff and

995
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:32.160
Matthew Montano: It's taken a lot of gas. And so I was thinking about getting a car that's a little bit more economical but I found a really nice Mustang. You know, one of those like really sexy looking cars.

996
01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:45.510
Matthew Montano: For really good price. And I'm going to test drive that later on. So it's just but that's just been like your excitement of getting something so I really haven't had time to think about too much negative stuff.

997
01:55:47.340 --> 01:56:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And now just I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on the concept of retail therapy for just a second. I'm just want to make sure that this is thought out because you mentioned the gas mileage

998
01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this I'm going to sustain other beliefs that you have. Is this a good investment. I know you're excited but just want to make sure it's not impulsive, that's all just want to touch on that a little bit.

999
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:30.540
Matthew Montano: Um, no. It's actually something I've been thinking about for a while and with like income tax return. And I sold my truck at a really good price. Like I doubled. What I bought it for

1000
01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:43.440
Matthew Montano: So, so this just happens to be a really good deal. So, so I'm not, I'm not making any because I don't want to get myself into debt. So it's nothing like that. Nothing. So it's not like an impulse

1001
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine, fine. So if someone. I'm going to look at the engine, make sure it's in good working order.

1002
01:56:50.250 --> 01:57:02.850
Matthew Montano: Yeah, at five, me and my dad good test drive bit talk to the guy, make sure everything's good with it and we'll take it to look good. The engine checked out to make sure, yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: Fine. Oh, man, what color.

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is a newer one

1009
01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. Oh, fun. Yeah, it's a little girl in it when you hit the accelerator to

Matthew Montano: They also kind of like Camaro like that that type of look of a car.

1012
01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Very fun. Alright, so you've had this to occupy your mind for basically since we last saw each other.

1013
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:57.540
Matthew Montano: Um, I met the guy and the girl about two weeks ago. So this has been going on for a while, and they were interested in buying my truck and they test drove it on

1014
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:15.030
Matthew Montano: Saturday, and then they gave me five $500 down and then today. They gave me the rest of the 2100 so I sold it for 2600 and I bought it for 1100 pretty

1015
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.680
Matthew Montano: Pretty good to

1016
01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, okay. And you have been mentioning at one point, I can't tell that my depression is being affected by this medication. Are you noticing any kind of changes that might be attributed to an antidepressant.

1017
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:44.340
Matthew Montano: I don't want to say, Yeah, because right now I'm just like excited because I like I like toys.

1018
01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.340
Matthew Montano: I'm excited about the car. So again, I'm not going to say it's the medicine. I'm not sure.

1019
01:58:54.090 --> 01:59:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so as far as the prescription goes I'm sending a message to Dr. Solomon and when it is it safe to say that you will be in group on Monday.

1020
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:06.300
Matthew Montano: Yes, for sure.

1021
01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get there.

1022
01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you thinking of talking with him about continuing to go down. If so, how much, if not tell me more.

1023
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.370
Matthew Montano: With the

1024
01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:37.500
Matthew Montano: I just want to give the breakup, a little bit more time of healing before I change any medicine.

1025
01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What did the to have to do with each other.

1026
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:44.040
Matthew Montano: Cuz it that's it's still

1027
01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:49.980
Matthew Montano: The only time it really is hitting me now because it's already been a month and

1028
01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:56.190
Matthew Montano: Two. A month in three weeks, we've been separated

1029
01:59:58.110 --> 02:00:16.980
Matthew Montano: Is when I and I'm when I get home at the end of the night. I do all my stuff I'm focused. I'm happy, I'm home. I'm clean in playing video games, watching a good movie but the when the loneliness will start kicking in, or when I start thinking about him or wondering what he's doing.

1030
02:00:18.690 --> 02:00:25.860
Matthew Montano: And then my mind my mind will start racing with should I get back with him. Can we get back together.

1031
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:44.730
Matthew Montano: Is it a I think I do want to get back with him. Oh wait, no. I remember if I if I really think about him being next to me right now. I'm it's going to make me it's, I'm going to go right back to that point where we were. We just didn't get along. I wasted a year.

1032
02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:53.340
Matthew Montano: Trying to make something work we were talking about marriage. I want a family, you know I wasted a year within

1033
02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you did great. Now I want you to see.

1034

02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:05.370
Matthew Montano: What does that

1036
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it have to do with perspiration.

1037
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:19.890
Matthew Montano: It's not gonna make me it's just referred to get up in the morning if if I have like these two if if it's the withdrawals and the depression.

1038
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1039
02:01:25.230 --> 02:01:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Depression is call it something else. It's not depression. This is, I miss my boyfriend. That's not depression. No one's going to diagnose you with depression. When you have a breakup.

1040
02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.420
Matthew Montano: Yeah, yeah, I'm in my been diagnosed with depression before the

1041
02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel

1042
02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Lonely

1043
02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:53.250
Because there's no one there.

1044
02:01:56.370 --> 02:02:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Depression stays there when boyfriends their depression stays there when new car is there. So just don't like nice and easy. Nice and easy. Don't run and jump away from labels, just hang on yourself. Okay.

1045
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: No more fear.

1046
02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about your fear of success not loneliness feeling some discomfort in the morning isn't about loneliness. And if that's not about depression. This is about sweaty crappy uncomfortable, a little

1047
02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Run don't run away. Stay there.

1048
02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still true that you don't want to feel those things right. That is true. You don't want to feel them. Yeah.

1049
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they, what are the things that you don't want to feel let's let's name it. What don't you want to feel in the morning.

1050
02:02:53.610 --> 02:02:57.240
Matthew Montano: I guess when I take this Suboxone it

1051
02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:09.030
Matthew Montano: While the reason I even started taking the pain pills is because they gave me a boost throughout the day when I was going through a lot of issues in my life and the Suboxone does that now.

1052
02:03:12.210 --> 02:03:15.420
Matthew Montano: And I am ready the taper but

1053
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:22.890
Matthew Montano: Do you think we can do that. Not this Monday, but next Monday.

1054
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But, see if you can answer yourself.

1055
02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You predict into the future, what you'll be less what

1056
02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:40.980
Matthew Montano: I will be less less in a slum, I will call it depression from from the break.

1057
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:45.960
Matthew Montano: In another another week.

1058
02:03:46.590 --> 02:03:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, can you predict that

1059
02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:53.490
Matthew Montano: Because it's gotten better with every day gets better.

1060
02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know, right.

1061
02:03:58.410 --> 02:04:02.190
Matthew Montano: Every day gets better. And this is actually the breakups in the past.

1062
02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:04.380
Matthew Montano: Uh,

1063
02:04:05.670 --> 02:04:20.130
Matthew Montano: I really got screwed over in those and cuz I let myself get into a financial bind with those people. This time I did make the same mistake. So he

1064
02:04:20.850 --> 02:04:32.340
Matthew Montano: You know, had to move back with mom, he had to do that stuff. I was always watching out for myself and I started seeing that it was headed in that direction. So that's why I started pushing myself away from him.

1065
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:47.190
Matthew Montano: And you know, I didn't make the same mistake this time. Yeah. So, this, this, this is just like the hurting of the heart. This isn't like Oh shoot, how am I gonna pay my bills like actually I'm getting a new vehicle now so

1066
02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:51.480
Matthew Montano: Some

02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Get muster the courage to say what it really is. What are you afraid of

1068
02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:11.190
Matthew Montano: Been taking it so law. Well, I'm afraid of doing it. Well, I'm dealing with the walk still kind of dealing with the breakup. Yeah.

1069
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how right first remembrance and it's mine too. Because I think about that kind of pissed at the other program at not addressing this, but it's not unlike most programs.

1070
02:05:22.650 --> 02:05:26.460
Matthew Montano: He's not I found out he got fired that doctor. Yeah.

1071
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:29.550
Matthew Montano: I don't know why I didn't say

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Waiting

Yeah.

1075
02:05:35.730 --> 02:05:36.390
Matthew Montano: Because I actually

1076
02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:45.300
Matthew Montano: Like I said, I started off with to two strips a day and by the middle of the program. He moved me up to three strips. Just because I asked for them.

1077
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But so

1078
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. I know. But notice how you probably

1079
02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Are doing the same requesting here and bright heart, you're not getting the same response. I'm but do we care more about our pocketbook or your healing.

1080
02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:09.300
Matthew Montano: Our healing. Yeah.

1081
02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:10.710
Matthew Montano: Definitely

1082
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: When it be more profitable to have you on three but not that your insurance will pay for it. But wouldn't it be more profitable for by hard to have you on this for the rest of your life.

1083
02:06:19.590 --> 02:06:20.880
Matthew Montano: Yeah, definitely.

1084
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.170
Is that ethical

1085
02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:23.730
Matthew Montano: No.

1086
02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.140
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1087
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Your goal is to not be on this. You aren't on it for blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to fill in the gap give you something to answer back you're on it for this. You just said it.

1088
02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, for a lot of people. Ironically, this depressant.

1089
02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a stimulant for you and for you. It is a psychiatric medication to get you through loneliness.

1090
02:06:55.710 --> 02:07:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You were scared. Well, you and I are working through those issues. You're not the same person you were a year ago.

1091
02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Touched those touched on memories and they will never be the same because you visited them in a different way with me that day and in future days every time you pull something up and you revisit a memory. It changes, believe it or not, it changes.

1092
02:07:30.570 --> 02:07:34.110
Matthew Montano: I oh I just remembered I had a dream last night I was crying in my dream.

1093
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:35.160
Matthew Montano: And I woke up.

1094
02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:42.390
Matthew Montano: And I was crying. I was actually, I was like, Bob, but I was like in and out of the dream, but I was actually like brought balling.

1095
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:52.020
Matthew Montano: And if it felt good. Like, it was like it was like, I think it was because

1096
02:07:53.070 --> 02:08:03.090
Matthew Montano: The dream was a little bit of I don't remember exactly, but I think I was like in a counseling session and and it and it was going in between that and talking to my mom.

1097
02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:11.160
Matthew Montano: Well, yeah. And then I was I was I was crying. And then I woke up and I was actually crying. And then I kept when I woke up, I kept crying.

1098
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that amazing

1099
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:14.460
Yeah.

1100
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:20.610
Matthew Montano: It was like my my body subconsciously letting something out is what it felt like

1101
02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting something out.

1102
02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I send you the message that you can't handle a breakup. How does that serve you. What does that help you

1103
02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:39.870
Matthew Montano: I know I can handle breakup.

1104
02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, convince me

1105
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:44.820
Matthew Montano: Convinced convince you like

1106
02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:48.930
Matthew Montano: I think I'm doing a pretty good job, you said

1107
02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing,

1108
02:08:52.530 --> 02:08:53.610
Matthew Montano: I am

1109
02:08:55.170 --> 02:08:55.920
Matthew Montano: Not

1110
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:59.400
Matthew Montano: Ice I finally realized

1111
02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:01.830
Matthew Montano: I think

1112
02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:21.960
Matthew Montano: What kept us together for so long, was more or less than anything. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Got and in the past, I would run back to that just because I didn't want to be lonely and I am not going to go back to that.

1113
02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:30.660
Matthew Montano: And and it happened, our on our one year anniversary, because I said we're at one year and I

1114
02:09:31.770 --> 02:09:39.000
Matthew Montano: Started every little thing that he would do that. I wasn't going to put up with anymore. I started to

1115
02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:49.980
Matthew Montano: distance myself from him. I'm not talking. He had he needed to fix start fixing those issues you know he's needed to start seeing that I wasn't going to put up with them.

1116
02:09:50.400 --> 02:10:05.910
Matthew Montano: And he didn't. He started getting very angry that I wasn't putting up that those things and forgiving him and and we'd have we'd get mad at each other and then have makeup sex or something and then everything was okay temporarily forgotten that was the cycle with him.

1117
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:10.950
Okay.

1118
02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're also doing what with your time.

1119
02:10:17.850 --> 02:10:23.190
Matthew Montano: I'm working. I'm working working extra hours I am

1120
02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:27.000
Matthew Montano: Building relationships with

1121
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:42.420
Matthew Montano: With friends like my new gym buddy that aren't so intimate I'm working on relationships that aren't so intimate like you told me to do that. And that makes a lot of sense because once cuz I guess. When I get a boyfriend.

1122
02:10:43.890 --> 02:10:46.530
Matthew Montano: I'm very intimate and then

1123
02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:52.260
Matthew Montano: And then that made that's I should, you know, move so fast like that.

1124
02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:59.730
Matthew Montano: Because when it starts becoming so intimate. It's like it makes it so much more scary.

1125
02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:01.500
Matthew Montano: To me.

1126
02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well it preoccupies your attention and then you don't have to attend to areas that maybe need some development.

1127
02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So being alone with yourself.

1128
02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Loneliness in and of itself, like what's the problem with you. Why don't you like your own company, why can't you hang out with you. What's wrong with you, you can you hang out with yourself like

1129
02:11:27.150 --> 02:11:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Little questions right yeah

1130
02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:42.990
Matthew Montano: Well, actually, um, I think that loneliness was just coming from spent because we spend all our time together as time goes on, and I am comfortable being alone.

1131
02:11:43.770 --> 02:11:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Content maybe tightening up having the room just the way you want it. Yeah.

1132
02:11:50.280 --> 02:12:03.690
Matthew Montano: Being if it's cold outside. Been toasty inside watching the movie, you know, I'm proud of my the way my apartment looks. I'm going to have a nice car hopefully by the end of the day.

1133
02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:11.730
Matthew Montano: You know those things make me content because it all falls back into my hard work. Okay, so

1134
02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not uncommon for people to value. What is hard earned

1135
02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Value. What is hard earned

1136
02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you use that mindset.

1137
02:12:32.490 --> 02:12:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: To take pride.

1138
02:12:35.490 --> 02:12:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: In sitting with the fear.

1139
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Of waking up in the morning and having a little discomfort. It's not a lot

1140
02:12:46.110 --> 02:13:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on psychiatric medication you're getting psychotherapy, you're working through some childhood wounds. You weren't doing this before, you're not financially dependent on someone else you're going to the gym you starting to see the wisdom of personal growth before rushing

1141
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Into immersion and fusion of another.

1142
02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing the hard work.

1143
02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was easy.

1144
02:13:16.050 --> 02:13:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't value this this is supposed to be a little uncomfortable. That's how you know you're doing something of value.

1145
02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Tapering

1146
02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A milligram or point two five whichever a small little piece you decide to do

1147
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to the bottom that but you don't get to be proud of it. If you don't do it.

1148
02:13:40.890 --> 02:13:41.370
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1149
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:43.530
Matthew Montano: I was thinking

1150
02:13:46.170 --> 02:13:50.040
Matthew Montano: Since you're pushing me so hard. Okay, so right now I'm taking

1151
02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.300
Matthew Montano: Once one strip and five eighths.

1152
02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.030
Matthew Montano: If I go down.

1153
02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:03.840
Matthew Montano: One of those a style take me down to one and a half strip

1154
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Is convenient also

1155
02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:15.600
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Wait, cuz it's hard cutting that five eight because it's like you got to do a little like doo doo doo thing so

1156
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:20.550
Matthew Montano: If you think that's a good idea.

1157
02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:21.630
Matthew Montano: I guess like

1158
02:14:22.410 --> 02:14:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you just see we're doing the work. Now you're sitting with it. Right. You're like, she asked me that. Look at the soul, she's going to get me to talk

1159
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But I care about your growth.

1160
02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: When you forget who you are, that you're not born to be on Suboxone for the rest of your life, you're not born that way.

1161
02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a self healing system you're bypassing the self healing system by using a substance. You didn't grow up in an environment that could teach you how to go to the self.

1162
02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To nutrition to exercise to spirituality. You need that going to that. Let's remember some of those truths. We're not going to teach our children. Yeah. When you get to

1163
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're either going to smoke weed drink alcohol or text box on. Sorry, I'm very sorry, but that's just the way it is. But I'm going to say that

1164
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:20.040
Matthew Montano: Right.

1165
02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:22.800
Matthew Montano: You said

1166
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:30.540
Matthew Montano: It is scary. It's scary to know that I'll go down even more. And then what about when I'm

1167
02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:34.410
Matthew Montano: To a little bit and I'm not gonna take it like

1168
02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to do that yet.

1169
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:37.200
Matthew Montano: How, how

1170
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You write that everybody does. They want to get ahead and say, Oh my gosh, but we don't have to. All we have to do is this little bit the same way.

1171
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We get our tennis shoes on. We put we put our workout clothes on and we don't have to know whether the gym experience is going to be awesome.

1172
02:15:55.860 --> 02:16:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's worth it. This is where you meet the value of what you're doing it, you're not going to skip over being scared.

1173
02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes scarier than others. You're on a treatment plan that is tapering down. You are not on a taper off treatment plan here it, you are not on a taper off treatment plan right now you understand

1174
02:16:22.650 --> 02:16:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: There may be indeed a holding pattern for quite some time, whatever that number is where you sit here.

1175
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got all the skills you can run a therapy group, you could do therapy, you got this stuff. So under your belt. You're starting to write a book.

1176
02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you still hoping

1177
02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll get there when we get there I have every bit of faith.

1178
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That the work will get an answer. Over time, you're getting way ahead but that's what fear, does it says

1179
02:16:55.410 --> 02:17:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We weren't able to meet this distress before will will will make you think we can do it in the future. But she did you have. It's just the way you remembering it is alone and lonely.

1180
02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your mother was not available to you. And I'm telling you, you're going to do some healing along the way it will not be as terrifying as you think. So one of us has to remember you're forgetting you are enough

1181
02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are healing. No one saying go down to two milligrams

1182
02:17:27.570 --> 02:17:29.790
Matthew Montano: Today or tomorrow. He's saying that

1183
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's important that you say it out loud. Every time you see me every time you go to group as many times as you want to. I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared. I, I don't know.

1184
02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: How

1185
02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: To do that, but it speaks to the value of how hard you are working into the importance of this work. It is not a small thing which you're doing you were enabled for a very long time.

1186
02:17:56.430 --> 02:17:56.760
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1187
02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe in you. I believe in you because you're doing these things.

1188
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:07.740
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1189
02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:09.120
Matthew Montano: I

1190
02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean, do you want a friend to look at you and say, you're basically flawed.

1191
02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:16.800
I

1192
02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean, is that a good friend.

1193
02:18:20.730 --> 02:18:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No good friend says, I know it's scary. Let me take your hand will go. The first mile together and you'll see, and then you'll be leading me and you'll be saying, Come on, why are you holding me back, but you don't have to know what that is today.

1194
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I'm scared.

1195
02:18:42.210 --> 02:18:42.300
I'm

1196
02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be there for you. There's going to be

1197
02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: A recovery of the self. You will remember

1198
02:18:51.090 --> 02:18:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And be so proud. I'm proud. Yeah. Be proud, but it's gonna be hard earned. You gotta earn it.

1199
02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Boom said

1200
02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I inherited a bunch of pretty shiny things I didn't earn them that I don't get to really brag about that too. I know I didn't earn them.

1201
02:19:13.530 --> 02:19:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you get to be proud and you should be of what you're doing in this recovery program.

1202
02:19:22.650 --> 02:19:23.670
Matthew Montano: And they will

1203
02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Try and feed you align their rationalizing. Well, I was just alcohol. So I'm a drug of choice. You're gonna be like

1204
02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that bullshit. I tried it on my therapist didn't work. Don't play a player, listen, you're going to lose it. Okay, you're going to recognize it and be like,

1205
02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This for someone else you'll pass it along. You'll see their strength when they have forgotten.

1206
02:19:55.470 --> 02:20:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: around people that see what you're capable of not missing.

1207
02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: missing anything. There's something wrong with you.

1208
02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To be sad, you're grieving this dream. You're supposed to be sad.

1209
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Dream a whole life of this beautiful attractive man. Wouldn't it be great if he was also all these other things and we can have a family, you're

1210
02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Not pathological as human means you know how love means you you have hopes and you put them out there.

1211
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:41.460
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1212
02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad, man.

1213
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't skip over we get sad, we feel deeply

1214
02:20:55.440 --> 02:21:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be doing it differently than the way you did it when you were a little boy, you're going to be doing it differently than you did with other classes. Yeah.

1215
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:10.320
Matthew Montano: And I think depression medication might have to be a part of the process because

1216
02:21:11.850 --> 02:21:32.550
Matthew Montano: Just from the, the, I can just remember from when I was really young, maybe middle school just having a negative mindset, a lot like, you know, looking at negative things more than positive things because that's the way my mom was. And that's, that's how I you know I kind of was

1217
02:21:34.530 --> 02:21:34.890
Matthew Montano: You know,

1218
02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you, you're

1219
02:21:38.610 --> 02:21:41.520
Matthew Montano: My dad that really positive person, you know, so, but

1220
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:43.320
Matthew Montano: But it seems like

1221
02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:44.520
The perpetrates

1222
02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see the problem.

1223
02:21:53.310 --> 02:22:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Your solutions repeatedly our medication. You can see the problem, intellectually, this was shaped by these people and what makes you think

1224
02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That the scars that were inner personal are going to be medicinal scars. The wounding or inner personal medicinal answer. Wait a minute, why is it that you can't try on the idea that if the wounding if the cut so deeply for Inner personal

1225
02:22:20.850 --> 02:22:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would they be

1226
02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:23.490
Matthew Montano: Will. Will I

1227
02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:36.150
Matthew Montano: Yeah, will I learn how to, like, okay, so say I'm working like, you know, I work my job at FedEx and

1228
02:22:38.370 --> 02:22:41.160
Matthew Montano: I'm really good. I would say

1229
02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:44.820
Matthew Montano: In smaller groups of people are one on one.

1230
02:22:45.720 --> 02:23:00.840
Matthew Montano: But like when there's a big group. And everybody's like, you know, acting like fools, stuff like that. I can't, can't do that. I feel like I would be back. I can't, I can't fake that it doesn't come natural to me. I'm kind of like

1231
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:15.090
Matthew Montano: You know, you know what I mean, like at the end of the day when we're done with our work, we have I work with guys ever heard of me and stuff and and and there's the two girls. I worked with in my office are. Those are the only two girls that work there.

1232
02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:38.100
Matthew Montano: Them to date they they're real playful and stuffing it playful and stuff. And I feel like sometimes I'll be my mind will be in a state of thinking about something in the future or thinking about something that happened in the past. I can't be in the moment, a lot of the time.

1233
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: NASA, Matt.

1234
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of pieces you just talked about. Let's just, let's just pick one. If you prefer to be with small groups of people and you prefer one on one. Nothing broken about that.

1235
02:23:53.340 --> 02:24:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you prefer to be around mid tour people. Nothing wrong with that you get to have your preference what meaning do you lay go nice and slow, what meaning. DO YOU MAKE OF LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE acting like idiots. I don't want to play play doesn't look like that to me.

1236
02:24:14.940 --> 02:24:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning you do something inside your head about that as I don't quite know what that is. So they're silly because

1237
02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:30.600
Matthew Montano: They're being silly. At the end of the day, they've done their work. They're good workers and then they're just like

1238
02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:42.210
Matthew Montano: You know now how I look at this. Just joking around about some bullshit and about something and I look at that and I want to be like that. I want to be able to just I want to be like that.

1239
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm want to be silly.

1240
02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:51.870
Matthew Montano: I want to be more playful when when when the time at the right times and it's

1241
02:24:53.490 --> 02:25:00.240
Matthew Montano: Like, I'm a war World War II war and I feel like I go into work like this is a mission, you know,

1242
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:07.140
Matthew Montano: It's instead of like, I can't, I don't, I can't like enjoy it.

1243
02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is new information. I'm glad we're touching on it. I don't know that we'll have a lot of lot of time to get into it. Some make some notes, you're not able to go into work and enjoy it. Where's your mind usually focus. It's not just task oriented like

1244
02:25:27.390 --> 02:25:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When what time during the workday. Does the worry switch on

1245
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:50.190
Matthew Montano: As soon as soon as I get up and start getting ready for work. I'm like, just task oriented, and that's what that's what keeps my mind from being able to focus on something funny tell a little joke to lighten up the mood. You know what I mean. Well,

1246
02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So here, let's cross cross reference

1247
02:25:54.780 --> 02:26:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The way full up in group. Um, let's put those on different screens. There's you go in into work well.

1248
02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:07.980
Matthew Montano: Real quick, I'm gonna have to plug in my phone because it's 10%

1249
02:26:20.730 --> 02:26:22.290
Matthew Montano: I'm right here I'm just plugging in my phone.

1250
02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting those two different screens. When you're ready,

1251
02:26:39.330 --> 02:26:41.100
Just get something plugged in first.

1252
02:26:47.490 --> 02:26:48.540
Matthew Montano: Okay, we're connected

1253
02:26:50.010 --> 02:26:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So on one side, I want you to remember because I've only seen you in two settings wanting group and what

1254
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.890
Matthew Montano: What

1255
02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I've only seen you in group and individual therapy. I haven't seen you at work. So, I have no idea. I haven't seen you out. I don't know what you look like.

1256
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I haven't checked in and said, How you feeling, so I don't know. So, picture. There's a group of people in group right

1257
02:27:22.530 --> 02:27:29.280
Matthew Montano: Picture what you're thinking how you're feeling just get into that for a month. What I mean group.

1258
02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:32.130
Picture it

1259
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:34.410
Are you picturing

1260
02:27:35.490 --> 02:27:35.880
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1261
02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's the emotion you feel

1262
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:46.260
Matthew Montano: You know, when we went through that thing about manipulation.

1263
02:27:49.410 --> 02:27:57.090
Matthew Montano: I do like I answered a lot of those questions. Yes. And I was embarrassed to say it, but I still do a lot of those things.

1264
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

1265
02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's okay.

1266
02:28:04.050 --> 02:28:06.210
Matthew Montano: And it's because I think my

1267
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:11.310
Matthew Montano: Being I think I got my mom. She was a big manipulator, you know,

1268
02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a skill, man.

1269
02:28:17.730 --> 02:28:18.210
Matthew Montano: It's like

1270
02:28:18.510 --> 02:28:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You're. It's a skill. Sometimes we turn on a charm. We asked questions were the smartest kid in the room. That's what you are, you're very charming and you're the smartest client in there and you've got lots to say you're fantastic and I see what you're doing.

1271
02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:35.370
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

1272
02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:53.700
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I'm really yeah really I turned on that charm and then in real life. I'm really charming. I can turn that on and then I'm confident in the way I look. I'm not saying I'm the most gorgeous person in the world. And I have this great confidence. I think I'm perfect.

1273
02:28:58.770 --> 02:29:07.050
Matthew Montano: And you know, I can turn that on. But when I'm tired when I'm having an issue like you know is

1274
02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, let me do my job for you.

1275
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to be charming everybody enjoys it you get lots of nice responses. And you also get a little bit afraid that honesty, you said in group you actually said, I think a lot of these are yeses. I think I'm still doing them actually do say some really honest things in there.

1276
02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:35.700
Matthew Montano: And sometimes my child meanness, um,

1277
02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:55.650
Matthew Montano: Can you know you have those people are more jealous. Get, get that at work. You know, I work with a lot of people, so like I work with other guys who like I guess sometimes when I'm charming. They might feel intimidated by me. Okay, so, um,

1278
02:29:56.940 --> 02:30:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now switch pictures switch over to picturing it group have you registered intimidating anyone someone getting jealous when you were

1279
02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The best client.

1280
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:19.380
Matthew Montano: Knowing group. It's different because it's over a screen. I don't know exactly how looking because I always want to present myself as looking good.

1281
02:30:20.610 --> 02:30:27.600
Matthew Montano: And then I'm I'm it's it's this. I hate video chatting, like I said,

1282
02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you notice anyone being jealous.

1283
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:37.710
Matthew Montano: No, not a group because in group one thing that is running through my mind is, if I look okay look okay

1284
02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:40.380
Okay.

1285
02:30:43.770 --> 02:30:48.330
Matthew Montano: Do I look okay do I sound okay and I'm thinking, I want to

1286
02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:51.900
Matthew Montano: say the right thing.

1287
02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we do.

1288
02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:59.100
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I feel like I need to see the right beings.

1289
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:04.260
Matthew Montano: To come across. I always want to put out my best.

1290
02:31:05.610 --> 02:31:06.540
Matthew Montano: My best self.

1291
02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, slowly.

1292
02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to say the right thing because saying the wrong thing with resulting what

1293
02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:22.140
Matthew Montano: In a room, you get off dad.

1294
02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:29.700
Matthew Montano: Maybe somebody's thinking, oh, he, he looked

1295
02:31:31.410 --> 02:31:37.290
Matthew Montano: He looked a certain way, but he's not really that way or something. You don't mean

1296
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone looked at you.

1297
02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you don't know what I'd be thinking, but I'm sitting here and I'm thinking something

1298
02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you concerned about me being misunderstood.

1299
02:31:57.120 --> 02:31:57.870
Matthew Montano: You or

1300
02:32:00.330 --> 02:32:03.150
Matthew Montano: Am I concerned about me being misunderstood.

1301
02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:04.950
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1302
02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:23.490
Matthew Montano: Misunderstood or judged because I'm very confident in myself now. But I was teased pretty versus the I hung out with God. Like I played sports hung out with guys but like

1303
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:41.220
Matthew Montano: I, it wasn't like bullying like they were my, my friends were teasing me for being gay. And this was like they would tease this would they would call everybody game and stuff, but I actually was gay. So it would like it would automatically shut me down.

1304
02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:43.770
Matthew Montano: You know,

1305
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on, hold on.

1306
02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're in group.

1307
02:32:51.060 --> 02:33:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are charming and you fill the air time air time went right okay you get what like 20 seconds to talk in these groups like nothing but whatever. So there you are. You got your air time. Finally she calls on me. It's my turn. I'm up

1308
02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:09.630
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1309
02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:11.190
Matthew Montano: Okay.

1310
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: With the smartest, the most insightful thing that you can say

1311
02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What you don't say is for also

1312
02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear it.

1313
02:33:34.530 --> 02:33:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If you decide

1314
02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To practice the skill.

1315
02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Of sharing vulnerability. Instead, instead of being my star student

1316
02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:47.430
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1317
02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad saying,

1318
02:33:53.850 --> 02:33:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: This program pisses me off.

1319
02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you and I were in a confrontation or what if you caught someone else being superficial and overly saccharin and turning. What if you picked up on something and you had a thought.

1320
02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you decided not to bring it up, but maybe you brought in here and you talk to me about it. Maybe you recognize it in somewhere else. Maybe you saw someone else's vulnerability and you just say this is too much for me today.

1321
02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so angry. Something's getting triggered in me. I'm really sad and you don't talk at all. You never get to say something smart and witty and charming. But you get to pay attention to yourself. You don't know what's going to happen if you do that if you haven't done it.

1322
02:34:44.490 --> 02:34:46.440
Matthew Montano: Mm hmm. When I do I

1323
02:34:47.610 --> 02:34:50.250
Matthew Montano: I do edit myself a lot

1324
02:34:52.350 --> 02:35:11.520
Matthew Montano: And and I do want to be more vulnerable vulnerable because that becomes across as more relatable, because I can, I can go out with that charm like that comes very natural to me. I'm any even manipulation, sometimes, but

1325
02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.320
Matthew Montano: That isn't always relatable. So sometimes

1326
02:35:16.530 --> 02:35:16.890
I wonder

1327
02:35:18.210 --> 02:35:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Why we're talking about relatable, because right now we're holding onto group. You think you're going somewhere else with it just

1328
02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:35.520
Matthew Montano: No, no, no. Because, uh, cuz sometimes I do edit myself and grew and I don't let that vulnerability out and people don't maybe aren't going to relate to me.

1329
02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want people to relate to you.

1330
02:35:40.530 --> 02:35:42.180
Matthew Montano: Yeah, okay.

1331
02:35:43.170 --> 02:35:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a part of you that also doesn't want to go to group right

1332
02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.500
Matthew Montano: Yeah, cuz it's makes you feel uncomfortable. Yeah.

1333
02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:58.110
And something important happening there.

1334
02:36:01.980 --> 02:36:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's something important when we're at that edge. There's no way you can wiggle around it. When we're something's getting moved around. We're getting a nervous stomach. We're, we're like, oh, look, oh my gosh, I swear. My mouth is moving. I don't even know what I'm saying, I'm just like,

1335
02:36:20.310 --> 02:36:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, I'm doing it again.

1336
02:36:24.330 --> 02:36:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to get that same AHA experience in here as you are in

1337
02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can if you want to use that as a learning opportunity to catch yourself and say, Wait, doing what I always did.

1338
02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to light.

1339
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:49.380
I wanna

1340
02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to be caught off guard and somebody make fun of me. So I'm going to fill it with all these words, all these smart words.

1341
02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to fit in.

1342
02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But at what cost. And so then you sit within a little longer, and you're quiet and you say, oh, at what cost. I don't get to be a mess. I don't get to cry.

1343
02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think

1344
02:37:16.770 --> 02:37:41.940
Matthew Montano: My defense mechanism is a is a sorry is a sometimes in large groups just being charming and coming in like seeing the right joke at the right time. Like it's calculated and I come across as mysterious and that's become like a defense mechanism, I guess, in large groups.

1345
02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:47.700
Matthew Montano: Because I'm scared I'm scared of being judged. I'm scared of being made fun of.

1346
02:37:48.090 --> 02:37:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so now move over to the other screen.

1347
02:37:51.540 --> 02:38:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're at work. You're tired, Matt, I can tell you have quite a work ethic. Okay, you are working very hard. You got that down, you can focus your attention, you get the job done. You're tired.

1348
02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens if you are aloof and quiet. Look at my face.

1349
02:38:19.290 --> 02:38:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: How what emotion. Do you think I'm having just based on this face.

1350
02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:29.760
Matthew Montano: Just focus or serious

1351
02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. And if someone was insecure around me. All right, what else might it be

1352
02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:43.260
Matthew Montano: This you like me, does this dis you like me should probably hates me.

1353

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. It's just got really bad.

1356
02:38:56.730 --> 02:39:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want people to see that on your face.

1357
02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:02.550
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1358
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen. What's the worst thing that could happen at work. First thing, don't censor what might happen if they think you've got that serious angry face what might happen.

1359
02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:30.750
Matthew Montano: Well, cuz I especially with women. Um, and I work with women because I work in an office, there's three of us at FedEx, there's one that she is always watching me and I might just be so stressed out. And I'm like,

1360
02:39:32.370 --> 02:39:43.920
Matthew Montano: You know, and she's constantly like she's looking at me like I have a master plan or something like I'm trying to take her out. So she's like, you know, she's

1361
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how funny. This sounds

1362
02:39:53.190 --> 02:40:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she's looking at me, I'm looking at her. She's going to me, she's thinking I got a master plan. I'm looking at her, look at her. She's going to be still going to be she's thinking I'm thinking I've got a master plan.

1363
02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What a bunch of mind reading. What's up with that.

1364
02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that you

1365
02:40:18.810 --> 02:40:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Are looking at her face. Let's just start there.

1366
02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:22.890
Matthew Montano: And

1367
02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, what is it her face. That is a threat to you. What is it about this woman's personality. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS WOMAN THAT IS A THREAT TO YOU JUST TRYING TO CATCH IT

1368
02:40:36.330 --> 02:40:52.020
Matthew Montano: BECAUSE I WORK. I WORK WITH HER all day because there's we have our office. We each have our desk. There's three desks. So I work with her all day right next to her. So we work together or the or the the

1369
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:55.560
Matthew Montano: Whatever foundation or whatever won't work.

1370
02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:08.640
Matthew Montano: But the rest of the people we work with our drivers. So they come in, but you guys just like me and she's super nice to them. She treats me differently.

1371
02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's work it backwards. That's the story.

1372
02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try it. If I'm her right with me if I'm her

1373
02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel

1374
02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When I treat you.

1375
02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:27.810
Different

1376
02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel around me when I treat you differently. It

1377
02:41:37.530 --> 02:41:39.150
Matthew Montano: Makes me feel a

1378
02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:42.330
Matthew Montano: Kind of makes me feel sad.

1379
02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:44.130
Oh,

1380
02:41:47.370 --> 02:42:00.900
Matthew Montano: No. Well, not necessarily. Not, not okay so I'm going back, not to be honest. No, it makes me pissed off because I'm at work. I'm working my ass off. Why are you making my job partner.

1381
02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait.

1382
02:42:03.210 --> 02:42:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if that's made up.

1383
02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I will. I don't know yet. Let's see. And then we're going to have to go. How is she making your job harder. What is she going out of her way to do to make your job harder.

1384
02:42:18.930 --> 02:42:31.950
Matthew Montano: Because there's been a few times we've gotten into because she there's the lady like my desk is here. She's right here. And the lady that's worked there for years, but she works the mornings is right behind me, I'm

1385
02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:38.550
Matthew Montano: Deseret is her name. She, she's trained me but um

1386
02:42:39.570 --> 02:42:48.330
Matthew Montano: She kind of threw me to the woods, you know, she she showed me everything once we have to learn like 15 or 20 different programs and you have to get it right the first time.

1387
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:59.520
Matthew Montano: There's been times when I didn't get something right because she's still don't understand a lot of what she's doing when I wouldn't get something right, or I'd be like, just, hey Deseret

1388
02:43:00.930 --> 02:43:06.000
Matthew Montano: This is this time is a 1526 right yes or no question.

1389
02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:17.400
Matthew Montano: She gets she got up. One time I showed you this three times already, and she got up. She slammed her chair next to me. You gotta get this yelling or the manager can hear.

1390
02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:26.670
Matthew Montano: You're if you're not, you got to get this the first time it seems like you're not getting nothing. You're not getting nothing I'm teaching you. She literally had an outburst like that.

1391
02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:36.300
Matthew Montano: I went back at are like desert with i that is not professional, you do not talk to me like that when we got into a big yelling match.

1392
02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:46.590
Matthew Montano: We both had to go into the idea. I told you about this. We both had to go into the office and talk it out, she kind of has the issue and in the office. And then she started crying.

1393
02:43:48.510 --> 02:43:57.780
Matthew Montano: I need help. I need, and he keeps asking me these questions and I don't add it was a yes she could have said yes or no, and it would have been solved.

1394
02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there's a lot. There's a lot going on right and that type of person right there. There's something going on in there.

1395
02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:21.870
Matthew Montano: She's she what what it was is when I first started. I'm the manager likes me a lot more she felt threatened by me. I know that's what it is because the manager started giving me telling her let Matt do that today let Matt do that today.

1396
02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:29.190
Matthew Montano: You go home Deseret Matt's gonna work do this today because she she you know

1397
02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You have compassion for for in her insecurity.

1398
02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:45.480
Matthew Montano: And I do I try my hardest to sue.

1399
02:44:47.070 --> 02:44:48.420
You didn't sit there in law.

1400
02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: She's insecure, which is a story. You just told it is something you and as well.

1401
02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:05.070
Matthew Montano: uncomfortable position to be in.

1402
02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:07.320
Everything.

1403
02:45:08.370 --> 02:45:09.480
But we're insecure.

1404
02:45:13.230 --> 02:45:13.710
Matthew Montano: Everything.

1405
02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:19.230
Yeah.

1406
02:45:22.140 --> 02:45:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't feel sorry for her no compassion. There's just your sadness and frankly moving forward into anger, we're going to wrap it up right now. But listen, it could be that you do this already sent the email your medications already sent in. Um,

1407
02:45:39.570 --> 02:45:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You could decide today, tomorrow when you go in. I'm going to go about this a little differently.

1408
02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to have compassion for her. I'm going to relate to her in my mind when I put my

1409
02:45:54.270 --> 02:46:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Shields down and I'm imagine what it would be like to be afraid.

1410
02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Of losing a job, losing respect.

1411
02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Gary and I have compassion for her.

1412
02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you talk, the energy that spent might change.

1413
02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: People are scared they're nasty.

1414
02:46:22.290 --> 02:46:25.710
Matthew Montano: And and and she has a kid. So she uses that

1415
02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:32.400
Matthew Montano: See that's it's tough sometimes because in in a career environment.

1416
02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:44.130
Matthew Montano: Sometimes people use that, you know, like I have, I have to take care of my kid or this, that, and I don't have a kid, you know, it should. It's just like, and then they look at me as just some selfish guy that's trying to make a bunch of money.

1417
02:46:44.490 --> 02:46:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no.

1418
02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna get into that now you have every right to earn a living and enjoy it. Get that car. Have fun. Absolutely. You know, so there's something. There's something something about

1419
02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, we, we can cram it all into 60 seconds here so

1420
02:47:06.210 --> 02:47:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your takeaway from today. What are you going to do with this. What, what do you need to sort of marinate in a little bit longer. We need to get into the dream, but what do you need to sit with a little bit

1421
02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.010
Matthew Montano: I'm going to try and have compassion.

1422
02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:38.100
Matthew Montano: Time trial and figure out why someone might be acting the way they're acting because obviously if they're shooting me that way they're probably threatened by yeah

1423
02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Just that alone. Now, I wouldn't go to the lie. All I'm saying is

1424
02:47:47.490 --> 02:47:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to have compassion. This is another human being on this planet that you sit right next to

1425
02:47:55.170 --> 02:47:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You might just be better at your job and her

1426
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Friend.

1427
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.740
Matthew Montano: Not sure.

1428
02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: She might hold on.

1429
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:09.420
Matthew Montano: Excuse me.

1430
02:48:15.450 --> 02:48:17.820
Matthew Montano: Like what is that like a stress relief thing for you.

1431
02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Know. Okay, I gotta go. It is not, I have an air condition, it is not a stress relief. I've tried to tell everybody that I'm trying to relieve an immense amount of pressure in my ears.

1432
02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I got her start this group right away, Matt. The job is not to figure out why.

1433
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just try on being compassionate, because that's where two human beings can overlap. She's having a hard time she's scared.

1434
02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Her nastiness her vindictiveness might be coming from there, just get that far. Don't go to this, let's figure out why if you can just give to compassion. You can find your own and yourself too. I've been scared.

1435
02:48:58.770 --> 02:49:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been scared that if my truth comes out.

1436
02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The very thing that I enjoy all my friendships my reputation, the enjoyment of sports, the image. All of this will disappear. You do know fear of judgment. Okay. You do know it just even holding that compassion for another human being.

1437
02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You can give it to yourself to we can calm down in that moment that's as far as I want you to get don't that other stuff, you and I can do it together, just see if you can do that.

1438
02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of spending time being angry and being threatened being sad. Just hold compassion and if you can also see I too have been manipulative

1439
02:49:44.010 --> 02:49:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can hold those two things you'll get your power back. Okay, just do some invitation, do some homework with it up. See, see how it goes. Let's schedule another time. To me, you're going to be in group next Monday. Right.

1440
02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:03.300
