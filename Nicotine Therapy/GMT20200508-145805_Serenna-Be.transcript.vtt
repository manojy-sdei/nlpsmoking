Okay.

30
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.940

31
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.190

33
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:51.300
Serenna Beers: And I mean, personally, when I was getting into trouble with it I it didn't dawn on me that it had become an issue until you know I was where you were at not for as long, but I was still there. And I was like, How did I end up here like, Wow, I really, there's something wrong.

42
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.440
iPad: Level one. And then they said I needed to do another one.

43
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.370
iPad: And that's why

44
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.840
iPad: I've been

45
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.680

56
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:20.760
Serenna Beers: You know, it takes takes a lot, especially when you go from being instead of to analyze. I mean, I remember it took me five years to bounce back only after two years stand so I can't even imagine what it must have done for you after 17 years

57
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.480

iPad: Um, I was mainly raised by my mother.

63
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.640
iPad: And, you know, step boyfriends were around my dad was in prison.

64
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.330
iPad: Okay, so, um, she

65
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.430
Serenna Beers: Uses as well.

66
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.400

69
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.370
iPad: Um, I don't really know.

70
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.840
iPad: Him.

71
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.860
But, uh,

72
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:33.930
iPad: My mom was awesome. She did the best she could, you know, and wasn't hers, the dudes in her life that affected me

73
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.580
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

74
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.900
iPad: You try to protect me from

75
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.270
iPad: Me. Oh.

76
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.770
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

77
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.890
Serenna Beers: Wish I could say I didn't, but I do

78
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.900
Serenna Beers: What about did anybody in your home. I did you, you didn't say whether you had brothers or sisters

79
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.490
iPad: Yes, I have two sisters

80
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.210
Serenna Beers: Okay, and what is your relationship like with them.

81
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:14.190
Serenna Beers: I'm pretty close. That's good. Yeah, support is everything in this in this deal when you're walking a life of recovery, because you know sobriety is a choice and anybody can make a choice to get off of the substances. But it's that lifestyle that has to change as you know

82
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.960
Serenna Beers: You have to not hang around the same people. You have to start to learn how to think differently.

83
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:32.250
Serenna Beers: The criminality has to go. I mean, all of those things. And those are things over the years that are just ingrained in you. Right. And so, learning how to live in society on societal terms to the best of our ability to be

84
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.040
Serenna Beers: for lack of better terms and

85
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:46.290
Serenna Beers: an upstanding citizen, you know, is is can be difficult, especially when you know you you you learn to

86
00:06:47.580 --> 00:07:00.120
Serenna Beers: It's difficult because when you have a problem with authority and you're kind of, you know, just you're under the control of someone else. So I you know I can't even imagine support is everything. That's all.

87
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.520
Serenna Beers: Yeah, so that's good.

88
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.960

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.940
iPad: Um, my older sister suffers from Mental Health and Addiction. She's been clean for 12 years

92
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.380
Serenna Beers: Good for her.

93
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.920

Serenna Beers: Nasty felonies on there. And so, you know, it really does something to your self esteem. But you have to remember that that was not you. This is not you now that was you, then, and no matter what, or no matter how somebody judges you, you know, I don't know if you have faith or not, but

150
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.960
Serenna Beers: If you do, you know, there's only one judge and it's your higher power and nobody else has the right to

151
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:50.730
Serenna Beers: judge you, but that takes time, right, that takes time to really let that sink in that really, it's not anybody else's business or it's not up to anybody else to create your happiness and your happy ending. It's really up to you. So I applaud you for you just got to keep going. Right.

152
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.290
iPad: Now,

153
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.060
iPad: With no cigarettes today.

154
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.800
Serenna Beers: Oh, you are

155
00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:02.280
Serenna Beers: Yeah. Wow. Wow. That's in and of itself is something to brag about. Holy crap. So are you like

156
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.310
Serenna Beers: Are you irritable, or are you bitchy or yeah

157
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.240
iPad: Or yeah, I'm sweating, your energy.

158
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.600
iPad: I'm using the patches also. Oh, good.

159
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.320
iPad: But he's helping

160
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.740
Serenna Beers: Tell me, what made you want to do that.

161
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.750
iPad: I was watching TV with my mom and the stupid commercial came on and just rang my bell

162
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:28.800
iPad: About this guy haven't heart cancer or some from smoking and his wife said something like, you know,

163
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.960
iPad: If he's hurting or something. I don't. I just something. There's a commercial

164
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.370
Serenna Beers: Something happened. Yeah.

165
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.240
iPad: Everything and you so I'm going to stop.

166
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.760
iPad: And that was it. I wouldn't bought a box of patches and

167
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.270
Serenna Beers: Wow. See, look at your strength.

168
00:13:45.720 --> 00:14:01.050
Serenna Beers: That's why I am proud of you and hopefully when I check back in with you that I i'm going to hear that you're still going. But here's what I want to say to you, okay, because, as you know, especially us recovering addicts. Nobody can beat us up better than we beat ourselves up like

169
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.920
Serenna Beers: Literally, nobody, nobody can tear my self worth down better than me. And with that negative self talk

170
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:20.070
Serenna Beers: Even after 14 and a half years. I can get into my head and I am the worst mother. Look what I did to my older kids. How could I do that. Look at the way I think I'm crazy. I mean, all kinds of shit, you know that you

171
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:39.630
Serenna Beers: Think about yourself. And so you have to really just rise above that. And remember that if you fall it's okay because as long as you're trying you're moving forward. And that's what you want to do is always have that forward motion, even if you stumble along the way. Okay.

172
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.420
Serenna Beers: So I just want to encourage you there. Are you in a relationship at this time.

173
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.270
Serenna Beers: No. Do you have any kids.

174
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.500
Serenna Beers: Nope, okay. And you said you live with mom.

175
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.210
Serenna Beers: Yep. Okay.

176
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.070
Serenna Beers: Tell me.

177
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:09.900
Serenna Beers: Frank what you what you hope to maybe get out of being with with us, maybe, maybe some skills or some some things that you want to work on things I can help you with to support you. I

178
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.250
iPad: Have a hard time communicating

179
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.650
iPad: Okay, there's something I need to work on you.

180
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.180
iPad: Um,

181
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:17.910
iPad: I just

182
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.680
iPad: I just, I'm just finding myself so so

183
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:23.940
Okay.

184
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:34.050
iPad: You know, every day is a battle really yeah yeah it's worse up there than it is out here, but I just hope to maintain my

185
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.970
iPad: Sobriety and stay alive and be with my family.

186
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:46.110
iPad: Yeah, I couldn't do it without being on my meds. So at this point, you know,

187
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.390
Serenna Beers: Tell me, tell me the meds that they had, have you on

188
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.910
iPad: Right now what am i right now.

189
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.980
iPad: I'm on the tutor and

190
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.160
iPad: My subjects.

191
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.030
Okay.

192
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.990
Serenna Beers: What do they have you on the lead two to four. I know that's a

193
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.020
iPad: Mom diagnosed as bipolar.

194
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.710
Now,

195
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.360
Serenna Beers: Okay.

196
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:18.540
Serenna Beers: What happens when you when you go into a bipolar episode, are you more manic or you more depressive

197
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.280
iPad: More depressive

198
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.090
Serenna Beers: Okay.

199
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:28.710
iPad: Once in a while I get a little manic, I haven't. I did the other day. Um, when I first started squint and I went nuts in your garage, but

200
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.100
Serenna Beers: Laughing Because

201
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.270
Serenna Beers: I understand I'm

202
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.490
Serenna Beers: Not laughing at you I'm laughing with you.

203
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.830
iPad: I totally get it.

204
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.120
Yeah.

205
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.980
Serenna Beers: Okay.

206
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.030
iPad: I get. I get more

207
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.440
iPad: Like a hermit, you know, and just student

208
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.140
iPad: But it's real loud. Up here, you know,

209
00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:02.910
Serenna Beers: Yeah, they have this video the other day I sometimes watch, there's this lady that I watch and she's called juggling the Jenkins.

210
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:09.750
Serenna Beers: And she's so funny. And she's a recovering addict, just like us. I, I really like to stay close to

211
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:21.240
Serenna Beers: I call it. My people and My people are those that are, you know, going through the same thing as anybody who's in re recovery. The struggle is real. It really, really is.

212
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:40.980
Serenna Beers: And I think the biggest problem is we get in the way of ourselves because of those voices and she does this skit. It's hilarious and it talks about so she has all these different voices. So it shows different clips of her but she's portraying depression isolation anxiety.

213
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.330
Serenna Beers: There was another one, anger, fear, it's so freaking funny and I laugh because

214
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:56.190
Serenna Beers: That's an everyday battle, even after all this, this, this time, but coming to a place of where I can just accept me for who I am.

215
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:08.310
Serenna Beers: Because let's face it, we do a lot of damage when we do drugs we mess up our brain to think that we're, we're going to come out smelling like a rose, and there was no damage done is is is irrational, in and of itself. Right.

216
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:15.180
Serenna Beers: And and and so that's one of the things you know i don't know what kinds of things that you do to keep yourself going

217
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:31.050
Serenna Beers: But I would recommend honestly finding something to stay out of that to stay on your head to quiet those voices, because you've either got the recovery voice or you've got the attic voice and they're always battling they just sit right right here. They're just chatting away.

218
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:31.710
Older

219
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.940
Serenna Beers: And obviously you listen to the one that's the loudest so you need to feed the one that you want to hear you know if you want to

220
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.760
Serenna Beers: Be in that nasty place you feed all the negative self talk, you know, you know, I do weird stuff like right on my

221
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:50.730
Serenna Beers: Mirror still, you know, I love me, you know, I'm the best that that I that I can be all those

222
00:18:51.180 --> 00:19:00.000
Serenna Beers: silly things, but those silly, silly things really do make a difference because it's really about trying to find a place of homeostasis, which is balance.

223
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.480
Serenna Beers: And folks in early recovery just really struggle with the balance, you're either all the way over here.

224
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:19.920
Serenna Beers: Or you're all the way over here. There's no like in the middle, you know, and so I would really just caught caution you, and I believe that you said that you are helping to take care of your mom. Right. Yeah.

225
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:29.790
Serenna Beers: So, you know, you have to make sure that you're really trying to take care of yourself, Frank, because your self care is absolutely vital in this battle, as you know, right.

226
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.740
Serenna Beers: Yeah, so

227
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:46.560
Serenna Beers: And part of that is taking care of your health. And it sounds like you're really starting to like really take the bull by the horns. And so I just, I really want to just wish you the best on your journey and get giving up nicotine.

228
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.440
Serenna Beers: Okay, so you said communicating and then you said something else. I forget after that.

229
00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:00.420
iPad: Uh, just finding me you know where I fit. I don't know. I'm just lost. Okay.

230
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.440
Serenna Beers: When you say I am just last

231
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:15.840
Serenna Beers: Is it like you're going through your day and all. And all of a sudden you'll just kind of sit and you'll think to yourself,

232
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.720
Serenna Beers: What am I

233
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.320
Serenna Beers: What am what what's happening here, is this really my life.

234
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.610
iPad: Every day.

235
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.260
Serenna Beers: Every day. Yep.

236
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.300
Serenna Beers: Okay. Um, do you journal at all. I'm sure you've learned about that.

237
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.490
iPad: Yeah but and but I haven't been

238
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.570
Okay.

239
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.880
iPad: There's been at home, we're in the process of moving houses so

240
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.770
iPad: Okay, packing.

241
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.540
Serenna Beers: Busy with that stuff.

242
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.070
iPad: Keep library cell. Yeah.

243
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:56.970
Serenna Beers: Yeah, well, I'm going to put a little star by that because I want to recommend that. And the reason I say that is because even after all this time.

244
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:06.870
Serenna Beers: I'm pretty consistent I journal, at least four to five times a week. If I don't, it's because I'm so tired from work or just because I just, I just don't, but I still do it four to five times.

245
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.500
iPad: A week

246
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.460
Serenna Beers: And it really does help. It helps get what's going on up here out

247
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:22.500
Serenna Beers: So that you can sleep restfully even if you just journal a sentence Journaling is a way, it's another form of your brain releasing toxicity. That's kind of going on up here.

248
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:38.460
Serenna Beers: And that's a huge help. Because when you feel rested, you're more productive and more productive and more ways than just being alert your productive in your mind. You know you. It's like a form of D cluttering I might have days where I journaled four and five.

249
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:50.700
Serenna Beers: Pages, I might have days where I just say today was a good day and and and that's it. And I might draw my little rainbow or my stick folks, or I might, you know, but it's just it's

250
00:21:51.180 --> 00:22:01.020
Serenna Beers: It's staying in that habit of writing things down so that it doesn't clutter my mind and it allows me for my system to reboot. You know what I mean.

251
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.580
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay. So I am going to just write that down. I get that you're moving

252
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:21.570
Serenna Beers: But I short, I assure you it takes five minutes. And if you can sit in your in your bed at night and watch TV or scroll on your phone or whatever you do, you can give the gift of your to yourself of five minutes of relieving yourself from all this stuff that's flying around up here, right.

253
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:31.710
Serenna Beers: Yeah, they say the research shows we have what is it like 60,000 thoughts, a day and I can't even wrap my mind around that.

254
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:39.900
Serenna Beers: Because a lot of them are on the subconscious level to, you know, I mean, gosh. Let's not even start with that brain. You know that cluster.

255
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:53.100
Serenna Beers: Just the ones we consciously think think about, I could understand five or 600. I mean, I'm thinking all day long, even, you know, as I sit here with with you I'm I am present with you. But there might be other thoughts that are just kind of filter in you know about

256
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.180
Serenna Beers: What's next, what am I

257
00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:02.730
Serenna Beers: You know what I'm saying. So journaling helps with that is what my, my point is, so, um,

258
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:14.190
Serenna Beers: And let me take a look at. I have what they have in your chart as far as when I'm supposed to see you are you are you somewhat new to us here.

259
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.430
iPad: Uh, yeah, I think this is my first month

260
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.240
Serenna Beers: Okay.

261
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.170
You guys

262
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:26.100
Serenna Beers: Let me make sure I just want to make sure that they didn't assign you another therapist, and I was just put on to do your

263
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.250
Serenna Beers: Your bio psychosocial nope I'm your therapist and your physician is dr fig.

264
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.140
Serenna Beers: And

265
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.710
iPad: This is the number that I call you on all the time.

266
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:52.620
Serenna Beers: Yes, but when you and I schedule an appointment so keep it because this is my personal zoom. But you always have to go through the virtual clinic.

267
00:23:53.550 --> 00:24:00.810
Serenna Beers: Yeah, because if you don't, then, then I'll have to send you back. And so they like send me a slack. They send me a little note.

268
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:18.840
Serenna Beers: Hey Frank m just check, check, check, Dan. So then I'll open my, my, zoom, but yes. Keep that number because that'll be the one that you use when you when you and I do individual sessions. Okay, so it says that I need to meet with you at minimum twice a month. So does that does that work.

269
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:19.560
iPad: Yeah.

270
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.800
iPad: I might be getting a job. So I might have to change up my times but

271
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.990
iPad: Okay. Oh, yeah. That works.

272
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.070
Serenna Beers: Okay, well let me go back to see what I have on the

273
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.760
Serenna Beers: Sorry if you hear that noise, they're painting the outside of my apartment very annoying.

274
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.970
Serenna Beers: Okay, so it'd be for the 22nd. Let me just take a look at what I've got going on.

275
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:55.500
Serenna Beers: I like to always make the appointments, before I get off the phone so that way you have it. I have it and there's no mistake, and we can go from there. Are you up early. Is it, is this a good time for you.

276
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.060
iPad: Yeah, I'm early

277
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.210
iPad: Early riser.

278
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:08.490
Serenna Beers: Yep, I'm with even if I go to bed late I'm I don't know about you, it's just, it's that biological clock, you get can condition right

279
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.680
iPad: Now it's hard for me to sleep.

280
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.410
iPad: Now, maybe like two hours a night.

281
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:18.570
Serenna Beers: Ah, goodness, you got to sleep more than that. Well, maybe through the

282
