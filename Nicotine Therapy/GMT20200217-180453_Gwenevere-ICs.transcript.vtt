00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:02.399
Jessica G: Hi.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, my goodness, you okay

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.680
Jessica G: Yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.279
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so go find some place comfy to hang out for a little bit and I'll open up a note.

5
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.630
Jessica G: I have my nephew's over because they didn't have school today.

6
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.210
Jessica G: Oh, I was gonna hang out in the restroom.

7
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.860
Jessica G: But then my nephew needed the risk. And so I'm just upstairs. Okay.

8
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you were kind of going through something last week to

9
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how have your emotions spend this week for you.

10
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.870
Jessica G: OK. OK.

11
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.370
Jessica G: OK, I feel

12
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.990
Jessica G: Like a lot more stable.

13
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.330
Jessica G: A lot

14
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.290
Jessica G: Like calmer.

15
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.430
Jessica G: Right. I've been reading the Bible. I've been

16
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.120
Jessica G: I bought some stuff like masks and stuff for my face. So I've been doing that.

17
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.420
Jessica G: Moisture a night. Well, that makes me feel better. So

18
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You had some

19
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned, I'm looking at the note from February 10

20
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You had mentioned your dreams to calm down last the prior month or had been nightmares. Almost every night.

21
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Twice a week, the past three weeks.

22
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was the same theme I take off. I'm out and about. And again, you end up doing drugs. I think I leave my son behind. And I remember, I have a son and then think, where is he

23
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now over this last week. What is your dream life been like

24
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.470
Jessica G: I'm

25
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.790
Jessica G: I feel like I haven't really been dreaming.

26
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, you probably have been, but you haven't had it sounds like you haven't been woken up by nightmares. Right. Okay.

27
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And would you say you haven't had any in the last week or the last two weeks. How long you think it's been

28
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.140
Jessica G: Probably like the last week. Okay.

29
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts about that.

30
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.170
Jessica G: I'm pretty happy about it.

31
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

32
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.760
So nice change.

33
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.550
Jessica G: Yeah, I wonder if like

34
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.710
Jessica G: Me.

35
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.700
Jessica G: Like getting closer to God or trying to build a relationship or getting in touch with my spirituality. Like, I wonder if that has anything to do with it.

36
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's a great part of healing for a lot of people think that sense of unconditional love and safety think that's a, an important part of feeling one's own strength, you know,

37
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely.

38
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: don't minimize the work that you've been doing, though in here either. You've been addressing we've been able to look directly at pieces of the dreams and there's still this one that we just, we just talked about the one

39
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little different than the prior one we had explored and I don't know if that's something you wanted to do but

40
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.850
Jessica G: I'm the one where I'm with my grandparents and my crash or what what

41
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is

42
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's put it, let's put it like this.

43
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The one you did explore had to do with sort of this negative image right that we worked

44
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were in your resource room, we were able to get some distance you were able to talk directly to it.

45
00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that's pretty common for people that make some progress where you can face the thing that you're afraid of, if you can talk directly to it and you were able to do that over time you were able to directly face it.

46
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But the one I'm looking at right now that you talked about on the 10th, how to deal with your son and drug use.

47
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And a lot of what you talk about has to do with your son being almost afraid to be away from him. That seems to be a theme kind of is that seem familiar

48
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this dream kind of has those elements in it. But what was the one you just talked about, what was the one with your grandparents. What's that

49
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.780
Jessica G: I don't know if it's like this weird dream.

50
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.240
Jessica G: Like they have two bands and one of them is gray.

51
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:56.070
Jessica G: And so we're always like in that van and I end up like losing control of the vehicle or not knowing how to drive anymore. Like, I can't drive and then we're always like, so in some like rural area like it's just like

52
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.080
Jessica G: Like hills and mountains and stuff. And I always end up

53
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.960
Jessica G: Like the van always ends up flipping over we end up crashing and I can see us like going down.

54
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.060
Okay.

55
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know we got a late start, but you're not going to get much out of this. If you're having to hold me. So see if you can either put me off to the side and you can sort of sit on the bed. Let's see if we can do a little work around these

56
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have

57
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This one that you just talked about.

58
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this one more distressing than the one with your son like he is. He doesn't exist. Where is he, which one is the

59
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.070
Would you say it's more than

60
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.410
Jessica G: The one with my phone.

61
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.250
Okay.

62
00:07:53.190 --> 00:08:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now has something in your, your actual life ever happened that resembles that

63
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes to mind when I asked that question.

64
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.050
Jessica G: I feel like it's just like

65
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:27.150
Jessica G: The typical story for women who have children were poor on drug okay they either loosen. To this day, or they

66
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.860
Jessica G: leave them behind what their parents or their family and

67
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.990
Jessica G: And I feel like that's that's always impacted me so much.

68
00:08:40.860 --> 00:09:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember even if you can't, like, say, Oh, I remember this exact thing. But do you think there were moments in your haze right of the drug use, where you forgot you had a son. Like, were you ever that high. Do you know

69
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I

70
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.230
Jessica G: I didn't have kids.

71
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

72
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:14.430
Jessica G: I didn't have kids. No, I was, I was really young guys I didn't have kids yet. Well, I've had him. I've always been

73
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.790
Jessica G: Stable. I've always been with him, like I've never left his side.

74
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me get a little timeline. So I'm confused. So he's too, I think.

75
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you been on Suboxone

76
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.320
Jessica G: Um, for a few months.

77
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you go. What about in between. What about the seven months, you know, or the years like I'm trying to track. Whoa.

78
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.390
Jessica G: Why I stopped using I stopped using

79
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.650
Jessica G: Like all the hard drugs in 2016 in August of 2016

80
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

81
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.960
Jessica G: I'm with young when I was

82
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.670
Jessica G: I was sober for three years and then

83
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So that puts us to 2019

84
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had him when

85
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.780
When

86
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.110
Jessica G: All that is 2019 know so when I had him.

87
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:45.450
Jessica G: I was only sober for like a couple years. No. Not even yeah like a couple years, a year and a half a couple years. Two years something. The point is that I stopped using in 2016

88
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When was your son born

89
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.550
Jessica G: A

90
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.310
Jessica G: 2017

91
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.960
Jessica G: December of 2017 to 28

92
00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is

93
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It possible you weren't playing you found out you're pregnant, maybe, and you may have stopped using in 2016. Is that possible, and then right that he's born nine months later, December 2017

94
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:23.220
Jessica G: No, because I had already lived in California. Okay, so I got sober maybe my timelines off, but I know this is

95
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:33.780
Jessica G: How it happened. I got sober, because I know I was stuck in Mexico on my mom went to go get me from California. I ended up in Mexico, and then I moved to California.

96
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:44.370
Jessica G: With my mom. That's when I was already sober. I didn't use or anything. And I was working and I was there for for a long time, like a while I would say probably like

97
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.540
Jessica G: A year if not

98
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.260
Jessica G: Nine months or something.

99
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.350
Jessica G: And then I started dating.

100
00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.170
Jessica G: His dad, and we were together for a while and then I found that I was pregnant.

101
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So just so you know, those are stories not time

102
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, the sign love the story, but I can't see where what the timeline was in there so stuck in Mexico moved to California. Is it possible that when you were in California.

103
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That that may have happened.

104
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Team.

105
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Did something triggers sobriety and California, maybe we can figure that out with something about being in California that you thought

106
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.900
Jessica G: When my mom went to go pick me up.

107
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.480
Jessica G: Okay, so pretty. Mexico.

108
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

109
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.630
Jessica G: And you're thinking, I didn't use anymore.

110
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that marked it so stopped. So some writing about right in there and you think that that was 2016

111
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:04.740
Jessica G: I think so. It could have been 2015 I don't know really things are really hazy back

112
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.060
Jessica G: Yeah, yeah, sounds like

113
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.060
Jessica G: Yeah, okay.

114
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

115
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.160
Jessica G: Would you share with 2016 and so my timeline has been on

116
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.970
Jessica G: Oh no, because it's three

117
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.280
Jessica G: Years now it's three years now. It wasn't three years back then, back then it was only like the year

118
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.920
Okay, I'll just go backwards here.

119
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All my little months.

120
00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So sometime, maybe an April of 2019 maybe maybe March or April. Your you found out you were pregnant.

121
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.760
Jessica G: Of 2017 it was March 15 of 2017 when I found out I was pregnant.

122
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool.

123
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

124
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:33.870
Jessica G: And then I got, I know I got sober. It was August 2016 so it wasn't even that long when, after I got pregnant and I had been sober, but I know for a fact I've never used ever since then, since my mom will pick me up from Mexico.

125
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So yeah, so we've got august so 2016

126
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: September, October, November, December, January through March. It's about what seven months.

127
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're pregnant then you stay sober, right. Mm hmm.

128
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you have him.

129
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

130
00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So december of 2017

131
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You have your son, and is there a relapse between then and now.

132
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.340
Jessica G: Um,

133
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:21.660
Jessica G: Well, I got I had tried out to Suboxone because I I started feeling really anxious and everything and I decided that I wanted to get on the program.

134
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me hear that correctly.

135
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I have my son. I feel anxious and I try Suboxone. Did I get that right.

136
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:34.770
Jessica G: Mm hmm.

137
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did you get Suboxone was this off the street.

138
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.450
Jessica G: Yeah.

139
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and who told you that Suboxone would help with anxiety.

140
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.810
Jessica G: Um, I don't know what I mean. I took it and it made me feel better. So

141
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So how long did that last

142
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.550
Jessica G: Um,

143
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.620
Jessica G: Two weeks.

144
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what happened.

145
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.980
Jessica G: I got on the program. I called

146
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.880
Jessica G: Bright health right heart health, or whatever.

147
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so help me. I've got December 2000 2017 and then way up here to current like there's this there's like two years. I can't quite see what was going on in there, see it.

148
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying that before you started Braveheart

149
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd only been taking Suboxone on your own for two weeks.

150
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, before that. So let's say all of 2018

151
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You were playing

152
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.680
Jessica G: I was writing my schooling that yes

153
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: white knuckling it. Okay.

154
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.090
Jessica G: Yeah, yeah, I was

155
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.190
Jessica G: I was

156
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:14.460
Jessica G: I guess I was just so afraid that I would go back or not, like, you know, I didn't want to in I felt like, for me, it was a measure that I

157
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.290
Jessica G: Wanted to take to make sure that I didn't

158
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.210
You know,

159
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.120
No, tell me what I

160
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.830
Jessica G: Think taking the Suboxone. What about

161
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.890
Jessica G: To like as a kind of a, I don't know.

162
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:45.960
Jessica G: I heard that it keeps people sober. You know, it keeps people from relaxing and I didn't want to relax. Oh, I see. Okay.

163
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So were you because you first. You said I was feeling anxious

164
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.300
Jessica G: Do you remember. Do you remember feeling anxious

165
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember thinking, I want to use heroin. Do you remember having strong cravings.

166
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:10.260
Jessica G: No, um, it was never like Oh, I'm gonna go out and use like no I'm I just, I've always known about Suboxone

167
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.670
Jessica G: And so I was like, well, I'm gonna take it.

168
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.240
Jessica G: Just to see how it goes.

169
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, where did we start here.

170
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.460
On Suboxone since you

171
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: First, you said you're on it for three months before and now you're thinking is more like two weeks.

172
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:39.510
Let's see.

173
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

174
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.130
Jessica G: It says that I was on it for three months.

175
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you did.

176
00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Reading the Bible masks typical says typical story of a woman on drugs. And then I have a little scribble here on Suboxone three months, but then you read clarified, yeah.

177
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.880
Jessica G: No, no, I've been on it for about three months now that I got your

178
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:17.340
Jessica G: Program. We're talking about before I got on the program, right, or in my

179
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Desk probably what this notice it's just a little scribble it doesn't mean anything. It's just, I'm trying to see what my notes are so this is

180
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.510
Total

181
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This is probably a total

182
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.330
Jessica G: Right.

183
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so this originally started with trying to kind of get a sense of

184
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Content of the dreams wanting to know if there were times where you were using

185
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: With your son.

186
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.640
Jessica G: But that's not the no, no, no, it's

187
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:58.200
Jessica G: The only thing that has ever come close to it is the Suboxone but even then.

188
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.390
Jessica G: Like when I would take it. I would take it at night when everybody was asleep.

189
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.180
Jessica G: And then

190
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.810
Jessica G: It's it started getting like as a couple weeks progressed. It was like

191
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.510
Jessica G: I'm

192
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.200
Jessica G: Like, oh I need it. No.

193
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, oh I need it. Now tell me what that actually meant

194
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.400
Jessica G: Like I started feeling nice

195
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.130
Jessica G: Sick, I guess.

196
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So you felt sick during the day.

197
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.280
Jessica G: Yeah.

198
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That was the moment

199
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.180
Jessica G: Yeah, like that. First it was okay. And I was like, Oh, this isn't so bad you know I

200
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.600
Jessica G: I can get on the program know do all that and

201
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.690
Jessica G: And then I was like,

202
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.730
Jessica G: Well, I ran out.

203
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.030
Jessica G: He's up I run now.

204
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:11.730
Jessica G: Then I got to feeling what it was like. Without it, and I had it felt like them one time. And I was like, yep. I'm definitely getting on the burger. No.

205
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So originally you described that you went looking to self medicate anxiety.

206
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.220
Jessica G: Yeah yeah that's that's part of it. Yeah.

207
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:36.780
Jessica G: It wasn't just like one specific thing like oh I'm tackling this with this, like, No, I was just the whole idea I get, like, I don't want to go back

208
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:50.580
Jessica G: Well, I want to go back and this is me, obviously I'm you know probably thinking now, it probably wasn't the best way to do it, but for me it was like

209
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.930
Jessica G: This is the preventive preventive measures measures that I'm taking you know yeah

210
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:11.280
Jessica G: Not to go back, I understand, like, I'm hard on myself about even taking the medication even being on the program even doing that. Like I feel like I messed up, but

211
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Before that you described that you are white knuckling so being a new a new mom, you know, in December of 2017 and

212
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometime into 2018 right you called that time period where you were white knuckling it

213
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.320
Jessica G: What was that like

214
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.130
Being a new mom.

215
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.710
Jessica G: My on my time and energy was just

216
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.210
Jessica G: Like used up.

217
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.150
Jessica G: Alright, so

218
00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What was there to white knuckle. Tell me what that means, because that's a phrase and not everyone knows like metaphors and Idioms are really cool, but I need to understand what that meant. What does that mean,

219
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.270
Jessica G: So,

220
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.870
Jessica G: Just like the whole quitting cold turkey and

221
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.940
Jessica G: Fighting the urges and just doing it by myself.

222
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.240
Jessica G: You know, okay.

223
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.100
Jessica G: So there were not by myself.

224
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.480
Jessica G: But without any help.

225
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.010
Jessica G: Yeah.

226
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

227
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And so during that time what what support, did you have during that time.

228
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.980
Jessica G: Um,

229
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.440
Jessica G: I had

230
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.320
Jessica G: My mom.

231
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.060
Jessica G: pretty much always with my mom what

232
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.870
Jessica G: Wish I had

233
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What was she doing that was felt supportive

234
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.070
Jessica G: I didn't know she was there.

235
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.470
Jessica G: There and

236
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.300
Jessica G: You know,

237
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.790
Jessica G: That's something that I hadn't had in a long time.

238
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.460
Jessica G: So I had to plug my phone in

239
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You said she's there now a mom can be standing right here and be there. Was she supportive

240
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.660
Jessica G: Yeah. How so, how so

241
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.330
Jessica G: I'm

242
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.590
Jessica G: She

243
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:50.460
Jessica G: Well, she went to go get me all the way up there. She drove all the way over there was a 17 hour drive

244
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That was 2016 now.

245
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, look where we are, we're up here. It were a pair of 2018 that's that's like a couple years ago. So here you are, you're in this white knuckle experience, right, you're a new mama. You said your mom's there. And so I'm getting into real specifics. People can be standing

246
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here.

247
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can say they're there.

248
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's about it. So I'm checking in to see if you felt support.

249
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you went all the way back to me from Mexico on, thank goodness. Right. So glad, but we're talking about when you had to white knuckle it, you're a new mom. That's the part because this is when the cravings.

250
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Started creeping in.

251
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.580
Jessica G: The cravings. I felt like the cravings didn't start creeping in until

252
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:56.130
Jessica G: Like the dust settled until everything was calm and I had time to myself.

253
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.350
Jessica G: And

254
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.090
Jessica G: I feel like that's when the craving started creeping in.

255
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:25.740
Jessica G: So I before then, like, okay, so I decided to leave from California with my three month old son because I was having so many issues over there. I got in a huge fight with my mom's boyfriend and she left me. She left with him like

256
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:40.920
Jessica G: She asked me at that apartment by myself for like three days with a newborn baby because she chose to go with her boyfriend and basically pick her boyfriend side.

257
00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.230
Jessica G: And then

258
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.900
Jessica G: His Dad was

259
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:57.150
Jessica G: Just doing his own thing I would ask him for help. I would see him on the internet at 40 niners game because we were in San Jose.

260
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.690
Jessica G: 40 niners games.

261
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:16.020
Jessica G: wrapped in a blanket with another girl, you know, just instead of being there for his son, you know, and so I was like, I'm going to Albuquerque. I'm going back to Albuquerque where my family's that I'm going to go to Pima

262
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:24.300
Jessica G: Medical School. I did that. And then his dad decided to come work over here.

263
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.130
Jessica G: Is that

264
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.930
Jessica G: I told him you know what you need to come over here and you need to help me with your son.

265
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:32.340
Jessica G: Like

266
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.620
Jessica G: You get to live a free life with no responsibilities, no nothing like

267
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:48.270
Jessica G: Can be responsible. Like, I have my own apartment, my own car. And you're sleeping on your mom's couch like you know

268
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:58.920
Jessica G: And so he did and he got a job. And that's what's given me the opportunity to stay home and raise my son.

269
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, nice.

270
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:09.360
Jessica G: Yeah, so that's how that went. And I do. I have a lot of resentment towards him for that to

271
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:18.510
Jessica G: The bunch of stuff that I'm still working through. But as far as the Suboxone thing goes like I

272
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:32.100
Jessica G: Know my mind was all hazy in it. I figured if I got on Suboxone program then that was a way of me making sure that I wouldn't really

273
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.920
Yeah, I understand.

274
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:51.420
Jessica G: And by anxiety I meant like cravings, like I felt inside because I was getting cravings. Right.

275
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.090
Yeah.

276
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So you came here to Albuquerque with a three month old and you in order for you to go to school at Pima who take care of the baby.

277
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.250
Jessica G: Um, I would alternate

278
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:17.340
Jessica G: alternate between my grandma and my brother.

279
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.310
Jessica G: But it was easy because it was from 12 o'clock.

280
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.350
Jessica G: To

281
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.050
Jessica G: Was at five o'clock.

282
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.110
Jessica G: Food only five hours.

283
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know how easy that is. I mean,

284
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's still a chunk of time you were able to focus your attention you're able to put aside.

285
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you said, all that resentment that you have for her father, you're away from your baby, you're focused on on taking care of your career. So, that doesn't sound like the easiest thing in the world to do

286
00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:12.930
Jessica G: No, no, no, it wasn't. I had a lot of homework and I didn't have a place to live. I didn't have a car, you know, it was hard. It was really hard and it took a lot of sacrifice and

287
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.680
Jessica G: It was really hard.

288
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: During that time.

289
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That one you're describing as it was really hard.

290
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember having cravings frequently during that period of time.

291
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:31.650
You

292
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.410
Jessica G: Know, I didn't, I didn't. I was too busy.

293
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

294
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Too. Yeah.

295
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.810
Jessica G: Have you heard that baited

296
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You've heard it. I hope twice.

297
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Twice. You heard I was really busy before too busy right with raising this baby and then watch it settles down

298
00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and there it is again.

299
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:07.770
Jessica G: I feel like I finally now have finally gotten to like stop and everything. Hit me.

300
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.530
Jessica G: When before I was just

301
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:19.170
Jessica G: Going, going, going to handle it. I felt like I had no other choice because I had to do something because I was alone with the baby.

302
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.480
Jessica G: And

303
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:30.990
Jessica G: Even though when I, you know, like my mom told me that shoe. She told me so much stuff when she found out I enrolled in school.

304
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:37.320
Jessica G: She told me that I was wrong, but I was making a big mistake. And she cried, and

305
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:48.150
Jessica G: I don't know. I don't, I don't understand why she was coming from. But I did that.

306
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.540
Jessica G: And from now.

307
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.200
Jessica G: Yeah. Now the dust settled in

308
00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.230
Jessica G: Marketing

309
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's the everything's hitting me and it's the dust is settled. So those two things have my full attention. I'm very curious about them because

310
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how last time.

311
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of weren't ready didn't kind of want to do the therapeutic stuff. And that's okay. Sometimes it's alive. It's intense, you know, to bring up all those things.

312
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And today, there's a little delay and because there's these kids around. I mean, you're responsible for these kids just keep, keep in mind that

313
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The treatment does take your undivided attention really does.

314
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might be kind of, I don't want to say wasting time.

315
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But it might end up feeling like that. Let's say you keep sort of halfway doing it, half, half, half, half, half, half, half, let's say months past months past and you and the doctor and I are like, okay, let's keep tapering

316
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And then six months have passed and then we say, I say, okay, well how practice, are you

317
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And your relationship with anxiety. How comfortable are you with resentment. How comfortable are you with. If you start to have a pang of guilt.

318
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Or how comfortable are you of being away from your son. Let's say you do want to go back into the workforce. So all of those things. You and I need to be tackling them.

319
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're coming down off this tapering. And when you're ready, I mean the doc doesn't from what I can see, you can stay at the Super medical low dose for quite some time and be working through sort of the behavioral piece for a while.

320
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's so many places to start, we can start with, Hey, there's this resentment towards my ex or there's this this idea of how you handle when it's calm. That's a big one that has a lot. I think to do with this.

321
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: With the cravings. So how you handle boredom. How you handle your own mind in this quiet.

322
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not able to spend too much time because we got a late start my next clients and knocking at the door.

323
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me make a little note in the record about where you want to work next time. If you could say, what's the most troubling for you. Is it about oh, these these these demons from my past, or is it

324
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh geez. What am I going to do if I'm away from my son, or is it like the quiet and calm when my mind starts to wander and I start to think about using again, or is it something about the future that you worry.

325
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Really what. Where do you think you'd like to focus. Next time we're really going to zero in on it will give it lots of time.

326
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:56.790
Jessica G: And it sucks because like throughout the week. I didn't like. I know, I know what I want to talk about. I'm going to tell her.

327
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.530
Jessica G: Like when it comes down to it, I'm like, oh, I want to

328
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.110
Jessica G: Talk about it. I don't

329
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that with with these approaches.

330
00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You can think of it like this. You notice how you like, oh, I don't want to talk about. You don't actually have to in order to experience the healing. There are some people some

331
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: therapeutic approaches are they think that you have to say all of it.

332
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's not actually the case, you can experience healing. If you just hold it in your own awareness, I can say, okay, do you have it. Are you picturing the worst part of that event. Yeah, I am. You don't have to tell me

333
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't have to retell it you know for some people they don't want to say just yet. Or maybe ever

334
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, especially if it was violations to the body or there was something that happened, and maybe later on they decided to but first they want to have this sort of desensitization so it

335
00:35:50.760 --> 00:36:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels more comfortable to even think about it. So I just want to remind you, you don't actually have to go into all the details about it, you can just hold it in your awareness, we can still be doing for example that em, Dr. And you can still have a positive effect.

336
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, for there to be changed there does need to be a little bit of discomfort, we do have to bring up one. You know what I mean. You don't have to tell it to me though.

337
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you just kind of have to hold it in there and I can hold it and I don't like that image. Yep, that's it. That must be because, look, I'm up my body's getting a little distress, this, this is an important one.

338
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little different with the dreams with dream work. What I like to do is maybe have, have you talking to the different parts in the dream. It's a little different dynamic. I'm happy to go any direction you want

339
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what you had thought you wanted to talk about and kind of decided not to.

340
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.330
What the topic was

341
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.070
Jessica G: Yeah.

342
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:52.560
I do

343
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.010
Jessica G: I do

344
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:09.300
Jessica G: It was about one of the like the trauma. The big one that I had a little girl and like when they asked me about it. I

345
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:19.110
Jessica G: I like protected that person and I want to know why I don't understand why. Why did I do that why you

346
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Why you protected like a sister or a while you protected someone else. Yeah.

347
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.720
Jessica G: Like who harmed me

348
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Good one. So, you know,

349
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.880
Jessica G: What's wrong with me.

350
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely not. No, no, no. And Damn, that's a great one. So I'll make a little note of that and look at all in the container and you don't have to think about it. Okay.

351
00:37:47.160 --> 00:38:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll carry that and let's see. Let's see if we can get some new thoughts about it in there because that's that's way off, you didn't. There's nothing wrong with you. You didn't do anything wrong. Absolutely not very common what you just described, so let's

352
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, yeah. So let me get in there and and help you with that one.

353
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:19.560
Jessica G: Okay, cool. Thank you. And then to also I wanted to say that I haven't what I just said, like everything like leading up to right now. I hadn't really talked about it or said it out loud, and I feel a lot better.

354
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Really even that's

355
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: When I didn't know that.

356
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:31.350
Jessica G: Because I feel like a sense of validation, like I look I did work hard. I did do it it it wasn't all for nothing. You know, like

357
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, oh my god. We just kick butt.

358
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I'm listening. I can't imagine this, this time in your life. I mean, that's, that's amazing. Definitely strong woman.

359
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:45.510
Powerful

360
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to skip we'll meet again this this time next week and then

361
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:52.860

362
00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Carefully will pull out what you're ready to pull out first, we're going to really feel resource and safe and secure. Before we even begin. Okay.

363
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.710

Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming you're at the other room, and you'll make your way. Oh.

Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to for a second.

376

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tomorrow.

401
00:41:54.390 --> 00:42:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what happened to you, and I'm very concerned, is there some sort of like embarrassment or is there something I'm missing. Am I being clueless or naive about something.

402
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.130
Tomas Valdez: As far as what

403
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what happened to you. I mean you do experience something that hurts your face and

404
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.670
Tomas Valdez: It can't see it anymore. I tore up all this gabbing and stuff and

405
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know what happened to you.

406
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.880
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I

407
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:33.960
Tomas Valdez: You know I never ever ever go out and I started to get depressed about it. And finally, and I reached out. So my cousins and

408
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:46.650
Tomas Valdez: Oh, but well be well okay well that's the bad part first. But there was a good part like like I text you about going to the basketball game anyway um so I went with my cousins, my cousin and his girlfriend.

409
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:55.590
Tomas Valdez: To my other cousins Brock show. And then we went to this other place to go play games afterwards and

410
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:01.770
Tomas Valdez: They weren't letting one of one of them in. And so I was trying to get out. But I was designated driving

411
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:10.470
Tomas Valdez: And I feel like I hit the tapping on the window like that. So I could get my cousin's attempt, my, my cousin's girlfriends attention so she could turn around and come back out because was really loud.

412
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:26.760
Tomas Valdez: And I broke the glass on accident. I'm like, Whoa, I'm like, I looked at the bouncer like I'm like dude, I'm so sorry. Like I'm I'll pay for it. No problem at the law and he just lost it. He lost he freaked out on me and owner came out and was like, whoa, like, yeah, like, calm down like chill.

413
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:36.270
Tomas Valdez: You know, and then he he walked back and see, for some reason, I don't know why. And then that same balancer. But no, it was like, now you're now you're asked

414
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:47.010
Tomas Valdez: Like what he's, he's like, Get the f off the property like okay, cool. Alright, so I went and I wasn't being like mouthy or anything. And I went and got off the property.

415
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:55.620
Tomas Valdez: And I was standing there anything. No, I said. He said, I said, Get the f out of here. I'm like, dude, I'm off your property. I'm not even on your property. I'm waiting for my cousin, relax.

416
00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:07.080
Tomas Valdez: And he's like, oh, okay. It's like that mother effort. And he said, and he sends just like a pack of like a pack of 15 dudes after me. It's like literally like around 15 is what I counted

417
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:16.470
Tomas Valdez: And I was like holy shit like oh my god I'm gonna die right now. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Calm down. I was trying to call them down. They wouldn't come down.

418
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:23.460
Tomas Valdez: And so I started, I started, I turn around and I started jogging, like, Oh, why are you running a little pussy. Why you ready little pussy.

419
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.240
Tomas Valdez: Like what my do, let alone and I'm recognized start sprinting as fast as I can. I'm sprinting for a good i don't know maybe quarter mile

420
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:40.320
Tomas Valdez: Before one of them caught me he caught me from behind by kicking my legs out from on me. Boom. I hit the frickin summit.

421
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:50.430
Tomas Valdez: And ended up with a ton of gravel and stuff inside of me and then they just started beating me like, no. Actually, no. I popped up really fast.

422
00:44:50.700 --> 00:45:03.900
Tomas Valdez: I feel like I got like two punches off and then they grabbed me and got me the ground and just started kicking me in the head. They knocked me out. And then they were holding me up like this, boo, boo, boom, boom, boom.

423
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.860
Tomas Valdez: And that's when the cops got there.

424
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:16.770
Tomas Valdez: I woke up like I for a brief for a brief second of consciousness. I had

425
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:29.010
Tomas Valdez: They were taking my wallet out that I get is fucking law get his fucking wallet, take a picture of it, take a picture of it. Well, we will know who he is, will know who he is. So they know who the hell I am and they know exactly where I live.

426
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:36.930
Tomas Valdez: Now whatever happens even if not so I'm gonna, I'm going to press charges that was that's ridiculous bullshit. You know, I mean,

427
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:50.430
Tomas Valdez: But I'm scared to though because they know exactly where I live, and they're ghetto people you know I'm saying, like, I'm, I mean, this happened like in like the Scottsdale of new mecca of Albuquerque. I mean, like, yeah, so it's like, I don't

428
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.730
Tomas Valdez: And then so yeah so I'm dealing with all that and then you know I'm healing and it's going horrible.

429
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:08.760
Tomas Valdez: And I got a really bad concussion from it. And because they're they're pounding. You know, this isn't really the, I mean, the worst right here right don't have school that's like

430
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:18.840
Tomas Valdez: It's like it's almost like they knew I had a TBI and i and i have a mess here. It's like they knew and all the doctors at the lake. Do you are

431
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:36.450
Tomas Valdez: Beyond lucky, like you're you're beyond the 99.9% luck, like you are ridiculous lucky at your life like how you are alive is you don't know like you got hit. So you got you got hit so hard. So many times in that spot Matt tender spot you should be dead.

432
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:46.980
Tomas Valdez: And I read them in the in the ambulance got me and they took me into they took me to the hospital. My mom came my brother drove down from from

433
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.140
Tomas Valdez: From Espanola

434
00:46:52.200 --> 00:47:02.040
Tomas Valdez: That was good and bad, but whatever he tried to kind of he basically try and make it seem like he like he went there with the border first and then he's on his way out. He was like, this is your fault. I'm like,

435
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:14.790
Tomas Valdez: Dude, you are doing it again. Like, son of a bitch like don't do that. Like, come on, how it was my fault. You know I'm saying, like, every, every single time something happens, it's my fault. It's not New Mexico as well.

436
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:27.780
Tomas Valdez: You know, I mean it's not New Mexico. That's the problem or the ship the shitty place it's Tomas, you know, I mean, and that's that's kind of been our little riff as of lately, but I let it go really fast and I was ok yeah whatever you

437
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you. What is it that you think, do you have a black cloud. You're just just crap luck.

438
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:42.600
Tomas Valdez: You just don't. I am just I don't know at this point, like I'm just, I'm scared to walk out. My frickin front door. You know, I mean like

439
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:52.500
Tomas Valdez: I put it like this to like I've made a Facebook post about it, of course, and showing like how like how really screwed up. I was and

440
00:47:52.800 --> 00:48:03.180
Tomas Valdez: I don't know why, but I think, well, I know, I know why I was doing it for documentation. But I recorded myself like in the ER and stuff like that. I was unit for documentation for court but um

441
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:08.910
Tomas Valdez: Yeah. What are we talking about. I'm sorry. Well,

442
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Originally, and maybe the invitation is. Let's just, let's just really take everything down to slow where we don't have to. We don't have to move fast. We get to

443
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:20.490
Tomas Valdez: Just

444
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:21.750
Nice and slow.

445
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: In general,

446
00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It was it was this

447
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, all these things. Yeah, terrifying and thank goodness you're alive.

448
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, then there's this inter personal hit this slam of and it's your fault. And so what I asked was, what do you do with this and

449
00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.470
Tomas Valdez: That's what we're talking about. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

450
00:48:46.530 --> 00:49:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, whether you attribute it to, well, this is my lot in life and this negativity is going to follow me everywhere. I'm helpless to it or is it something else. Because what your brother said to you, really looks like it hurts your feelings.

451
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:06.720
Tomas Valdez: You know and I, you know, I've never told I've never talked to my brother like this before. And I said, Get the fuck out of my room.

452
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:16.050
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, and he was because we were sitting there going back and forth. He's like, Well, I'm. He's like, he's like, I don't care. I don't care. He's like one here tonight.

453
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:24.570
Tomas Valdez: I'm like, Yeah, you are. Here we are here being an asshole dude like you come in here and telling me you want nothing but the best for me.

454
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:34.290
Tomas Valdez: Doesn't give you permission to tell you to tell me whatever the hell you think whatever you want about my life, like, whatever it is. You think that's what he does, he's like, I only want the best for you.

455
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:40.830
Tomas Valdez: But do you know that every single time and it bugs, the shit out of me. And I told him it bugs, the shit out of me.

456
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:52.920
Tomas Valdez: He takes New Mexico side every time because he loves this place. And this is where is, you know, this is worse companies at this is where his family's at this where everything's at. So, of course, so he's taking this place inside and he's blowing my mind.

457
00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:04.260
Tomas Valdez: Like I'm like dude, this place is a known shithole. If you go on YouTube. They have a top five top five places in the country, not to live or top 10 places and New Mexico is number three.

458
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:14.550
Tomas Valdez: What does that tell you you know I'm saying, like, we're working, we're like, we're number one in crime in most in most categories. What does that tell you it's not me. Okay.

459
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you want you want to

460
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.290
Tomas Valdez: Feel i'm sorry i totally dominated on you. I apologize.

461
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sometimes when people do that they really have no one that can hear them and see them and it can feel good to feel validated by someone

462
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And other times it's

463
00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not what's needed what's needed is a way to opt out of the same cycle for some people it's like, I don't want to feel this rage. I don't want to feel this resentment, so that the interventions are a little different.

464
00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you today is today about like really being heard, because no one's hearing you.

465
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:06.150
Tomas Valdez: I don't know. No, I mean I'm over that with him. Like I had no choice. We then

466
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:14.280
Tomas Valdez: As I was healing from all that crap my grandma, who I take care of with my mother passed away this past Sunday.

467
00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:20.460
Tomas Valdez: Who I'm super close with who's my, like, number one, she's like my mother. You know what I mean, like,

468
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:27.870
Tomas Valdez: I hang out with her more than I hung out with anybody else in New Mexico, since I've been here she's

469
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

470
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You're very blessed to have known someone that loves you like that tomorrow. Some people don't think the so I'm I know it hurts. But that means that you are loved so deeply, TRULY

471
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

472
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What's now.

473
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:59.040
Tomas Valdez: I know already, just like a one stop like this call this ship and stop. It's like nothing will stop. But even if I don't leave my house batches happening. It's like

474
00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.260
Tomas Valdez: It doesn't have any you leaving the house.

475
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the magical. That part is some magical thinking it's you don't determine the life and death and behaviors people you don't you're powerful man, but not quite that powerful. Okay.

476
00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave your house when you want to, you have the same rights and you are an interesting, important guy, but my guess is THESE THUGS. So move on to some other targets more interesting ones.

477
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:30.930
Tomas Valdez: Okay, so

478
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's focus on you enjoying your next moment, enjoying being who you are, again, because you could spend time kind of coming up with really good reasons to be upset, but knowing the kind of injury that you've had just get styled up so high.

479
00:52:49.980 --> 00:53:00.300
Tomas Valdez: You know, it's like it was so bad that I had my concussion. I couldn't drive but I Uber to school, just so I could be around people and not be in that funk.

480
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:09.060
Tomas Valdez: Like I couldn't even think straight. I couldn't, I couldn't understand anything that teacher was telling me I couldn't comprehend like that was pointless for me to be in class.

481
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:24.990
Tomas Valdez: I didn't learn a damn thing that day, like I just need to be around people kind of, I think, I don't know, or feel safer just, I don't know what it was, but I just I needed to be around just people that had smiles on their faces, I guess, or something like, I don't know. I don't know. I'm just

482
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.700
Tomas Valdez: Want to do anymore.

483
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We are wired for that social connection we are required for that. So it makes sense that you would you have gone to that that kind of refuge, you know, safety of people so that has a lot of logic to it.

484
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that was smart. That was good self care. I like that.

485
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.400
Tomas Valdez: Try. Oh no, that was one thing I could think of, you know,

486
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me face on a couple of things with you okay um

487
00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You are prescribed a medication or checking on medication or checking on sleep when I checked in on eating and then move to a couple other things. So for you, are you, I know you're seeing a psychiatrist, are you taking the medication as prescribed.

488
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:17.220
Tomas Valdez: hearse. Uh, yeah, I mean, not all, no, I guess. No, no, no. I'm taking less than and what she's

489
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: She's prescribing a lot of the benzodiazepines.

490
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:34.020
Tomas Valdez: Be prescribing me 60 of them, but I told her that I've tapering down and she just keeps giving me the same amount. So I have, I have a bunch of little quarters and halves and I have a whole separate bottle for that just quarters and halves of that just breaking it down.

491
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How much benzodiazepine you're taking a day over the last week. Let's just say

492
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:40.140
Tomas Valdez: I'm taking

493
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:48.090
Tomas Valdez: See one milligram the morning and one milligram afternoon I'm taking one till

494
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.720
Tomas Valdez: I'm being prescribed to okay

495
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's two milligrams basically a day.

496
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.740
Tomas Valdez: You're either tomorrow or two milligram pills.

497
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually milligrams a day. Got it.

498
00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it, okay.

499
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:15.870
Tomas Valdez: And if I'm having like, Well, no, this past week I've been taking like an extra half dollar honestly like since since all this happened like I started taking a half more or a coordinate. Well, not a half, maybe like a quarter more. So just, you know, something a little extra bag.

500
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Any mood stabilizer antidepressant.

501
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.360
Tomas Valdez: Just the Gabba Penton

502
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:29.520
Tomas Valdez: I and I crap you not, that really has been a mood stabilizer for me like a lot like

503
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:37.260
Tomas Valdez: Wow way but the only bad part is, it has made my IBS insanely bad like

504
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, can I talk to you about food for just a second. And let me just

505
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking gamma pen has been let me just put improving him proving let's get some specific symptoms that it is relieving. And so what has it.

506
00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe increase. So for some people it's I feel happy.

507
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Your concentration baba baba those things and then

508

Tomas Valdez: You know, I just, you know, I just started getting prescribed the 150s and smooth sailing good

513
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Your cycles tend to be the ups and downs happen within a single day. Right. Yeah.

514
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:42.540
Tomas Valdez: They can be I mean take yeah

515
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And this this psychiatry your I remember there was a bipolar diagnosis, but it was not. You weren't diagnosed it before the the brain injury, is that correct

516
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:58.080
No. Okay.

517
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And

518
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:09.180
Tomas Valdez: But I really hadn't really had like a sec. Yeah, psychiatric evaluation evaluation. Before my accident, though, so

519
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.750
Okay.

520
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

521
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:12.840
I mean,

522
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: People describe you as

523
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:17.910
Tomas Valdez: Well, yeah.

524
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.730
Tomas Valdez: I guess I had, I like, I take that back. Right. Go ahead. Sorry.

525
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:28.350
Tomas Valdez: I had. But what about family counseling with my with my family, my parents split up and all that.

526
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so in family counseling, you were a teenager or

527
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:34.620
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

528
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so as a teenager. Do you remember if you were diagnosed with bipolar disorder at that point.

529
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:40.890
I wasn't

530
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:43.200
Tomas Valdez: I wasn't diagnosed

531
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:45.900
Okay.

532
00:57:50.220 --> 00:58:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember it's okay if you don't, but in a single day you experienced this kind of intense up and down, day after day, up, down, up, down in a 24 hour span.

533
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:17.670
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I would. And then, you know, I think I've told you before, but like my my safe thing to do is to grab a pellet like anywhere I go, I always have to grab a pillow on a couch and put it in front of me and hold it like that.

534
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:24.990
Tomas Valdez: You hold it like that, you know, and I have to hold it tight. And I've been doing that ever since. Like I was going into those those, uh,

535
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:38.760
Tomas Valdez: Those sessions in that in that therapist. Notice that she's like you're shielding yourself like that's your safety blanket, whatever, and I still do it as an adult like even if I go to a stranger's house. I'll go grab something, anything so I can grab and hold it in front of me.

536
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:40.710
Tomas Valdez: It's weird.

537
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:48.450
Tomas Valdez: But my and all my friends noticed in the all a, it's a joke now amongst my friends and they're okay with it. Of course, because you're used to it, but

538
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How much sleep. Are you getting

539
00:58:52.110 --> 00:59:01.560
Tomas Valdez: It's been horrible. Lately it's been weird lately I've been waking up like at 3:34am and, you know, and that's after going to bed at 1130 at night.

540
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're getting three or four hours of sleep.

541
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:05.280
Yeah.

542
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.960
Tomas Valdez: Just as bad as just this past week I've just been waking up to really bad stomach pain so

543
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.120
Tomas Valdez: Once I'm up, I'm up

544
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about food for just a second, I'm

545
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure I'm not the first person to to bring up this the gut brain access right

546
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Correct. Okay. When you research it. What do you do with this because this is pretty new information.

547
00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that we really get that the sort of micro biome of the gut can determine our mood. I mean, this is pretty revolutionary. This is like what

548
00:59:47.280 --> 01:00:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How can that be where this is where we make 80% of our serotonin and the information travels a fairly up to the brain about 80 90% from the stomach up, not the other way around.

549
01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: With you, having an era Bell, right, the whole the whole and look what you just did you just went have my whole life where I have something in front of me right you you have and you have this profound experience of having this time for matic breathing.

550
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring your emotions down, you have these tiny little crumbs of clues. And I just wonder if they comprise a bigger understanding of what's going on in that belly and

551
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.750
Tomas Valdez: What

552
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you done to really take a look at that gut health, what are you doing to make sure it's healthy stuff going in there.

553
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:54.750
Tomas Valdez: Honestly, not beyond Not lately, especially lately. Lately I've just been like honestly forgetting to eat, and then I'll just grab whatever I can. And he

554
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.650
Tomas Valdez: Know I norm. I mean, I was

555
01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:02.670
Tomas Valdez: I mean, I mean you know obviously being a trainer I'm agro about my eating, but

556
01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that's all I grow up, I have no idea what those things mean. I need to get into specifics, I need to understand what we're talking about. So I want you to explain to me a healthy diet if you say one of your healthy diet for me is this, tell me what it is.

557
01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:26.100
Tomas Valdez: For breakfast, I would say.

558
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:28.200
Tomas Valdez: Some

559
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.340
Tomas Valdez: You know, two eggs. Couple of egg whites.

560
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:38.370
Tomas Valdez: Some red potatoes or sweet potatoes on the on the grill.

561
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.400
Tomas Valdez: You know, shut it up hash browns.

562
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:43.440
Tomas Valdez: Some fruit.

563
01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So on a grill is not the same as shredded up and put in a pan with butter.

564
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:49.200
Which

565
01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:54.060
Tomas Valdez: Gotcha. Well, now with now and butter, but all boil

566
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. Okay. Yeah.

567
01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have egg whites. We have two egg whites. We have sweet potatoes. Maybe it turned into hash browns, with some olive oil. Okay.

568
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:04.830
Tomas Valdez: What else

569
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.080
Tomas Valdez: I have half an avocado.

570
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:10.650
Okay.

571
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.810
Tomas Valdez: Let's see, and then normally a breakfast me normally Turkey sausage your turkey bacon.

572
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.780
Tomas Valdez: And I do that in my air fryer.

573
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:26.160
Alright.

574
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:36.120
Tomas Valdez: And what do you think sometimes fruit with it, you know, on the side or it wasn't, but it was it was some kind of she's like some bag or an orange.

575
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: mandarin oranges would be the fruit typically

576
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:46.710
Tomas Valdez: With with the cottage cheese okay mandarin oranges with cottage cheese. Okay.

577
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What else drink.

578
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:50.940
Water

579
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.480
Tomas Valdez: I don't drink juice, okay.

580
01:02:55.830 --> 01:03:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, when was the last time you had that type of meal.

581
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:06.540
Tomas Valdez: It's been a little bit

582
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:24.660
Tomas Valdez: Like two and a half weeks, probably, I think right like probably like right before I got hurt and they were i right right before you buy bread before the fight thing happened.

583
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: About two and a half weeks ago now. How long had you been ingesting that type of a breakfast. How long had you day after day then eating like that.

584
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.120
Tomas Valdez: Not that exact breakfast but

585
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let the specificity go

586
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:42.840
Tomas Valdez: Okay.

587
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you been eating what you described as a healthy and we now have an example healthy eating how long

588
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:52.140
Tomas Valdez: A healthy eating. Oh, I'm

589
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:56.370
Tomas Valdez: Past couple years few years.

590
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so for two years was eating.

591
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.330
Tomas Valdez: More than that, like, three, four years.

592
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:10.770
Tomas Valdez: Four years closer

593
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:11.820
Okay.

594
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: For those two years. What were the symptoms like of the ideas.

595
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:33.390
Tomas Valdez: They were the same, actually, but not as pronounced. There were, I would wake up with stomach pain and but once I when we read my, you know, got, you know, got emptied my bowels. I was alright.

596
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.160
Tomas Valdez: But, uh,

597
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:40.140
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I would. I mean, every morning, it would it would hurt waking up, but just not as bad.

598
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's the degree of pain or it was diarrhea or like, that's why I kind of want to understand

599
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.050
Tomas Valdez: It's always been diarrhea. It's been diarrhea since I got her

600
01:04:53.190 --> 01:05:03.780
Tomas Valdez: We're not if that's, that's weird huh I went from like how Suboxone severely constipated you to all of a sudden pure diarrhea all the time.

601
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.200
Tomas Valdez: It went from one to the other, within a week.

602
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:14.340
Tomas Valdez: It was so weird. I even went and saw a gastroenterologist over it and they couldn't tell me anything.

603
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:19.980
So,

604
01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I just sit with this. I don't know. I can't give nutritional advice I'm not qualified to do it, but I can't not talk about it. I can't not included in the conversation. There's too much information out there.

605
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to introduce it and just, we're just going to talk about it from the outside, as if looking in a fishbowl, okay, we're just talking about it all. Look at that fish is orange and alluded a little fins.

606
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're talking about changing nutrition intake. That's what we're looking at, through the fishbowl here. What if, wait, we haven't started talking about yet. What if

607
01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It meant radically changing what you ate, but it also might mean you didn't have pain and diarrhea. And what if it also meant you could find happy on a regular basis. Also, what if changing what you were eating could help you feel happy.

608
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you really treated, since it's it's in your bowels and its whole job is to manage food.

609
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And now we know it also is a place where it manages the the serotonin. What if you were really on purpose about it and you took it quite seriously.

610
01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not qualified, but a nutritionist would be right. And so I pulled from the little bits out there like

611
01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:50.670
Tomas Valdez: dietitian actually registered dietitian. Yeah.

612
01:06:51.720 --> 01:07:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone who can talk to you about, you know, well if you yell at some interesting. It says it's got probiotics in it. But you know what, it doesn't have this one. And what about

613
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:08.040
Tomas Valdez: Hold on one sec. I'm sorry. You've jumped off my screen.

614
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.260
Tomas Valdez: There we go. Sorry.

615
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Things like right fermented food, you know, and having some appropriate good as far as science there. They're a little fuzzy on which probiotics are the ones that are actually helping healthy

616
01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But that you actually ate, whole grains as in short grain brown rice and

617
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this cottage cheese. Maybe you shifted to a kind of a kind of yogurt that had had what you needed in your gut, like a probiotic in it right all these things like a Kieffer you started filling your fridge with things.

618
01:07:51.480 --> 01:08:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right what is some. What if, if you knew you feel better. I mean, would it be worth it to to see it as fuel instead of just sort of pleasing the taste buds. Instead, it was I have I'm being forced, in a sense, to feed and fuel this body differently.

619
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:20.160
Tomas Valdez: No problem. I've done I have I have strawberry Kieffer in my fridge rater. As a matter of fact, like I've

620
01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:37.140
Tomas Valdez: I've tried. I'm trying that like I have I have private probiotics that are on the top of the fridge refrigerated probiotics, but my problem is, I'm be honest I don't take them religiously. That's my, that's where I fail. And if I did that, it probably help

621
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But look how far you've come already, you already have the mindset you already have a at least a spark of like I kind of think this might be the right thing to do. But do you notice that there are times when you might

622
01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Eat maybe emotionally

623
01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus nutritionally

624
01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, who doesn't

625
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:16.770
Tomas Valdez: Honestly I don't eat when i when i get him on it when I get emotional. I don't. He is my thing. And then I then I'll wait. Today, then I normally wait to the end of the night when I'm just like famished and I'm like starving. And finally, I'll be that's

626
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then are you eating I'm checkers and and like fried processed food. What do you nibbling on what do you, what do you when your family. What do you, what do you end up eating.

627
01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:37.680
Tomas Valdez: Oh, make a chicken breast half cup of brown rice with some teriyaki sauce and some veggies cut up in it.

628
01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because earlier. You did say I eat like crap.

629
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:46.380
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, honestly, I can just see it. This past this past week, I have a little bit

630
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been eating.

631
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:52.770
Tomas Valdez: Um, I mean, homemade but still like burgers and

632
01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:00.690
Tomas Valdez: Fries, stuff like that. Okay. Me. Then I'm not going out and buying them, but still not good.

633
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. All right. And do you notice the difference in how your body responds to that.

634
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.820
Tomas Valdez: And I'm like, oh, and then I'm before if I like instead of now that I went shopping

635
01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:21.960
Tomas Valdez: I didn't like normally I really agro about the things I shop like I normally really examine all the labels to look at like the fat content and all that I always buy a leanest meet all that

636
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:40.080
Tomas Valdez: This time I really just didn't care. I was just like, just, I was just like a drone, kind of like a robot just going to the character that ok let's go. Okay. Yeah. So I meeting, not as good quality as I know me would either know me, I like organic farm raised that type thing or

637
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That word you just clarify, because you're using it a few times. What do you mean by its agro like tell me what that term means slang of some kind. I just want to make sure I

638
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:53.700
Tomas Valdez: Aggravated like ah that's agro

639
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it.

640
01:10:57.570 --> 01:10:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

641
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you agro dating your own gut.

642
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:06.240
Tomas Valdez: Thank you, my good agro

643
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:18.780
Tomas Valdez: Maybe, maybe, I don't know. I mean, I mean, no. Because even when I eat healthy, even when I'm yet that even when I'm dieting, I'm up

644
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:33.000
Tomas Valdez: At the top at the top of my game. And I'm like, I'm I'm logging my food, taking a food diary. Same thing in the morning. I'm still I still have diarrhea in the morning, my. But my gut maybe doesn't hurt as bad, but

645
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:38.280
Tomas Valdez: Until I avoid my about until my bowels empty. They do hurt that bad.

646
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've had this diagnosis for how long.

647
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.520
Tomas Valdez: Like five years.

648
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Was this before the injury. No.

649
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:53.070
Tomas Valdez: I didn't have this problem for the injury.

650
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

651
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: One other observation.

652
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a day you were in distress and you were laying on your stomach and we met.

653
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were concerned whether you could get through it and you ended up doing some pretty interesting work, but you didn't spend a lot of time focused on pain and you were really present for that.

654
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember thinking that maybe there's something to, you know, the mind and the body that there might be me. Think about it. You had a brain injury and your guts freaking out.

655
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I were working with the mind I was having you attend to the body. I mean, that's the psychotherapy that's working with the whole body here the whole being.

656
01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I would invite you to consider that I'm the kind of work I have started to do with you and want to continue to do is all of it. It's all of it together.

657
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out that you do everything you can with your eating so that it's not as painful in the morning and you and I'll keep doing the work that probably even maybe preceded

658
01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The injury where that whole thing of the pillow wanting to protect because that's a very symbolic place in you and and others, the gut.

659
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting to feel safe.

660
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you, you just got an injury that makes the the every little thing around. You probably right feel unsafe. It's so sharp so vivid so intense, and you have to have a really crummy things happened recently.

661
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to continue to do this work, I

662
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want you to go away. I don't want you to disappear you starting to write if you hadn't come in here today. You are no no group. No, no, no, you're pulling away.

663
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel good when you're connecting with people, at least you know they're there. On some level, so don't go. Don't go too far away. Stay here keep meeting with me.

664
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep coming into group and you know you've already seen, if there are days when you really don't have it in you to do that, that analytical mind. You don't want to share. That's okay.

665
01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But at least you know you're not alone. Okay. It's one thing to feel like I'm suffering. It's a whole other level to think I'm suffering alone. Do you understand that. I don't want you to know that.

666
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

667
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

668
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:43.410
Tomas Valdez: I'm kind of I'm just used to. I'm used to suffering alone. So it's kind of just like feels like to be like my normal. You know, I mean,

669
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just not we're not

670
01:14:45.960 --> 01:15:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That way, we're four people. People were supposed to be interacting, you know we're supposed to be like, oh, oh, I see you. You're smiling. I hear my own voice. I hear your voice. I'm okay, you're okay. All right, now ready to play. We're just kind of wired for that. Okay.

671
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:03.480
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

672
01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, let me check in. We were at this month review. Want to see where what you've got written here for things you're working on, I, we've got stop.

673
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop being sick and start using Suboxone to get off opiates. That's where you first walked in the door. Okay. I'm wondering if maybe we could change that one close that one. I don't know because it's it's this, it's the big one here.

674
01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop being sick and start using Suboxone to get off of opiates. So you had defined that months ago.

675
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that still your goal. Would you phrase it just like that today.

676
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:49.980
Tomas Valdez: No, no, I don't know if I'd phrase it just like that.

677
01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you phrase.

678
01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:58.890
Tomas Valdez: That I use, I need to get whatever help. I need to get to get better.

679
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.440
Tomas Valdez: That's what I need to do. Okay, I need that I have more of an open mind.

680
01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you getting help right now.

681
01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.090
Tomas Valdez: Yes. Okay.

682
01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So yours, it's a fine goal. I'm one of these stickler people that

683
01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't know exactly what help is defined as then I'll have trouble measuring whether we've reached it. So let's look at it like this. I want you to just hold in your mind that you probably came into this program, you may have identified as someone who had a substance abuse issue.

684
01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold that in your mind for a second.

685
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, say, oh, I see this in myself. These particular behaviors, these particular things there's these pros. These cons. Now I want you to picture.

686
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Five years from now.

687
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now see if you can come up with an i want statement.

688
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want for your future.

689
01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:56.940
Family

690
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:59.010
Tomas Valdez: That's easy.

691
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.270
Tomas Valdez: No, I can buy my own family, but I want job security, I want

692
01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:12.480
Tomas Valdez: You know, I want the American dream. I want the house the picket fence and three car garage and

693
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Get there by using opiates.

694
01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.420
Tomas Valdez: Hell, no. Not a million years. Well, who knows.

695
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:27.450
Tomas Valdez: All these million dollar freakin junkies out there are unhappy, but I know that's not the right way. And I'm not going to get there. That way, and it's not going to help me, for sure.

696
01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Came into this program.

697
01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.000
Tomas Valdez: Definitely

698
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think that it has gotten a little clearer. It's not this stop being sick and start using Suboxone you've already started using Suboxone you've reached that goal.

699
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you not taking Suboxone. Yeah, you are. So now I want you to think about, what do you call yourself to call yourself chemically dependent and addict drug user, I want to know what term you call yourself when it comes to substances, what do you call yourself.

700
01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:05.340
Tomas Valdez: As much of a lie. It is to myself. I guess I can call myself an ex opiate user, which I'm not, so I'm using Adobe it

701
01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:05.820
So,

702
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.140
Tomas Valdez: I guess I'm I guess it depends. It depends what group I'm in. If I

703
01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on, come look at me. Don't lose this connection you great say here, so

704
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You are taking a long acting opiate it is for the treatment of chemical dependence to an opiate

705
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It is filling the opiate receptors and it's quite sticky so it stays there longer it stays 2436 hours where the short acting ones pop right off. And then of course you're experiencing with all these are sticky.

706
01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Suboxone stays on there longer you are chemically dependent now hold that in your truth to wherever that needle is for you.

707
01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to tell me what your goal is.

708
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:54.240
Tomas Valdez: Not be clinic chemically dependent

709
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Like right the goal. I don't want to be chemically dependent. Is that my truth or years

710
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:01.110
Tomas Valdez: My truth.

711
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:01.830
Really

712
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.810
Tomas Valdez: Think so. Right. Or I met my mindset and my mother standing

713
01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo, I want to make sure that it's not about what I want, I'm being very careful because

714
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:17.160
Tomas Valdez: I know

715
01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:21.450
Tomas Valdez: You want from your treatment program. I mean, I mean, that's one of the

716
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:22.920
Tomas Valdez: That's one of the things I want.

717
01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To say it one more time so

718
01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:30.930
Tomas Valdez: Yeah. One of the things I want for my children. Yeah, I don't wanna. I don't want to have. I don't have substance in my life.

719
01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:32.040
Tomas Valdez: Okay, there we go.

720
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what am i right

721
01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.020
Tomas Valdez: I don't want it.

722
01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I will follow up.

723
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.630
Tomas Valdez: I just got it.

724
01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want was that in my life.

725
01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it.

726
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:51.930
Tomas Valdez: Now, or at least I don't, I don't want to have to depend on a substance. I don't want, I don't want to need a pill to feel happy. I don't want to need a pill to control my anxiety. I don't want you know oh

727
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.510
Tomas Valdez: I don't want it. I don't need a pill to make me feel better and not in pain, you know,

728
01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:01.350
Tomas Valdez: So I feel normal. Normal

729
01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay but regarding the substance use. I don't want to be dependent on a substance to feel happy or feel no pain is all right.

730
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That basically gets it.

731
01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:18.930
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, I don't

732
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Think he said feel normal.

733
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I really got it. Okay, there we go. Now that is a little bit more precise versus stopped being sick and start using Suboxone to get off opiates.

734
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're already taking you're already taking the Suboxone you shouldn't be feeling any withdrawal symptoms, unless you are

735
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:39.540
The most

736
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:42.090
Tomas Valdez: Economical

737
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I definitely know um let me see. I think we have a different spot in here.

738
01:20:51.150 --> 01:21:02.190
Tomas Valdez: Actually I have. I do have a question, though. Ever since I started taking it all in one dose instead of splitting up my dose into two into two in a day. I have noticed my stomach pain and has gotten a little worse.

739
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:04.350
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

740
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:12.810
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, when I went from just taking in the morning or whatever or know when I went from taking it in the morning and the afternoon. I wasn't waking up with as bad stomach pain.

741
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:20.610
Tomas Valdez: But now that I'm just, I'm taking my dose and, you know, like right after I get it ready and all that. Yes. And then I don't take anything for the whole afternoon.

742
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:27.420
Tomas Valdez: I then I wake up in my stomach's hurting. So I was thinking, you know, withdrawals, but I know that some Suboxone as alarm half life so

743
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk pros and cons, the pros and cons, the pros and cons of this

744
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.430
Tomas Valdez: Sorry I keep looking off. I'm sorry I'm not doing it on purpose.

745
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where they remember

746
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.030
Tomas Valdez: Look to the left. Remember

747
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm

748
01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The pros.

749
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking care of yourself, you would be continuing to experiment what works best for your body. That's smart. That's a pro and you watched it. You like ooh it's worse when I take it in one full dose.

750
01:21:56.310 --> 01:22:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The con. There's two that come to mind right away. Number one, you're not getting the dose. You need into your bloodstream. You're only getting half

751
01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're never getting the right amount that never sits with the right amount. I'm just laying it out, never get the right amount. The one you actually need to mitigate withdrawal symptoms you never it never gets the exact

752
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're taking them at different times of the

753
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Day. So, second one is the second downside of of taking one of the big reasons why I kind of discouraged it in Dr. Solomon and I are not quite on the same page on this, but that's okay.

754
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're working it out. The second reason I don't love it is because it still reinforces substance addictive behavior.

755
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.510
Tomas Valdez: Behavior.

756
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. Oh, I gotta take this. I gotta go check this against him.

757
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is. Yeah, so

758
01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:05.130
Tomas Valdez: I've noticed that like I get that feeling that same feeling now that now that I'm just taking it one time compared to when I was taking it two times

759
01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:12.570
Tomas Valdez: I would get the when I was taking the two times I would get that feeling like I would get when I would you know use oxy or whatever opiate you know like OSHA egos.

760
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:23.280
Tomas Valdez: egos score. I need to go do a lion, or I need to go pop that pill or whatever. You know what I mean, like, it was like it was enough. It was the most important thing going on in my mind. But now I know

761
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:26.760
Tomas Valdez: You're out, you're either you're onto something there.

762
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I am.

763
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.580
Tomas Valdez: Yeah.

764
01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, they're taking them as much as three times a day for China. And I'm like, I can't, I'm like this is mimicking exactly what

765
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:38.100
Tomas Valdez: That defeats the purpose

766
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Of behavior is so it's a challenge. So there's pros and cons. I can't. I cannot, in good conscience tell you what to do with this piece. Not only is it out of my scope of training because this is the medication. All I can do is I can tell you talk with Dr Arielle about it.

767
01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I just talked about nutrition you and I talked about the gut brain connection you are open to it. You said you want to have an open mind.

768
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may, you may consider scheduling an appointment with a dietitian.

769
01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you're really this is a condition that's very distressing for you it might end up getting in the way of socializing, it might get in the way of school. It certainly has gotten in the way of coming into your treatment program so

770
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:29.490
It gets worse.

771
01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.560
Tomas Valdez: It's affected my school, the way it's affected my treatment program. So you can relate those two

772
01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:39.270
Tomas Valdez: Okay, like it's really, it's really messed up my school like like I told you I don't

773
01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:48.030
Tomas Valdez: I don't schedule any classes before noon ever. And that's that makes school really hard on me. But that's the only choice. I've had, but I

774
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:59.370
Tomas Valdez: During my semester I did my internship. I had to do a class at like nine o'clock in the morning, and that was God awful. Oh my god, I used to have to

775
01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:09.540
Tomas Valdez: walk out of the door just like clutching my stomach like in tears. Just like you got to do it. You got to do it gotta do it and and I'd have to go and work out like that and then

776
01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:14.430
Tomas Valdez: It is what it is, gotta do what you gotta do sometimes. Yeah.

777
01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like, in our subsequent sessions so that we do some of the interventions and techniques that that can be processing.

778
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: These issues and it. It's not just, but today was about catching up. We needed to catch up and review your goals. Okay, but in the future ones. I do want to to be a little bit more deliberate about addressing some of those those gut issues. Okay.

779
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's

780
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:43.380
Tomas Valdez: That's that's

781
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Too hard. I mean, oh my goodness, and if it turns out that what we're doing, has a positive impact everything from the breath work.

782
01:25:52.830 --> 01:26:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To to the other interventions. If it turns out that that has a positive effect for you. Can you imagine that you robbed yourself of doing that. I mean,

783
01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have had it. We could have felt better. And right you didn't have an open mind. So definitely have an open mind and let's see if we can help you feel better.

784
01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because this was this preceded the TBI, you had stuff going on. And I'm guessing that there's some stuff going on and family dynamics, some things back

785
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Long before this injury that maybe we can we can kind of have some reprocessing around. All right. You mentioned a goal that had more to do with the

786
01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: PTSD symptoms. I want to stop. So one quick sentence if we can. I just want to make a quick note, I want to stop talking about the accident, all the time, have you caught yourself going

787
01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to talk about something else have you caught yourself.

788
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:52.620
Tomas Valdez: I've caught myself telling the story again. But I stopped myself now.

789
01:26:53.070 --> 01:27:00.150
Tomas Valdez: I don't I don't tell the full story anymore. I found a way how to how to summarize it faster and

790
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:10.140
Tomas Valdez: Or even just tell a snippet of it and just okay so as well and I'll change this up to something that's like so vigilant of it now like

791
01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that was a goal you had, you said I want to stop talking about the accident, all the time. That's a goal you set for yourself. Have you reached it

792
01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:20.880
Tomas Valdez: Not yet.

793
01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:21.690
No. Okay.

794
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweet.

795
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's see if we can measure. Is it a matter of how long you're still talking about it. Is it the frequency you do it. What's a way we can really zero in on how to measure progress a little bit more

796
01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:36.660
Tomas Valdez: I had a percentile in my mind like

797
01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:42.330
Tomas Valdez: I'm at I you know I'm probably at a

798
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.190
Tomas Valdez: As far as like it like in Grades. Grades wise like I'm like I'm doing good at night. Right now I'm doing okay.

799
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you, what do you want to be at

800
01:27:52.320 --> 01:28:03.750
Tomas Valdez: War know where I was, I was at maybe a 60 or 58 or 50. You know what I mean. I want to be at 100 obviously I want to be at 101, you know, an extra credit, but I'll say

801
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we, what if sense what you want is less of something. What if we flip this around. What if we said

802
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what you want is, do you want. You really want zero where you'd never tell anyone, any story.

803
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming. Come on. Don't you want people to know why maybe there might be times when you might be impulsive or maybe you won't think things through. Don't you want the people around you to know.

804
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That that big. I mean isn't part of your prefrontal cortex, the one that organizes and don't want people to know that that's the thing.

805
01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:43.710
Tomas Valdez: I do. But I also don't want people to think that every time they see me, they're going to hear that they're going to hear a complaint, they're going to hear a

806
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:45.120
Tomas Valdez: Story.

807
01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's frequency we just found something. Watch this.

808
01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: More times than not. Do you want, do you want everyone or most people to at least know

809
01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:58.890
Tomas Valdez: Most

810
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we got it. Do you want it basically tell it one time you want to tell most people a maximum of one time accepted.

811
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:07.320
Tomas Valdez: People

812
01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just love and you're just like, let's say fall in love or something and you need that might come up again and again. But for the most part, look at us. We just found it. Most people you want to be, say, at once.

813
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, well then we were getting somewhere. Then, so I think if you were to come back and say, I've reached this goal, you will be

814
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll just say will be

815
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying it to most people for about, what, five minutes.

816
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:43.830
Tomas Valdez: What's that we mean whatever five minutes.

817
01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:44.580
Story.

818
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:52.080
Tomas Valdez: I go longer than five minutes I go like 10 minutes like I get into details.

819
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you want to keep it that way.

820
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.320
Tomas Valdez: No, I wanted

821
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.190
Tomas Valdez: I wanted. Oh, no, no. I wanted less than it

822
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So so so here's, here's the extreme opposite, just so you know man had a traumatic brain injury was in this accident big chunk of my brain that's that's not in there.

823
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:11.610
Tomas Valdez: And sometimes

824
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I do is I kind of impulsive and I don't think things through these kind of important one.

825
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not, I don't really want to talk about it again. But if you ever see me kind of doing something like that I welcome you know pointed out to me or kind of consider that and don't get too pissed off. Now that was 60 seconds right

826
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's me. Right. And I went really extreme, it's not 10 minutes I went real tight, tight, tight, tight. Um, what do you want

827
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:51.660
Tomas Valdez: I before I before I tell you that I've tried what you what you did. And I'm scared to do that because I'm afraid people look at me like you're a frickin weirdo dudes like stop it, like, okay, cool, like if someone is like like

828
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.620
Hey,

829
01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.320
Tomas Valdez: What's up,

830
01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You take up 10 minutes of their time instead

831
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

832
01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: No. What are you afraid will happen.

833
01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:07.080
Tomas Valdez: What's that, what do you, what are you afraid will happen.

834
01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:10.530
Tomas Valdez: Um,

835
01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.980
Tomas Valdez: What, what do you think of me, I guess.

836
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.840
Tomas Valdez: Or, or, or what do you mean, I guess, I don't know, maybe I missed

837
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You said earlier, and then I'm gonna have to go. But you said, I'm afraid they'll think I'm a weirdo.

838
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:26.460
Tomas Valdez: Yeah, they're just

839
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: A, watch, watch. The irony of that when I was describing it just now. I did a little role play

840
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I sound irrational or like I was missing a part of my brain.

841
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So the irony is, I'm talking about a missing a part of my brain that's methodical and logical I'm literally saying I I'm missing that part of my brain. But what I'm doing in front of my friend is being rational and logical you see

842
01:31:55.290 --> 01:32:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you won't look weird. You'll actually they'll probably scratch their head like anyone who can self identify

843
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: As the ability to be assertive and clear and precise and be able to make the connection between this injury and a possible disconnect and interpersonal level or maybe I don't show up for something

844
01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It, they're probably going to say, Dude, like I was saying in you at all. I mean, damn, you're saying it right now. I think it's the opposite. I think it it's it's actually showing that you can be organized methodical and precise and socially competent. I don't see what you see

845
01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But 10 minutes of animation and on and on. We're, we're WATCH, WE listeners can only hold one or two sentences at a time and you just gave me 10 minutes of probably because I listened to you before, probably almost uninterrupted

846
01:32:52.170 --> 01:32:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: monologue. Because if I don't interrupt and I'm not really pushing you'll

847
01:32:56.850 --> 01:33:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll give me lots and lots of really great information. But it's hard to hold it. We don't. We can't

848
01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people can't hold a lot. They can only hold in working memory about a sentence or two, it's not their fault. I can't either. That's why I'll say, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to think about that now because I'm broken but because I can only think for just this little bit so

849
01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:33.300
Tomas Valdez: With it with the frontal lobe TBI. That's why, that's why I'm so but I don't mean to be pushy, and like in the inner interrupt people interrupt people because I know I do. I know, I know I interrupt people a lot but

850
01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:44.580
Tomas Valdez: And I always say when I interrupt people like, I'm sorry, like, let me just tell you this before I forget, because, and then I have to go into story about how I have brain problems this and then. Okay, so this is what I want to say.

851
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.040
Tomas Valdez: I catch myself doing that. I'm like, Oh my God, you did.

852
01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.010
Tomas Valdez: You need to tell them that they probably don't care.

853
01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We care we do care. We do want to understand. Okay, so what we noticed today. And this is stuff that you and I can talk about is if you if you liked what I did. Maybe we'll, we'll come up with is a nice short tight little story.

854
01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can practice it.

855
01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can remember it, that's all because you couldn't remember all these details. I bet if we practiced and rehearsed it the brain.

856
01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It can do a lot if we rehearse and rehearse that okay we can we can do that if you like that and you get real time to see if you're perceived as weird or not. I don't think you're going to

857
01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're gonna like the outcome because it gives space for other people to then have a response, and they can talk to you. And then there's a nice flow, we do need to go down to run this group.

858
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna, I already sent the doctor a message. So she should be taken care of the order for you. I want to meet with you again, when are you free again.

859
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:56.100
Tomas Valdez: Let me know. Yeah, you let me know if you know you know my schedule.

860
01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not right now. I do not

861
01:34:58.650 --> 01:34:59.880
Monday.

862
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:08.400
Tomas Valdez: Tuesdays and Thursdays. I have class from like one I basically one to four and then

863
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:15.630
Tomas Valdez: Fridays. I have class from 1130 to two

864
01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.450
Tomas Valdez: So there you go. That's my, that's my school schedule right now.

865
01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:32.370
Tomas Valdez: Okay, and I have time to ask you what to do. But I'm going to, I'm going to run it. I'm going to run into my brother who I don't get along with. And I don't get out and talk to you. I'm going to see him now for this for the funeral.

866
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:41.070
Tomas Valdez: Okay, yeah, I know it did it by my grandma. It's about. It's not about us. So I think that's where it needs to stay and I hope you stick. I hope it gets better.

867
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just think of a nice thing to say. I hope you're doing well and just announce I'm hanging in there. She was close to me. I hope you're doing well.

868
01:35:50.460 --> 01:36:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm hanging in there. I was really close to her. Hope you're doing well. I'm always here to talk to you memorize one quick thing. You take the lead by saying how you're doing just already have it memorized. Okay, something quick and easy like that and just hand them out to everybody.

869
01:36:07.650 --> 01:36:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, everybody gets a dose of that the people that you can trust they get a little bit more. Okay.

870
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:14.550
Tomas Valdez: All right.

871
01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I will love. I'm gonna get have to go. I'll work out a schedule and texture.

872
01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:19.110
Okay.

873
01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.630
Tomas Valdez: Okay, bye. Have a good day.
