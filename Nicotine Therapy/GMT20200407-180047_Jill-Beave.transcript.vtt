00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:21.300
Lauren Johnston: Yeah, they keep that it like they're supposed to have died and the X rays. You can see where the roots has just gone. Surprisingly, I still have those ones. They're all the other ones. So yeah, it's just a lot of sensitivity in that area now.

136
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, and

137
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:33.930
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So are you doing any therapy or counseling on a routine basis or were you doing any of that, and Florida.

138
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:43.380
Lauren Johnston: Yeah, I was doing that in Florida. I went to any meetings law down for now. I haven't been able to get that established up here. So yeah, those are all my intentions and trying to get back

139
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.150
Lauren Johnston: To normal mental

140
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.480
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah and now with all the pandemic going on.

141
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.500
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, I don't think anybody's meeting in person, I believe, everybody's online.

142
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.160
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So what

143
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:05.640
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Recovery or what bright health heart does is we meet online and group meetings with group therapy and those meetings are Wednesdays at 10am

144
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:13.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. Every Wednesday at 10am you'll come to group and meet and it'll be myself and a therapist and

145
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Other patients from Ohio, who are going through similar things. And that's how we do our therapy.

146
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:31.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Away. We know that you know you're in therapy and studies show that participating in therapy really does impact your sobriety and it makes it much more successful.

147
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:42.540
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So just make sure when you come to group that you're in an area that's private so that other people can't hear what what's going on in the group. And, you know, can't hear your conversation.

148
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Just kind of been maintain that that privacy for the

149
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.340
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So what questions do you have for me as of right now, just yet.

150

182
00:15:54.150 --> 00:16:01.560
Lauren Johnston: You know, I double checked it and everything because like I said I'm nude up here. I'm new to this insurance. I'm like, freaking out of just trying to make sure that everything is in its

183
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:11.820
Lauren Johnston: Place, because I don't want to jeopardize their mess anything up. I'm trying to get all of this taken care of. Like I said, I can get back to normal and

184
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:20.640
Lauren Johnston: as normal as I can be. And yeah, I double checked with them and they take my insurance so I'm happy about that. Just hope everything can be smooth sailing from here.

185
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so I have the Walgreens, is that the pharmacy, you want to use.

Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. Um, so I will send in your medication to there.

190
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.330
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do you have any other questions that's come to mind. So it's just we've just been

191
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:54.360
Lauren Johnston: Talking just not do I need, are you guys able to prescribe me my clonazepam also or do I have to seek a different doctor for that.

192
00:16:54.810 --> 00:17:00.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I will be honest with you. This is my third week with this company. So I'm not exactly sure on the

193
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Other policy on that. So I've got that wrote down to double check.

194
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:06.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so

195
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah. And the other problem I'm having is trying to find you are prescribing history so

196
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:29.430
Lauren Johnston: So there was um well i i don't know maybe if it's not 34952 I mean my address I had it forwarded to my mother's house. I don't know if that makes a difference if I should give you my most recent that i know i mean i give you three different zip codes, if that helps.

197
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.510
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I just tried to refresh my screen. Is that what helping in it didn't. So I got to put your information back then.

198
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.710
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so yeah. Give me try is a difference of code.

199
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:48.090
Lauren Johnston: Okay try 349579 would be the most recent as far as like mail for dating goes and

200
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.010
Lauren Johnston: All that

201
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.730
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Now,

202
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:10.470
Lauren Johnston: There's 34982 and I want to say my doctor might still have that address. It is the one in Florida might have had that always still there and never changed my address with them possibly

203
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.470
