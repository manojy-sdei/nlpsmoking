00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

3
00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.109
Gwenevere Abriel: And seeing you guys in a while together.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.780
Ateeq Dean: I know it's been a while now.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And the world has changed since we last met

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.450
Ateeq Dean: Oh, sure.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you guys

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Live in with this. How is this changing the stress level the tension between you two. I mean, how can it not, oh yeah, all we got finger point. We got finger pointing. Yeah.

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.550
Ateeq Dean: I've been stressing out and

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.720
Ateeq Dean: The other day

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.480
Ateeq Dean: When this was all really new.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.300
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I, I've been snapping at her.

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.870
Ateeq Dean: You know, there's nothing better stuff and

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
Ateeq Dean: I'm going to calm down and it took a while. But I started to combat stuff.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we get now a teak it's so interesting because

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like a revelation for me to realize that this expression of your emotions. This sharing of a family history is not like it's not a norm for you.

18
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really new. And in fact,

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Kara.

20
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I saying it right yes it's you're like one of the first trusted people that he's been able to do that with. So this is all new new noon.

21
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I each time I hear, hey, this is the first time I'm kind of doing this, I have to remember

22
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This is new.

23
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I take it for granted. I mean, you're an intelligent man And you know, I just think, Oh, surely, he's he's talking to people. I forget. Did you do that.

24
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

25
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at Kara antique

26
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When she is scared and that covers anxious nervous and see worried. How does she express that worry

27
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.100
Ateeq Dean: Um, she feel usually tell me how she's feeling right away.

28
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it nice to know what's going on in in her mind, kind of like what the

29
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.480
Ateeq Dean: Context, because I'm there to comfort her

30
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So you don't think she's a week.

31
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

32
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: He thinks she's a loser.

33
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.260
No.

34
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then.

35
00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But you act out instead. And I call acting out it goes for a lot of our behavior will get passive aggressive will get snippy sniping snooty will get lot the right we'll, we'll kind of act out in some way instead of sharing how we're feeling

36
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But I have to remember, that's not your cultural meaning in your family each each home is different. That's not the style that you were raised with you guys didn't share what's going on for you.

37
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:38.130
Ateeq Dean: Know maybe mean she's, she's seen how I kind of communicate with my family and we fight a lot, me and my sisters we do end to fight a lot and we don't really talk. We just like blah bad one another and we stopped for a while and then we'll talk like nothing happened.

38
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you might notice over time. A teak that

39
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That that will change.

40
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I think once you really get the utility of a different way of communicating. I think that's going to be different with your sister and she might like it too. And you guys might start having a more direct communication, but let's come back to you too. Okay.

41
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's make the most out of this time together.

42
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there's this undercurrent of uncertainty and one perspective could be

43
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Snow worse than any flu season. It could be the response globally in the context of a particular political environment, let's say,

44
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be that that's the outcome of all of this.

45
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Me not that big a deal. And it's this global response.

46
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't predict it, and neither can you.

47
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We can make safeguards keep things sort of lots of hand washing and things like that.

48
00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But a teak. What is your fear. I'm most spent a lot of time here for turns out that you're able to compartmentalize this and kind of put it off to the side. I just kind of want to hear what it is, what's the the imagination that's going on in your head.

49
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:15.630
Ateeq Dean: I hear that I won't be around to raise my daughter. That's what scares me the most. I just want to be a part of her life. I don't want nothing to happen to me or to her mom.

50
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And your spiritual perspective of what you have named in the past is worrying the recipe to prediction. Let me say that again.

51
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If you worry about it enough, then you can change the outcome of your future.

52
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm saying, hey, this is a tricky question. That's all the time.

53
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's see what he says to it.

54
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.920
Ateeq Dean: If I take a bit long enough, I can change the outcome on my future. Yeah.

55
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If you worry.

56
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that I want you to worry

57
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm 23 hours out of the 24 hours to try not to eat. I see if you can skip some sleep. In fact, really get into it.

58
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a paradoxical thing obviously I'm not very subtle. And in fact, if you do a little even almost 23 and a half hours of worrying. Do you think that that will prevent more test.

59
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: No Why not

60
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.980
Ateeq Dean: I think when it's my time to go. I'll go, I can really

61
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.930
Ateeq Dean: Stop.

62
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.070
Ateeq Dean: Or anyone can really stop when is there time to go.

63
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you see why it could be and Tara, you said, I've been telling us and telling us mention this.

64
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That it might be a waste of your time.

65
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To be getting in the way of that right if you can say what I believe is

66
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: When it's my time, then it's my time. Now when you say that, does that mean that there's it's predestined like it's already set like there's nothing you can do to change your environment.

67
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.020
Ateeq Dean: I feel like that.

68
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.690
Ateeq Dean: Okay, no, I what I imagine is me getting old.

69
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:32.520
Ateeq Dean: Okay, that's, you know, like living 100 years maybe plus that'd be awesome. But I have. I've always said I was little, you know, pictured getting old going now We did my sleep up nice.

70
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we did it completely different today and I won't spend a lot of time on this, you can actually, I think you can see that it's a waste of time.

71
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: To put energy into something that you actually have no control over. But what you could do is you could do this thing that you're not very rehearsed at is, you could look at your sweetheart. And you could say,

72
00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I lost my dad to this, I lost. I had a loss, and I don't want to not be there for my own child that's sharing. Now that might not be your truth. I might be something I made up.

73
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's sharing that's putting a connection to why it might be so resistant, why even hearing from from Kara. Hey, he doing this it we've got other you know it won't get through, like, you're still so maybe busy worried worried worried

74
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you look at her. Let's look at each other here because it's not just about the short term snipping we often times right or snippy and short tempered because we have something under underneath it all.

75
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just as I'm talking with you now. Are you starting to think about something that maybe you want to share with her. Yes.

76
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.380
Ateeq Dean: I worry that if something happens to me and

77
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.350
Ateeq Dean: You would have to raise our daughter.

78
00:08:53.550 --> 00:09:05.910
Ateeq Dean: I just worry that, you know, because when I would what my dad got really sick. He wasn't really there for me and it was time for me to kind of grow up and

79
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:16.920
Ateeq Dean: Kind of put on his shoes and work and go to school and take care of everything. While he was able to, I don't want her to go to

80
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.620
And that's what we're here.

81
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear your question care. I just couldn't use drop in here.

82
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.520
Ateeq Dean: I asked him if that's what he was worried about with her growing up that she would really have

83
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:54.840
Ateeq Dean: I feel like he missed out a lot of his childhood and I asked him if that's what he's worried about with our daughter, if something happens to have if you feel she'll have to grow up too quickly and get a job. And how about the family and stuff like that.

84
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So you asked a clarification question and

85
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to looking at each other.

86
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So uh teak share with Cara yes or no, I think, I think you really understand what I'm talking about, just let her know. Yes. You understand what I'm talking

87
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and now Kara. Why don't you share with him, what your concerns are and they may be a different topic. Don't know.

88
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.560
Ateeq Dean: Concerns about the future.

89
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it they can be on anything you want the, I don't want to steer that part. This can be on whatever you want. Just this is an opportunity if you want to, while I'm here.

90
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:56.130
Ateeq Dean: I want to get lost in your head and why and stuff like this box you down. So the time that we do have to get

91
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:04.380
Ateeq Dean: used to wearing searching sofa and watching videos about what can happen.

92
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We have our demo. Okay, tell him how you feel. So there's an emotion that happens when you see him spending his time searching

93
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, OK. Let's give him time to mirror that back.

94
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to be a take the structure and I'll review. Let me see if I got that right. You feel sad when I

95
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:40.350
Ateeq Dean: You feel sad when I worry and I watch all these videos of what's happening around the world. When we can just enjoy our time now. Yes.

96
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.760
Ateeq Dean: Okay, ask her if there's more. Is there anything else.

97
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's a different way to phrase it try it a little bit differently is a really invitation. Is there one

98
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.630
Ateeq Dean: Did I get that right.

99
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And is there more

100
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.200
Is there more

101
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.510
As we

102
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:17.730
Ateeq Dean: See, two to three, it's on your head, you have a hard time focusing on anything because I have noticed I'm talking to you. And then the next thing you say to me, don't have anything to do with what I said is, whatever your thing.

103
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and let's get to the feeling. The reason why you bring this up to tell them how you feel when

104
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound.

105
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:36.840
Ateeq Dean: So I feel sad when you're consumed by these kind of negative thoughts. I feel like you kind of checked out of what we have going on.

106
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can mirror some of that back critique. It was a lot. See what you can do.

107
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:58.290
Ateeq Dean: So what you said is that I get so consumed did my thoughts and the negative thoughts that I got going on. And when you talk to me. I

108
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:06.630
Ateeq Dean: Completely spaced out on what you told me, and I talked to you about something completely different. And that makes you sad.

109
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of okay so

110
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:18.390
Ateeq Dean: In general, yeah. Little checked out into your head, not just when I'm talking to belly, you're just kind of in your own world.

111
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you. All right, let's try a next level piece. So Tara did something really organically it right up front. When we first got here, and that is that she validated you she did something very naturally. She took history and story on her own.

112
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: She said, Is this, is this about a miss childhood stuff she used information that she had on her own. She didn't mirror back you exact thing she said she did was called empathy validation. Okay. And you felt heard right away.

113
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to do that for her.

114
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you this. This is going to take some ownership. So a teak what I'd like you to do is, is try this. It's going to, I'm going to do some modeling of it.

115
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you you make it your own. Okay, so I'm going to make up a story. Some of it might work. Some of it will just be totally off base. So it might look like this. If Cara's here and I'm talking to her, and might say,

116
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I kind of get what you're saying because

117
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually a lot of people have told me that I kind of look like I'm not even here when they've been talking to me and I've heard that from a few different people and I do I

118
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the ability to be sitting right here, but the way in the future of totally almost like out of my body and really not not present with you.

119
00:14:51.690 --> 00:15:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now I made that up. But that's taking my own history. It's not regurgitating being a mirror shouldn't say those things.

120
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: She said, in general, right, you're kind of like not here are disconnected a camera her wording when you're when you're checked out you. It's like, in general, like when I'm talking to your kind of checked out in general.

121
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I did was not mirror that back. I took my own personal experience, although fabricated

122
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I let my sweetheart know Kara. She's not crazy. I know I imagine what you're seeing is this thing that I'm describing because other people have said it. And I kind of know that about myself. I listened to you sometimes Karen, I am, I'm busy, kind of in a fantasy.

123
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. That's validation that's taking our own experience, and we're letting this person know you're not insane. What you're saying is real.

124
00:15:53.250 --> 00:16:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see if you can do it. Look at her and the piece was in general, I think it was in general, you're kind of checked out was that kind of yet.

125
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:01.770
Yeah.

126
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:17.640
Ateeq Dean: So in general, I checked out, but I am also listen to it might look like that. I'm my own little world, but a lot of the times, the way I feel is like I have so much on my mind.

127
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:27.750
Ateeq Dean: If I'm gonna lose my job, or if we're going to make a suit next month or, you know, like I've been really stressed out about all the food supplies and stuff going

128
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:38.280
Ateeq Dean: Like that. And I've been really worried about the baby food and stuff like that. So I just want to make sure that the baby to we get through this.

129
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So the part, the part that's not working antique is your chance to find your behavior. You're almost there. You're so close. It would include something like you didn't say this part Carrie, you're right. I'm not present with you. I am worried I'm

130
00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.920
Ateeq Dean: I feel like she's not

131
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.540
Ateeq Dean: I feel like I am present with her, but I still have those thoughts on my

132
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so tell me some of the things that she's, she's talked about you with

133
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.230
Ateeq Dean: Shield and I'll listen to her, but

134
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm asking. I'm asking. I'm asking. I'm checking. I'm calling your bluff right now.

135
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.480
Ateeq Dean: Okay, so we'll be talking me and her will be talking and I'll be listening to exactly what she said.

136
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know what she said, I want to know what she said. I'm calling your bluff. Want to know what she said what she said she'll

137
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:40.650
Ateeq Dean: Tell me to repeat what I said. And I'll tell her exactly what she said until they call your listing. But how come you don't look at me and I tell her like I can multitask. Oh.

138
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You do a crappy job. You want to know why I know you do a crappy job because we all do.

139
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, I don't know if you remember, I haven't done any the MTR with you yet. It's typically when I get into working memory is we have this this this ability

140
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To. Let's say we can do, you know, four plus five divided by three. It means we can hold you know divided by means we hold a certain piece of information and we can do some mechanics with it. We can only hold a small chunk of information at a time.

141
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't hold different chunks like this. Well, yeah, so

142
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.110
Ateeq Dean: Well, that's why I got kind of defensive

143
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do it. We all do it, and

144
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.790
Ateeq Dean: Like I'm not, but it's my emotions. Doing it itself.

145
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's that's that's that's just habit.

146
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now maybe under a normal relationship someone that doesn't know you well I'm or isn't seeking intimacy, you can get away with that. But she wants to feel I'm guessing.

147
00:18:50.730 --> 00:19:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That you care about what's being talked about and not half of it not half of your attention, which is true because the other half is in worry mode. Your whole you're having to force.

148
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that other stuff you're distracted by these other pieces. You're not when she says you are not present. She's really on to a cool word because that's what's happening. You're not literally listening.

149
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: To relate to validate to also offer comfort and support you not listening for that you're just doing the I'm going to listen to some of the words that will be able to measure those back if she asked me, I'll pass this quiz. That's not the same thing. Hey,

150
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is handy is mirroring is and you know I always start with that. And I love it is very different than what she's looking for is maybe

151
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I want this, I want to be known and understood in this moment that I'm not going through this moment alone. It's a weird dynamic, but we need to know this other person we're talking to is really present with us. So yes, you'd like to think that you're good at multitasking.

152
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is, it isn't working. It hasn't isn't having me effect you want it to. She's not feeling heard and connected to you look checked out a teak you also have and I don't know if you've noticed this Kara. And I don't know if you're aware of it.

153
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me start with you. How would you describe the way my tone moves. Do you know tone is like this would be

154
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes up and down. Yeah.

155
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm kind of animated on demonstrative it. I GOT MY PAWS out. I'm always kind of like all over. Yeah. So I'm very animated

156
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: My, my voice does go it's high and then it can come down here and when I'm really, I want to slow down, I can do it.

157
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very aware of my pitch my volume my rate of speech. I pay attention to it.

158
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you describe yours.

159
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.300
Ateeq Dean: When I get defensive my speech goes up.

160
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.330
Ateeq Dean: When I'm calm and kind of I keep it level like that. Okay.

161
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So what goes up tongue rate or

162
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.270
My tone.

163
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.280
Ateeq Dean: The speed that I talked to go. Okay.

164
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Tone up and speak. Can I hear it.

165
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.100
Ateeq Dean: Example,

166
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.560
Ateeq Dean: I'm not gonna say it too loud because the little one is sleeping.

167
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.970
Okay, so here's one where I'm yeah

168
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.030
Ateeq Dean: I told you to be up this morning I bought this building and you didn't get up with the hell.

169
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

170
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.730
Start my little

171
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so pretty close. Kara.

172
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:52.890
Yeah.

173
00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Right. Yeah, I'll be the volume is up higher. So there's a rate of speech that goes up the prosody, we might say that goes up and down, up and down goes, it goes up higher. And there's a higher volume, um,

174
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What about your empathy.

175
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's a tone of a love comfort level, use the word comfort you know the word comfort. Right.

176
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:32.700
Ateeq Dean: Um, I did what I noticed, I don't know if it's empathy, but I just noticed, like what I know at her, she'll throw back at me. So all sudden we're ballplayer bad rating. Yeah.

177
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty common, but I'm really asking specifically about how you modulate your tone rate of speech and the volume when you're trying to show someone care. Do you know how to modulate that way.

178
00:22:48.090 --> 00:23:02.610
Ateeq Dean: I do, I do. Oh, when we, when we talk and when were you know, in a moment of connection. I'll refer back and just look at her and talk to her. Ensure that I am president. Okay.

179
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.120
So,

180
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:12.210
Ateeq Dean: Predators, and he does talk a little bit quieter and maybe a little bit faster than his normal

181
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.670
Ateeq Dean: Tone like the way he normally talks. When you start

182
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: quieter and faster. Yeah. Okay. So let me try it a different way. And I think you're noticing what I'm getting at. I'm not subtle.

183
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I am

184
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you're talking to your baby I seek

185
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear you talk to the baby. Can I hear how you would talk to her.

186
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:47.370
Ateeq Dean: I make a bunch of sounds like oh yeah oh my god I love your little baby no

187
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.120
Ateeq Dean: No go like that and do things with my hands. Okay.

188
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's called queueing

189
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.960
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, cool. You come in.

190
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And out just. This is one of the

191
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: First ones I've ever heard you raise the pitch of your voice.

192
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Kara. Did you hear it.

193
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.540
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, that's basically the only time with her.

194
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one I'm talking about. This is going to be a shocker for you to take, believe it or not, we adults.

195
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We like that sound to the same way this. Oh, does your body wellness nutrition yoga a boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, we like it as little tiny tots.

196
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it says this is safe, high pitch sounds. This is not one of your stuff. This is this is science.

197
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is science are hiding pitched voices and

198
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What they do to a little infant is it says it's safe.

199
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now just imagine that that becomes a norm. So now, a growling tiger. A girl sound.

200
00:24:54.270 --> 00:25:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Has been threat has been danger for as long as we've been alive and it's just out there in the animal kingdom. Like, this is how it works. Right. That growl deep sound means danger. So take that moving into adulthood.

201
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not that much different.

202
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, we're not. So when we go, you know what, so if I said to take care of.

203
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, see my voice just went up I exaggerated it, but when I listened to a to do you know that I don't hear it. I don't hear porosity, I hear this.

204
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:40.290
Ateeq Dean: It takes a long time to anybody. It really when we first got together. I do.

205
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I do, baby.

206
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Baby

207
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:46.620
Ateeq Dean: Boys. I do.

208
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.150
Ateeq Dean: I do it the way I'm talking now it's like Monday.

209
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.950
Ateeq Dean: Relax boys me mean her

210
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be convenient to know that if she would agree, she just walked away to get the baby. But if she comes back, we might want to ask her.

211
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do that, because I've never seen you do it, really. And typically, yeah. You have a very unique style.

212
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can not match the content.

213
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't like it's confusing.

214
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless they really know super, super, super subtle sounds. That's why I asked you to make the sound. The cooling sound with the baby.

215
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Girl.

216
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.790
What a cutie patootie.

217
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.010
Ateeq Dean: Else now.

218
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.120
Okay.

219
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.530
Well,

220
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi. Hello.

221
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.240
Exciting.

222
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm Kara. Can you still hear me, yes I do you find that when he's trying to show you, compassion comfort and care that he uses

223
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: prosody, which is that cooing those higher pitches because you said it was quieter and faster, but you didn't say that he had that pitch change like he does with the cooling the baby.

224
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.720
Ateeq Dean: I don't know. I don't think so. Maybe

225
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So a tikka saying he does have it. He says, I do.

226
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.570
Ateeq Dean: Oh, don't example out there.

227
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

228
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.140
Ateeq Dean: What we find is if you don't love me.

229
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:54.720
Ateeq Dean: And that go back and forth and I'll be out no bad, but I love you. I love you so much and you and that's where my tone of voice will change to a higher pitch and

230
00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I heard it right there in the note. I've heard. I've heard it up there. Once I heard it on the note, baby, I love you and then it came back down. Does this seem just completely insane that I'm bringing this up to you and take

231
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.570
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I never noticed that.

232
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.430
Ateeq Dean: Good.

233
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but it's kind of a neat thing. It's just one more way that we communicate

234
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And why not use all of the angles that we can, we have our body posture. We can have an open posture. We can have eye contact.

235
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We can have a little tilted head and we can we can use the tone of our voice and the volume and the rate to send the message, no baby I do love you know i i do love, you know, baby, I love you. Yeah, it sounds

236
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't, it isn't always what we say it's how we say it.

237
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I want to empower you with this piece of information. Now, right now, my guess is a big piece of it may be unconscious. All this is doing is saying there's other levels. And if you want to explore explore it further.

238
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It might might have something to do with that she's not feeling connected

239
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're busy doing two things at once. Number one, you won't be grayed out at one of them's going to suffer probably both of them are going to suffer and the person that you're trying to reassure and comfort.

240
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You're probably going to be doing that monotone sound and they're not going to feel it and you may seem checked out.

241
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about how hard it is. I'm having to really define it and and explicitly describe this change in tone, but I couldn't do my job. If I didn't have the ability to modulate how I talk to see how my breath is different. It says, doesn't it say I care.

242
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's different, isn't it then. Well, you know, that's just the way it is. You know, it's just this different is a different vibration

243
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: With the tone is different. So a teak. The goal is to give you another place for you to play with different communication. You probably got this particular style somewhere along the line.

244
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Kara. When you look at his family of origin, have you seen that anywhere else where it's it's it's sort of a norm to be able to talk in a monotone way have you seen it anywhere else and his family of origin anywhere.

245
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:46.890
Ateeq Dean: His dad talks like that. But I don't know how it was before either has died on vacation.

246
00:30:49.050 --> 00:31:00.240
Ateeq Dean: A lot of times if you want. This is the thing we have to with interrupting and kind of if you want to talk and his family. You need to yell over the other person that's talking

247
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:14.850
Ateeq Dean: So that's been a thing with us and recently I've like hello you interrupted me, excuse me, and it's normal for him. Like, and I had my sister pointed it out. He's like, he interrupted.

248
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:29.310
Ateeq Dean: And I was like, I, at that point, I didn't even notice anymore. But then I started noticing again and then his sisters do it if you want to talk, you have to interrupt. Somebody I feel like especially when I'm talking to sisters. I can't get a word in edgewise. Like they just

249
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.190
Ateeq Dean: When I was younger, my dad did a lot of mechanics and older cars.

250
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:53.940
Ateeq Dean: Everyone I will talk to him who would be working on something and talking to me and I felt like he didn't this hear me and I will tell him that he did you hear me and he's like, No, I heard you. And he would repeat back to me. So I feel like I picked that up to a lot of times

251
00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:02.070
Ateeq Dean: He really, you know, I didn't feel like he heard he heard the words like me, you know,

252
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.480
Yeah, so I feel like that's where a lot of that.

253
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.250
List.

254
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we've got on all the fancy terms are all lovely and good

255
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But we, you know, if a if we don't know that we're doing it, it can continue

256
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And not knowing how to replace it with something else. If it's foreign like I don't know how to replace it. How do I show connection, that kind of thing.

257
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: For now for a take if you want to play with something new. It would be

258
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: To actually watch her face. So we watch aspect. This is called aspect. So you can see mine right you'll be able to, you could probably label how I'm feeling what based on

259
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably just a couple of things. Just right in here on my eyes. Okay. So right now, why don't you see how I might be feeling

260
00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:57.720
Ateeq Dean: Annoyed

261
00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I look at my, look at my mouth.

262
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's tomorrow. Marky Mark

263
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Mark watch my breath.

264
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I could turn away if I turn away from you.

265
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you just lost your audience. Oh, so if you start to pay attention to her aspect you want. Remember we communicate

266
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a message received

267
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When she says to you, something like I am not feeling very love these days. I'm not feeling very connected

268
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to get a message of no babe. I love you.

269
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, do you know whose job it is to communicate.

270
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the, the one talking

271
00:33:51.150 --> 00:34:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't think that we think, can you just, it's your problem. You know, we've got to try it a different way. Try another way, try another way, if I want to send a message.

272
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I do love you. I do love you. You're right. Right now, I was distracted and I was worrying. My mind was half here. I was distracted by these other things. I don't want to do it that way. I want to show you right now. I'm completely present

273
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you may not know you're doing that, that dual awareness thing if you're not watching her face.

274
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't watch her face when your eyes are somewhere else and you're working on a car in a sense we have to be looking

275
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: At them. We've got to be connected. And you might get some information from her face, whether you're having the message received the way you intended it if the message is no babe, I do love you.

276
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to look on her face and see if it was received the way you intended it for face might be a really good way to find out if you are spaced out because

277
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not feeling it. Let's say you look at her face. You know what I see. You look like you. I'm not present. So let me, let me see if I've got anything else on my mind and I do I'm, I'm so distracted by what's going on.

278
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But Kara, even if he said that if he owned in the moment that he was distracted without feel like he's being honest and connecting with you in a real way. Yeah, I'd be better.

279
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.980
Knows what's going on so

280
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, to know that a teak we don't always know that we're trying to run problem solving for the 10 things all the balls in the air that we have. We don't. Sometimes we don't realize that we're doing that.

281
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And the people in our lives can remind us that we're not connecting with them.

282
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have to be defensive over it you can just say you're. This is one of those times, you're right. I'm going to put that aside.

283
00:35:54.030 --> 00:36:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll think about our worries on the pressures in a few minutes. But for now, what's going on for you, Kara. You just tuned in to her.

284
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So pay attention to her aspect and remember the job is for you to get your message across. So you could check your own eye contact. You could check your tone of voice.

285
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You can kind of check your mind and see if you've got other things going on.

286
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this other piece that that you're describing about the yelling over. Yeah.

287
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so interesting. You do that. That's such an interesting technique.

288
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm watching it played with in business. It's actually quite an effective one to bulldoze you just keep talking. And eventually, the person will just stop. They'll just shush, and right it is effective.

289
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But, uh, so what have you tried to do carrot to interrupt that when you are interrupted it let's say you're having you're talking

290
00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: From a writer and he interrupts you. What have you done to try to solve that disruption.

291
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.140
Ateeq Dean: Hey you interrupted me. I wasn't done

292
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. And what does he do

293
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:14.100
Ateeq Dean: Either. Oh, sorry. If, then, after that, though. I feel like he's not listening. He's thinking about where he wants to say it was or what I say.

294
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.070
Ateeq Dean: The principle of it like

295
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

296
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, we can tear. Did I ever show you that list to take. Are you there in that group and I had a whole list and you just described. One of them, which is we're

297
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We're thinking about our response. We're not actually listening to what someone saying we're storing up our great ideas about what we're about to say. As soon as you shush.

298
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you end up seeing that list.

299
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.190
Ateeq Dean: Um, it was going one day, right.

300
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now wasn't Monday was a few weeks ago.

301
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a pretty cool.

302
00:37:52.170 --> 00:38:00.000
Ateeq Dean: Thank you all. I usually I'm usually hear me. Was it the list with all 50 of those yesterday model I

303
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Know this one, I think there were 12 ways barriers to listening.

304
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know what, that's one of them.

305
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.170
Ateeq Dean: I think I missed that one.

306
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.410
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I think I missed that one.

307
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So you probably identify with a few of those on there.

308
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So you guys already have the skills necessary for this part, if you are already a team able to tolerate being told hey you interrupted me I'm not done.

309
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can tolerate that. That's a huge step in your favor because you could get pissed off and storm out and rant and rave over just that.

310
00:38:46.980 --> 00:39:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so to your credit okay care that is a plus. He can he can tolerate the redirection now unfortunately he doesn't hear that you want to feel heard,

311
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't get that he's just like, Okay. Well, that just means I have to store in my working memory on my list. And so all he's doing is thinking about that. And he's not listening to you.

312
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: He's going to think about his list, remember something about working memory can't hold on to too much at a time and he doesn't want to forget his good list.

313
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It so

314
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Antique she's not going to feel heard, when you're thinking about what you want to say you're not going to be able to show compassion and care. None of us knew it, we can't do it. I mean, I can pull it off because I'm like good at those times. I like worked at it because I have to.

315
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:53.070
Ateeq Dean: Feel like I really was listening and I, but I see where you are coming from. You're right.

316
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The total looking at her. So the way you say things does matter.

317
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:09.600
Ateeq Dean: And I didn't. I guess I got so you know clicking away from it. I didn't really see how I was acting myself.

318
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's get back really far as if it was us looking at Planet Earth. Okay, why do we bother getting married. Why do we bother. Is it so we can be right so that we can really finally someone and be like, Yeah, I've got good evidence for how smart I am and now valuable. No, we don't.

319
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We get together because it feels good to be known to be seen.

320
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This, believe it or not, it's just this

321
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Containing is the reason why therapy for some people can feel so good because guess what I don't do I don't make it about me.

322
00:40:51.270 --> 00:41:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my therapy feels like this, you're the baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's gonna be okay. And I remind you of how lovable and good and kind. You're okay right there right that we get together with someone, so we can feel seen and loved

323
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.970
Don't forget that part.

324
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be right and have your facts and your ducks together in five minutes and I'm telling you, it can go really fast when the person that comes to you in a need an emotional need if we give them what they need, which is

325
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You have my undivided attention. I love you and I'm gonna show you that you're important to me. Guess what they feel better and off they go. Karen needs to know she's okay to love them and then off she goes. And then guess what

326
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You can start fixating on all your little stuff that you want to pray about now I have my opinion about your list some of it might be a little more or less productive to put your energy into but that's just my opinion.

327
00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But as far as the connection between each other. That's why we're here. We want that. We want that, like, hold that space for me for a moment. Just see me.

328
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't get it to either. You didn't have a dad that could do it. He was half present and then because of psychiatric illness again was another half present

329
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.490
Ateeq Dean: You know, I missed out on that.

330
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:25.530
Ateeq Dean: I know

331
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Critique it's going to be hard for you to give that to care because she didn't have the modeling.

332
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm being very explicit about describing the tone of voice, giving you an example of that tone that you use with your, with your little girl, you can actually

333
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:43.710
Ateeq Dean: Use

334
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of it with her with your wife. Okay, you can use that. So same thing. It's, you don't want to be condescending.

335
00:42:54.330 --> 00:43:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll, you'll find your balance, you know, and you can say that seems phony. I mean, I want to show tenderness in my tone of voice.

336
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try one. My next client isn't here yet. Let's just see if we can do one. See if you can get the COO pitch doesn't have to be quite quite as much. But, see if you can say

337
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, babe. I do love you something in there. Just, just let her know

338
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:24.180
Ateeq Dean: I do love you.

339
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's find out what did you think care such a

340
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: dork. But, but was it didn't draw you in even a little bit more than the monotone

341
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And we made a joke. We were saying it might be over the top, as we're rehearsing but I kind of liked it. In the first part of it. I thought it actually sounded really good like the first part.

342
00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then it got kind of silly, but the first part, I was, I was kind of like, oh, that sounds good.

343
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Would that be like a team to to remember that the same kind of

344
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Voice that you use with your baby. You could actually use to let let her know hey I do love you and I'm here and everything's gonna be okay.

345
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: To offer that reassurance, even at first, it feels a little artificial

346
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys, create the space to, hey, she can say

347
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That, that seems a little over the top.

348
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.400
Ateeq Dean: Can you hear

349
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Yes.

350
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.410
Ateeq Dean: I'll work on it. I see that I've been like this, but I didn't do something I didn't know

351
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've known I've known that for a while and taken didn't really know kind of where I was going to enter the conversation. So it just happened organically and here

352
00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.410
I'm usually

353
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:12.480
Ateeq Dean: It's hard for me when I say it's hard for me to open up I've opened up to you because you've heard my voice. I don't do that with people. I don't know. I'm using monotone, he doesn't do anybody. No, I don't.

354
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.610
Ateeq Dean: But she's seen

355
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.280
My home.

356
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think you are going to benefit from the connection to it take, it's not just for the people that are listening, even in our voice when we open up that that space for

357
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For the different tone. I think you're going to feel connection to might be a little distancing thing that you're doing through the way you speak, you're sending the message I

358
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't really care. So therefore, watch. I'm not going to get hurt by you either if I don't show you I care. Why then, you can't hurt me either. I won't be let down. I don't have any expectation for even this conversation.

359
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is this is that sort of unconscious stuff I'm no in no way am I saying you're doing this on purpose, but it has a purpose. You understand we humans we do things for a reason. Okay, so, um,

360
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears really bad this morning. Um, anyway. You guys are amazing.

361
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you want to meet again for whether it's individual or meeting together a

362
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.810
Ateeq Dean: Couple.

363
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

364
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.270
Ateeq Dean: See what we got here.

365
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'd be going into April.

366
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.410
Ateeq Dean: And April going is probably the last month I'll have my insurance.

367
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:51.900
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I am going to try to see what they do. I don't think I'll get it back because working and they're going to see all that

368
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.140
Ateeq Dean: It's for people who are working really

369
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.350
Ateeq Dean: Another question. I know you have to go

370
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not here. Yes.

371
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:08.580
Ateeq Dean: Good good on the agreement everything, but I was going to see before my insurance goes up. I was going to see if there's a way you guys can increase a little bit

372
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't go like that. This is what it would look like this is what it would look like that would be unethical. But the number of days.

373
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember we have people just now that had to leave the state and the very last second.

374
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Before they left the state the boxes are packed been leaning up against the wall.

375
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been able to meet with them and then they get a 30 day prescription. Now, that gives you time to go find a medical provider that is something that you can afford.

376
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes me sad that that might be the case.

377
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.420
Ateeq Dean: I know I feel so bad to that like made me really sad.

378
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so you're sure that the insurance that your company is offering

379
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.340
Ateeq Dean: Assurances terrible, she added, because we used to work together.

380
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.150
Okay.

381
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:10.620
Ateeq Dean: I had, I was paying $150 a month and I had crazy high, it was when I was pregnant. I had crazy high co pays. And it was just

382
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.150
Ateeq Dean: It's horrible. It's really it doesn't

383
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, almost like half not having 100 basically okay okay um

384
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:37.080
Ateeq Dean: I like I like the insurance. I kind of want to see how much it would be to see if I can get maybe an independent insurance and see how much that would be just

385
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What and so you've been in here a little while I'm guessing. Don't just let us go. Consider like variations of it like a modification, like maybe once a month, you might meet for a group, maybe once a month, you might meet for individual therapy or whether you want to do the couples work.

386
00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And

387
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.200
Ateeq Dean: That

388
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, I'm not the only one, making that decision.

389
00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Your physician also would participate in that discussion, but first magical, find out what the product actually looks like. What this insurance. What it at what the payments might be. Maybe there's another package, they have

390
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That you might like better, make sure you connect with the folks that at virtual clinic. They care navigators because maybe

391
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an insurance that they accept or products are like there's a little very in some things. This is not my expertise to go to some kind of special training for that. And I don't know what it is.

392
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But, um, I think you're doing some good work. Because when you first started tapering was just like, this is not going to happen.

393
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're you're doing it, you're, you're facing the scary stuff and

394
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think I thought I would like you to stay if you can possibly pull

395
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.030
Ateeq Dean: It off.

396
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To so so you get some information. I'll put something

397
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't make it just made me think that we may not want until April.

398
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Since you're not going to have a lot of service time left.

399
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:21.060
Ateeq Dean: They gave me a date, April 20 is the cutoff time. Okay.

400
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Okay, so then it's not going to be the first. So let's go to go to a Wednesday and let's see if we can do this same timing.

401
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing I don't think I do. So we want to do 10am yeah okay

402
00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:39.840
Ateeq Dean: What date was it again.

403
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, APRIL, APRIL 1

404
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.000
Ateeq Dean: April 1. Yeah. Okay. Well, great.

405
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Know. Is there any medication bridge to today, show me messaging, the doctor and they are you good

406
00:50:51.870 --> 00:51:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, fantastic. Alright. So the takeaway right watch her face watch each other's face because we're both a part of that right and

407
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I'm trying to get a message across. And they look defensive, they look angry. They look irritated for them, something went sideways. Let me try again. And I take you have a chance to check tone.

408
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, you can go ya know what, go up. Notice I just went up, you know, a bit

409
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a little distracted. Just now I was half listening to you. I want to turn my full attention to tell me again, what's going on here, my time. Do you see what I'm doing.

410
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm saying, and I'm owning I was distracted.

411
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:41.520
Okay, and give full attention. See if it feels different. Okay.

412
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I will see you guys in for first, if not the to communicate with me, send me texts and emails about anything around the financial peace, feel free to stay connected with me around that. Right.

413
00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:54.990
Ateeq Dean: Have a good day. Good.

414
00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see you later.
