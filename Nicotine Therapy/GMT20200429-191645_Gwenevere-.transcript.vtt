11
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Or nothing whatever you want.

12
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me open up a note for us. Well, why don't we start light and fluffy and kind of tell me what's it like to work for Domino's these days.

13
00:01:45.390 --> 00:02:00.810
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, like it. Sometimes it can be kind of stressful. Like, especially for like short staffed by, like, if it's like super, super busy, but I mean, it's all really simple stuff. So it's not hard to stay focused, you know,

14
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.730
Melissa Harrison: For that I was a medical records director at a nursing home.

15
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.070
Melissa Harrison: So it started out as the receptionist and then the position became open, so I just

16
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:24.660
Melissa Harrison: Said Screw it. I'm going to go for it. So I got promoted to that and I stayed there for like almost a year, but it was just super, super stressful and all the regulations and everything. So I was like, no, I need a break from

17
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you took a break.

18
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's clarify break

19
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you give two weeks notice and

20
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.350
Melissa Harrison: I know, yeah, they love me.

21
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just checking.

22
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.420
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, you're good. Okay.

23
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what we got.

24
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and the money that you earn does it go. I think you live with your sister.

25
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.840
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, yeah. She just recently moved in within the last month. Okay.

26
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And

27
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a two bedroom. What, what kind of environment is up.

28
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To

29
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.350
Yeah.

30
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did that come about this. Your sister is moving in with him.

31
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:27.840
Melissa Harrison: Happened because when coronavirus sort of being extreme domino started cutting hours. So I went from being full time to being part time so I needed her collaboration to come in just to like help with bells, a little bit.

32
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what about on her. And that's what you needed, but what it should. What was her reasons for wanting to move in.

33
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.890
Melissa Harrison: Before that I see if you remember from our previous things like she has issues with drugs.

34
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.640
Man.

35
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:53.190
Melissa Harrison: And so yes, exactly. And so she um she got better, like a couple of years ago I was in Texas, at the time, and she

36
00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:10.920
Melissa Harrison: got put on probation. And last year, she got a probation violation and she did six months in jail. And then she did six months in a rehab. So when she came back living with my dad and she's 27 about to be 28 she really wasn't liking that. And so

37
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.310
Melissa Harrison: For her benefit because she got out of my dad's house.

38
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's your dad like tell me about even for 27 year old. What did you imagine what's going on over there.

39
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.750
Melissa Harrison: Um, well, I mean very strict in his ways and super religious um he doesn't really like the whole drug thing.

40
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:39.030
Melissa Harrison: So he was always really hard on her. It was hard for him to like trust her. So he was always like triple checking on her. And I'm sure that made her pretty frustrated because she is 27 years old.

41
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.750
Melissa Harrison: But like, at the same time. Like, I mean, it comes with being around

42
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.730
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, my dad have a pretty good relationship. He definitely isn't you know he's not proud of what happened to me.

43
00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:03.900
Melissa Harrison: But he seems pretty proud of my I'm taking it so far, usually call him after my group meetings and I call him if I talk to my probation officer, pretty much. She's with me like STEP AND STEP through everything.

44
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And for you.

45
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Was his religious bent as intense when you were a teenager.

46
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.770
Melissa Harrison: And little by little progress.

47
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.720
Melissa Harrison: Because he started out as a like alcohol and drug either, but he got clean and sober and he started out with Christianity.

48
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:41.070
Melissa Harrison: And where I came back from Texas, like two years ago, and pretty much since then he's been more on the like Judaism side. OK, so the Sabbath, and he celebrate Hanukkah and like

49
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.530
Melissa Harrison: Shabbat Shalom and stuff like that. I don't know you.

50
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get out mitzvah and you're just gonna throw out yet. I should just gonna throw a few words.

51
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.050
Melissa Harrison: But

52
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.480
Melissa Harrison: Sometimes I do not understand.

53
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. Well, you got to ask him what the word schmuck means if that puts a smile on his face.

54
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.910
Melissa Harrison: What is it

55
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: MCC

56
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: MCC schmuck

57
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do it. I'm kidding. Don't do it.

58
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it means penis.

59
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.260
Oh,

60
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

61
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I should have looked it up before I was using it all the time. I go, what a schmuck kind of germ.

62
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.070
Melissa Harrison: Probably heard that before. And I've never really known exactly the meaning

63
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.240
Yeah.

64
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It stopped. As soon as I found out what it was. I was like, oh no, that that is in so many settings, not the right choice of words.

65
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so don't repeat that after this session.

66
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.790
Melissa Harrison: No, ma'am.

67
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got a little sense of that. And so how long has. Have you been living with your sister.

68
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.010
Melissa Harrison: It's been about a month.

69
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your name,

70
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Mariah. Oh, I can remember Mariah. Why no why

71
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.900
Melissa Harrison: Why

72
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a little dog down the street called Mariah.

73
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is so sweet, sweet dog that dog. She's just like to

74
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish Danielle hyper about it, jump all over me.

75
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so Mariah chill and so she's 27 and

76
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And just did you grow up with her where she

77
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:42.660
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, yeah. Um, and her grew up together when she turned 18 she went she moved all the house and

78
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:51.810
Melissa Harrison: He would like kind of Mia for like a year and then she went to Texas for a couple years, came back. I'm pretty much anytime that she was like really really using

79
00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:02.820
Melissa Harrison: And she didn't really want the family to know we didn't really hear from her like she was at the point where she didn't even want to have. She didn't care about having a cell phone. She didn't care about having a car drivers license any of that because

80
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:13.050
Melissa Harrison: You know, it would make her liable for it. And so she just kind of took the easy route and like, so I didn't really hear from her for like a good five years, but I was already kind of older than

81
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:28.440
Melissa Harrison: But since I've been back from Texas, we've been pretty in sync. I would call her like every couple of days while she was in jail every month, I would go and visit her and rehab. So, I mean, we're pretty close because my mom wasn't around he kind of spun up raise me a little bit.

82
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Oh, praise and when you notice how she talks to you how she interacts with you. Can you tell that she's in a recovery mindset.

83
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.890
Melissa Harrison: You know, sometime

84
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me, tell me about that when you notice. Hmm, maybe this isn't so

85
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.120
Melissa Harrison: Well,

86
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.720
Melissa Harrison: I don't know if you go over different moods.

87
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:14.880
Melissa Harrison: And she's very, very much right now in the point of her life where no matter if she's using or not she like trying to show that she is doesn't need my dad's help anymore.

88
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.180
Melissa Harrison: She's really proud about stuff.

89
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:19.830
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

90
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about trying to show. Tell me about the trying to show what does that if I was watching what would she be saying or doing were like, is she trying too hard.

91
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.440
Melissa Harrison: Um, well.

92
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.680
Melissa Harrison: Well, one circumstance is usually it's me that finds her stuff.

93
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:56.970
Melissa Harrison: I'm usually not even looking for it. I just usually end up like stumbling upon it, and I'm like, where I like what is going on here. And I could tell the first time because I already had suspicions, just because she she tends to be more

94
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:06.930
Melissa Harrison: On Mia when she's doing stuff, you know, I mean, I live with her and like I'll notice because she was like, welcome home where like, she'll be gone for a couple days and I'm like really

95
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:15.150
Melissa Harrison: And I found a piece with some with like a baggie with some method, it just the other week actually.

96
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.520
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, and

97
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.620
Melissa Harrison: Like I wasn't sure how to react to it. Like, I went up there and I was like, why, like, what is going on here.

98
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:39.300
Melissa Harrison: And she pretty much was like I've done it like three times since I've been out and I'm doing good. Like I just got stressed out a little bit and like I could tell from looking at it like looking at the piece that it definitely had not only been used three times, you know,

99
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.030
Melissa Harrison: It was like it was getting ready to, like, change color. You know how pieces do I don't know actually, if you know

100
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

101
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:45.960
I

102
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I do.

103
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:56.100
Melissa Harrison: Because I smoke weed like you'll get a piece, it will be clear. The more you smoke it rather than will change the color to like a pretty purple or something.

104
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:06.900
Melissa Harrison: And I didn't know that my thesis, did the same thing until I saw her. Is what the change color on it. Honestly, but it went from being clear when I have like when I like

105
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:18.960
Melissa Harrison: First had suspicions and then like last week or the week before that it was like a lavender color. And that was just like, it was like, are you kidding. And so like she doesn't spend a lot of time here recently.

106
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:25.320
Melissa Harrison: Like me and my daughter time in the hopper, how we can, but mainly how you can tell is that she's

107
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.750
Melissa Harrison: Am I not. Yeah.

108
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like what she did what she was right going off to Texas. She just just disappear. She is GHOST Everybody, and she okay

109
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do some some real time stuff here. What was that like to tell me and real time really what's going on with Mariah.

110
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:52.710
Melissa Harrison: It's hard, you know, I mean, like I said, this is what you're here for. So like in my head, I have to keep telling myself like it's okay like just talk about it.

111
00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:06.000
Melissa Harrison: But it's kind of hard. Just because like I care about her so much, and she's my sister and like, yeah, like we're both struggling right now, but I feel like my struggles are nothing compared to what she's going through right now and I just

112
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:20.040
Melissa Harrison: I hope that she you know doesn't mess up again because I mean so sick if she does like if she doesn't get clean, like she could like actually go to like president or something and I don't want that for her.

113
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:21.570
Okay.

114
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's come back to you for a minute. We talked about Mariah for a little while and then you shared kind of this conflictual thing. I know you know, talking with therapist is the right thing to do, but it's same time

115
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want her to get a trial of, well, it's confidential and I'm not gonna let she's gonna kill someone or abusing a child or elderly, I'm not gonna not gonna do anything.

116
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.150
Melissa Harrison: We're then

117
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not calling the Popo like over here, you know, well you gotta swing by that house. Tell you what gets you some

118
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Fans up. So, but let's talk about how I know you're feeling for her. What might happen to her.

119
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're my client. Yeah. And I'm worried about you.

120
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And obviously, in a family system. I care about everyone because it impacts you so just staying with how you feel. Are you already told me

121
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You went over under her side and you read about her worried about her worried about her. In fact, and you notice I'm not going to benefit from having my sister around

122
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.210
Melissa Harrison: You know the

123
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Then there's you, how am I going to feel I'm going to miss her. She was kind of like a mom to me and you really like this kind of best friend.

124
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.340
Melissa Harrison: No, yeah, it's stressful. Um, I remember after I found the stock.

125
00:13:54.510 --> 00:14:04.530
Melissa Harrison: She actually wasn't home when I found it so like I had a period of time in between her doing like we finally have in her coming home.

126
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:12.810
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, and so I called one of my friends, um, he's, he's like, not one of my closest friends, but he knows her really well.

127
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:24.330
Melissa Harrison: And he's probably the biggest advocate when it comes to not doing drugs and not drinking and stuff like that. So he's kind of my go to ensure no because I have a different mindset than other people will

128
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:35.070
Melissa Harrison: And I bawled my eyes out to him on the phone afterwards and I just didn't know what to do and what I kept telling him was, I'm tired of feeling like I need to be the older sister.

129
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.680
Melissa Harrison: Because it's stressful because I want to be there for her. I want to hop here about the same time I'm only 21 years old, I can't tell her what to do.

130
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:59.610
Melissa Harrison: You know she's gonna look at me and be like, we are equals here we share this House, you're not going to control me you know type of a thing. So it makes it hard to know like what do I even do I just wrap my head all the time, but

131
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.280
Melissa Harrison: My dad's a lot of help for that too.

132
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's some good advice sage advice that you get from your friend and from your dad.

133
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:19.650
Melissa Harrison: Pretty much all a Tommy is that the more pressure we put on her, the more she's gonna feel like she gonna slip up because she's gonna be all stressed out.

134
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:29.310
Melissa Harrison: And so they pretty much told me that I just need to be there for her. I try to spend as much time with her. I can try to get her and activities that like

135
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:37.650
Melissa Harrison: She can't just sneak away and go do something or I mean I don't really see her doing that, like sneaking away to do drag from me but like

136
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:50.760
Melissa Harrison: Just in general like trying to keep her busy and keep her focus on things other than that because like I know she has friends that will help her out to lunch with those friends I worry, I try to just like limit the

137
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.440
Melissa Harrison: The amount of time that she has to mess up, I guess.

138
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.670
Melissa Harrison: I don't know, it's been it's been robbed. Hmm, you know, and okay

139
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me just see if that's actually what dad and friend were saying

140
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.350
Melissa Harrison: Yeah.

141
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If anybody ever gets a text to you. It'll. It'll knock out your video or your audio.

142
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.550
Melissa Harrison: My probation officer just texted me and it

143
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.270
Melissa Harrison: was funny.

144
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

145
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:30.450
Melissa Harrison: We were supposed to meet yesterday and she was super busy so she wanted to reschedule. And she was asking if we could check in, but I'm going to tell her. I'll be available in like a like.

146
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.120
Melissa Harrison: I like to 30 yeah

147
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

148
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just want to check and see if this was an interpretation or this was actual advice from dead or I'm going to put down friend together. So I'm just going to

149
00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of dad advice was the advice you need to keep Mariah busy. You need to keep her. So she didn't have any time for self shouldn't get yourself in trouble.

150
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:18.990
Melissa Harrison: I mean not exact wording. Now, he said, like do the best year ability, like my dad, especially he's getting to the point where he's frustrated and he doesn't know what to do. So you know that you can

151
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.820
Melissa Harrison: Help her

152
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:28.500
Melissa Harrison: Because she's like she's no longer in my house. I can't do anything like she'll even like respond to his call. She's completely ghosting have at this point.

153
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Does your dad now and now I'm being specific about him and not friend does your dad know what I now know that you are tired of being a parent.

154
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Tomorrow,

155
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She knows that.

156
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Has it ever gotten

157
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Really bad where you were managing her emotional well being at the sacrifice of your own.

158
00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.850
Melissa Harrison: Um,

159
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:09.360
Melissa Harrison: I mean, I guess, in a in an extreme situation. Yes, before she went to like not recently, but before she went to jail. This last time.

160
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:20.010
Melissa Harrison: Me and her were both living at my dad's because that was about two years ago and I had just moved back to Texas. So until I found my place. I was staying at my dad's

161
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:29.550
Melissa Harrison: And me and her shared a room and I would wake up to like use the bathroom or something, she would have a candle on and organize up

162
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:43.380
Melissa Harrison: And I'd be really confusing for like Mariah like what are you doing, why don't you go to bed like all this stuff and I later found out that she was lighting a candle so that my dad or me wouldn't be able to hear her lighting the lighter every time she went to her pipe.

163
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.380
Melissa Harrison: And we lived in like we shared a bedroom. We were sleeping on bunk beds.

164
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:59.550
Melissa Harrison: Hop on so I was like this is not cool. And I remember getting ready for work. One morning, and she pulled it out to do it and I legit just started bawling my eyes out to her.

165
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:07.770
Melissa Harrison: And I was just so upset. I was like, why I'm sitting here getting ready for work and you're just laying there thinking that this is okay.

166
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.460
Melissa Harrison: Like this is not okay, it's like not only, like, is it not okay for you, but like you're disrespecting Dad's house you're disrespecting me

167
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:23.640
Melissa Harrison: I was like, you know, I don't want that around me, and she wasn't listening to me. And so after a couple more time. That's when I finally

168
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:32.700
Melissa Harrison: I texted my dad as, like, Dad, I'm sitting here again, getting ready for work and this is going on. And so he left work.

169
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:42.390
Melissa Harrison: Waited around the corner. When I left a bit of work he pulled in walked in the door like as if I forgotten something walked in and Carter. Yeah. And that is what sent her back.

170
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:55.860
Melissa Harrison: And so like it's been traumatic experience between me and her just trying to figure out how we're supposed to co exist when we know each other so well and want to help each other, you know,

171
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that was an example of when you sacrifice to your own emotional well being. For hers, but it also you shared there was a limit you reached the limit, and then you fold in

172
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The rules, the guy that has rules and it worked. I think he showed up and it sounds like he got her the police involved.

173
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:33.030
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, no. Yeah, he's really adamant about that. He's very much about the lie, he didn't like drugs he does really good with that. I remember

174
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:40.350
Melissa Harrison: Gosh, junior year. I think I got suspended for being a high at school. I didn't have anything on me, but I'm

175
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:46.380
Melissa Harrison: That I had to sit there and wait for my dad to show up in the office to come get me. And it was after school time

176
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:58.830
Melissa Harrison: And I know you've been sitting there for like an hour and he came in and you really went through everything in my backpack for them to try to find something on me because he wanted me to get expelled like he's very much about that, you know,

177
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:06.030
Melissa Harrison: You pretty intense. He has no problem like calling the cops are doing what needs to be done.

178
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

179
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

180
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, and that's interesting. So I'm just trying to taking it in trying to get, get the landscape of what your life is like.

181
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

182
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice now.

183
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How you're starting to get tired.

184
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And for you kind of do it two or three times where she was smoking, but it was right in your presence and then you call dad and then accountability was in the picture.

185
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how tired, you'll have to get

186
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Before she's held accountable.

187
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.560
Melissa Harrison: You know, that is that is that is the question right there.

188
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.140
Melissa Harrison: Something is this is all about.

189
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that why you're crying with your friend and

190
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:29.640
Melissa Harrison: No, yeah, I mean, and it's because I mean it wasn't that long ago that I found it and every single time I looked at her. I told her I was like I wasn't even trying to find it on you.

191
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:36.570
Melissa Harrison: Like I wasn't even looking for anything when I was going to like grab something else I was going to the bathroom and boom.

192
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

193
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:52.590
Melissa Harrison: Was like, and if you're slipping up with me what to do out there. I was like, are you going to slip up are you going to get in trouble. Like what are you thinking because you're slipping up the music and comfortable and you shouldn't be getting comfortable

194
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go back to you again.

195
00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:58.560
Yeah.

196
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:13.170
Melissa Harrison: It's just, no, I don't know, I feel conflicted every single time I get confronted with the situation because I don't really know a whole lot about like

197
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:32.610
Melissa Harrison: All how like all the seriousness, like I know like she needs to not be doing drugs, but I don't know exactly what happens to her. She gets caught and like all this different stuff. And so it makes me feel like I'm in this situation either I'd be the homie. I'd be like the parents are

198
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.300
Melissa Harrison: Either like

199
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.370
Melissa Harrison: A stranger that calls the cops, you know,

200
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:48.750
Melissa Harrison: Just like I have all these roles going through my head and I'm not sure what to take and it usually takes me a while to even do anything about it because I just, it's, it's a lot of comprehensive, a lot of

201
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:55.350
Melissa Harrison: Not power, but it's a lot that I have to like decide on my own kind.

202
00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you didn't ask for that now.

203
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to tell me what emotion you feel in that conflict, all that burden that unasked for burden that is placed on your shoulders. What's the emotion that you feel

204
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.710
Melissa Harrison: Disappointed.

205
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:29.160
Melissa Harrison: It's stressful but I feel like more than anything. Like I feel like my heart literally sink everytime I have to deal with it because it's like

206
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.860
Melissa Harrison: No, yeah, disappointed. I mean, it's like, I want to be there for her but this just keeps happening.

207
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.750
Melissa Harrison: And it is it's it's tiring that feeling of upsetting.

208
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you noticing when you have that disappointment and sad that you end up thinking about wanting to escape into weed or something so

209
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:08.070
Melissa Harrison: You know, at first I thought it was going to do something like that. But most of the time. Once I'm really thinking about it, like it gets me where I want to cry.

210
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.470
Melissa Harrison: Hmm, and that exact moment. I don't want to do anything.

211
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet when I

212
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.450
Melissa Harrison: See what's going on with her and it makes me feel like

213
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.400
Melissa Harrison: Like

214
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.570
Melissa Harrison: I can't really get on her about something, if I'm doing the same thing, just on a much smaller level, you know, if

215
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:40.020
Melissa Harrison: I need to be sober. So I can deal with all of this and I can help her, because if I'm sitting there all high when I tell her not to get high on something else, then how she supposed to take me seriously.

216
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so inadvertently. It sounds less homey.

217
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And more like a parent take care of the situation that just now went

218
00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Over to handle sister there. You just moved into sort of a really responsible mindset. You don't want to be a hypocrite. You don't want to be called out on your Burt use when you're trying to call someone else on it that kind of right in that space.

219
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:23.100
Melissa Harrison: And I keep one wanting to like I give trying to talk to her about like, it's like, yeah, like I'm in this program now like I'm focusing on me getting clean from drinking

220
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:33.030
Melissa Harrison: And like, that's a big thing for me. Just because you know all of my friends drink hard for me to go to a social gathering without dealing with like

221
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:42.390
Melissa Harrison: Awesome. And so, I mean, I stand for her, that it's hard to and I keep bringing after her. It's like, why don't we do this together. You know, why don't we both say we're going to go sober.

222
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:52.950
Melissa Harrison: How it goes and she's not really at this place in her mind right now, I think, to go for that, but I'm hoping that that will change.

223
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go a little deeper.

224
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.110
Okay.

225
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If you didn't go to the parent role of disappointed. I'm disappointed and I'm sad that you're you know that one.

226
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What about just sister.

227
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that this burden is on your shoulders. Now what emotion. Do you feel

228
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.050
Melissa Harrison: Sad.

229
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:26.850
Melissa Harrison: The sad.

230
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:41.760
Melissa Harrison: I mean, it sucks being the sister going and visiting her and rehab every month, you know, getting this year, while she was in jail for those six months, putting money on her bugs. It took a lot. And so to go through all of that.

231
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:48.690
Melissa Harrison: And then to see her out here, not in the same extent but still doing what she was doing before.

232
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:56.100
Melissa Harrison: It's just, it's it's upsetting because it's like, well, what is it going to take them because like I just want her to be better.

233
00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.250
Melissa Harrison: And I just see that she's not better.

234
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: When your dad showed up that last time.

235
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the emotion. He had

236
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.340
Melissa Harrison: Um, I don't know. I already driven away.

237
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You drop my. That's right.

238
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.270
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, I didn't want to be involved in that exact

239
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:23.220
Melissa Harrison: Situation. I was like, that is between y'all because I had to get to work. And I just, I couldn't deal with them.

240
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And later on.

241
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Which by the way you ended up choosing a role when you did that, didn't you

242
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we call that one where Hey Dad, you work this out. This is your daughter. What do we call that, what role are you in when you're like dad handle your own kid.

243
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Sister okay I got, I got a frickin job to go to. It's not my kid this right

244
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What

245
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:07.020
Melissa Harrison: One that has the real authority over her right now. Like what's gonna happen. It's like she she feels comfortable enough to pull out in front of me, knowing that I don't like it.

246
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, what's that feeling.

247
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that one.

248
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.080
Melissa Harrison: That one is honestly just

249
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.790
Melissa Harrison: It makes me a little mad. Sometimes, honestly.

250
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.130
Melissa Harrison: Because, I mean,

251
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:33.540
Melissa Harrison: Like I don't do, man. What if I was to do, man. I wouldn't do it around like let's say my little brother or something, you know,

252
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.070
Okay.

253
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's selfish.

254
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.520
Melissa Harrison: That that's a very good word.

255
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Insensitive of you because it puts you in danger.

256
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.790
Melissa Harrison: No. Yeah.

257
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not movie.

258
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.000
Melissa Harrison: It's been

259
00:29:54.210 --> 00:30:01.110
Melissa Harrison: It's been a little tense lately. Just because and I told her, when she moved in. I was like, I don't want none of this coming in my house.

260
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:14.790
Melissa Harrison: I was like, yeah, you want to, you want to take a chance with your probation and stuff. I was like, but I'm on probation to now. Like, it's not just you, that can get in trouble was like, if it's in the house. We both live in the house.

261
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:20.010
Melissa Harrison: I was like, I don't know how all that works, but I'm sure they could pin something on me if they really wanted to

262
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:27.510
Melissa Harrison: Like I'm not getting in trouble for a drug. I've never done. It's like if I have an issue with something. Yeah, I'll take the charge

263
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:39.420
Melissa Harrison: Like, but this isn't my issue is, like, so I don't want it in the house is like, I don't want my cat sniffing whatever smoke you blow out of it, you know, something like that. And so the fact that I have on a piece on here.

264
00:30:41.310 --> 00:31:00.270
Melissa Harrison: Really really upsets me, you know, just because like I like I have my database. I was like, I don't know what steps to take. Next, like, I don't know what the game plan is here because obviously she took everything that I said, and just kind of toss it out the window and

265
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.620
Melissa Harrison: Do herself. You know, so selfish really is a good word.

266
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I guess I am a little surprised. Did you minimize a little bit with that.

267
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.010
Melissa Harrison: Um, you know, at first I would just say like I'm super worried

268
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:19.980
Melissa Harrison: Yeah.

269
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:27.030
Melissa Harrison: And me and him. Well, me and her went over to his house, just a couple days later.

270
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:32.760
Melissa Harrison: To have our. We do family dinner every week she usually doesn't go I usually try to go though because my little brother.

271
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.050
But

272
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:46.680
Melissa Harrison: And he he could just tell by looking at her. I mean, she's lost weight. You can, you can always see it in her cheekbones, because those shrinking immediately and

273
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.140
Melissa Harrison: So he called her out on it.

274
00:31:50.250 --> 00:32:01.440
Melissa Harrison: In front of me and was just like, right, like, what is going on like me and your sister worried and we're all pretty open about like the issue and roll confrontational about it and I was like, Dad.

275
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:12.720
Melissa Harrison: Because you tried to sit there and say that she didn't have like a problem that she wasn't doing anything. And I was like, dad was like she knows what I'm about to say like, but I found this to, like, yeah, we are dealing with an issue here.

276
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does it look like when you said, I found a rock.

277
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.890
Melissa Harrison: He honestly looked like he was gonna cry like he was that upset.

278
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:32.730
Melissa Harrison: Cuz i mean it's it's weird to see her like this. Because growing up were both homeschooled because of my dad's second wife.

279
00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:53.340
Melissa Harrison: And so while she was in our life were homeschooled. Right. I love being homeschooled. She did it before her. She did it after her. She did it for her entire like middle school and high school like career, whatever. And I went in from third grade until seventh grade, and so like

280
00:32:54.990 --> 00:33:11.820
Melissa Harrison: She we did all the different activities. She did Scott was country dancing the bay choir piano, guitar. She had all these different talents. I mean, she went to Kansas City for nationals for speech and debate and she's a very talented.

281
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:18.840
Melissa Harrison: young male. I always looked up to her so much. So to see her go from that super high

282
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:30.690
Melissa Harrison: To be in over here and not doing as well as she was, you know, since she started doing drugs, it's just, it's been a whole different experience because I'm used to the old Mariah.

283
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:37.770
Melissa Harrison: Because a lot of this happened, and she was gone. And then I was in Texas, and then I came back and then we were together a little bit. And then she was in jail.

284
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:47.820
Melissa Harrison: So it's just, it's been a roller coaster because it's just you look at her and you see like Mariah Mariah. And then they gotta realize like, there's more issues here now.

285
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:49.620
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

286
00:33:50.130 --> 00:34:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now. You did it just naturally you can see Mariah. And then you went, then you can see the issue. So this is a place I want to, I want to talk about for a second.

287
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about

288
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This may not be of use to you, but it certainly helps me and a lot of people so Ryan's on one side and the addict and that's the term.

289
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to be

290
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have to draw. I'm just giving you a visual to say that if you conceptualize

291
00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sister isn't living with you.

292
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have a sister living with them, just hold that thought for a second.

293
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.550
Melissa Harrison: Now, yeah.

294
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What you have is

295
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A narcissistic. Selfish. Indulgent inconsiderate.

296
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: At it. The only cares about lying so that she can get to her next. Hi, and I know no one likes to hear that. But I think that's because you're thinking of her

297
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: As your sister. And who wants to have a sister like that sisters out there. Your sister is making choices.

298
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That are about making sure she gets she gets that next euphoria and she will do, meaning the attic will do anything because the addict doesn't have a moral compass the attic only cares about manipulating whatever environment is around that might get in her way of getting what she wants.

299
00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sister, however, doesn't do that.

300
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sister is kind and funny and intelligent and talented.

301
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you remember the first question I asked about your sister. Do you remember what that was.

302
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Which when you first came in and we just brought it up. I said, they'll sound familiar. Once I say it.

303
00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you recognize when your sister is in. Do you remember I started with that. And that's because I have this understanding

304
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And we will our way into it and then sure enough. Now here comes some details. Things are not so rosy.

305
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.050
Melissa Harrison: No. Yeah.

306
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: More than tension.

307
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not just

308
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That we're so tight.

309
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's more than that really

310
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a big burden placed on your shoulder, and you didn't ask for this and and it took you a long time to get too mad.

311
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Sister, the same one that was like

312
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an addict to my bunk bed. This is a frickin junkie and my bunk bed for crying out loud. What is that

313
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, get the junk out of this bed.

314
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No, yeah, your sister wasn't there.

315
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's happening again. And I know I'm gonna be here with you.

316
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

317
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: really inconvenient.

318
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But only because you're over on first side imagining what it would be like to be

319
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Incarcerated imagine what it would be like to be in a rehab and you feel for her.

320
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel for your sister.

321
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your sister's voice right now you're going to hear it. You'll see this in group a lot to you'll see my hands going like this, me, me, me, me, me.

322
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll be like, this is the addict. Hey screw screw screw Melissa. We don't need her anyway. We just need

323
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, where did she put that rock, by the way. Remember, she mentioned, she found it. Do you know where it is, where do you think she put it, she think she classical god Oh, she didn't flush it

324
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Seriously, like that's what the scheming little

325
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.600
Melissa Harrison: About investment. I mean,

326
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:54.330
Melissa Harrison: Drag on

327
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.330
Melissa Harrison: So her question was, well, did you flush it

328
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:14.310
Melissa Harrison: Wasn't anything besides that she tried to be like, Well, are you sure it's math in the bag. And I was like, yes, I'm sure I know what that looks like. And she was like, Well, did you flush it and I was like Yammer I flush it right away. So no, I mean, yeah.

329
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wasn't even there.

330
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because the perspective is only about. Did she just say she's just say my first iraq war in Iraq, your sisters voice down here that says

331
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, look at my dad's face.

332
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at my sister. Look at her.

333
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and then goes like this and gets mad at the addict inside this is our inner voice right this is going on. So just imagine I'm your sister that's going on that dialogue is going on. But here's the problem.

334
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sisters voice is so low.

335
00:38:53.220 --> 00:39:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is dominant. And it's not just my hands. It's not just a metaphor. This is actually when we take the silliness. And we take words away from it. What's happening is chemical

336
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think any of your let's say crime if you're like, Well, I'm going to kill myself. If you don't stop. God forbid. But my point is hoping to leverage that this attic is going to give a shit.

337
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.760
Melissa Harrison: Word.

338
00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.930
Man.

339
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That addict isn't what's looking at the, the, your sister isn't the one viewing the world right now. What's happening is it's just chemical it's just

340
00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling that comes from that substance that doesn't mean that she gets where we as humans get we get this much from

341
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Sunset that much from a good orgasm, we get this much for me. Yeah, from chocolate cake. Okay, so here's what mass does

342
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.430
Melissa Harrison: Really

343
00:39:54.090 --> 00:40:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That much joking. So what you do is you flood this brain of yours with this massive amount of it. And guess what the brains like

344
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, this is what we've been waiting for this is the only thing that matters. This is it.

345
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And when it's not there, the crippling depression that follows when she's not taking it.

346
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The potential for suicidal ideation. The absolutely feeling like doing nothing that emptiness that follows without this now the brain just wants this. I don't care about know sunset sure don't care about your feelings.

347
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.560
Melissa Harrison: No. Yeah.

348
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:42.600
Melissa Harrison: Yes, you know, I can tell, just like I can tell that definitely want to ride lapa because when she got out of rehab. Actually, they

349
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:50.370
Melissa Harrison: Were the ones that suggested her to get her medical card because they're hoping if she could smoke weed. She wouldn't go back to me.

350
00:40:51.510 --> 00:41:04.860
Melissa Harrison: And so she got her medical card and she got out a probation officer like said it was good to go. But I've noticed that like because she'll go out with her friend or whatever and all know what she was doing, you know, I'm not

351
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:11.490
Melissa Harrison: completely clueless all the time. But, um, and she'll come home.

352
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:21.990
Melissa Harrison: And I can tell that like she's still trying to ride the wave because she'll sit there and like yeah like I have my mid part like yes we does my favorite drug, but I'm over here like

353
00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:29.010
Melissa Harrison: I like, well, maybe smoke a bowl at night, but I don't sit there. I don't want to be high, every day, like all day long, you know,

354
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:37.440
Melissa Harrison: It's like I've got other stuff going on. It's like, I don't have time, like I'm doing this. I'm doing that and like with her. It's like she's trying to cram in smoking weed every time she gets

355
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.350
Melissa Harrison: To try to ride the high for as long as she can.

356
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:53.880
Melissa Harrison: And so I was like, Well, I don't know if that ended up being a negative thing or what because she's taking it from it. Just being the thing that helped her not be a stressful, or take off some of the cravings to where she's using it to aid her issues.

357
00:41:54.750 --> 00:42:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in a unique and will kind of have to kind of end with that. But, um,

358
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in an interesting position because on one hand you keep bouncing it back to your own norm, you keep sort of justifying certain behaviors, based on yourself. We all do it. Well, I'm the reference standard then well I'm

359
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: model citizen or maybe your dad is the reference standard. I don't know what it is, but these granting things are really funny. I just see them.

360
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I know.

361
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so convenient that my glasses are right here. Anyway, so, um,

362
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's tricky because you're having to look at your own behavior and it might be you're justifying her addictive behavior.

363
00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And made worse by even dad didn't call the Popo

364
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And now that's confusing.

365
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:01.890
Melissa Harrison: Yeah.

366
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:02.910
Yeah.

367
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So the pressure is back on you know you can't even call dad that heavy hand to come in and lay down the law.

368
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:11.580
You

369
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:21.810
Melissa Harrison: Know, you've gotten to the point where he is like he's pretty much done trying like he's done everything in his power. I mean, he's bought her two different cars.

370
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:39.060
Melissa Harrison: He helped with her commissary. I mean, he opened up his room by room in his house to her anytime she needed it. And like, it's just, he just keeps in his in his mind giving like quote unquote show on, you know, um,

371
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna get shit on

372
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to just imagine that you do get

373
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A VIP because of this and you're going to spend even if the end result is you get cleared. You're gonna lose your job, you'd be held in custody.

374
00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have this on your record, the stress of what if because it's a system I sit here and listen to you all the time that new system ain't ain't too good.

375
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying, I'm listening. I'm like, Dang. I'm glad I don't live over there.

376
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:15.900
Melissa Harrison: No. Yeah, it's definitely different than like in taxes and stuff.

377
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, so what if you get lost in that

378
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's only just

379
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean you're not taking maybe a moment and saying how maybe you might want to know what might happen maybe your PO. Maybe I need to have a conversation with that one, you

380
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Know me having one, like, Well, what happened in my accountable for who I live with. Am I not supposed to be around illegal substances.

381
00:44:50.400 --> 00:45:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Think that might be part of a stipulation. And what would happen if I am. How are you going to be at your sister. Wait a minute, how pissed. Are you going to be at the attic, who's living with you.

382
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that does not care about you going to jail. You understand that you're treating your sister.

383
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: With friendship, the attic is hustling, you

384
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.250
Melissa Harrison: Yeah.

385
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just say

386
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:27.180
Melissa Harrison: No. Yeah, no, that's a really good, really good food for thought thing to be rallying my head today.

387
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely not that, but

388
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.300
Melissa Harrison: No, it's okay, I need

389
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.970
Melissa Harrison: To happen, you know, but that's what this is here for

390
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't put yourself in the mix just just assume clean and sober you it's sister, it's authentic you because you've got a piece of this in there too. It's just you.

391
00:45:47.010 --> 00:46:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that can go. I know I need to get things done on that one. The one that knows I need to have a clear mind it messes with clarity, it messes with productivity messes with that, I want to have that clear sharp mind I want it working optimally. I need to have my head straight

392
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That one that part of the self that voice that you have inside of you. That's the one that needs to make the decision about your boundaries and and who you're actually living with

393
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.970
Melissa Harrison: No, yeah, you're right.

394
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:25.740
Melissa Harrison: Like keep letting my other thoughts get in the way and it's just like, like I cover so much that makes it hard. So, yeah.

395
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you are looking out for your sister.

396
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Your the addict isn't looking out for you.

397
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can get up and how you're going to feel when you're in jail, and she's out

398
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Out and you can't even reach her because she's M. I. A.

399
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That is some kind of altered universe. What is that story.

400
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:54.660
Melissa Harrison: Yeah.

401
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just saying.

402
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.930
Melissa Harrison: No thank you.

403
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.720
Melissa Harrison: I mean it's realistic is what it is.

404
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I had a little scared for you, right, I got scared, cuz I'm like

405
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

406
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Initial right next to that and won't associate with people engaging in illegal activities. I bet you put your initials like

407
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then went to the next one route and then went to the next one prayer.

408
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:21.390
Yeah.

409
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And

410
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So all right, let's schedule another appointment, do you kind of know

411
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Next week,

412
00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:37.560
Melissa Harrison: Um, I don't, because it kind of hits, but it shouldn't be any different than this week's okay

413
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go for it. I do need for the next 30 days. We're not going to overanalyze it we're going to meet every single week for individual therapy every single week for group.

414
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to get that down pat. Then we'll lift her heads up and go okay, how we doing

415
00:47:49.560 --> 00:48:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll figure out the next play but 30 days real tight every single week every single week. Okay, don't let anything with this. This is a doctor's appointment. There's going to be in fact because I've got to write a report every Thursday.

416
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

417
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:06.540
So good.

418
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Good no detail. So I just wish there was

419
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.080
Melissa Harrison: No. Yeah, I understand.

420
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.140
Melissa Harrison: Boring. So yeah, the way I think it says that

421
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I should include it say whether she was whether she attended this date that day group was this. She was compliant. It is my opinion and you'll probably hear it here in in there. If they do reads it can't tell. Yet such a new program.

422
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Has been whatever let me stay focused so

423
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I do think it would benefit you to explore sober network just see the horizon for people that they may not look as fun but don't judge them yet, check them out. You know, I mean, I'm

424
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because people, places and things. That's no joke that that does make a difference.

425
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.230
Yeah.

426
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's real significant consequence to you. So okay, so I'm looking right now at the week of May 4 through May 8

427
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it on Tuesday. Okay. Okay.

428
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just got on. That's it. So you weren't during the first part people eat pizza in the morning.

429
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:44.940
Melissa Harrison: That no yeah we'll get there at 10 o'clock in the morning and people will already be ready to order. And I'm sitting there like having just woken up like just finished my coffee. And I'm like, how do you want pizza already

430
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Was like

431
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: She

432
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And listen, what's the difference. She's it's bread. OK, OK, OK, I can work with it.

433
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um so yeah so 11 would be ideal. On Wednesday, but that's not going to work for you. She'll be at work. Let's see.

434
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how about

435
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Thursday, May 7 at. Wait a minute. Are you going to be home by 1210 you won't be home.

436
00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.400
I'm

437
00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:21.900
Melissa Harrison: Not

438
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me try something else. Let me try.

439
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So the problem if if we do May eight, which is a Friday, it leaves no other room, which means, you know, show your non compliant. So it's there. That's the problem with those Friday appointments, they kind of stopped. For that reason, because

440
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.230
Melissa Harrison: What time on Friday.

441
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be at 1:10pm

442
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.850
Melissa Harrison: I think I could do that.

443
00:50:53.220 --> 00:51:01.140
Melissa Harrison: For me, I usually only go into help with PrEP in the morning and then I'm usually set free because they pretty much important every single employee on Friday.

444
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd like right now if you looked in your phone, you could see your calendars. See if there's a conflict dental appointment and

445
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:18.420
Melissa Harrison: I the only the only stuff going on right now for me is the work and then y'all. And then along with always on Tuesday, she does, because it's on zoom to

446
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:25.290
Melissa Harrison: He does she sends me a text whenever he's ready to do it and we do it. It's not like I said being it's just on Tuesdays.

447
00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, one second. I'm just worried about that Friday.

448
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, can we change. Let's just do exactly what we did.

449
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: May six instead on a Wednesday at 110

450
00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.190
Melissa Harrison: Bricks at one time.

451
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:58.590
Melissa Harrison: Okay, no. Yeah, that's fine. And like, I mean, I rushed out of work today because they're a little first. So I stayed a little late, so I rushed out of how to get home in time to do the meeting. So like they know about everything going on. And they're, they're pretty flexible with it.

452
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to make it 115 just in case.

453
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:10.440
Melissa Harrison: That might be a nice idea. I think I plugged in today like 114 or something like that. I'm definitely a couple minutes late.

454
00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

455
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do. Here we go next appointment. Next, your next Braveheart health

456
00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Service is may 5 group.

457
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, well, and then we have the next day may 6 at 115 Mountain Standard Time. That'll be for our individual therapy.

458
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.150
Melissa Harrison: All right, I've got it.

459
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And

460
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah see, see how you do around thinking about sort of pulling apart those set those those pieces like

461
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There's addiction mindset. There's sort of active addiction and then there's

462
00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Recovery mindset, you know, as my sister, even there, just when you're starting to think about how to because you've got some tough decisions are you for sure.

463
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And that might help kind of tease apart what the next play might be for you, but I would want to know I would want to be fine. Now, am I

464
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.320
Melissa Harrison: Know, yeah 1,000% here.

465
00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see you later.

466
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:17.550
Melissa Harrison: All right, bye.

467
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:18.390
Bye.
