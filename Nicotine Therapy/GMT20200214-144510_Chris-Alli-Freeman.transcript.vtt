Yep.

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.560
Chris Alliman MD: What I always tell people is that

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:03.990
Chris Alliman MD: Suboxone is basically just a patch. Right. It's the therapy that one is able to actually heal the brain, get the skills needed. So I'm glad you've been doing that. That's really helpful. Good. Alright.

13
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.260
Chris Alliman MD: Any surgeries at any point ever

14
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.490
Jessica Freeman: I had a tonsillectomy. When I was five. So 1985 and I had to normal births. So no surgical intervention there.

15
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.980
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and

16
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.240
Chris Alliman MD: You said no, you had your. When was your last alcohol use.

Chris Alliman MD: Any tobacco use.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:45.780
Jessica Freeman: Yeah I smoked for 22 years on a about not quite a year and a half ago I switched to the vapor and I still use that. But I don't use it very much, you know, okay.

21
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.550
Chris Alliman MD: We have is so we certainly you know we're learning more and more about taping, and I'm sure you've heard all the news about lung issues with that.

22
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:03.060
Chris Alliman MD: What we have discovered is that it can be a nice way to taper off nicotine just slowly decreasing the amount of nicotine that's in the cartridge so

23
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.260
Jessica Freeman: Way to get off of cigarettes. So

24
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.120
Chris Alliman MD: We just don't want people to stay with it.

25
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.910
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I know. And same thing with Suboxone and I know that these are things that I need to stop like my recovery is really good. And I talked to my psychiatrist Dr chambers before you know

26
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:36.030
Jessica Freeman: For several months before I left, and he's like, with you moving. He said, I don't see that it's a good time for you to try to stop that. He said, Why don't you get there and get stable getting treatment and then you can have, you know, doctor's supervision, while you're

27
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.890
Chris Alliman MD: Doing yeah that's

28
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.060
Jessica Freeman: All I want to do.

29
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.870
Jessica Freeman: It's just, I just got here on Christmas Eve.

30
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.720
Jessica Freeman: It's been a lot of changes. It's all good. I got a job. My son's in school.

31
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.890
Jessica Freeman: You know everything's is good, but it's still just, you know, it's lonely. I don't know anybody takes a long time to build friendships. Yeah, it does.

32
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.860
Chris Alliman MD: What brought you to Albuquerque.

33
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:15.360
Jessica Freeman: Well, my mom got married and then they retired here and seeing how I'm a single mother to five year old boys autism. I need my mom. She's my biggest supporter. So we came on your much better weather to

34
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.770
Chris Alliman MD: 300

35
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.670
Sunshine.

36
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.500
Chris Alliman MD: Your mom's aware of what's going on with you. Obviously. Yeah, and very supportive. It sounds

37
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.230
Jessica Freeman: Very supportive. Yeah, she's gonna help me cover these upfront costs and then I'm going to submit all this stuff to Medicaid for potential reimbursement and

38
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.670
Jessica Freeman: What can I do, then she'll

39
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.820
Jessica Freeman: Regain that money. If not, she's, she's very supportive. Good.

40
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.880
Chris Alliman MD: That's, that's nice to have that support sounds like that was a good move for you.

41
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.870
Jessica Freeman: Well, she, too, has learned a lot about addiction, and alcoholism in the past four years right along with me.

42
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.820
Jessica Freeman: You know she, you know, instead of

43
00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:01.110
Jessica Freeman: Instead of like ending my life if I if I relapse because she would she would like come in and sweep and just destroy everything that's what she did the first time, but this time.

44
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:09.540
Jessica Freeman: She knows, like, just take care of my little boy for me. Put me in detox and get me back into meetings and I'll be fine.

45
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.680
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, good. She knows that she's very supportive.

46
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:22.590
Chris Alliman MD: Very good. Now when you were taking the short acting opiates. What, what were you taking back in the teenage years up to

47
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.540
Chris Alliman MD: Most recently, when you were taking them. What were you taking how much, how often

48
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.990
Jessica Freeman: Um, I was taking anything I could find. So it started off with Norco that I found in my mom's medicine cabinet as a teenager.

49
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:48.960
Jessica Freeman: Then I got my own script with lots of manipulation and lies and I was getting, you know, hundreds mean they even put me on methadone and Norco at this is had

50
00:04:49.290 --> 00:05:05.010
Jessica Freeman: Hundreds of pills. Wow. And this was, you know, in the mid 2000s. Yeah, when it was easy to do that. And so it was easy to buy it was easy to sell and then things changed.

51
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.210
Jessica Freeman: Which is a good thing that I didn't think so at the time, but then I eventually like at the end, anything I could find.

52
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.910
Jessica Freeman: And then when I was coming down and I couldn't find anything. I started, you know, other things like crystal meth. Like I smoked it for six months.

53
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:36.570
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I tried. I tried anything I could get at the end because I was so afraid of withdrawal and, you know, being in reality I just couldn't be present in reality, ever. And it was, you know, decades of my life that I spent altered.

54
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.650
Jessica Freeman: Right, right. No, it's great that that's not the case today.

55
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.170
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, you've made some great switches and great improvement. Um, did heroin ever become a thing for you.

56
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.720
Jessica Freeman: Know, okay, I'd probably be dead.

57
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.560
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

58
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.260
Jessica Freeman: I never did anything intravenous and I never tried heroin. Good. Good. Those were kind of my

59
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.910
Chris Alliman MD: follow up questions there. So I'm glad that you were able to avoid that part.

60
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.020
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, thank you.

61
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.580
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Um, alright, so living situation. Sounds like it sounds like it's pretty stable, but new

62
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.100
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Actually, I'm renting a house that my mom and her husband own

63
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:24.570
Jessica Freeman: It's affordable and flexible and they actually own the car that I'm driving as well, which I had one, but then I sold it to them and then they gave me this.

64
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.800
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, they're extremely supportive of me and my little boy and our lifestyle and I am

65
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:48.720
Jessica Freeman: Working but like with my situation, it's impossible to work 40 hours a week and get my son to every therapy and appointment and evaluation and assessment interview that he needs and keep a job. So I work 20 hours a week.

66
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.800
Jessica Freeman: And I make

67
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.780
Jessica Freeman: 10 shitty dollars an hour and it keeps us qualified for the things that we need to be qualified for. Okay, so you

68
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.560
Chris Alliman MD: Found how to balance that so that's good. Yeah. Good. Are you doing any counseling. Currently, it doesn't sound like it. That's still

69
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.520
Yeah.

70
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:15.330
Jessica Freeman: When I left my therapist, Brittany, you know, we've been working together for almost four years. She's like, you know, you're a success story, Jessica. She was like,

71
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:29.850
Jessica Freeman: Fly little eagle. She said, you can take some time and not do this for a while. And just as situationally I'm sure I'll be back in therapy at some point but but right now things are good, you know, actually therapy would be kind of awesome.

72
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.380
Jessica Freeman: So I don't know how much you know about our program. I am going to get you a

73
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.320
Chris Alliman MD: Suboxone prescription today. So you'll be set with that.

74
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:47.100
Chris Alliman MD: You absolutely take that stress away from you so you don't have to worry about that. Um, but our program is basically we have weekly group visits.

75
00:07:47.610 --> 00:08:00.540
Jessica Freeman: Now when you say group is that, like other people that are in recovery. Yeah. Okay, so I've done the whole gamut of that. I mean, I've done all the group therapy like CVT GBT you know

76
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.290
Chris Alliman MD: Right, right.

77
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:06.900
Jessica Freeman: I've been in group therapy for years and I haven't had to do it for about a year and it's been really nice.

78
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.220
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so, so the way our program works out is we have, it's so most people aren't at the spot that you're at right

79
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.090
Jessica Freeman: Now,

80
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:24.120
Chris Alliman MD: So we've got a group therapy where there's usually somewhere between five and 10 patients that come in on zoom like we're doing now.

81
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:33.990
Chris Alliman MD: I'm in the group. And we also have a therapist in the group. And that's when we do medical check in to see how things are going with the medication that's very quick. We do that very quickly.

82
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:47.670
Chris Alliman MD: And that's and then it switches into kind of a group therapy discussion session, led by the therapist that's in there. Well, that's going on. That's when I get medications refills sent into page up for patients.

83
00:08:48.090 --> 00:09:05.910
Chris Alliman MD: So, people generally they they need to show up for the group therapy. And then there's also once a week therapy sessions with the counselor individually. So, that is, it's generally a requirement that we have for people because like we talked about the Suboxone is a patch.

84
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.340
Chris Alliman MD: And then the therapy is it

85
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.170
Jessica Freeman: Is this is a good option right like you do you guys accept new mexico Medicaid

86
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.880
Chris Alliman MD: Oh, yeah, yeah.

87
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:34.140
Jessica Freeman: So as soon as I get that, then all of that sounds great. I just don't have the confirmation yet. And it's, I'm going to have to front. All of this costume. My mom has my back. She does. She will cover whatever I need. But, you know, to, it has to be reasonable. You know, I can't

88
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:41.580
Jessica Freeman: Drop a bunch of money. So yes, I'm definitely down for this program with my lifestyle, it's very convenient.

89
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:56.130
Jessica Freeman: Which online thing like I have a really difficult time even getting to meetings because I don't have. I don't know anybody to babysit. And I don't have a million dollars to pay babysitters and my mom. She's already doing so much, you know. Yeah.

90
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:06.150
Chris Alliman MD: Absolutely. So as we kind of work through this. I've got a bunch of questions to ask you. But we'll, we'll lay out kind of when the groups are and what works with your schedule.

91
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.400
Chris Alliman MD: And we can certainly work with things. I understand your situation and we can work things out.

92
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.200
Chris Alliman MD: But we'll

93
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.670
Jessica Freeman: Take that, yeah.

94
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.890
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's my little boys diaper.

95
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.330
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, no worries. You're fine.

96
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.570
Jessica Freeman: We turn the volume down yeah but

97
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.400
That's

98
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.900
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

99
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.910
Chris Alliman MD: Sounds good.

100
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.640
Jessica Freeman: You slept Late Late Late today so

101
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.630
Jessica Freeman: Which was so nice. He never does that when I can sleep in.

102
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.090
Jessica Freeman: The only sleep late when I have to get up early.

103
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.470
Jessica Freeman: You gotta get your

104
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.500
Chris Alliman MD: Do you have a primary care provider yet. I wouldn't

105
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.720
Jessica Freeman: Get to your new. All right.

106
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.440
Um,

107
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.290
Chris Alliman MD: So we are not the primary care group, obviously. So that's something that you'll want to check you.

108
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.400
Jessica Freeman: Can be able to

109
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.510
Jessica Freeman: I

110
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:06.840
Jessica Freeman: I had to select an NCO like a managed care organization. So I'm sure they're going to give me a list of network providers that I can choose from.

111
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:20.100
Chris Alliman MD: I don't know what's going to be included in your SEO options, but what I do know is that first choice is a group that all is always accepting new patients, it might be awhile, but they're always accepting new patients. Okay.

112
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:28.890
Chris Alliman MD: And they're spread out all over Albuquerque, and they've got lots of different offices. Well, that could be an option for you. I'm

113
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.110
Chris Alliman MD: Marital status.

114
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.570
Jessica Freeman: Happily divorced. Okay.

115
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.820
Jessica Freeman: Got 15 years

116
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:46.650
Chris Alliman MD: Right. And because Suboxone can cause birth defects. I always ask about contraception last period, things like that.

117
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.660
Jessica Freeman: Well, um, last period was January 31

118
00:11:52.830 --> 00:12:02.010
Jessica Freeman: And I have been abstinent during my recovery, thus far. So, going on a few years. Good.

119
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.240
Chris Alliman MD: So just be aware of that changes that you want to be protected.

120
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:07.950
Very good.

121
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.450
Chris Alliman MD: Any family history of addiction anything run through the family.

122
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:28.560
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, there's a few like my mom's side of the family. They have some alcoholism, but you know they hide everything. So it's not really discussed, but then my dad side of the family. We got a couple of alcoholics and drug addicts. I have a cousin. I have an uncle.

123
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.690
Jessica Freeman: Actually two cousins.

124
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.080
Jessica Freeman: And an uncle and then me

125
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:44.040
Chris Alliman MD: Gotcha. And then, especially with women. We always check in. If there was a history of childhood abuse if you were abused as a child.

126
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:50.910
Jessica Freeman: No, I was not using my parents here for religious. Gotcha.

127
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.170
Chris Alliman MD: Gotcha, we when we know that for women at least that can play a

128
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.160
Chris Alliman MD: significant role in addiction issues so good to be aware of. All right.

129
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:11.460
Jessica Freeman: Thing. When I was 17 was like with a pastor church. I grew up and it just went down so bad, and I'm the one that got stuck with all the blame for the whole thing and like

130
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:22.500
Jessica Freeman: It was so traumatic and suck my entire life and just use it off in this other direction. And I just never recovered from that until I got sober.

131
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.980
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, yeah. It takes a bit for sure.

132
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:36.930
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so I got some yes or no questions for you. And this is thinking back to the time when you are actively actively using like Norco or or other things.

133
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:46.710
Chris Alliman MD: So we'll just kind of run through those if you don't understand the questions I can certainly rephrase or repeat them whatever you need, but we'll just work through that. Okay.

134
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.720
All right.

135
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:56.100
Chris Alliman MD: Did you take opiates in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than initially intended

136
00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.170
Chris Alliman MD: Oh yes, some of these are a bit obvious, but I still have to ask

137
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.830
Jessica Freeman: I get it, you have to ask me questions that are like, oh,

138
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.460
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, yes, I will answer them. And I will try to be patient and

139
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.010
Chris Alliman MD: You can roll your eyes. That's fine.

140
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.960
Chris Alliman MD: There's a bit. It was there a persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to cut down or control the US.

141
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.520
Jessica Freeman: Oh yeah, yes.

142
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:29.190
Chris Alliman MD: Did you spend have to spend a great deal of time trying to get the opiates use them or recover from them.

143
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.680
Jessica Freeman: Yes, yes, and yes

144
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.730
There you go.

145
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.690
Chris Alliman MD: Where there's cravings, or a strong desire to use

146
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.680
Yes.

147
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:55.290
Jessica Freeman: has really helped with that. Yeah, like the miracle of the program. I don't think about it. I don't desire it. I've got to a point I can even like I went to a drag show with my, my friend recently and you know everybody's drinking I it didn't bother me at all.

148
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.190
Chris Alliman MD: Nice. So it's been working both for the opiates and the alcohol for you. It sounds like

149
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.590
Jessica Freeman: Well, the whole recovery bit. Yeah, yeah.

150
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.360
Jessica Freeman: That's great.

151
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.940
Chris Alliman MD: Um, did the opiates cause failure to fulfill roles at work at school or at home.

152
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.460
Jessica Freeman: Yes, yes, yes.

153
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:22.440
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue to use despite their possibly being recurrence social relationship problems worsened by the opiates.

154
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.650
Chris Alliman MD: Did you have to give up important social, occupational or recreational activities because of the opiates.

155
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.140
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue to use in situations that were physically hazardous like driving

156
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.590
Chris Alliman MD: And

157
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:43.020
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue to use despite knowing that they could cause physical or psychological problems.

158
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:55.800
Chris Alliman MD: And did you notice. So these two questions are going to be very similar but phrase, just a little bit differently. Did you notice that if you took the same amount of opiates, they didn't tend to work as well.

159
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.890
Jessica Freeman: Let me take more

160
00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.820
Chris Alliman MD: There you go.

161
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.630
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so that's the other part. Did you have to take more to achieve the same effect as you had been having. Yeah.

162
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.290
Chris Alliman MD: And did you have withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them.

163
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.690
All right.

164
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.840
Chris Alliman MD: Right. Do you know your hepatitis C status.

165
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.020
Chris Alliman MD: It's way too negative. Okay, you're a little bit muffled at this point. So it's a little harder and

166
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.790
Jessica Freeman: Maybe I put

167
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.310
Jessica Freeman: Microphones microphone.

168
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.960
Jessica Freeman: In a bad place. Now, maybe. Okay.

169
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.870
Chris Alliman MD: All right. And we talked about your last period. How many pregnancies. Have you had

170
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:44.730

Jessica Freeman: He'll be 17 next month. Okay.

175
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:04.980
Chris Alliman MD: All right. All right, now we're going to work through just kind of head to toe symptoms, just looking for yes or nose on these

176
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.970
Chris Alliman MD: The sun's coming in my window. Give me just a moment.

177

219
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.980
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so now is the fun part where we do the physical exam.

220
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.630
Chris Alliman MD: Which is a little bit hard

221
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.340
Chris Alliman MD: In the computer process.

222
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:27.240
Chris Alliman MD: But watching you. You're breathing normally. So I'm putting down a normal respiration rate of 18

223
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.540
Chris Alliman MD: What's your height.

226
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.790

227
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.490
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think so.

228
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.240
Okay.

229
00:19:49.620 --> 00:20:03.660
Chris Alliman MD: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to when you found your pulse. What I'm going to do is time six seconds on my phone. You're going to count the number of pulses and I'll tell you start and stop and then you tell me the number of poses that you get in that timeframe.

230
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.970
Chris Alliman MD: Tell me when you're ready.

231
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.170

232
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:16.530
Chris Alliman MD: Stop.

233
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.300
Chris Alliman MD: Wait. Alright, so we take that time is 10 and that gives us at in a minute.

234
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:30.750
Chris Alliman MD: All right, and then really the only other thing that we can do with the physical exam is heavier on the camera just push on your stomach.

235
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.020
Chris Alliman MD: As best you're able

236
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.750
Jessica Freeman: To or I can put the computer.

237
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.430
Chris Alliman MD: Wrap it up. Yeah.

238
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.300
He

239
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.210
Jessica Freeman: So you want me then.

240
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.290
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, just press all over the stomach and press kind of firmly.

241
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.020
Chris Alliman MD: So in the middle on the sides a pie down low.

242
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.420
Chris Alliman MD: Any pain as you do that.

243
00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.970
Okay, good.

244
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.540
Chris Alliman MD: So that's about all we can do with the physical exam.

245
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.970
Jessica Freeman: I mean I'm healthy man.

246
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:13.740
Chris Alliman MD: I'm good seems like you've been doing it sounds like you've put a whole lot of work into this. You're a healthy person in general, you're really taking care of yourself, which is good.

247
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.820
Jessica Freeman: And do that. So I can take care of my little boy. Yep.

248
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.870
That's what it's about.

249
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.820
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so now we're getting to the point where we need to work out.

250
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:32.430
Chris Alliman MD: A medication and getting connected with the groups. So then we can have you connected and figure out what's going to best work out for you.

251
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:38.730
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so the Suboxone do you use the the generic or the trade name.

252
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.040
Jessica Freeman: Um, I had just been using, like the tablets there orange.

253
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.870
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so not the films, but the

254
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.110
Jessica Freeman: Tablets. Correct. Okay. And

255
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.440
Jessica Freeman: I don't know if it's the same thing. But that's what Medicaid covered in Indiana.

256
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:57.360
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

257
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.350
Chris Alliman MD: We can go either way with it in New Mexico. They're pretty open to

258
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.930
Chris Alliman MD: Whatever. So it's, there's not a whole lot of restriction. If you're used to the tablets. I would just stick with the tablets.

259
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.160
Jessica Freeman: I prefer them.

260
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.030
Chris Alliman MD: That's fine.

261
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.380
Jessica Freeman: Films. It's like that taste in your mouth all day.

262
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.830
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that's what I've heard, heard from people. It's convenient but

263
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.050
Chris Alliman MD: Kind of, yeah.

264
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.570
Chris Alliman MD: And do you know if it was the buprenorphine dash no oxygen or the Suboxone that you got

265
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.520
Jessica Freeman: It was the view. Okay.

266
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.220
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so we'll get that taken care of.

267
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:41.910
Chris Alliman MD: Them will send in the Narc can. Sounds good. Let me check. I should have an email address here for you.

268
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.850
Jessica Freeman: Easy Jessica Freeman three to eight@gmail.com to Ada

269
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.980
Jessica Freeman: How prosaic

270
00:22:51.030 --> 00:23:01.320
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good. So I've got a couple emails that I'll send to you. So we'll be able to work things out that way. What it. You said your schedule is pretty busy.

271
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:13.950
Chris Alliman MD: Let me tell you what groups. I've got available there are more groups and what I have available, but since I'm, you know, talking with you and getting to know you. That is the easiest connection.

272
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:14.730
A great

273
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.550
Chris Alliman MD: So I have a Monday 9am group.

274
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.560
Chris Alliman MD: I have a Wednesday 7:30pm group.

275
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:33.630
Chris Alliman MD: And then I have the Friday 12 noon and a Friday 1:30pm

276
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.400
Jessica Freeman: Probably the 730 on Wednesday would be best.

277
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:46.260
Jessica Freeman: Work either 930 to 330 or tend to for pretty much every day. Okay.

278
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.600
Jessica Freeman: My name. Yeah.

279
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.370
Chris Alliman MD: So it seems like that would fit in pretty well with what you got going on so good.

280
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.830
Chris Alliman MD: So with that group currently

281
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:08.790
Chris Alliman MD: Are the therapist that we have is is traveling so she's not going to be here at the group next Wednesday. But she'll be back the Wednesday after that.

282
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:22.260
Chris Alliman MD: So what I'd like to do is send in a prescription of the Suboxone to get you to that second Wednesday, not this coming Wednesday, because there's not going to be a whole lot of point and that would just be wasting your money as you're trying to work this out.

283
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:34.350
Chris Alliman MD: What I am that therapist is not currently taking new patients or new clients on. So what I'm going to do is send it out to our other therapists and

284
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.580
Chris Alliman MD: I think Becca is probably the one that will be in touch with you.

285
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:48.570
Chris Alliman MD: And and we've got another situation with another patient who's had some insurance issues and we're working things out together that way so we can work it out.

286
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:59.730
Chris Alliman MD: The first appointment with with Becca is a bio psychosocial we're just kind of go through a lot of questions just, it's not a very therapeutic session. It's just kind of

287
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.850
Jessica Freeman: A lot of questions while building your treatment plan.

288
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.320
Jessica Freeman: Yeah yeah I

289
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.740
Jessica Freeman: hate those appointments, but I'll do it. It's cool.

290
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.330
Chris Alliman MD: We'll get it. We'll get it work through

291
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.060
Chris Alliman MD: And then we can certainly see how things

292
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.780
Chris Alliman MD: how things go.

293
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:13.950
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

294
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.330
Chris Alliman MD: Go check on him.

295
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.890
Jessica Freeman: Sounds great.

296
00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.120
Jessica Freeman: On your bottom Sir it down. Thank you.

297
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.770
Jessica Freeman: Okay.

298
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:30.600
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Alright, so we're going to work it with that information, um,

299
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:39.300
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so there's also, there's a couple rules just with senior raping helps remind me no smoking or baking during the sessions, because for other people. It can be a trigger.

300
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:40.770
Jessica Freeman: So,

301
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:49.350
Chris Alliman MD: No big deal. I'm sure I'm also just being settled and present can be helpful so that you're you're focused on the session and what's happening.

302
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:54.210
Jessica Freeman: I will do my best. I will say that, you know, my little boy.

303
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.650
Chris Alliman MD: Right.

304
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.220
Chris Alliman MD: And we have

305
00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:02.370
Chris Alliman MD: We have other people that have kids and it's it's a reality, it's life and you got to take care of the kids and that's okay.

306
00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.900
Jessica Freeman: I can mute my mic right yeah

307
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.210
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. And we actually do that a lot.

308
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:16.320
Chris Alliman MD: And I will often during the session when people are being loud on mute it on them just to so that background noise isn't coming in.

309
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:22.680
Chris Alliman MD: Of course, the sessions are meant to be confidential. Right. We don't want other people in

310
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.280
Jessica Freeman: The background and whatnot. Seriously, my kid.

311
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.980
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, which at five years old. I'm not worried about that.

312
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.290
Jessica Freeman: And he's nonverbal so there's that.

313
00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:33.270
There you go.

314
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:41.160
Chris Alliman MD: The way that you get into the groups when they do happen is that you call into the virtual clinic, like you did today.

315
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:51.810
Chris Alliman MD: And there's that's like going in the front office of the doctor's office or calling the doctor's office right there's always aligned and there's always paperwork to do

316
00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:08.730
Chris Alliman MD: So what I'm telling you is that with this 730 group. You don't want to call in at 725 and think you're going to get in. We encourage people to call in about half an hour to 20 minutes 20 minutes to half an hour ahead of time so that they can go through get all that taken care of.

317
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:20.550
Chris Alliman MD: When, when I give them the meeting ID, then they'll email it or text it to you so that you'll be able to get in the group. And that ID changes every group. It's not the same. Each time around.

318
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.020
Chris Alliman MD: We want to ensure people

319
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.660
Chris Alliman MD: check in and get their things taken care of. So

320
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.860
Jessica Freeman: Make sense that way.

321
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:31.290
Chris Alliman MD: So yeah, put the reminder in your phone, you know, whatever you need to do with all of that.

322
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.150
Chris Alliman MD: Again, this will be for

323
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.020
Jessica Freeman: Adult

324
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.900
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, you seem to be a very responsible adults.

325
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.210
Chris Alliman MD: too worried about

326
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.950
Chris Alliman MD: Some folks, you know, they're still struggling on those basic

327
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.700
Jessica Freeman: Basic

Chris Alliman MD: So we try to

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.130
Chris Alliman MD: We try to support them as best we can.

332
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.030
Chris Alliman MD: So your first group then would be on February.

333
00:27:54.030 --> 00:28:06.720
Jessica Freeman: 2626 at 730 with an alarm at seven. There you go.

334
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.090
Chris Alliman MD: That would be good. Now I'm going to send you an email that has all this information on it.
