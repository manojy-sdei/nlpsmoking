1
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

2
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.790
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, I can hear you.

3
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and videos. Good.

4
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, excellent far out. So let's see if we can find some place for me to sit. So we're not wobbling around maybe prop me on a even a workbench or something somewhere.

5
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.540
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I'm going to come out to the back to usually. Okay. Give me one second. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.970
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, it doesn't feel like there's any wind today so

7
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.830
Ariel Mirabal: Okay. All right.

8
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice. Alright so today is, um, I guess. Is this our first treatment plan review where we review your goals.

9
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Um, so let's do that. I'm looking at them right now changing them changing the dates, just a little bit here. So one of the ones that

10
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is for everyone that is part of this sort of accreditation question they want TOUCHED ON IT ISN'T STATED necessarily by the client, but this is something that the accreditation wants us to touch on. So when you you know how each time you do a brief addiction monitor the BAM survey. Bam.

11
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When it asks you about how you use spirituality or religion to help you in your recovery. What, what is your belief around that.

12
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.750
Ariel Mirabal: I always say no because, I mean, I do believe in God, fully I don't. I just don't really practice religion.

13
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.770
Ariel Mirabal: I am Catholic my family's Catholic

14
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:23.580
Ariel Mirabal: I just don't practice it enough and hold it right there with me, you know, all the time to to really use it to help me with my recovery process.

15
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.370
Okay.

16
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it typically like if I were to go into those fans. It takes me a few minutes, but I can get there, are you, is it a like a zero or a one, is it not at all, are you putting like

17
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.580
Ariel Mirabal: Like a zero if there, if it's not at all. Yeah.

18
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.630
Okay.

19
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All helping. Okay, got it. Okay. Um, and when you think about Catholicism. Wait, the way you grew up.

20
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Were there times in your life when you liked it and it felt like this worked with you and then other times when it, it just didn't work for you.

21
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.210
Ariel Mirabal: Well, growing up. We didn't have a lot of it.

22
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:33.750
Ariel Mirabal: My grandmother, though, of course, we were always around our grandparents visiting and stuff. And my, my mom's mother is extremely religious, which is why I'm, to make a long story short, my mom was

23
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.100
Ariel Mirabal: She, she was, she went to Catholic school all the way through high school. My grandma had her and Catholic school she had her in church every Sunday.

24
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.970
Ariel Mirabal: My grandmother actually goes to church every single day. So my mom kind of lived with it so much that she when she grew

25
00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:03.270
Ariel Mirabal: Up and kind of went on with her life. She was like, I don't want to be at church anymore. You know, it kind of was something that she didn't really instill she instilled God in us, of course, we all of us, me and my siblings.

26
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.930
Ariel Mirabal: All of all of us. We do believe in God, but none of us really, you know, my sister. She has crosses in her house. You know, you know, all the beautiful things

27
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:25.050
Ariel Mirabal: And she actually is probably the one out of all of us that she'll go to church and things like that. But none of us really, you know, we believe in God, but we don't like.

28
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.650
Ariel Mirabal: Might like I said my sister is the only one that will be like Oreo, you know, stop and think about God, like my sister does that she will say,

29
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.870
Ariel Mirabal: Things like you know just just pray, you know, all the time. I sisters like that, but

30
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:52.500
Ariel Mirabal: That's not like for me. It's not like the first thing that comes to mind when I'm like in a troublesome spot or thought or something. I'm not, like, Okay, I'm gonna go pray, you know, to God or something, you know, I've never been that person.

31
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think about just something broader

32
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And and just first thing that comes to mind when you think about this broader idea of something

33
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Higher than yourself.

34
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

35
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it determine your future do you determine your future, what's your connection to something greater than yourself.

36
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.480
Ariel Mirabal: It's for me. I don't even feel like I have a connection with that with something greater than myself like something like that because

37
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:44.250
Ariel Mirabal: Otherwise I would probably feel like a little bit more of praying to God for something for about thought or, you know, I'm having a bad time. I think I just need to pray right now.

38
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.510
Ariel Mirabal: I think that I should be doing more things like that because you know I want my daughter to do I want her to have something else to believe in

39
00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:03.480
Ariel Mirabal: You know, and I always say that to myself if I didn't believe in God or that there was a heaven I would be in a really bad place after my after I lost my dad, I would have been in a worse place.

40
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was. Notice how those two things, sit out there. I believe in God. I believe in a heaven. And I think that's what you're saying heaven.

41
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.190
Ariel Mirabal: Mm hmm.

42
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not connected to a higher power.

43
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.790
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, it's hard to just

44
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You only get to connect when you fast away.

45
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.330
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know. I'm one of those people. That's like

46
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.730
Ariel Mirabal: Like you know how you hear some people say, like, you know, give your problems to God.

47
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.830
Ariel Mirabal: I'm a person that doesn't. I don't understand that. I think I'm happy. I think that I have just a hard time understanding things because I don't open up enough

48
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.150
Ariel Mirabal: To look into them more

49
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:51.360
Ariel Mirabal: Because it's like how could you give your problems to how could you do that and I feel like I need, I need to fix my problems. I'm the one that needs to, you know,

50
00:06:53.130 --> 00:07:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a piece of a much larger conversation, but you just gave me some very interesting pieces to it. Just want to make a little note around that. So your perception is if there is a problem. I have to solve it.

51
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.260
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

52
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.220
Okay.

53
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.030
Ariel Mirabal: It's always been how I felt about that.

54
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm kind of want to talk to you a little bit about how many times, or do you even know what the Serenity Prayer is

55
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.880
Ariel Mirabal: I do know what the Serenity Prayer is

56
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. You haven't memorized.

57
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.210
And

58
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.420
Ariel Mirabal: Like pieces bits and pieces.

59
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

60
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.840
Ariel Mirabal: Give me the serenity.

61
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:45.420
Ariel Mirabal: To handle what I it's it's so hard to remember right now, but I do know what the Serenity Prayer is it's hard to remember. Okay.

62
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But you got you just got this is not a quiz in this is really what sticks and You almost said a piece. Good. So just go with the pieces. This is, this is no judgment. I just want to see where it lives inside the memory.

63
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it a shot. I'm going to pull it out. We're going to look at it together to see how much you can actually

64
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.060
Ariel Mirabal: Know, I know I'm like kicking myself in the

65
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.900
Ariel Mirabal: In the teeth. Now,

66
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.870
Ariel Mirabal: It's like, God, give me the serenity.

67
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:20.070
Ariel Mirabal: To handle things I can't change something like that. It's like

68
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just that part handle this things I can change. So what if we just, if that's the piece you're holding on to right that's the piece that sticks if when you visit this if you ever have. That's the part that's there, doesn't matter what the actual one is

69
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a screen if we want to we can look at it, but this

70
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Distinction between if it's my problem. I have to solve it.

71
00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But the Serenity Prayer gives its, its listener, it's it's believer is

72
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.670
Ariel Mirabal: I'm asking him for his drink.

73
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well let's look again.

74
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me, which means outside yourself. The peace of mind however you define serenity is that piece. Give me the clarity, give me serenity no stress no anger no sorrow. Isn't that living in serenity. Give me the serenity.

75
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To handle

76
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's put back on your lap.

77
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.070
Ariel Mirabal: There's something about strength in this prayer. I'm trying to say like

78
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.480
Ariel Mirabal: God giving you the strength

79
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You are so we're almost there. So, but it's so your hands up here. Give me the peace, the strength. But then, back to you. You give me the serenity to handle

80
00:09:50.790 --> 00:10:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The things I can't change you put it back in your lap. That is why I'm guessing you are at where we started. It's my problem. I've got a handle it. The only part that stuck with you is all the problems are back in your lap. You're just asking that you be chill while you handle them.

81
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And if this prayer asks more this, whether it's prayer or however you want to think about it. You can replace God with higher power universe love

82
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people for a lot of people. It's that that's what's pure. That's what's perfect is maybe they can find this perfection in love for a daughter, you might find that that's an ambivalent, it's very clear. This is what love is. I know it.

83
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that's the source of all it's right there. You can play with it. I'm not stuck on whether it's labeled Catholicism Buddhism, Taoism i'm i'm not stuck in that

84
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I want whatever works for you guys. If it's God and this one probably will work just fine. But did you notice how you're asking. Let me have a peaceful experience of sitting with the things I can't change.

85
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw still on your shoulders. That's still a lot of pressure on you.

86
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the way it looks.

87
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because look what you said give me serenity to handle the things I cannot change. That's what stuck.

88
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You are saying, I'm still gonna have to deal but help me deal without like losing my serenity.

89
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that the stuck around with it's consistent with I still have to work it out.

90
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.040
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

91
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to look at it now and see what's actually there. Okay.

92
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just give him peace and I'm going to shut up and I want you to see.

93
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece that's missing.

94
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.270
OK.

95
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.730
Ariel Mirabal: To accept

96
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:07.470
Ariel Mirabal: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference.

97
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.100
Ariel Mirabal: courage and wisdom.

98
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You have courage you have wisdom. I don't think those are the pieces you are courageous you have wisdom, but that's still back in your lap. There's still something that wasn't in what you remember that is in this

99
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here about this, except what I can't change. Notice how what you remembered was I got to be able to handle

100
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.900
Ariel Mirabal: Except, yeah. That's the first thing that I noticed

101
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What you weren't

102
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you still had to solve the things you can't change.

103
00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is the difference. That's one really big difference. No, it's more like this.

104
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, I cannot change in law behavior. I cannot change. A, B and C. You put your hands up. That's where you have faith.

105
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Faith means you put your hands up and you walk forward into the abyss of unknown anyway. So you say, I believe in God. Well, do you, will you put your hands up like this and say I accept it.

106
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know everything there is about, let's say the recovery process or what it means to finish my degree or something. But I'm going to put my hands up. And I'm just going to say this is coming from a loving intention and I'm going to do it, not knowing how I will get there.

107
00:13:50.430 --> 00:14:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm going to go and I'm going to trust and I'm going to move forward in the things that I believe in and the distinction is except what I can't change. So if right now you're spending all your energy around this coven

108
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: railing against it. How could this be happening I'm such a good person. This can't be real. Let's say you spent

109
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 hours a day doing that to yourself.

110
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This would, that would that would be one of them. You gotta have to accept it. It's real. This is happening. Our communities are are having to really make significant changes.

111
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.190
Ariel Mirabal: Right. Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So just let's not go any further. Where do you think you need more acceptance versus you hammering away at it. I think that have nothing to do with you.

113
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.840
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, I have a lot of faith, but I think that I need to have more

114
00:14:53.100 --> 00:15:00.780
Ariel Mirabal: I need to have more faith and like you said just putting my hands up and walking out into the abyss and saying, I accept

115
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:08.070
Ariel Mirabal: This the things I can't change, you know, and that's what I truly think that I need to work on also

116
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.270
Ariel Mirabal: As learn to accept things that I can't change.

117
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do yesterday.

118
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get specific. We can philosophize, and it won't move us forward into our dreams into our visions. If we can't see the real yeah yes in our lives.

119
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.900
Um,

120
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.210
Ariel Mirabal: I mean,

121
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.040
Ariel Mirabal: Nothing really yesterday, specifically, but I mean,

122
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sure where are you tired.

123
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.750
Ariel Mirabal: And you read probably think about something for every day, you're

124
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Tired and I fought it. And I said, No, this can't be and I should use a substance to address my tiredness, it can be that subtle. No, no. Sometimes we're just tired.

125
00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes. Sometimes we're just impatient. Sometimes we're the one that starts the fight.

126
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That happen.

127
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.450
Ariel Mirabal: But used to be my mind frame with like the drinking and stuff. It's like, oh, well, if I just take a shot, it'll give me a little bit more energy.

128
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.170
Like

129
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.270
Ariel Mirabal: I'm so tired. Right now I'm just going to go drink so I could get some energy

130
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there it is. See, you know, I came up with that though that one, don't count.

131
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.580
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, no, it's just so easy to say you know now thinking about it. The wheels start turning um

132
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.340
Ariel Mirabal: Let me think.

133
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time.

134
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be around relationships wishing hoping someone would be different. And if only I'll change all change then or if I could say what just understand my then they'll change.

135
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be around something like that.

136
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:48.540
Ariel Mirabal: Oh,

137
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.210
Ariel Mirabal: Relationships would probably be a big one. I can think of, of course.

138
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.480
Ariel Mirabal: My boyfriend. I think that

139
00:16:59.250 --> 00:16:59.940
Ariel Mirabal: He

140
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:13.080
Ariel Mirabal: He doesn't do anything. But every now and then he'll have a relapse. I know that he used to be particularly particularly, excuse me, on pain medication, a long time ago.

141
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:28.890
Ariel Mirabal: But I felt like maybe that's a part of his past and it's gone, but I've seen him do it a couple of times within the past couple of years, and I get really upset about it, like I'm trying to change it. I'm trying to make a, you know, and it's like those are one of those things where

142
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.110
Ariel Mirabal: Should I be, you know,

143
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.220
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, so

144
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's look at it. Let's just see what's the pilot. Let's see if this is the one. It might be a different skill might not be this one might be something else. Let's just see how you feel. Okay.

145
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put it in there. Just imagine there's you seeing with your own eyes. Oh my gosh, I can tell he's using

146
00:17:54.210 --> 00:18:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want this to be true God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.

147
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Change what someone does, I cannot. I can't make him heal. I can't make him want to get better. And here we go. Here's the second half.

148
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And Arielle the courage to change the things I can, and this is the massive change and to know to have the wisdom.

149
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Of when do I put my energy into something that I can change and when do I put my hands up and just say let go and let God. How do I know when. Oh, that's why these are so big. Give me the serenity, help me know where that is helped me distinguish what is my problem versus your problem.

150
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me the wisdom that's key here.

151
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me the wisdom to know when I'm to lean into faith and just let them work it out.

152
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus I can do something right now.

153
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in line with my moral standards, I will do something now.

154
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's that line between

155
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's yours and what's mine when it comes to boyfriend. Do you have the wisdom to know the difference.

156
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:46.290
Ariel Mirabal: I feel like with some things maybe not. But with that, I feel like I do, it's, I don't know if it's just like I i love him. And you know, I care about him, obviously. And I want him to be well

157
00:19:47.670 --> 00:20:03.390
Ariel Mirabal: Not just for us, but for himself, you know, and of course our daughter and things so I feel like that's one of those things where I want you know you can lead a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink it. I kind of want to help lead him to the water. You know, like

158
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.370
Ariel Mirabal: Make him.

159
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:11.520
Ariel Mirabal: Make him. I can't make him stop. I can't make him not want to do it.

160
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And why

161
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You know something's off when you got upset.

162
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:28.680
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah. Um, and then I think maybe I can, I can help him to I can help him to want to not do it anymore. All the time, you know, then there's just

163
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:41.880
Ariel Mirabal: Then the not getting upset that would be okay. I accept I accept that I couldn't change it. You know it. I tried, but it happened anything's you know

164
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:53.970
Ariel Mirabal: Instead of oh my god you know I've, I was trying to help you and I can't believe you just did it anyways. You know, you promised you weren't going to do it again and then a big fight, you know,

165
00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you in the past have a difficult time seeing where your problem.

166
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Or his problem how they overlapped how you made his problem your problem. Got yourself offended because he didn't accept your solution.

167
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.180
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, all the time.

168
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why this is useful again.

169
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Really elegantly put this slide years in the making this type of Serenity Prayer. Right. This came about from a lot of people sitting with what am I trying to control here. Is it my place to control it. Where is it, enabling, where is it coaching. How do we know

170
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:46.980
Ariel Mirabal: I've always had such a hard time with that. I feel like growing up. I didn't really pay attention much attention to that prayer or anything about it.

171
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:55.320
Ariel Mirabal: And, you know, of course, like I said, we didn't practice religion, you know, and stuff. Growing up, I feel like I was just a normal teenager, you know,

172
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:07.710
Ariel Mirabal: And then after high school. It was like I felt like that was my time just to be wild and crazy and that's pretty much what I was all the time. Every weekend out with my friends drinking camping, whatever.

173
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:16.200
Ariel Mirabal: But none of that. I just none of that ever came to mind. It's like I was always just a free

174
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.660
Ariel Mirabal: Just go, you know,

175
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's back up to the distinction between enabling and coaching.

176
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.340
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, so that's what I was saying, I feel like I pretty much

177
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.030
Ariel Mirabal: Have always just had a hard time just

178
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.250
Ariel Mirabal: Just like

179
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll see.

180
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:48.630
Ariel Mirabal: Friends. Yeah, between the two of those, because I've always been the person I feel like I've always been more like I'm like super opinionated. I'm like, on one end of that, you know, I feel like

181
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:58.890
Ariel Mirabal: I'm never I'm always the person that gets so upset right away about something that I can't change instead of just accepting it. I've never been the person that could just accept something

182
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:12.840
Ariel Mirabal: I always fight. I always find something I noticed about myself. I'm a fighter. I'm like, wait a minute, why, why can this happen. No, no, that's not right. Like this is I'm going to try to make this happen. You know, I've always been like that.

183
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.010
Ariel Mirabal: Well, it's like

184
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:15.930
Ariel Mirabal: You know,

185
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: One thing might be you know too much Pepper. Pepper still good, but a little too much pepper soup. So, but we don't want to throw the whole thing out. It's a great energy. It's a great vitality

186
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's just come back. I just really want to see this since we picked up this concept of

187
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Control acceptance and we picked up this notion of boyfriend is substance use and you're kind of not knowing where his problem begins and kind of where you begin where he ends and where that is. So if we just say for now then, enabling is

188
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing for others.

189
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: They can do for themselves.

190
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So if they could have done it for themselves. And I did it. My enabled. I made it possible for them to not have to do it themselves, which reinforces them never doing it for themselves. That's the simplest explanation of it. But if instead. If you think about the kid right when

191
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You put it in the basket.

192
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's our first one. Oh, we got our stinky socks. Let's walk it over together. But if you always do it and then you give said daughter a hard time about it.

193
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you always did it, we can't be too surprised. But if instead we say

194
00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, can you pick yourself up. Oh, nice. Can you walk. Well, you can pick things up and you can walk. Can you drop it. Can you let go of the grip. Well, those are the only skills you need

195
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then we watch and we say good job. Nicely done. You feel proud of yourself. Yeah, yeah. Cool, cool, cool.

196
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the difficult part when we see people in our life hurting themselves. It's just sit back and as a coach, do I get on the field.

197
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't my players play

198
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can say. Remember, remember the play, we plan for the game.

199
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting your position.

200
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do it. You can remember the play. Remember the play, but I can't get on the field. Can I, I can't kick the ball for him as the coach right

201
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I can encourage okay let's let's have a timeout everyone

202
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well alright, how we do it. We can bump up the self esteem. We can coach and cheerlead and say, all right, we're how we're doing. Let's assess our progress.

203
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What are our strengths. We people that are approved. We can pull them out, put in new players. Right. And maybe because I'm on the sideline, I can see things from a different perspective, because I'm not on the field.

204
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see all the different moving parts.

205
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:08.610
Ariel Mirabal: Encouragement and like motivation and stuff. It's really what I want to do.

206
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We can offer it with your acceptance. My guess is is going to come in with accepting that its own welcomed and done wanted

207
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you get to be pissed off. How could you not love me enough to quit care about my daughter. HOW COULD YOU HOW COULD YOU HOW COULD YOU is that

208
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything.

209
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.700
Ariel Mirabal: And I'm like, sometimes like I'll tell him like just most recently when he did it, it was like

210
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:51.960
Ariel Mirabal: I can't remember exactly what I said it was something like, you know, I'm working so hard to try to you know better myself and stay sober and you're over here doing this.

211
00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:03.450
Ariel Mirabal: And it's like, so sometimes I compare myself to him, and I'm not perfect. You know, I've had relapses and things. I'm just trying to, you know, stay better to

212
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:11.040
Ariel Mirabal: But I can't be. I don't feel like that's right. I don't feel like I should be comparing, you know, and sometimes I just like, throw it out and like

213
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:25.950
Ariel Mirabal: Stuff to try to make him feel bad and I don't really want to have on the on the spot. I'm like men will this work will this make him want to, but it's like that's not the right you know it's obviously not the right way to do it, making somebody feel bad, isn't the right way to do it.

214
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

215
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.600
Ariel Mirabal: You want to make them feel that

216
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It wouldn't work for you either if someone tried to guilt trip you into it. We just present them senior

217
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Group and they were like, how could you do that, you know, you'd resent them not want to go to group anymore. You wouldn't feel accepted but if on the sidelines. You were sharing. So if you wonder what to do.

218
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's sharing your hope your, your stories and saying, This is what I've done to overcome the temptation to want to bypass.

219
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: leap over escape and avoid the truth. I'm tired. I'm broke, I'm in. I'm in an argument I'm whatever I'm scared I'm I'm feeling guilty about something.

220
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I no longer, right, sweetheart. I no longer can sleep over it. I actually have to sit with my feelings and as uncomfortable as it is. It turns out they only last about a half hour if I really pay attention to them if I journal

221
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been noticing. I've been doing this breath work that's helping. I've been doing these distraction techniques that's helping talking with other people that are going through it's helping me

222
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of telling people using a guilt trip leverage leveraging love to maybe motivate people, which is a pretty common one for folks when they don't know what else to do.

223
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to talk about your own experience.

224
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what a coach now go back to coach position right we were in coach for, like, okay, I did this, I remember when I was a kid when I needed to do.

225
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Was I would make sure I stretch tonight. I ran on the weekends to stay in shape, even when they're sort of asked what I did. You guys want to kind of give that a try. Okay, go for it. But that's what I did.

226
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can talk about your own and you'll know you're doing it because you'll just stick with the I, I've noticed when I've been low on energy we're normally I was going for a drink.

227
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been doing this other thing I'm trying radical acceptance now and I'm like, what's really wrong with being tired.

228
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I still get some things done nothing catastrophic happen.

229
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have another day of sobriety. So

230
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's okay that sometimes I'm tired.

231
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So key thing is

232
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I

233
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus you and then you just let go of outcome you just he's gonna buy it, take it on, try it. Or he won't you let go of outcome like

234
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.130
Ariel Mirabal: That is

235
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's huge. That's why I remember this word in here.

236
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were saying was this word handle was your verb but it's

237
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: A big verb is starting with acceptance, you cannot change his motivation. He is either going to help he'll either want to do it or he won't. And as inconvenience. It is

238
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. Nonetheless, this is someone who's using. I don't know how much

239
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not wanting it to be so because you're getting sober. You're the one getting sober. He sees and the one to sign up for this gig. You did.

240
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not an easy thing to do. Your you're addressing and there's a few of you that are addressing maybe both alcohol.

241
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And the, the opiate dependence. They're also addressing you'll hear them and narratives meth and opiates, because it's both or another stimulant this up down thing that was needed in order to kind of survive.

242
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But meth may be their preferred choice, but then they ended up getting this chemical dependence on the opiate because they needed to come down, you know, either way.

243
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Your acceptance might be a really big change for you.

244
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.690
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I agree.

245
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The phrase that I use.

246
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You've probably heard me say this.

247
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see someone doing something that you don't approve of, or you wouldn't do yourself.

248
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe just asking yourself, is this a meat problem. Are you from

249
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you

250
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it because it's gonna piss them off, but I

251
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.770
Ariel Mirabal: Run my mouth run. So that's where I go. Ba ba ba ba my mouth opens right away.

252
00:31:51.600 --> 00:32:07.380
Ariel Mirabal: It's awful. Like, oh my god, I saw this lady like stealing from a gas station one time and Silly me. I go open my mouth and this lady comes over, like tries to beat me up, you know, I'm like getting in my car like oh my god I shouldn't have said anything. It's like my mouth just

253
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.740
Ariel Mirabal: You idiot. Don't say anything to show

254
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.080
Ariel Mirabal: Oh man it's

255
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So, well, maybe you have some some challenges in in sort of inhibiting that impulse. Okay.

256
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's been times when you have been able to, I know because I've seen you in group if you were in group and you couldn't inhibit it you would be talking the whole time and no one would have a chance to talk. I know you can do it.

257
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you've had thoughts and wanted to. And did I know you can do it.

258
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So start, you know, we go to the breath, and we take a deep breath and then we go. Is this a me problem are you problem.

259
00:32:47.910 --> 00:33:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just even that amount of time that can define our boundaries that can define my about to do some enabling right now this isn't for me to solve. I'm going to do the things that are within my control. I'll go do some things that feel good.

260
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you know what I'm going to drive safely home or a little authorities certainly my job to discipline the planet and teach them right from wrong. This one's really I, you know, my God.

261
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.180
Ariel Mirabal: brought this up because it's a huge like

262
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:24.240
Ariel Mirabal: It's kind of like you brought me into this like reminded because this is definitely something that I i

263
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:32.610
Ariel Mirabal: It's huge for me. I really, really, really need to work on that. And it's not something I think about every day, like, oh, I need to get help for that and counseling. You know, I didn't

264
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:47.190
Ariel Mirabal: So it's really appreciate you getting into this conversation about that because it's really I think that now that you've kind of like pinpointed it and it's like I'm looking at it and it is. It's one of my biggest problems.

265
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean it what what what's the it the

266
00:33:52.020 --> 00:34:01.170
Ariel Mirabal: It is that I don't just that big word. I can accept. I just can't. It's like I keep seeing that word in my head. Now, except it's like

267
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:16.500
Ariel Mirabal: I, I can't, you know, and then this other than you just know said I can't discipline the world discipline the world and make them do the right thing all the time, you know, because it's like when it's true. When I see somebody doing something that's

268
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:29.700
Ariel Mirabal: Wrong, or if I'm talking with somebody and i know that i mean i know that they're wrong about something and I you can't change that. But it's like, then that's when the argue comes out. And I'm like, No, you know,

269
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's, since we're here at our treatment goal review anyway. And the ones we had I'm opening them up.

270
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or some of them are pretty vague because they were when we just met. So why don't we make some more ones that are really personal for you, ones that

271
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Will have a meaningful register of change. So let's get into that just a little bit so

272
00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What you have here is I want to be more patient with my daughter. I want to slow down my mind so down the running thoughts. I want to research more fun activities decrease reported symptoms of depression. That one's me

273
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Routine implementation emotional regulation skills that one's me you are increased exercise. I want to get a gym membership more of yours include

274
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to continue to be with positive people that will help me stay clean. I want a job. I want to be able to completely stay away from all substances. Let's add one that has to do with acceptance. Now hold on yourself because we're going to have to measure it.

275
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha, so that means I'm assuming you want more acceptance. Is that right,

276
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.550
Ariel Mirabal: I want to be able to accept more

277
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, have to measure that. So I wonder how we'll measure it.

278
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so. Okay.

279
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that we were talking about

280
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We were talking about a relationship. We were also talking about a stranger, we were talking about. So you are there are ways to measure it. So if your goal is, and I write it down. I want more. I want to accept more

281
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:28.110
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, I and I guess that that kind of is the issue with me getting so and probably most of the time me getting so upset with my daughter is that exactly

282
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:37.260
Ariel Mirabal: You know, maybe I wouldn't even I wouldn't even go near the place of getting so upset so often. And that wouldn't even be an issue. If I could just learn how to be that person that

283
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:46.380
Ariel Mirabal: could accept more things like, you know, except the fact that she's you know she's still learning. She doesn't just know you know obviously

284
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:56.580
Ariel Mirabal: It's like there's so many things. Now, just thinking about that one thing now that just leads into so many different things that I've had problems with and it's like

285
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:07.740
Ariel Mirabal: I even feel like I've burned friendships because of that, like one when it's not your place to say something, you know, what are you gonna say it anyways, like, Hey, your boyfriend's cheating on you, you know,

286
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.900
Ariel Mirabal: I caught him.

287
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:20.370
Ariel Mirabal: But maybe even though I'm the one that caught him. They're both my friends, I shouldn't go tell you know what I mean, it's one of those things. I feel like that's that was that's kind of a rough one them.

288
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.650
Ariel Mirabal: So I have a hard time with that one.

289
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.070
Ariel Mirabal: On what I should what you should be doing with something like that, you know,

290
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so your mind goes very fast. And that's a blessing. And it's probably been a little bit of a challenge at times. So what I do, which can be uncomfortable for people is I slow it down.

291
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

292
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So we are, believe it or not, at the top of the hour, my client just walked in, but I want to get really clear about what the objective is, so this is the measurability, this is where my input comes in. Your goal is, I want to accept more

293
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we need a little bit more to that may be something like

294
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.150
Ariel Mirabal: A like TechCrunch, like I want to accept tomorrow, but I can't.

295
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, that's it. Okay, so, and we're going to be measuring that. So let's take client will

296
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What will acceptance look on you will look like on you probably something client will notice I'm right.

297
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.340
And recently.

298
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:35.730
Ariel Mirabal: Decrease in I wouldn't say anger so much because I'm not really an angry person. But decrease in

299
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.800
Ariel Mirabal: Like want to say something about like reactions like my

300
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.940
Ariel Mirabal: My instant reactions.

301
00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:57.360
Ariel Mirabal: That aren't so good. Um, I don't know how to say that I would just say, angry, I guess, decrease

302
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me do the job you're doing it. You don't have to do my job for me. You're doing

303
00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so sweet. So you already have yours. So the art comes in in my finding some tasks that will get you there. Okay, so here's I've got an idea. What if all you have to catch is off. I'm right.

304
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can catch it there. I'm right and you're indignant, and you're righteous and you're like, oh, I'm right. And that's all you just grab it. Okay, got that one. Okay.

305
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're going to know it, right, I got some to say, and I'm I tell them, but you don't what you're going to do is you're going to just grab it.

306
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So wrong. It's so obvious, they're wrong.

307
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you do three belly breaths and then you think to yourself, we'll try it on. Is this is the problem.

308
00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is this a you problem and you just get that far. Because what may happen is you may end up deciding this isn't a good budgeting of my time.

309
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You may remember, other things like it's not, I'm not the world police what I can do, if you can remember this, this would be great. Is this a me problem or a huge problem. If you can do the next one which is

310
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: To choose curiosity over being right that's a huge one, usually a separate those two it will make a profound difference

311
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:37.410
Ariel Mirabal: Pretty

312
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Over being right. This is what it looks like. And I don't have a lot of time, but I'm going to show you really quick. Okay.

313
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.190
Ariel Mirabal: Now that's interesting.

314
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to catch feeling righteous. You can catch it, especially if you have any boy.

315
00:40:52.230 --> 00:41:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Any Catholic background, you're going to register all of that really fast. So you're going to feel right. Oh, oh, oh, I got this really good explanation, but what they're doing. That's not good. And I got, it's good. You're going to catch it there and you're going to

316
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Do three breaths to building breath three if you can manage one. Great, then you're going to think to yourself, what, what's your new mantra.

317
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this a knee problem or a huge problem.

318
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah yeah that's they got to work that out. Okay, what's the second thing I gotta do. I'm going to choose curiosity over being right.

319
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I manifest that how does that show up if I'm thinking it so I got my two little mantras here. Got my two mantras. How do I show curiosity.

320
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

321
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, instead of preaching and teaching

322
00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Do some asking really genuinely but don't do unless you actually want to know, even a little bit about how they came to that conclusion and don't ask the why question that will make them defensive

323
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so tell me, Sarah, how, how long have you had that that idea about how this works like was that how your parents thought or how did you come to this. I'm so curious.

324
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Only do it until you're ready so you stay quiet. Quiet. Quiet, quiet normally asked when you really are curious that there might be another human being that came to a different conclusion.

325
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that everybody does the best they can with what they know and we get out of a position of judging judging judging. Why don't we just get curious. I know I am.

326
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to be

327
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys come up with solutions, whatever your friend, family, your daughter. That's her solution. You gotta respect that there are a lot of different ways to get a problem solved.

328
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.750
Ariel Mirabal: That's really interesting. I really, really, really like that.

329
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.570
Ariel Mirabal: And I've heard I've

330
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.500
Ariel Mirabal: I think I've even heard you do that before with the curious thing.

331
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:16.650
Ariel Mirabal: That's really interesting. And I, I mean maybe I've done that before to just on a on a wing, you know, before I just I've definitely heard that I've heard it before. And people just

332
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:24.810
Ariel Mirabal: Most many times in my life, I've heard people do that. And it's like, I'm always like I said, I've always been the person that just fly straight through it.

333
00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:26.220
Just

334
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.810
Ariel Mirabal: Okay.

335
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Damn.

336
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.520
Ariel Mirabal: I'm going to try it. I'm going to really try it.

337
00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this a knee, probably you problem. Oh yeah, I'm sticking my nose and nobody asked for my opinion, who may hang on a second one.

338
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: She was curiosity. Well, I felt so right. I feel so right okay at least are arguing

339
00:43:50.700 --> 00:44:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: alienating people. Okay. Oh, hey, I do actually kind of want to know, and all of a sudden, it comes up and you find, you're like yeah and then you ask a genuine question why questions will get defensive let's pick another time. I know this girl is going to be like wow

340
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.760
Ariel Mirabal: That's cool. That's perfect, that's like, thank you so much for that.

341
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.030
