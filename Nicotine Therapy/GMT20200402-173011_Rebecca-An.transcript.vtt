Yeah yeah

39
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're working with Dr omen.

40
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.620
Amanda's: Well, I haven't yet. But yeah, definitely.

41
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, and

42
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It shows that you're here for an individual. Have you had your bio psychosocial done yet.

43
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

44
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. Yay. Okay, so, um, let's talk about what are some of the things that you want to work on why you're engaged with right heart.

45
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.550
Amanda's: I told you last week about um

46
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.030
Amanda's: Be bossy, or

47
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.150
Amanda's: Or I'm like, go get this and say, being demanding or like rude.

48
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.880
Amanda's: I can, I can nicely. But, you know, take me a while to come up with it when I could use it when it comes to me. Sometimes it is rude.

49
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.030
Amanda's: That's not what I'm trying to be anybody knows me, I'm not rude, but there's people who don't know me.

50
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so basically your approach is what you want to work on communication skills.

51
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:21.960
Amanda's: Yeah, I mean, I'm good with that. But I mean, if something comes out. I'm going to say what comes to my mind right away, not sit down and think about the nice way to scan or sometimes I'll ask my wife was that rude, like a little bit. I said I could have said it like this after the fact.

52
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

53
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.270
Amanda's: Thought about it for a while. This may take me a while to think about how it can say that nice, they don't forget what I'm trying to say.

54
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:39.690
Amanda's: Yeah, they look on my mind. But I don't mean to be rude, but even I've noticed that I'm rude like me or not in a mood, but that was group.

55
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

56
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.740
So,

57
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.010
Amanda's: Know that I wasn't being trying to be rude.

58
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right. It's just your approach and you know really kind of being willing to

59
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think before you respond to people is going to be, you know, part of the

60
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:12.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Solution. You know what I mean. Take a few minutes before instead of just popping off with what you want to you know what's in your head and what you want to say, you know,

61
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.470
Amanda's: I'm saying I don't really notice that it's really until I actually comes out.

62
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.130
Right.

63
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.770
Amanda's: So I don't know if it doesn't come out kind of like

64
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.090
Amanda's: I don't review things in my head before I say, you know what I mean, it's just

65
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.450
Yeah.

66
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:43.140
Amanda's: I don't know how people can come back with jokes really fast, but I can't do that. I know I have to really think about things. Afterwards, or I'll remember a lot of things like, Oh man, I should is bad or or I should have done this or

67
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.240
Amanda's: That I thought about it a little bit.

68
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And so, wanting to get out of the afterthought, but more in the forethought

69
00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.690
Amanda's: Yeah, like, I don't know how to hurry up and think about it right away, cuz I don't know that it's going to be rude until after

70
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.540
Amanda's: It come out and I've said it or what I'm texting, like, oh, he reaches that rude.

71
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.090
Amanda's: And she's like, Yeah, let's change it.

72
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.510
Amanda's: So if I'm sitting there and I'm typing or texting and yet I noticed before but not when it comes out of my mouth.

73
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can always start the conversation with you know i hope this doesn't come out rude, but

74
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know what you know another way to say it, and then say what you you know were originally going to say

75
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I mean that's one way to prepare somebody beforehand and give them

76
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the warning, so they don't take offense to it and know that you're trying to communicate with them in a manner that you know isn't rude.

77
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

78
00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. That's one way to do it is just getting into practice of saying, you know, you know, I want to tell you something, but

79
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I don't know how to say it in a manner that I'm hoping that you don't take offense to it. So I'm just going to say it, you know.

80
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then just say it and say, you know, if it sounded rude or if I came off route. You know I never meant to. I just want to be honest with yet and I don't know any other way to give you, honesty, because sometimes honestly is not pretty.

81
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you know

82
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.100
Amanda's: Are you at home this week.

83
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It might hurt. Yeah.

84
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.330
Amanda's: Yeah, everybody is huh

85
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

86
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.960
Amanda's: You guys are you guys are lucky or worse in us, are you

87
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where are you at

88
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.110
Amanda's: I'm in New Mexico.

89
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, I'm in Sacramento. Yeah.

90
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.470
Amanda's: I noticed is different. The other place with like an office this room looks like an office but at home. Yeah.

91
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.350
Amanda's: I could tell that way. I don't know how that how that made any sense but

92
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.250
Amanda's: I could tell other places work. Yeah.

93
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, we're, we're working from home, which is, you know, a great thing.

94
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.890
Amanda's: That you have a job that you're able to do that.

95
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I definitely feel that it's a gift. Definitely.

96
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely like getting up and going into my office versus getting up and go, having to drive 3045 minutes and you know go to work for

97
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our so you know makes a difference.

98
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.000
Amanda's: Going from listening to

99
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, sometimes you know when you're in the habit and you like to get out of the house, a lot then

100
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's definitely the way to go.

101
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:42.990
You know,

102
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it just depends.

103
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.910
Amanda's: Yeah right now.

104
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, very much. How are you handling.

105
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.540
Amanda's: It also social skills to use

106
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.880
Amanda's: Your access other people when you're at work when you don't leave you don't really nobody

107
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:00.840
Yeah.

108
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do, though, that's a great thing. I get to see people all day long.

109
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like having yeah

110
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I still get to, but I see where you're where you're coming from. If I didn't work from home, it would definitely be

111
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I didn't have this interaction, I would go crazy. Yeah, you're right.

112
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.480
Amanda's: A lot of you I don't go anywhere. I don't really talk to anybody. So it doesn't bother me.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.020
Amanda's: I can think of it right now.

153
00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.070
Okay.

154
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.830
Amanda's: Real easy to. It's like he's just been a cadet train it like

155
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.390
Amanda's: A teacher. There's another word, I'll think about it.

156
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like a sergeant.

157
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.960
Amanda's: Already started but it's one of those ones where do they stay on the base and you always go to them. They don't ever deployed anymore.

158
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.730
Amanda's: It's not, it's not good at school. It's a

159
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.410
Amanda's: I'd have to look it up. I'll remember it for you next time.

160
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.460
Okay.

161
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.450
Amanda's: Perfect already been sitting there 10 years already.

162
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

163
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.930
Amanda's: He's making a career out of it.

164
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:52.470
Amanda's: Is just another job for him. Like it was especially intelligence, the first five years and then he went and get the drone, second by

165
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:59.610
Amanda's: Uh huh. Yeah, he gets his other we're going to finish the chain again like we did the very first tape.

166
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

167
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.100
Amanda's: It's a whole nother job.

168
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:11.130
Amanda's: Oh, wow. So it's his where he stays in that uniform like a white uniform all day long and they come to him for things

169
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:21.870
Amanda's: He's literally going to stay on base. Now, now, where he deploys or is it really going to go to work to teach. He's gonna go to school to that's his job is to go to school.

170
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sounds like a pretty good job.

171
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.980
Amanda's: Yeah he does a great job. I'm going to get paid to school.

172
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He

173
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: doesn't get better than that.

174
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.120
Amanda's: Yes. When you originally joy for was helping the GI Bill

175
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.710
Amanda's: But doing all the stuff that they have with us. You're trying to go to school was really hard.

176
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:54.330
Amanda's: You did actually get some credits, but he's ranked up pretty fast, too. So it was hard. He had to like go to work, go to his room and steady.

177
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.860
Amanda's: Go and then he didn't really spend time with his family. But then he was deploying

178
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.680
Amanda's: used to play a lot and his family.

179
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, how many kids as young

180
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As two boys well

181
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.230
Amanda's: He said he's selfish. You don't want no more.

182
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.280
Amanda's: Selfish at all. You just want to have more kids.

183
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.120
Amanda's: He didn't really want anybody does not regretting the one the as you just, that's it.

184
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense. You know, sounds like somebody that knows what he wants, you know,

185
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.870
Amanda's: Exactly who is

186
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.550
Amanda's: He say that just like I don't want kids, but let's say he doesn't love those ones. But if you've not had any heat have been okay

187
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm. Yeah, some people are like that. They just are. Yeah. Well, that's

188
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.280
Amanda's: Why would you want to have to have any kids depend on you if you didn't want it like that. It's not selfish.

189
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I don't think it is either

190
00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.970
Amanda's: He thought it was

191
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:06.030
Amanda's: Some people is, he's a great father. It's just some people don't want to do it.

192
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.260
Yes.

193
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many other

194
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many other kids do you have

195
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.130
Amanda's: I have two boys and a little girl.

196
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

197
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.250
Amanda's: My other son is 25

198
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:26.010
Amanda's: And 2220 1623 and my daughter will be 20

199
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, all groan. Yep.

200
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.620
Amanda's: I've grown a only have two grandbabies

201
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yet there's still time right

202
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.690
Amanda's: Yeah. The other ones are with anybody. They're not within a relationship.

203
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

204
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.040
Amanda's: And they don't have RANDOM KIDS FROM OTHER GIRLS THAT THEY'RE NOT with before.

205
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.950
Amanda's: You know you haven't had babies from like different baby mamas. Yeah.

206
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.990
Amanda's: I hope I don't have any of those. But if I do, I do, but

207
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:08.970
Amanda's: They just haven't had the right girl just my other son was with this girl for like four years, but she had kids.

208
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.720
Amanda's: So I think that was why

209
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

210
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kids definitely makes a difference. Don't they

211
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.880
Amanda's: Yeah, they do.

212
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.190
Amanda's: Everything like

213
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:30.510
Amanda's: Even if other people have kids, I'm pretty sure they were thinking about having kids because there's already kid. Yeah.

214
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm pretty sure that wasn't even on the table, or maybe it was or

215
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.480
Amanda's: Whatever they were doing. They were obviously using protection. You know what I mean.

216
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, being smart.

217
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:47.160
Amanda's: And then my other son. He got with this girl when she was pregnant, she still had hadn't had her baby.

218
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.010
Amanda's: And I drove her to the hospital and all that Naylor begin with. They were together like two years.

219
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.740
Amanda's: So I'm pretty sure they weren't talking about sex, either. I mean a baby. You know what I mean to you.

220
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.760
Amanda's: And I can guess the reason why I haven't had their babies. Just because they've already met somebody with

221
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.530
Amanda's: People around here that I was finding

222
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, they'll get ready when they're ready. They will maybe they won't not okay to you know that's what

223
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.730
Amanda's: You want to, but I'm glad that we got to see it was somebody else's

224
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.870
Amanda's: You got to see it first and not be struggling and be like, Oh, I'm leaving.

225
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:28.890
Yeah.

226
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.950
Amanda's: They also got to see how it was with other kids before it was their own

227
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense

228
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.390
Yeah.

229
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: definitely got training before. A lot of people don't get that.

230
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.700
Amanda's: And then they get overwhelmed and an end up leaving their spouse. Yeah.

231
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Too much

232
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.480
Amanda's: And I gotta go. Yeah, like that you should stay, no matter how hard to get

233
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.700
Amanda's: The mom doesn't get to leave all those know moms have left, but not very many. But

234
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.110
Amanda's: Because my cousin, he's raising his daughter.

235
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.640
Amanda's: She's a little bit out there. She's little hyper with the mom just didn't want a baby she left

236
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.550
Amanda's: In my cousin married her, and she came back. Four months later he left again.

237
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:30.930
Amanda's: She came back. She left again. He said, You know what, you're not coming back. I'm the worst thing you got full custody of his daughter, she would say, I'm not ready to be a mom.

238
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.630
And she didn't

239
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:41.820
Amanda's: I was like, wow, and he kept her like you don't really see Dad do that very much.

240
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, you don't.

241
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.410
Amanda's: Pass them off to the mom or the dad or

242
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.950
Amanda's: They go into custody of the state and

243
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.030
Amanda's: She wasn't ready to be a mom and she literally just picked up in LA.

244
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: LA. Wow.

245
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.200
Amanda's: She lucky that he stayed with her. She could have lost the baby.

246
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so.

247
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.670
Amanda's: Very much so. He's already like five years old now, but

248
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.110
Amanda's: My, my aunt helps out a lot. She works he's

249
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.130
Amanda's: Like he runs a restaurant. So when he goes pic certifications that was

250
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice.

251
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:30.660
Amanda's: Not his mom is her Mom's Mom to help my, my friend, Gina. My, my, and I hope

252
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.330

253
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.160
Amanda's: For great grip.

254
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice.

255
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything's okay with

256
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With you and your wife.

257
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:54.390
Amanda's: Yeah, okay, good. She, her stores still open, she works in 30 miles away from where we live in a little like rule town.

258
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.230
Yeah.

259
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.770
Amanda's: And they were thinking about closing it down because it's not real busy like there's a casino and

260
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:09.630
Amanda's: It's just kind of like a piece off of Albuquerque. And I don't know if you know what it is. It's called Bernal Leo.

261
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:26.460
Amanda's: So if there's stuff out there like you know there's finally a Walmart and stuff like that. But there wasn't before, but there's just not that much people there. Now the casinos not fair Aug casinos voluntarily shut down with what's going on so

262
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.990
Amanda's: It's not very busy there, so they actually changed her hours from 10 to seven. She's the one who works now.

263
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:42.060
Amanda's: Oh, wow. So is thinking about closing her down and bringing her back in Albuquerque where there's other stores.

264
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.330
Amanda's: But they making enough money, I guess, keep it open, so

265
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

266
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.080
Amanda's: That's really please, she goes to work.

267
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.690
Amanda's: And if we need stuff along the way, she'll stop instead of us going together.

268
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.470
Amanda's: Uh huh. On the way coming home.

269
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.760
Amanda's: And she passed the stores a lot of stores on the way home. So

270
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.270
Amanda's: No need for both of us to go out, which is already out there.

271
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that makes it nice.

272
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.950

333
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.480
Amanda's: You need to get one.

334
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.980
Amanda's: Tomorrow, if you call me that.

335
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.260
It was my doctor

336
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.710
Amanda's: Yeah, I haven't had a meeting with him at all.

337
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll see him yet 130

338
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And what he does. I'll give you kind of run down at the meeting, but

339
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:37.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Him and I go into the zoom room together, we get everybody in the group to come in. He checks in with you guys. He checks in with you and ask you if you need a refill. How you feeling any effects.

340
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From the medication that you're on any suicide thoughts. Any Hauser, anxiety, depression, that kind of stuff. Any physical issues.

341
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you experiencing from the medication or you think it's from the medication.

342
00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:05.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then he'll discuss it a little bit. And it's good information for everybody to hear in case they're having the same symptoms, but don't know or realize that the from it's from the medication.

343
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:14.940
Amanda's: And lady had told me I was sure rebel, go to the methadone, we go to the doctor room by ourselves about it. We're kind of just a number.

344
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:25.230
Amanda's: And I had asked her, do we talk to everybody, like, do I want everybody in my sessions. Yeah, I see why did I would think that you would want to share your thoughts with everybody.

345
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.330
Amanda's: Just because you never know. Maybe the same way you are. They don't know

346
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.660
Amanda's: Yeah, over there. We weren't a lot of talk about like

347
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.920
Amanda's: We're just the number over there. It's just was weird, but

348
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.270
Amanda's: I

349
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Better to talk to other people.

350
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.090
Because

351
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:54.870
Amanda's: Some people are the same. And some people aren't you never know. Yeah. And you talk to them outside when you get outside the clinic, you have like a couple minutes streetcar you can't hang out talking

352
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:06.750
Amanda's: And I'm just got user, Greg. If they don't sell in Europe doing this weekend deals. I understand that, too. But what if you wanted to talk about stuff about really the program. They don't know

353
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.320
Amanda's: You know what to call it over the only one person and that's

354
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

355
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.750
Amanda's: That's new. Yeah.

356
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.180
Amanda's: Like I was crazy.

357
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that is, that's different. And that's for sure.

358
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:31.410
Amanda's: How do we shared account I ever talked to you ever struggling with addiction. So how have you really been no one's talking about

359
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You do ask. Oh, you don't know you, because you didn't ask him.

360
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:50.790
Amanda's: I didn't ask really tell you that kind of stuff. I didn't know I could ask you if you were on drugs or be if it's like some people tell you, Oh, I've been there. I know how it is. Some people counselors will come off and tell you that

361
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:57.180
Amanda's: Is some low. You know what I mean. I just think it was appropriate for me to ask. So I never did.

362
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:14.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you can. You definitely have the right to ask any therapist that you're working with, or any doctor what your credentials are or your experience with addiction, you know. You definitely are allowed. I mean, that is your God given right to know who you're working with, you know,

363
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They don't have to be

364
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They don't have to give you our fold athletes.

365
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they don't have to. Yeah, give you specific details, but they can definitely tell you whether or not they've had experience with addiction, whether it's a family member of themselves and they definitely need to provide their credentials as well as well.

366
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:49.080
Amanda's: I'll keep that in mind because it's hard when somebody just goes to school and learn it or they get into thing for 20 years and they actually seen people doing it.

367
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:49.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

368
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.440
Amanda's: And then it's different when they've actually struggled themselves.

369
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It isn't as I know what

370
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.770
Amanda's: You're actually going

371
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I can tell you, kind of therapeutic. Yeah.

372
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is, and it really depends on you know where that person's passion is as well, you know, generally what I found.

373
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that most people that are in this field have either had addiction touch their life or they've lost somebody to addiction or they have lived through it themselves, you know, and that's the general

374
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, somehow or another it sparked that passion with them, you know, how did that happen.

375
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.680
Amanda's: You know, yeah.

376
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So in

377
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In this next week.

378
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some of the things that

379
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would like for you to

380
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be willing to work on is not

381
00:30:49.170 --> 00:31:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you say, but how you say it. And if you can't, then make sure that you either say before you before you give somebody information that you think might be will possibly come through, but let them know that

382
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:15.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not your intent that you had, you know, you want to tell them something and you don't want them to take offense, because you know your work, your work in progress. You're trying to change your approach, you know, and communication.

383
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so knowing you knowing that

384
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You tell them, look, I want to tell you something. But you know, I come off route. Sometimes, and I'm working on that. But you know, I need to tell you this.

385
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And please don't take offense to it. And if you don't remember to do that before. Then do it right after try to remember to do it right after you communicate. Okay.

386
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:49.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just, you know, I'm trying to work on my my communication skills and I realized that I might have came off a little bit rude just now. And that wasn't my intent, you know,

387
00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you give them, you give the other person the information and then they get to choose.

388
00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:13.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, whether they're going to take offense to it. Still, or whether they're going to say, all right, you know, not a big deal, you know. Yeah. And those are really kind of the first steps in order to be able to start changing the way that you communicate with people so that they

389
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They can approach you and they don't feel that you know you're rude or sarcastic or whatever, you know,

390
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

391
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is kind of give them

392
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:36.360
Amanda's: It's just not I worked through the P. I was like, if people would have told me that it doesn't bother me how people tell me because no matter if he's quoted or not. Still, as you see it nicer to me.

393
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:37.950
Amanda's: But

394
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.070
Amanda's: Other people do get offended and I think they do like so I just I want to change.

395
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:45.990
Amanda's: My inbox.

396
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:51.090
