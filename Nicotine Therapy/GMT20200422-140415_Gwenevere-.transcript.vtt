00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel

2
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:42.300
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, just, I just happened to wake up and look at my phone and I seem to cheer text. And I was like, All right, well, I might as well just go ahead and get up and start today.

3
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how's your how's the back and legs and I was hearing a little bit of kind of you're overworking your body recently.

4
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.390
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I just think this is what it is just over

5
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.180
Daniel Guerrero: overworking, you know, trying to, well, you know,

6
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.680
Daniel Guerrero: I had been working my ass off so I can get this race.

7
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.050
Daniel Guerrero: And I mean I did get the race, but I didn't get what I was hoping for. But I did get some so

8
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.290
Daniel Guerrero: It was kind of encouragement. No, it's just encourages me to push a little bit harder. You know, so

9
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.550
Daniel Guerrero: And if I don't do it. Nobody's going to do it so

10
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.840
Daniel Guerrero: Just another reason for him to know now, you give me a racing couple more weeks or something.

11
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:42.240
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, because the company is doing really well you know we're doing. Yeah, we're a burger place. You know, so that's killing us don't even really like fast food is more like dying in food, you know,

12
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.220
Daniel Guerrero: But, uh,

13
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.400
Daniel Guerrero: We're doing really well because everywhere else is closed and close by. You can't go to like

14
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.290
Daniel Guerrero: He can't go inside and even any restaurant clovers. No.

15
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.700
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if it's like that over there where you're at.

16
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I don't go anywhere but Costco and Publix and pharmacy, yo.

17
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know.

18
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.590
Daniel Guerrero: And so

19
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:26.850
Daniel Guerrero: Our restaurants, kind of like designed so you can pull up and we don't have a dining area. So what you do is just kind of pull up know have a car. What comes out basically like Sonic I don't know if you know what Sonic is

20
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.380
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, so basically same concept, except you don't press the button. You know, we have

21
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.810
Daniel Guerrero: A car, how it comes to you.

22
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:51.360
Daniel Guerrero: And at that time, you know, you could dine in basically in your car, you know, and we will bring you food like entrees. But now, just everything goes you know to go so

23
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:06.420
Daniel Guerrero: Like, there's a couple businesses in town that are still open, but there's not a business like ours, it's open, where you can get, like, for example, homemade food. So because we do everything from scratch.

24
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.310
Daniel Guerrero: And so it kind of

25
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: See kind of liking that. Because then there's not all this extra contact in a restaurant. So I kind of liked that gig. I can see why it's still doing well.

26
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.830
Daniel Guerrero: And then we're just

27
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.860
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, for us, we're doing

28
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:36.750
Daniel Guerrero: About 5000 a day. So, you know, that's, you know, to 2000 something in the morning and then my shield certain over 2009. So we're saying pretty busy and

29
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.370
Daniel Guerrero: I just honestly just think I'm just overdoing it, you know.

30
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.000
Daniel Guerrero: But they gave me some encouragement you know he gave me a little bit more money and

31
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:59.010
Daniel Guerrero: So it's quite a, quite a bit of encouragement. At the end of the day, it's just, I mean, we're talking just dollars, but those dollars. No add up so

32
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.870
Daniel Guerrero: It helps

33
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So Daniel I have, I have some ideas on a couple of different directions to go with you today.

34
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.060
Daniel Guerrero: All right.

35
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them would be. There's a video I could show you that is just terribly moving

36
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And the intent behind it would be to validate you validate your experience. I can't remember how many years you spent in custody collectively, is it more than five or 10 like how many alternate together.

37
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.750
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, the most I've ever done in one chunk is by like a

38
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.270
Daniel Guerrero: By 20 months, I think.

39
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So not a lot of. Not a lot.

40
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.990
Daniel Guerrero: But

41
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If you put all the time together. How many years or months. Would you say collective

42
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.440
Daniel Guerrero: Oh well, five and a half.

43
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm not sure if he would relate to this video, but you might I know I was. I've got a few clients that some of them aren't in the program anymore. But I think about y'all, and I think

44
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I would love to have right heart health and prison.

45
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.090
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, right.

46
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a little glimpse into how how that would look in a way

47
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel good for you. If it would be like I yeah I'm not alone. There are other people that are feeling this. That's one thing.

48
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't prepare it so it's sitting in a text.

49
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So it might take me a second to pull up

50
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The other one. Maybe I can be pulling that up and you could be doing something else to set up for another piece which is the

51
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: The installing of positive

52
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Cognition, any chance. Okay. Couple of tall.

53
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.320
Daniel Guerrero: Already have it.

54
00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so if you want, what I'll do is I'm just going to look over here if it takes me more than a couple minutes all I'll put a pin in it and I'll do it another time. But I'm thinking, I think, I think I know where it's sitting. I just have to just try and get there.

55
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Higher Self.

56
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

57
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: An image.

58
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Me try on on my phone.

59
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So something I was considering bringing into a group

60
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But

61
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone was

62
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Late

63
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean I I really liked it. I mean, but then I've worked with this pot, you know, oh yeah, let me see if I can find it on the internet. It's called

64
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: See them. Yo, it's called step into step inside

65
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: See if I can find it right quick.

66
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, share my screen.

67
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Up here, let me just make sure we got the right thing here.

68
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Face their path.

69
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: With compassion.

70
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a yes. Can you hear her. Okay.

71
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we're here to face or compact our cast with compassion. You can hear it because she's got kind of crunchy crunchy little voice, but she's obviously trying to protect it to a lot of people out there. Okay.

72
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: During your first 18 years of life.

73
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: As a parent, or other adult in the household often or very often would swear it to insult you put you down or humiliate you step inside the circle.

74
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: As a parent, or other adults in the household often or very often flushed grabs or through something at you step inside the circle.

75
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: If a parent or other adults in the household often or very often ever hitching so hard that you have marks or injured step inside the circle.

76
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you often felt that no one in your family love to or thought you were important or special

77
00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Circle.

78
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family lives in extreme poverty step inside the circle.

79
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Step inside the circle step inside the circle.

80
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Circle.

81
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

82
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I was abused as a young girl I was beaten by my mother. I was currently by my mother. I was sexually abused by another man.

83
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: My father was an alcoholic. My mother was a rage aholic I've driven drunk. I've sold drugs. I was juvenile delinquent probably my story is similar to most of your stories in here I'm white, and I'm female and I didn't. Nothing happened to me so I you know I gotta get out of jail free card.

84
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm here now because I see myself in every one of you I want traumatize child.

85
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Child. My mother was traumatized.

86
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You Karen all this, you've taken it in

87
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a break.

88
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to think about your wife or anything.

89
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.270
No.

90
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: cheater practice.

91
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Squad.

92
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how I learned about

93
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Always asked myself.

94
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Welcome to circle else

95
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But

96
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I look at my childhood. I'm like these people in the jar. Just like there was one step. I should have taken and it didn't take and I saw some of my brothers and my friends, take that step. And I felt like such a coward.

97
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I wasn't brave enough to be there with them when they took that step.

98
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Every round after that I took the most difficult to our traumas kept separate. Long as the conference all standing apart, once we begin to acknowledge our traumas publicly

99
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: About us all closer together and presenting as opposed to showing you things reason we want to do them to walk in a circle and take each step forward was a reminder

100
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To ourselves that we still have the humanity worth love. Most people on our side don't understand. And we want to change. So we can reassign

101
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Better than what we left. I think one of the days and we were shoving that no shame and you had us yelling it out.

102
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It was free and us to

103
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It was point to where when I was looking at that and it was all looking at it in a circle. You can hear that echo no shame.

104
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And that was very calming especially coming from a little late, like

105
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Six months ago. I'm seeing the company.

106
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I like to meet people that understand what's that

107
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do is get one.

108
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Spirits are not violent

109
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Spirits.

110
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.450
Daniel Guerrero: That's pretty powerful.

111
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:45.300
Daniel Guerrero: You know, there's a lot of us, you know that when we're in a prison. You know, there's something that you know we don't we don't face.

112
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:53.400
Daniel Guerrero: And there's even times that out here in this world. We still don't face them you know we we cover them up, you know,

113
00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:00.000
Daniel Guerrero: We cover him up with ink you know we like to eat express how we feel. Well, or what we're saying.

114
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.680
Daniel Guerrero: And so it's pretty powerful. It's pretty tight like that.

115
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Few me to, I think I have a real affinity for it because

116
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I've worked with with

117
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: In felony drunk for those 14 years. And for me, these are

118
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: These are the people that I most comfortable with.

119
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The just so misunderstood in a system that fails them and it fails them again and the system fails again and family failed them and it's just back to back to back failures to

120
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Support that spiritual psychological, emotional growth of a person. And we just keep failing people over and over and over. And it's heartbreaking.

121
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What what stood out to you.

122
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.650
Daniel Guerrero: To me was

123
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:09.180
Daniel Guerrero: You know when you're ready, like these guys were ready to face, you know, their fears, because

124
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:22.680
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I could imagine how hard it was for them to step out you know and and say, I'm ready to, you know, face my fears that you know that has. That's a big step, you know, especially a prison, you know, because you want to put on this.

125
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.110
Daniel Guerrero: macho

126
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.790
Daniel Guerrero: Right. Oh.

127
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:45.720
Daniel Guerrero: So for them to, you know, to even step away from their daily activities inside of their, their daily cream and say, You know what, it's time for me to change. I don't care what you think I'm going to go out here face my fears, you know, face.

128
00:17:47.100 --> 00:18:00.300
Daniel Guerrero: For me, that's, you know, that's pretty powerful because you know it's not easy. It's not easy to do that it's done, easy to walk away from your team and say I want to do something different, because I know that firsthand. You know, because

129
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.570
Daniel Guerrero: Here in New Mexico, you know, they

130
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:13.050
Daniel Guerrero: They the cars. The cars are in cities you know Albuquerque one car Santa Fe's another you know

131
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.310
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm from Texas, you know, so I don't make some people from New Mexico because I'm from Texas in

132
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:27.180
Daniel Guerrero: And in Texas, you know, in New Mexico prison systems were already hated know so

133
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:38.610
Daniel Guerrero: For me to walk away from from my ride in Texas and until my homeboy, say, you know what I'm going to step away from what you're doing and I wanted to do my own thing, you know.

134
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:49.350
Daniel Guerrero: It was pretty tough, you know, they're like, are you really going to do that, you know, you know, we need numbers were already outnumbered and for you to walk away from us.

135
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.560
Daniel Guerrero: Being from Texas, and I was just like,

136
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.650
Daniel Guerrero: You know i don't i don't know what to tell you know I'm saying, but it is what it is. And so

137
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:14.400
Daniel Guerrero: It was difficult for me to do that because I had to have was that, you know, depending on me, you know, because I got my back. I got Texas blasted this big on my back. Like, it's huge blasted said, you know,

138
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:27.840
Daniel Guerrero: I know back in my younger days and I was 28 when I first if the system. I was about it. You know, it's do it, whatever. And so for me to walk away from all that it was, you know, it was a

139
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.050
Daniel Guerrero: It was frightening but the same time, it was, it felt great. You know, so

140
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.150
Daniel Guerrero: That's a cool

141
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Gentleman that says

142
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We're all standing on out in the circle.

143
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Trauma kept us apart right

144
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:49.980
Right.

145
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When we shared it publicly, meaning they took a step in, because you risk it all taking that step right

146
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.660
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

147
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:01.920
look weak.

148
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So, I mean,

149
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: They all stepped in some didn't. But when they stepped in. He says the trauma kept us apart when we shared it publicly

150
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It brought us closer physically. I mean, that was such a great way they put it when we shared it, which means you letting go of shame when we shared it we fit. They physically stepped in and became closer and then in that last circle when when they're talking right

151
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what was powerful for me was

152
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The guy owning the fact that there was one that didn't step in, he still sad and shame. It didn't step in and he was like

153
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then he saw other people moving in and he said, Okay, I need everybody's got the courage and then that bolstered his courage to move in.

154
00:20:54.630 --> 00:21:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And acknowledge, basically it's a yes when you took a step in. It was a yes i was physically, emotionally abused. I mean, it was a yes that's a yes answer without saying it. They said, Yes, yes, yes. Yeah.

155
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Me too. Me too, me too.

156
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.370
Daniel Guerrero: And that's a little bit of our problem is nowadays is

157
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:29.730
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I say we because I'm talking about convicts, you know, and because I can relate to them so much. And that's our problem sometimes is that, you know, we're afraid to step into that circle and admit

158
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:42.510
Daniel Guerrero: That, you know, these are some of the heartbreaks that we have. You know what I mean. Because you know growing up, my whole life. I was told that I was going to amount to shit, you know, my whole life. I was told I was never going to be shit.

159
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.980
Daniel Guerrero: And you know that's something deep so again real deep and

160
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.400
Daniel Guerrero: Whenever you go to face those fears is like, do you want to expose this you know to other people know. Do you want to

161
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.500
Daniel Guerrero: And so

162
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.490
Daniel Guerrero: I can relate to where they're coming from, by not stepping into that circle because they're like, not me.

163
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.910
Daniel Guerrero: But in the end, they're like, Yeah, me too. You know, so I get that.

164
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're left with that's that's a start, we say, okay, by sharing it publicly I abolished the shame or it's the beginning, it's a start to getting rid of Shame. Shame. Shame is a pretty resistant experience. But then what

165
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What do they do because now they have exposed the underbelly right now. What, how does the healing move forward.

166
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's kind of what I want to work on with you.

167
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I need to get a little note open for us today. Okay.

168
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:52.830
All right.

169
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I started, I got one started

170
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to introduce to Georgia.

171
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.980

172
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.280

Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do some installing a positive energy and imagery with you.

175
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I just get a sense that those objects are about from the palm of your hand.

176
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so even when you sit back that adds

177
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you set this

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: With the earth.

Gwenevere Abriel: Expanding that awareness outside this room across the state and around the planet.

229
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being present with the vastness of the connection and the gravitational pull, that's pulling you consistently to the center through gravity.

230
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And breathing again into that.

231
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Allow that gravity to pull through those shoulders. Notice it maybe for the first time, is it pulls those shoulders down to the center of the earth.

232
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a part of that.

233
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Keeping your eyes closed. I'm going to bring up some imagery for you. And I'd like you to hold it in your awareness.

Gwenevere Abriel: To be at a protective figure this sense of grandma being around her.

237
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.340

238
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a sense of protection safety a safe haven.

239
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only was grandma protective figure. She also hosts the qualities of nurturing figure

242
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And a sense of my heaven.

243
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also Grandma as a figure of wisdom.

245
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring that imagery in to your awareness and you as well being present with her.

247
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That visualization

248
00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: clear in your mind.

Gwenevere Abriel: And when it is

250
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Open your eyes and at the pace that I set with my hand. Let's look at the tops of those objects.

251
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Just back and forth. Hold the imagery not looking at me looking at the tops of the objects.

252
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.970

255
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Other thoughts may come and go, but your work is to bring those images.

Gwenevere Abriel: To skin.

Gwenevere Abriel: To that gravity, maybe

267
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever comes up is just right. You're doing a great job.

268

285
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna go with that. So you go with that. And now again.

286
00:37:54.090 --> 00:38:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now whatever comes up uncensored when I check in a little later. So going with that piece being still.

287
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Free of worry

288
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't need to look at me, just the tops of the objects. The pace will stay the same.

289
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great.

290
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: tuning into

291
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you just paying attention to you.

292
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

293
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the tops of the objects just one than the other. No need to stop in the middle.

294
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the left right that's needed not me. I'm out of the peripheral vision.

295
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Just blue top

296
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together.

297
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale and exhale, letting it all go

298
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just noticed the first thought that crosses your mind. But first awareness Uncensored. What is that

299
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you notice the peace.

300
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.290
Daniel Guerrero: Kind. Notice it in my heart, you know,

301
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.210
Daniel Guerrero: This

302
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.420
Daniel Guerrero: Mind, a little bit.

303
00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: On the actual bilateral stimulation. Want to make sure that you're not stopping in the middle and checking on me.

304
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little hard for me to see. I want to make sure we're we're being effective be noticing, you're only looking blue cap blue cap blue cap, you know, to linger in the middle.

305
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: your peripheral vision will manage the pace, it'll pick up on what I'm doing and I announce it will stay the same.

306
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

307
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so you notice the peace in the heart. And then the mind.

308
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other thoughts or beliefs kind of wander through

309
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.340
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, for me it just kind of like

310
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:44.340
Daniel Guerrero: Just showed how how simple, you know, it is, you know, just to find that that area, you know,

311
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.430
Daniel Guerrero: Know, just a little bit of concentration, you know, you can find that area of

312
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.390
Daniel Guerrero: That piece, you know, instead of IT ALWAYS BEEN chaotic or, you know, has been

313
00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.490
Daniel Guerrero: So,

314
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.280
Daniel Guerrero: For me, I just like you just take a few seconds to focus few seconds to

315
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.840
Daniel Guerrero: You know, take these breasts and stuff.

316
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.740
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you can find that area and so

317
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.250
Daniel Guerrero: It's hard for me. It's hard for me to have that, you know, it's hard for me to find that area.

318
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That simple concentration that leads to peace, that is hard for you. Right. Okay. We're going to do another iteration, which means same thing. So go with that.

319
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Means go without meaning you focus on whatever it is you just said.

320
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great.

321
00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness of things going on in your environment will come and go, then tune back in

322
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune into you.

323
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

324
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you right now.

325
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to censor don't summarize. Just tell me what you're thinking.

326
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:39.540
Daniel Guerrero: I just, I just think it. I wish people could change their, you know, attitude, you know, change the way they think think the way they talk

327
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that.

328
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right straight centers look straight with your head straight and then we want the ice left and right.

329
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going with that. Great job. Outstanding.

330
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

331
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Left and right on the Jessica tops of those containers.

332
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale

333
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Without censoring

334
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up.

335
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.650
Daniel Guerrero: Guys, nothing.

336
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.220
Daniel Guerrero: Is focused. I was focused

337
00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So I need to make one adjustment Daniel ready. I can see here's what your eyes are doing. They're going here, and only going on one side or not getting this am I getting by louder. I gotta make a slight change.

338
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm suspecting and Mike because you might not be centered in front of the objects that let me just see.

339
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:16.950
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

340
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be a slight adjustment won't be a big one. It will be a subtle one but your eyes will feel going, you may need to pull those objects apart just slightly because I need this. See how am I going left and right.

341
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:32.700
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

342
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. You need to be more centered with them.

343
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.990
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe, maybe I'm just having to close together. Let me pull this table.

344
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Slightly maybe

345
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: 1720 inches apart. Not sure. Maybe that might do it on you. You have to be centered

346
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, this takes a lot of effort but i don't i don't have

347
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I can't do it for anybody.

348
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.980
Daniel Guerrero: Right, I get it.

349
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great, though, you just won't reap the benefits of the reprocessing part if we don't have the bilateral piece.

350
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if you're centered because right now you are slightly off to the left. So maybe you move your chair over

351
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that Ellen is just turning. Okay, so let me see your eyes look at the top of the of the containers.

352
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that feel like it's more left and right now with your adjustment.

353
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:38.580
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

354
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it

355
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.150
Daniel Guerrero: A little bit further apart now than

356
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.450
Daniel Guerrero: They were like this.

357
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.030
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah. Yes. So,

358
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:53.880
Daniel Guerrero: I just don't have

359
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I really am I dead center between those two things.

360
00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:58.890
You smell.

361
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And that phone if you if your nose that phone that you're looking at is right in front of your face.

362
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:08.370
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

363
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it slightly off to the left. Well,

364
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.530
Daniel Guerrero: So if I go this way, then you're on.

365
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. Okay, so we're good right there. Stop right there. Perfect. Okay. All right.

366
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring back. I wish people could change.

367
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to hold that

368
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there, and then bring up imagery of grandma was a protective the nurturing and the wise. Okay.

369
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna go with that you're going to try to hold those two things in your awareness. It does take effort she just see the piece that's really important is when I check in and I say what's coming up for you.

370
00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go summarize for granted here. Tell me what you're thinking. And I might as well do it at different times, because I want to catch what's happening right now.

371
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just thought my dog. Oh, I just thought, what a little turkey. He is or. Oh, I hate this. I love this. Or, oh my gosh, I'm having this feeling the work for you is to not censor non summarize what you think I want to hear.

372
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's whatever coming up. That's the part I want to know about won't be able to get into some some deeper things if you're summarizing what you think is kind of a fancy way to explain some

373
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I love that you said earlier, nothing. Right. Nothing was coming up. I was really focusing on just, yeah. So this is where the hard work is. And so we're going to go back to it again. It's

374
00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish people could change and pulling together with it this imagery of grandma with nurturing with protection and wisdom.

375
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to hold those in your awareness.

376
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Together in house with the nose.

377
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale out the mouth.

378
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting your mind go blank for even a beat.

379
00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then becoming aware of what shows up what sensation. What thought what imagery and you could share that with me.

380
00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:51.240
Daniel Guerrero: Over me is it

381
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.430
Daniel Guerrero: Again, it's the way it's the way people act like

382
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.980
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know, I just I just feel like that, uh,

383
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:11.100
Daniel Guerrero: People are always on their bullshit. You know, for either attention or

384
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.460
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know where that's coming from, you know, it's just

385
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that go with that.

386
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: People up front. Okay, I got you always with their bullshit you go with that hold that in your awareness and bring in weave it in

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you right now.

394
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.890
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, as I was thinking about it was biblical

395
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:39.300
Daniel Guerrero: Know comes out of relations, chapter six, it says pay attention to your own work, so that you can be satisfied by Job well done.

396
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.340
Daniel Guerrero: No.

397
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To

Daniel Guerrero: You pay attention to what you got going on, you know, worry about nobody else

400
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling out what a lot. Let's go with that.

401
00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that hold that up there in your awareness. Hold it.

402
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathe into the truth of that.

403
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You are going with right there.

Gwenevere Abriel: All that out out out out out out out

407
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let the mind go blank for even a moment.

408
00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that quietness, the space between the thoughts space between the notes.

409
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: tuning in, we come to a close today just scan the body that same Superman scan, maybe starting with the feet.

410
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: The toes, the ankles scanning up Achilles heel.

411
00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The calf, the knees hamstrings quadriceps seat bones or guts or stomach chest

412
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Her breath, our shoulders.

413
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And forget the hands and arms.

414
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: For through shoulders.

415
00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Larynx insurance, where we eat right we swallow and we breathe in our neck.

416
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And our jaw.

417
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: your cheekbones and maybe into the ears, just tuning in, seeing if there's any charge left knee is sockets in the forehead and up to the top of the head.

418
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And final breath.

419
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to where they're still charge or maybe there's none. I don't know. You tell me.

420
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you notice

421
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.170
Daniel Guerrero: This relaxation, you know,

422
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.810
Daniel Guerrero: From the last

423
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:49.500
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just pay attention to what you're doing. And so that you can be satisfied. You know, it's just from there. It's just like, it's just relaxing, you know,

424
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:56.580
Daniel Guerrero: Because sometimes I just feel like you're not too worried about the way other people are conducting themselves or worried about

425
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:02.700
Daniel Guerrero: You know how I feel about them as my opinion towards them know

426
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know, pretty, pretty blunt guy, you know, and so

427
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.390
Daniel Guerrero: I'm just going to step away from that a little bit and just worry about me, you know,

450
00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't take anything personally nothing others do, is because of you. What other say and do is a projection of their own reality right as soon as you see someone's lips moving. That's their story.

451
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Don't worry about their story. They got it. They're going to have their own storyline, you have your own perception. Hold on tight to that. Hold on tight don't abandon yourself. Don't abandon your intuition. Your awareness, your truth.

452
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you will be the victim of needless suffering.

Gwenevere Abriel: Don't make assumptions, find the courage to ask questions and to ask to express what you really want.

454
00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I really want reassurance. I really want a hug. I really want to just chill right let's not let's not get angry like people are supposed to know that. Let's ask

455
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And always do your best, your personal best your personal best might be tired.

464
00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your relationship with yourself, your relationship with with others, taking kind of complex things like what you were talking about in the Bible. And in this puts it in a really simple format.

473
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:29.790
