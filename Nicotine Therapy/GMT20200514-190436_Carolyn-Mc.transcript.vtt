Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, it's just like doing IP and cocaine is more like Steve Ballmer

104
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.550
Carolyn McCarter Wood: tells me it's like doing an opiate and cocaine. Right. Yeah.

105
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.030
Right.

106
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.000
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Um, so

107
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:46.170
Carolyn McCarter Wood: So shall we gotta, I gotta trash mouth. Okay, we

108
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.040
Jeffrey Cannon: Started to

109
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.420
Jeffrey Cannon: Narcos a lot like your phone.

110
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.790
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay, so, yeah.

111
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:04.380
Carolyn McCarter Wood: So you said that one of the things that's holding you up is, is your car. What's the deal with that.

112
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:08.670
Jeffrey Cannon: I'm

113
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:18.450
Jeffrey Cannon: I'm working on trauma and get enough gas money to go get it. My dad says type minute go get it. But I got, I have the gas money to go down and get it.

114
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.310
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Because it's. Is it just had a gas or do you need the money for your dad.

115
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:32.220
Jeffrey Cannon: I needed the money for my dad's gas. The car broke down.

116
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.090
Jeffrey Cannon: The road Syrians stripped out and

117
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.920
Jeffrey Cannon: So what my

118
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.700
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah, and so

119
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.990
Carolyn McCarter Wood: How could that get. I mean, like, I guess I'm wondering, What good's it to you, wherever it is.

120
00:19:54.390 --> 00:20:13.140
Jeffrey Cannon: Because when I get out he's he's gonna save up the money to pay to fix it and I've got. I mean, I've got the habit to work. So if I even if I stay out or don't go in, but that mark or I can't go anywhere, do anything because nobody else on time.

121
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.800
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah, okay.

122
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.990
Carolyn McCarter Wood: So,

123
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.280
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Ditch just getting the money to get the car.

124
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.980
Carolyn McCarter Wood: That's holding me back from like you could go in today. Right.

125
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:30.750
Jeffrey Cannon: Right.

126
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.420
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah, huh, yeah.

127
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.980
Jeffrey Cannon: They wanted me to go in today.

128
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:43.500
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah, I kind of want you to go in today to cause I'm kind of on board with you being a little scared about accidentally dying.

129
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.170
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah.

130
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.390
Jeffrey Cannon: And my dad. He don't he don't understand

131
00:20:52.470 --> 00:21:00.930
Jeffrey Cannon: He's never been on my level of shooting or doing anything he's he's old school. He was born in 1960

132
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:02.370
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Right.

133
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.680
Jeffrey Cannon: He don't a smart way but he don't understand. You know what I'm going through

134
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.270
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Right. Right. And he may be doesn't understand the danger.

135
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.220
Jeffrey Cannon: Right.

136
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.480
Right.

137
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.120
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah.

138
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:25.110
Jeffrey Cannon: He knows he knows if I keep on that I'm gonna be dead or in jail or some, but he just

139
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:35.340
Jeffrey Cannon: It. Hey, don't let it affect him because you don't want to lose what he's got so he just gets up and goes to work every day and pretty much

140
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:48.540
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah, so he's kinda sounds like he's kind of maybe put a little bit of a wall up so he doesn't get hurt bit for you. That feels really lonely.

141
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.480
Jeffrey Cannon: Right.

142
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.780

Carolyn McCarter Wood: What makes you

145
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:12.120
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Is there any possibility. So are you telling me that you're certain that if you went ahead and went in today that you would lose your car.

146
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.030
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, cuz he don't know where sat in Wilson.

147
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.780
Jeffrey Cannon: Uh huh. And I guess without me. He don't want to get it.

148
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.340
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay. And is your dad. Your only support.

149
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.810

Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, bring her down, not have a hierarchy and and it came. I came from Missouri geese.

216
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.270
Carolyn McCarter Wood: The term.

217
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.790
Carolyn McCarter Wood: DSS got involved.

218
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:13.830
Carolyn McCarter Wood: What happened.

219
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.530

Jeffrey Cannon: On the Ark daughter.

222
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:32.550
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I don't want to be flippant about it, but I'm just going to tell you the truth that cars come and go, but there's only one Jeffrey cannon. Okay.

223
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.930
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Well, like

224
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:47.130
Carolyn McCarter Wood: If you have we're kind of in a life and death situation here. I'm just wondering if it doesn't make more sense. I know that it's hard to think about

225
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.000
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Letting letting that car sit there

226
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.940
Carolyn McCarter Wood: But I think there are way over the

227
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.240
Jeffrey Cannon: Belongs to my dad.

228
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.270
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay, well,

229
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.370
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Then he ought to have fair amount of motivation to get it.

230
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.660
Jeffrey Cannon: Sorry, but if

231
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.430
Jeffrey Cannon: If I don't get up myself. I'm not going to happen. They weren't Leo.

232
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:18.990
Jeffrey Cannon: Either way,

233
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:25.770
Jeffrey Cannon: If I, if I lose the car because I took it down there and it's my responsibility to guide you

234
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.010
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I hear that

235
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.880
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I wonder

236
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:42.330
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I wonder if it makes sense for your would your dad be willing to get on a phone call with the two of us.

237
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.450
Jeffrey Cannon: I'm a might use the word right now.

238
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:49.410
Okay.

239
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.200
Carolyn McCarter Wood: So here's the way I see it, I mean like

240
00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:07.890
Carolyn McCarter Wood: People can live through having no car, people can live through being homeless, but people can't live through being dead.

241
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.690
Carolyn McCarter Wood: You know,

242
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:11.550
Carolyn McCarter Wood: And

243
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.690
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Or we're if you're scared enough

244
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.860
Carolyn McCarter Wood: To be thinking, hey, this is gonna kill me.

245
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.290
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I'm wondering if it might be wise to go ahead and get in there today.

246
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.840
Carolyn McCarter Wood: If

247
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.270
Carolyn McCarter Wood: What do you think

248
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.690
Jeffrey Cannon: I want to. But either way, I don't have no way to get her to die.

249
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.510
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay, so what's it going

250
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.260
Carolyn McCarter Wood: What's, what, what are we going to need to arrange to get you there.

251
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.220
Jeffrey Cannon: I don't know.

252
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.860
Jeffrey Cannon: I don't have last one is car before this same way

253
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.820
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, I had 1000 BMW that allows their birthday. My mom's

254
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.630
Jeffrey Cannon: SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND I GOT A lot like two days later.

255
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:04.590
Yeah.

256
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.600
Jeffrey Cannon: And he lost a car because he didn't have time to go get it.

257
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.100
Carolyn McCarter Wood: And hey,

258
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:18.300
Jeffrey Cannon: already told me that this follows this car here and he don't get it by that I'm not want to have no way of

259
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:19.920
Jeffrey Cannon: Because

260
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.720
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Oh, OK.

261
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.790
Carolyn McCarter Wood: OK, so you're living with him. And he said, I'll kick you out.

262
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.570
Jeffrey Cannon: Right.

263
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.110
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay. All right, so

264
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:47.970
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I'm wondering, what do you think would happen if, when he got home today. You said, Do you call him daddy.

265
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.410
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah.

266
00:30:50.370 --> 00:31:00.090
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Daddy, I talked to my counselor today and she's really afraid that I'm gonna die if I don't get in. If I don't get in somewhere really soon.

267
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:08.880
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Can, can we plan to go down and get the car tomorrow.

268
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:10.500
Carolyn McCarter Wood: And

269
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:19.530
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I mean, like, I know that you said that you need to get the gas money together, but that sounds

270
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.680
Carolyn McCarter Wood: It sounds to me.

271
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:31.380
Carolyn McCarter Wood: It sounds like maybe your dad. It's trying trying to like have a little tough love.

272
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.390
Jeffrey Cannon: Right.

273
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.220
Carolyn McCarter Wood: But is there a way that you could like

274
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:54.240
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Maybe you can say, I will work and do X, Y, or Z in exchange for the gas money. I mean, is there something maybe you could do to work off the gas money.

275
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.400
Can't be that well.

276
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.300
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, I've got part of it and

277
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.490
Jeffrey Cannon: Crying when they get soft work today, we're going to go get the core

278
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.660
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay, great. All right. Okay.

279
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:11.820
Carolyn McCarter Wood: So,

280
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.470
Jeffrey Cannon: With water be Jones will have my bed, more and more. And I'm not trying to go

281
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:27.780
Carolyn McCarter Wood: No, I don't know either. I don't know either. But then, so then, our job is to keep you alive until that bed is available because I'm hearing

282
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.920
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I'm hearing that you really, really.

283
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.740

285
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.150

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.250
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Okay.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:45.960
Carolyn McCarter Wood: So,

288
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:53.910
Carolyn McCarter Wood: I guess the next question is how do we make sure that you stay alive until you can get in the bed.

289
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.140
Jeffrey Cannon: And

290
00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.530
Jeffrey Cannon: Stay away from everybody that I'm not using drugs till I can get them water be Jones.

Carolyn McCarter Wood: And did you lose somebody did you use some of your gas money to get it.

298
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.030
Jeffrey Cannon: No, ma'am. She just came and do some drugs will, may I told her I didn't have the money.

Okay.

303
00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.990

320
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.600
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Not

321
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.100

332
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:50.880
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah. So yeah, maybe. Yeah, I love your idea of not answering the phone, but I love and idea even better of trying to keep the phone from ringing. You might even turn the ringer off your phone, you know,

333
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.400
Jeffrey Cannon: I do that and then I'll miss my call from my wife.

334
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.880
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah, I know. Yeah.

335
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.460
Jeffrey Cannon: Like in this column.

336
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.400
Jeffrey Cannon: Here then turn around and it'll be my wife that I'll have third missed calls from

337
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.500
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah, I gotcha.

338
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:29.400
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Yeah. Well, definitely, I think, asking them not to not to contact you and or and you might even just say I'm not going to be, you know, I'm not gonna be around a little white lie. You know, like, I'm not gonna be around my phone. So try. Don't try to call me or something.

339
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:37.080
Jeffrey Cannon: What up, what I do is I want, I don't want to do drugs and I'm having an okay day

340
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.960
Jeffrey Cannon: I'll go on my phone. And I'll block. How are numbers.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.080
Carolyn McCarter Wood: Block them all. Yeah, I know, I know, but

344
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:50.580
You know,

345
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.370
Carolyn McCarter Wood: The thing is,

346
00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:09.240
Carolyn McCarter Wood: The thing is that we're talking life or death here, and I know that probably sometimes, you know, life doesn't even sound all that good, but you've got these kids right

347
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.070
Carolyn McCarter Wood: And and nobody wants. No kid wants to have to say.

348
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.080
Carolyn McCarter Wood: My dad. He killed himself or my daddy died of an overdose.

349
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.080

Carolyn McCarter Wood: Right, and you are even grown sorta you were young, but you are

356
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.460

358
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.120
