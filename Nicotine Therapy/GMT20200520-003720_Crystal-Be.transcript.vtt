00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.520
Crystal Beal: To hear that and I still totally agree with you. It's probably time to check again.

159
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.630
Jerrod Johnson: And but

160
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:32.940
Crystal Beal: I'm glad you're being safe. And then what about, like any sexually transmitted infections gonorrhea, chlamydia, anything like that.

161
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.380
Jerrod Johnson: Once upon a time, I had chlamydia, long time ago.

162
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.310
Crystal Beal: Okay, and last time you checked for those a couple years ago as well.

168
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.950

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.450
Crystal Beal: Okay, and how how safe and stable, is that right now for you.

182
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.020
Jerrod Johnson: Well, I guess, as soon as they let us off lockdown.

183
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.520
Crystal Beal: Okay, I know some of the counties are starting to like be able to go to phase two. And I think they were going to allow some

184
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.240
Crystal Beal: Like general contracting like you're describing, but it's only like 10 counties out of the state. I think

185
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.810
Crystal Beal: So out of Washington. Yeah. Mm hmm.

186
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.230

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.340
Jerrod Johnson: Not really. I mean,

209
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.860
Jerrod Johnson: Just normal, you know,

210
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.380
Crystal Beal: What's okay

211
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.300
Crystal Beal: When you lay down

212
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.550
Crystal Beal: lay flat. Can you breathe. Okay.

213
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.170
Crystal Beal: Yeah. Great. And then do you wake up in the middle of the night, feeling short of breath.

214
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.460
Crystal Beal: Or Gasol they're

215
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:17.130
Crystal Beal: Great. And then, are you able to like walk up a few flights of stairs without stopping.

216
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.990
Crystal Beal: Oh yeah, okay.

217
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:28.740
Crystal Beal: Okay, um. All right. And then, um, any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea not related to withdraw.

218
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:30.690
Jerrod Johnson: No.

219
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.260
Crystal Beal: Okay, and any pain in your stomach.

220
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:35.970
Jerrod Johnson: No.

221
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:42.540
Crystal Beal: Okay, and any the urinary problems pain in your bladder pain when up

222
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.020
Crystal Beal: Though P real frequently

223
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:57.360
Jerrod Johnson: Sometimes like in the middle of the night I wake up to pee, you know, a couple few times in the night. I don't know how normal that is

224
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:09.450
Crystal Beal: Um, it can be not uncommon as as people with prostates age because your prostates can sometimes get bigger and it can make it a little harder to get your bladder empty.

225
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:16.740
Crystal Beal: And make you a little more sensitive to emptying. And do you feel like when you pee it you can get your bladder all the way empty during the day.

226
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:31.140
Crystal Beal: Yeah yeah and and that's one of those things that getting a regular primary care doctor and like getting your annual checkup and talking about that, to me, like, the best place, probably to do that.

227
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:44.730
Crystal Beal: And there's a blood tests that they do sometimes to check on your prostate and also sometimes they actually examine it, which for some people is not great, because they put a finger and your thumb to feel your prophecy, but

228
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.630
Crystal Beal: It does let you know if it's getting bigger, or if there's any signs of cancer or if there's any signs of infections.

229
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.160
Crystal Beal: But some people choose to bypass that exam and just get the blood test or just try to treatment and that's an option too, sometimes.

230
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.950
Crystal Beal: Um, any, any like discharged from your genitals.

231
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.560
Crystal Beal: Okay, any lumps bumps rashes, or anything like that.

232
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.720
Jerrod Johnson: Um, I do have a cyst on my back. Okay.

233
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.480
Crystal Beal: How about in your general region, though, anything like that.

234
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.860
Jerrod Johnson: No. Oh, no, no.

235
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.090
Crystal Beal: Okay. And then, um, body aches.

236
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.670
Jerrod Johnson: No.

237
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.250
Crystal Beal: Okay. Um so joints or muscle pains or bon pain's not having any of those

238
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:37.890
Crystal Beal: No. Okay. And you said you have the sense but no other rashes, or anything on your body.

239
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.970
Crystal Beal: No. Okay. Any non healing wounds.

240
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.980
Jerrod Johnson: No.

241
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.080
Crystal Beal: Okay, itchy skin anywhere.

242
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:54.060
Crystal Beal: No. Okay. Any HEADACHES, CONFUSION or memory loss. Nope, feeling super thirsty.

243
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:55.830
Jerrod Johnson: Sometimes

244
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.570
Crystal Beal: Sometimes do

245
00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:59.490
Jerrod Johnson: Be hydrated.

246
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:05.820
Crystal Beal: Yeah, how often do you think that's associated with like the Muslims. I mean, or heroin use versus like when you're not

247
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.210
Jerrod Johnson: Using know it's definitely because of that. Yeah.

248
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:24.540
Crystal Beal: Okay, um, it's interesting. We asked all these questions and a lot of them obviously can be triggered by substance use, or withdraw and but you know we'll see how you do. I speak a stabilized if if things continue to be issues for yeah you know

249
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.270
Crystal Beal: Any swollen lymph nodes.

250
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:28.710
Jerrod Johnson: Know,

251
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.900
Crystal Beal: Any easy bleeding or bruising.

252
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.920
Crystal Beal: Oh, okay. Um, and then I'm not sure what your reaction is to sell to do you get hives to anything else.

253
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.770
Jerrod Johnson: I'm not usually

254
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:57.780
Crystal Beal: OK, and then and mental health wise and he took some scoring at scoring cards and you fill out some questionnaires for us. Sorry. You couldn't

255
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:10.590
Crystal Beal: Ever called um, whatever it's called a PhD nine. It's a screening for depression and you just have a seven, which actually is like in the mile range for depression. Do you feel down depressed.

256
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.340
Jerrod Johnson: I'm know how I've been depressed. In the past, and I don't feel like I'm there right now.

257
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:27.540
Crystal Beal: Okay. Um, and then you know suicide does happen at higher rates among people with a history of depression and the substance use disorders are you having any thoughts of harming yourself.

258
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.530
Jerrod Johnson: Never

259
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.220
Crystal Beal: Okay. Have you ever attempted suicide in the past, low. Okay. Has anyone in your family killed themselves.

260
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:51.780
Crystal Beal: Well, okay, thanks for sharing all that. And then one of their sport and questionnaires you fill out first is called a GAD seven and it's a screen for anxiety and at your scores is seven on that one as well, which is also kind of mild anxiety, do you are you feeling anxious or irritable.

261
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.440
Jerrod Johnson: I'm not more than normal.

262
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.000
Crystal Beal: Okay.

263
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.300
Jerrod Johnson: I mean, some days, sometimes, but just depends on what's going on. Okay.

264
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.210
Crystal Beal: All right. And then, um,

265
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.270
Crystal Beal: As far as your

266
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.840
Crystal Beal: Question in my brain. I think we talked about all your substances, except nicotine.

267
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.150
Jerrod Johnson: I just smoked cigarettes. Yes.

268
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.530
Crystal Beal: About how many per day.

269
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.500
Jerrod Johnson: I'm half a pack to a pack a day.

270
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.050
Crystal Beal: Okay. And how many years have you been doing that.

271
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.620
Jerrod Johnson: Um, I just started I quit for five years and I just started

272
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.710
Jerrod Johnson: Two years ago when I started using again. I started smoking again.

273
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:45.600
Crystal Beal: Okay, congrats on not smoking for five years. I really like every single last cigarette smokers better for you. So, that's awesome.

274
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.930
Crystal Beal: And what's your interesting entering a quick again.

275
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.610
Jerrod Johnson: Yeah, yeah, definitely interested in that.

276
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.580
Crystal Beal: What have you done in the past to help you quit.

277
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.140
Jerrod Johnson: Oh, will you turn and nicotine patches.

278
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.660
Crystal Beal: Are you thinking you would like to try something like that. Now, or would you like to try to get

279
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.910
Jerrod Johnson: Jared again.

280
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.830
Crystal Beal: First and then try that, after

281
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.120
Jerrod Johnson: We do.

282
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.370
Jerrod Johnson: One thing at a time. Probably, yeah.

283
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.580
Crystal Beal: Okay, that's great that's totally fine. I'm

284
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.700
Crystal Beal: All right. Okay.

285
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:32.070
Crystal Beal: I think that is all of my questions for you. Thank you for doing that with me. And so the the major treatment options for opiate use disorder. So for the heroin, you

286
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.960
Crystal Beal: There's kind of four major options. There's not taking any medication.

287
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:50.220
Crystal Beal: Which you know doesn't work very well for a lot of people. Right. So eight to nine out of every 10 people who tried to quit opiates without taking medication will go back to taking them within a year so

288
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.630
Crystal Beal: Yeah, statistically, it doesn't work very well and

289
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.100
Jerrod Johnson: Even more than that even.

290
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:09.750
Crystal Beal: Yeah, Ray. And I think, and that's because at short acting. Okay. It's really changed our brain and you have a whole bunch of extra receptors on your brain and your brain can't function normally without those receptors being filled up

291
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:19.920
Crystal Beal: And so the goal of medication late supported treatment right is to fill those receptors up so your brain can function normally and you don't have to think about

292
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:27.990
Crystal Beal: Trying to find opiates and you can focus on doing things like working towards getting your doc right distracted. So that's why

293
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:37.140
Jerrod Johnson: There was, I heard there was like an actual operation that you could get where they like go into your brain and and do something to your receptors. Is that true

294
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.270
Crystal Beal: I have never heard of that.

295
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:50.520
Crystal Beal: These are like microscopic things on the outside themselves and I just don't think that we have technology that would allow us to work at such a small level right

296
00:24:52.410 --> 00:25:01.740
Crystal Beal: Yeah, and. But what we do have our medications that go in and fill up those receptors for us spate three different options. There's methadone or

297
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:11.670
Crystal Beal: buprenorphine like products like Suboxone which you've tried to and there's a divot job, which is a long acting injectable that one doesn't work as well as nothing on our or

298
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:21.210
Crystal Beal: Suboxone so I don't generally recommend it. It's less effective at helping people stay away from opiates. And I think that's because it doesn't really control your withdraw your cravings.

299
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.720
Jerrod Johnson: I've seen people fail on that.

300
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.530
Crystal Beal: Yeah.

301
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.540
Crystal Beal: And the problem with jaws, you're actually a little bit more likely to die from an overdose.

302
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:37.680
Crystal Beal: On that one, then you are with methadone or Suboxone even so it's less effective and you're more likely to die from an overdose. So

303
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:53.580
Crystal Beal: Um, if you go back to taking heroin. So, not, not a big fan to medication options or methadone spoke to me to try both before and they're almost as equally effective method on a slightly more effective than I'm smart soon.

304
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.510
Crystal Beal: It using smartphones, a great option.

305
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.910
Jerrod Johnson: Can you still hear. Oh.

306
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.590
Jerrod Johnson: I lost you there for a second.

307
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.010
Crystal Beal: Okay.

308
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.880
Crystal Beal: Sorry about that. Okay. What was the last thing you heard

309
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.990
Jerrod Johnson: You were talking about methadone or Suboxone or methadone is a little bit more effective.

310
00:26:49.620 --> 00:27:00.000
Crystal Beal: Yeah but boxing's a little bit safer. So we because methadone can cause overdose and stop your breathing. We actually do kill a few more people with methadone, um,

311
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:10.020
Crystal Beal: And we don't really do that with Suboxone. And so when we look at those numbers I think Suboxone and because it's slightly see for an almost as effective as a great option and

312
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.080
Jerrod Johnson: I wish you guys did methadone, though, because

313
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.170
Jerrod Johnson: It's it does work.

314
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.730
Crystal Beal: It does. Yeah.

315
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:24.930
Jerrod Johnson: The transition is like the the best part about it. It's so much easier to transition from one thing to the other.

316
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.690
Jerrod Johnson: Yeah, like Suboxone

317
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:37.200
Crystal Beal: Mm hmm. Well, the nice thing is with Suboxone if you start the Suboxone, it doesn't work for you and you want to go to a methadone clinic. You don't have to wait.

318
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:47.850
Crystal Beal: Um, to go from Suboxone or methadone, like you kind of do to go from methadone or Suboxone or heroin just Suboxone and you can just start at the next day. You don't have to start feeling spec.

319
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.800
Jerrod Johnson: List.

320
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:57.720
Crystal Beal: Or yeah, that is nice and we can't do anything on methadone has to be given out a dispensary so

321
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:07.050
Crystal Beal: Our physical location you we can't do it. Um, but if the Suboxone here doesn't work for you and you know we can help you try to find somewhere close by.

322
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:19.410
Crystal Beal: That is doing methadone and the Suboxone though will plug up those opiate receptors and it does hang out in those receptors better than any other opiates. So if you have like heroin around

323
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:30.420
Crystal Beal: In your brain, it's going to kick it out. And because the buprenorphine part of the Suboxone and kicks out the heroin, but only turns on that receptor, about half halfway

324
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:41.190
Crystal Beal: You do feel really sick rate that precipitated withdraw. Yeah, and that's not because of the you know Suboxone has buprenorphine and the locks on our in our candidate.

325
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:56.910
Crystal Beal: It's not the Narcan you get almost none of that in your body. If you take it the way it's prescribed that's really there to keep you from melting it down and injecting it um, because when you inject melted down Suboxone the Narc Canada is absorbed and you do go into withdraw and

326
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:04.200
Crystal Beal: It makes you feel sick is actually that buprenorphine. Because it just doesn't turn those receptors on as strongly as heroin or methadone does right

327
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.190
Jerrod Johnson: Yeah, and that's one thing I was gonna ask you if it would be possible.

328
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:17.940
Jerrod Johnson: For like the first like couple days. Would it be possible to get some of the sub you Tex just through the transition period.

329
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:31.020
Crystal Beal: No, it shouldn't it. It's not because it won't make a difference because it's the buprenorphine as what's on the sub you text just like it's what's in the Suboxone and that's what makes you feel sick. If you don't wait long enough. It's not the naloxone

330
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:42.930
Crystal Beal: Um, yeah. Because if again. Then the locks and really like you absorb almost none of it. If you take it under your tongue like you're supposed to. It's only a few melted down and injected by you absorb it.

331
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.970
Jerrod Johnson: Wow, I didn't know that.

332
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.740
Crystal Beal: Yeah yeah

333
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:54.330
Crystal Beal: It's literally just there to keep people from injecting buprenorphine because you can get high when you inject people are being without

334
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.220
Crystal Beal: Injected not something believe I interrupted you can

335
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:13.350
Crystal Beal: Yeah, yeah, so we we don't do non combination products. We don't prescribe like 70 texture products without an art can component unless you have a documented.

336
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:23.130
Crystal Beal: Half lactic reaction in our camp, which basically means we have to get hospital and medical records from somewhere that observed you take our cannon and have a life threatening allergic reaction.

337
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:30.330
Crystal Beal: And that's kind of the standard of care and expectation around the country in general.

338
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:37.740
Crystal Beal: I can't give you some medication for like nausea and vomiting and anxiety.

339
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:49.500
Crystal Beal: And sleep. I can give you some medicines that can help with the symptoms and you know of withdrawal and stuff like that to maybe make it a little bit more comfortable and they, you know,

340
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:57.930
Crystal Beal: They helped a little bit. They don't help a ton of it, but I'm happy to try to do that to Jamie, a little more comfortable for you.

341
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.740
Crystal Beal: When was the last time you use heroin.

342
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.360
Jerrod Johnson: Today,

343
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:04.830
Crystal Beal: That what time

344
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.130
Jerrod Johnson: Noon.

345
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:25.050
Crystal Beal: Okay, so yeah, so you'll definitely like usually want to wait at least 12 hours. So right now I would expect, you're not feeling super uncomfortable yet like I would think, maybe you're starting to get like MC and think about it and stuff but not like sick.

346
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.250
Crystal Beal: And so in general, we want you to feel kind of crummy right so at least 12 hours.

347
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.210
Jerrod Johnson: So this would be like when I wake up in the morning.

348
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.580
Jerrod Johnson: Yeah yeah

349
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:55.950
Crystal Beal: Yeah, yeah. And you know, you want to like you want to probably be having hot and cold flashes sweaty runny eyes lottery knows crappy Tommy like you want at least three significant withdrawal symptoms. Does that make sense. I

350
00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.780
Crystal Beal: You know, everyone everyone's body is a little bit different. But those are some of the common ones right

351
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:09.870
Crystal Beal: And like I said, I can give you some medicine that may help a little bit with sleep and may help a little bit with nausea and may help a little bit with anxiety.

352
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:24.690
Crystal Beal: And then, and usually like we just do those supportive medications for like the first week or two, where we're trying to get you on on stabilize on the Suboxone we don't continue those afterwards so

353
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.980
Crystal Beal: Um, and if you if we gave legalize on the thoughts of oxidative you still feel like you need them either.

354
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:41.940
Crystal Beal: We might need to be on methadone, because the Suboxone dose can't get high enough for you or there may be something else going on with your body and you will need to see a primary care doctor

355
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.960
Crystal Beal: Questions about any of that.

356
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:57.090
Crystal Beal: Okay. Um, so yeah. Generally, you would probably want to try to start your medicine, maybe tomorrow morning and avoid heroin. Until then,

357
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:08.010
Crystal Beal: I'm and I usually have people. I usually do the strips and I usually do the eight milligram strips. Those are usually the easiest to find in pharmacies and you cut your first one in half.

358
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:20.520
Crystal Beal: And you take half a stroke and you give it 45 minutes and might not help you feel much better. But the reason you're giving it 45 minutes and not taking a whole strip is because I want to know if it makes you feel worse, right.

359
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:30.570
Crystal Beal: Right, if you take that four milligram strips and you feel worse. You're in precipitate withdraw and it was too soon. And if you had taken eight milligrams that precipitate withdrawal would be way worse.

360
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.170
Jerrod Johnson: Yeah, it doesn't hurt to take even like two milligrams

361
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:41.940
Crystal Beal: Yeah, I usually only do two milligrams when I'm transitioning people from methadone and long acting opiate like

362
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:54.240
Crystal Beal: It's a lot harder to avoid that precipitate withdrawal than it is with the shorter acting ones. And if you're really nervous about it and you want to cut it into quarters and do too. I'm totally fine with them. I'm

363
00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:02.610
Crystal Beal: I'm. But in the absence of like kind of routine methadone. I think you'll probably be okay for

364
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:09.630
Crystal Beal: And but to affords fine give it 45 minutes if it did not make you feel worse. You can repeat the dose.

365
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:23.370
Crystal Beal: Right. And if it makes you feel worse. You want to wait and you want to wait at least six hours before you take another adult and you can take some of those supportive medications, you know, for like nada and symptoms and stuff like that. In the interim,

366
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.640
Crystal Beal: Questions about that.

367
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.400
Jerrod Johnson: No, no, I think we covered it.

368
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:44.160
Crystal Beal: Okay, I write enough for you to take up to I'm usually do 12 milligrams. I'm going to read for you. I'm going to write up to 16 so you were on 16 in the past, um, you know, so choose trips a day.

369
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:51.960
Crystal Beal: You were on 16 in the past, you have like a pretty long history with opiates and you've been on methadone and

370
00:34:52.560 --> 00:35:02.610
Crystal Beal: A lot of people will feel better on eight to 12 milligrams a day. Um, but, you know, for a lot of people will we're going up further to like 24 maybe even 32 milligrams a day.

371
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:13.110
Crystal Beal: I'm at 24 to 32 milligrams, we really think we like have blocked all the receptors and even if we give you more. It doesn't make you feel any better. So if we get there and you're not feeling

372
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:21.180
Crystal Beal: Like you're withdrawn cravings are controlled for a full 24 hours, then it's really methadone is where we're headed. Um,

373
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:38.610
Crystal Beal: And so, um, yeah, you can take two to four milligrams repeat it in 45 minutes and you can kind of do that, up to a maximum of 60 milligrams. So if you take more than two strips or 60 milligrams a day it'll run out before I see you again.

374
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:51.930
Crystal Beal: But, um, however much you taken the first 24 hours you know whether you take eight or 16 or 12. The next morning when you wake up, just take that entire amount in the morning.

375
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.670
Jerrod Johnson: Before No good.

376
00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:06.930
Crystal Beal: Yeah, so it's like if you say you try it tomorrow and you end up taking 12 milligrams. So strip and a half. And that's what helps you feel better. Right. And the next morning when you wake up you'll take a stroke and a half and you'll do that every day, till I see you again.

377
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.250
Jerrod Johnson: Look good

378
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.130
Jerrod Johnson: So make sense. Yep. Yep.

379
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:29.730
Crystal Beal: Perfect. Okay. And then most common side effects for people are nasza and headaches and for most people, those actually get better after a couple of weeks they get stabilized and they feel better and other really common side effects and or constipation, which is true of any opiate

380
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.690
Crystal Beal: And then, you know, all opiates also affect

381
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:46.260
Crystal Beal: Fertility and libido and erections so long acting opiates like methadone or Suboxone affect them less than short acting opiates like heroin, but that can potentially be an issue as well.

382
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.700
Yeah.

383
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.220
Crystal Beal: Questions about any of that.

384
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.590
Jerrod Johnson: Um, no.

385
00:36:53.430 --> 00:37:07.020
Crystal Beal: Okay, and so we should have a pharmacy on file for you. Um, so I would send your prescription electronically to that pharmacy and I would write you enough and medications to get you

386
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:13.050
Crystal Beal: Through to Wednesday of next week. And so at our program.

387
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:22.470
Crystal Beal: We do our follow up visits weekly for the first month, you've probably done this before, but we do them in during group so Wednesdays at 530 we have group.

388
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:33.720
Crystal Beal: And with Serena our who runs our group and you and I would like, do a little breakout session and check in about your medicine and change your dose, if we need to. And then I write your refills.

389
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.190
Jerrod Johnson: Good.

390
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.590
Crystal Beal: Questions about that.

391
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:49.320
Crystal Beal: Okay. And so I'm just like most of oxygen programs. If you might not have medicine early lose your medicine or lose, why you're not getting a paper a prescription social get lost.

392
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.300
Crystal Beal: And we can't do any early refills, and not just because the DEA so strongly regulates buprenorphine.

393
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:08.190
Crystal Beal: It's not that we want you to suffer. It's just that we wouldn't be able to prescribe for people if we did and and then the other important things, you know,

394
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:23.040
Crystal Beal: You'll get urine drug screens in the mail and want to make sure you don't open that package until you're actually in front of the camera with the technician and don't even open the outer package and will open all of that in front of them.

395
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.650
Crystal Beal: And the important thing to know is like

396
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:34.170
Crystal Beal: I'm substance use is not a reason for me to stop prescribing for you. It's like a reason to have conversations is the reason maybe to see you more often.

397
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:39.870
Crystal Beal: I'm happy with your counselor more things like that. The reason I can't keep prescribing I'm

398
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:50.160
Crystal Beal: Like immediately is if you are testing negative for buprenorphine. So if you're not taking your Suboxone or you're just dipping a Suboxone strip in the urine and not actually getting it.

399
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.320
Crystal Beal: Metabolized by your body again because of these are strongly regulates diversion. We can't keep prescribing um

400
00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:59.760
Crystal Beal: But other

401
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:17.670
Crystal Beal: Yeah. Other stuff like positives for other substances and stuff like that. I think, you know, our it's a harm reduction program, we're here to help you and support you and find ways to help you work through with that I'm not doing yeah alright cool questions about any of that.

402
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:26.070
Crystal Beal: Nope. Okay, so what will happen next is, I will send your prescription electronically.

403
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:39.390
Crystal Beal: Um, and you will get an email from me later and just with kind of a summary of next steps and the things you need to do. And you'll want to put in your calendar, write it down electronically.

404
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:49.020
Crystal Beal: Set some kind of reminder that our next appointment will be 530 Wednesday. If you don't need to come this week, but the 27th. I'm

405
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.250
Jerrod Johnson: Still looks good.

406
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.580
Crystal Beal: And that is the group. And that's where you get your prescriptions. You don't want to miss that. And unfortunately our system has no appointment reminders, um,

407
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:04.050
Jerrod Johnson: So Wednesday the 27th at 530 yeah

408
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.610
Crystal Beal: 30 Pacific

409
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:16.050
Crystal Beal: Pacific Standard Time. Yeah, yeah. I missed an appointment. The first time because like as a doctor because I was like, where's my reminder. So that's how I found that out. I'm so sorry about that.

410
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:26.310
Crystal Beal: And then there'll be a few other things, um, as far as like checking in with your counselor and stuff like that. But there will be instructions in the email.

411
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:38.610
Crystal Beal: Okay. And if you have any questions, you just talk to your care coordinator and who should be kind of the person you've been helping you get set up and stuff like that.

412
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:45.660
Crystal Beal: And still be able to say email them and check in with them. If you have other questions, and they can always get a hold of us if there's something that you need.

413
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.100
Crystal Beal: Okay. Any other questions for me, Jared.

414
00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.680
Jerrod Johnson: No, Mom. So you're sending the prescription over tonight.

415
00:40:59.340 --> 00:40:59.730
Yeah.

416
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.800
Jerrod Johnson: Pharmacy closes.

417
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.240
Yeah.

418
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.010
Crystal Beal: I'm not sure. Either you could call him and check I um

419
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.600
Crystal Beal: I don't even know right now because I can't. Usually the

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:16.860
Jerrod Johnson: Picture open till eight

421
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.990
Jerrod Johnson: Perfect. Essentially, yeah.

422
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.200
Crystal Beal: Perfect. So we'll put that in and and you should be able to go get that tonight.

423
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.460
Okay.

424
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:36.330
Crystal Beal: And yeah and but I'll get fed into this soon as we get off. Um, and then we'll go from there. Okay.

425
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.540
