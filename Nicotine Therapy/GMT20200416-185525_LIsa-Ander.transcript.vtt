Amber Romero: I'm sure

38
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.600

69
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:09.030
LIsa Anderson: Some of the panic and anxiety, you had been experiencing. Um, and one question for you. How many times did you feel like you had that experience or that episode this past week.

70
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.710
Amber Romero: I know probably four seven

71
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.530
Amber Romero: Measure it

72
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:38.220
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, I was kind of looking at some of the surveys that you filled out. And when we look at your, your kind of measure of of your anxiety, what you're telling me now I do see that matching up with

73
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:50.580
LIsa Anderson: Some pretty severe levels of anxiety I was looking kind of also at your depression scores from last time and and that was

74
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.710
LIsa Anderson: Around the the moderate, severe range to can you tell me a little bit about

75
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:06.330
LIsa Anderson: Your mood. This past week. Would you say that's that's pretty accurate that you were on the more depressed side this past week.

76
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.140
Yeah.

77
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:25.230
Amber Romero: I don't think so. But maybe I'm just off like but I mean I wouldn't call it depressed, but I don't know.

78
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.820
LIsa Anderson: Hey, tell me about that. What, what were you feeling pissed off about

79
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.460
Amber Romero: Life.

80
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.690
Amber Romero: No issues with the boyfriend baby daddy getting out of prison.

81
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.000
Amber Romero: I'm

82
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.110
Amber Romero: Not work.

83
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.700
Amber Romero: coronavirus taken over. It was just

84
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.140
Amber Romero: I don't know. Maybe it was my period. I don't know.

85
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.920
LIsa Anderson: Okay. So, a lot, a lot, kind of came out you this past week.

86
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:06.210
LIsa Anderson: Yeah okay well understandable. Yeah, there's a lot of, you know, you're dealing with a lot right now.

87
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:16.410
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so, so kind of not more so on the the angry side, you would say this past week, more so than feeling down or depressed or

88
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.400
Amber Romero: I don't think I would consider myself so I really don't.

89
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.740
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right.

90
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.370
LIsa Anderson: Then then looking at, I'm just kind of your

91
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:41.880
LIsa Anderson: Remember one of those surveys that you feel that it's called the brief addiction, um, monitor. And so looking at that you have reported I'm

92
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:50.190
LIsa Anderson: Kind of those days of having cravings. So, about six days of cravings. Is that about right.

93
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.320
Amber Romero: Well, every day.

94
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.360
LIsa Anderson: Every day okay and then sleep issues every day.

95
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.830
Amber Romero: Every day.

96
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.740
LIsa Anderson: Okay, anxiety, every day.

97
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.240
LIsa Anderson: Yes. And then I'm okay. You mentioned kind of issues with relationships.

98
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.250
LIsa Anderson: That's been giving you some trouble about every day and then

99
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:26.340
LIsa Anderson: Kind of a maybe family when you mentioned the family or friend arguments would you relate that to kind of your boyfriend and and what was going on with him this past week.

100
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.470
Amber Romero: Kind of an argument for a book.

101
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.080
Amber Romero: Hey, back in the day, what did you

102
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.840
Amber Romero: Are you today. I'm fine me one more time.

103
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.460
LIsa Anderson: Oh, it's already using

104
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.360
Amber Romero: Computers, you had

105
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.890
LIsa Anderson: Your survey.

106
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.150
LIsa Anderson: Just some family stress or a family arguments. This past week.

107
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:54.450
LIsa Anderson: I'm going over that I'm just taking a look that we're on the same pages. Those um you know all those all that work you fill out in the beginning.

108
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.670
LIsa Anderson: Are you also mentioned feeling that physical pain to

109
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.970
LIsa Anderson: So on your, your payment or so just about every day even having some physical pain.

110
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.470
Amber Romero: Point.

111
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.520
Amber Romero: Yeah, that was purpose for using

112
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.340
LIsa Anderson: That was what for using

113
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.180
That

114
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.390
Amber Romero: Are you preparing

115
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.270
LIsa Anderson: That's why you use this for physical pain.

116
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.780
Amber Romero: Of a car.

117
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.480
Amber Romero: Just to happen, but

118
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.850
Amber Romero: Probably maybe of all going down the freeway one here and

119
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.420
Amber Romero: Myself pretty bad.

120
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.160
Amber Romero: But

121
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:58.050
Amber Romero: Just I kept on using for the pain, cuz medication, they were going to meet that I felt wasn't strong enough and I don't want to be

122
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.560
Amber Romero: I never really thought about work.

123
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.420
LIsa Anderson: And would you say that's kind of how your use became more progressive as time went on,

124
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.400
LIsa Anderson: It.

125
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.470
LIsa Anderson: Was really a injury. Okay.

126
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.570
LIsa Anderson: Well, I can hear you, kind of, I'm having a little bit of awareness amber, you know, we talked about

127
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:30.120
LIsa Anderson: Last time kind of how you started, and it was you know you weren't really sure what it can point that so i think is we're kind of getting

128
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:44.520
LIsa Anderson: You along this process a little bit more for you to kind of look at maybe that injury was maybe even turning point in your addiction, where, where it got worse, where you were using relating to the pain, does that

129
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.650
LIsa Anderson: Does that sound right.

130
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:58.080
Amber Romero: I mean, it fits right i want to say that that was like the like the breaker, breaker if it just

131
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:07.140
LIsa Anderson: Depends. Okay, um, because you talked about last time that there were times where you didn't know if

132
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:21.930
LIsa Anderson: You didn't really take to the word triggers for your use it sometimes it would just, it could be anything. Right. Okay. Um, so, so, but now you would say when you're experiencing a pain of being

133
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:29.010
LIsa Anderson: A feeling of pain or or a feeling of anxiety was that kind of kicking up those cravings.

134
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:31.890
Amber Romero: Oh,

135
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.390
Amber Romero: Hey, I don't know.

136
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.850
LIsa Anderson: Okay, okay I

137
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.160
Amber Romero: Wasn't really thinking about that, like,

138
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:55.680
LIsa Anderson: Okay, well, we'll put that on the back burner for now. Um, how have you been coping this week, like with all of the stress that you mentioned.

139
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:07.050
LIsa Anderson: That came up for you this week. Like, how have you been kind of kind of keeping off all of those balls up in the air. What have you been doing to kind of cope with that.

140
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.270
Amber Romero: Crank point everybody around me and

141
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.430
Amber Romero: Smoke math.

142
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.650
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so you've been using math, um,

143
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.790
LIsa Anderson: This past week.

144
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.560
Yeah.

145
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.540
LIsa Anderson: So, kind of, um,

146
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.830
LIsa Anderson: Feeling like you switched over to that a little bit.

147
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:36.120
LIsa Anderson: Well,

148
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.760
Amber Romero: Just a couple days ago, maybe it would like

149
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.580
Amber Romero: Not like Scott and I were like

150
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.650
LIsa Anderson: stopping you from thinking so much. Okay.

151
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.310
Yeah.

152
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.430
Amber Romero: Yeah. Good work.

153
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.120
LIsa Anderson: Didn't work kind of maybe had the opposite effect, right.

154
00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.580
Amber Romero: Yes.

155
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.820
LIsa Anderson: Okay, when, when was the one that you used

156
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.770
LIsa Anderson: Days ago. Okay. Um, so you've been able to to stop it.

157
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:15.810
LIsa Anderson: I'm happy.

158
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.950

164
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.060
LIsa Anderson: under a tree to us so that very

165
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:42.990
Moving

166
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:55.710
LIsa Anderson: So, um, do you want, do you want to talk about as far as what's going on with your relationships right now or

167
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.970
LIsa Anderson: Are you in a safe place to talk about that.

168
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.660
Amber Romero: Yeah. Um, but, okay. However, your question was cut out so I don't

169
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:08.790
Amber Romero: Know what you're asking.

170
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.720
LIsa Anderson: So you you talked about kind of the stress that happen with relationships. This past week.

171
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.850
LIsa Anderson: And how that was connected using math, um,

172
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.830
LIsa Anderson: So maybe we talk

173
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.360
LIsa Anderson: About what about

174
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.280
LIsa Anderson: Help you manage going forward.

175
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.070
LIsa Anderson: Tools.

176
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.210
LIsa Anderson: You can pull out when you're feeling stressed when you're feeling anxious

177
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.500
LIsa Anderson: That you can kind of make those your go tues instead of using

178
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.260
LIsa Anderson: Does that make sense.

179
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:52.170
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, yes. Okay. So was it like an argument or was there one specific

180
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.770
LIsa Anderson: Situation like

181
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.520
LIsa Anderson: You know, as far as your his dad getting out of prison. Was that a safety situation.

182
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:09.630
Amber Romero: Um, no, no, no, no safety situation just I'm

183
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.880
Amber Romero: A long term relationship, I guess.

184
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:29.820
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned to me that, um, that last time that you know you guys were together for a long time and things didn't quite end on on the best of terms.

185
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.890
LIsa Anderson: And so for him.

186
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.360
LIsa Anderson: out of prison that just brought up a lot of those feelings for you.

187
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.860
Amber Romero: More than a mossy, I guess.

188
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.140
LIsa Anderson: And you talked about that feeling of anger.

189
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.790
Amber Romero: Yeah.

190
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:55.050
LIsa Anderson: Okay, what about that was it. I'm angry at him about the things that happened in the past.

191
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:56.730
Amber Romero: Um,

192
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.510
Amber Romero: Yeah, I mean, just everything

193
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:08.640
Amber Romero: angers secondary emotion so mean primary emotion behind that is hurt. I mean, I just, yeah.

194
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:10.740
Amber Romero: But

195
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.980
LIsa Anderson: Yeah so. So knowing that her was kind of

196
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.030
LIsa Anderson: It brought the hurt from everything that happened in the past.

197
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.730
LIsa Anderson: And then that was kind of secondary to that.

198
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.530
Amber Romero: Yeah.

199
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:34.860
LIsa Anderson: Okay, okay, well, you know, it's definitely you know a lot going on. And like you said, the stress of of not working.

200
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.390
LIsa Anderson: Um, you know, it's a lot

201
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.440
LIsa Anderson: It's a lot for anybody to take, you know, and you're still kind of

202
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.810
LIsa Anderson: You know, new in recovery.

203
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:52.080
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, I want to be able to support you in that in dealing with, you know, working through you know the steps in your recovery.

204
00:17:53.010 --> 00:18:05.070
LIsa Anderson: And also just you know these things that get thrown at us in life. And it sounds like you're still, you know, kind of healing from some, some of those things in regards to your relationship you know your your past relationship.

205
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:07.260
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

206
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.310
LIsa Anderson: Um, were you able to make your calls with your kids this week.

207
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.470
LIsa Anderson: How did those go

208
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.410
Amber Romero: Yes, um, quick.

209
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.580
Quick

210
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.550
Amber Romero: Yeah.

211
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:28.740
Amber Romero: I mean that's 20 minutes and there's two and they both want to talk a whole thing.

212
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.090
Amber Romero: But

213
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.280
Amber Romero: Yeah, fast.

214
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.410
LIsa Anderson: It goes fast. Yeah.

215
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.090
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

216
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:49.020
LIsa Anderson: Well, um, you know, I know. That's been a big priority for you. Um, is, you know, getting yourself in in a safe and stable environment, getting clean so that you can happen.

217
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.470
LIsa Anderson: So I kind of wanted to revisit

218
00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:00.390
LIsa Anderson: Some of our goals that we talked about last time and your goals and kind of looking at

219
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.820
LIsa Anderson: You know, as

220
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.690
LIsa Anderson: As far as

221
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.740
LIsa Anderson: The opioid use kind of what you know some of our, our long term goals for you.

222
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.440
LIsa Anderson: Would, would be to look at, you know, maybe talking about

223
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.810
LIsa Anderson: History, like the frequency of use, um,

224
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.250
LIsa Anderson: You know, we want to look

225
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:35.430
LIsa Anderson: At those those things that you fill out every week. That kind of gives us a good sense of where you are, as far as like your anxiety. You know those all of those those measures that you fill out.

226
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:43.680
LIsa Anderson: And then we're going to look at, um, you know, of course, continuing to work with your doctor on your medications.

227
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.260
LIsa Anderson: And then I'm

228
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.240
LIsa Anderson: Kind of look at

229
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.920
LIsa Anderson: Like, what have you ever heard the term member ambivalent

230
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.390
LIsa Anderson: ambivalent ambivalent yeah so you know if someone's in

231
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.220
LIsa Anderson: About a decision kind of meeting, like they're on the fence right

232
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:27.660
LIsa Anderson: You could see the pros and cons of either choice. So oftentimes when we, you know, look at addiction is there is some ambivalence. As far as the person wanting you know there there's reasons to get clean

233
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:37.230
LIsa Anderson: And we've talked about those, but sometimes for people. There's reasons that they still use. So I want to create, you know, a space for us or

234
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.770
LIsa Anderson: For both. Oh, so that's kind of what we call it.

235
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.470
LIsa Anderson: Um, so that'll be something that will keep keep working towards

236
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:48.630
LIsa Anderson: Um,

237
00:20:49.140 --> 00:21:02.160
LIsa Anderson: One thing I wanted to ask you. Last time I know you mentioned, um, you know, some of the social support, or is there anyone that you feel like would be involved in your treatment.

238
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.950
LIsa Anderson: That you feel like that it would be helpful for them to be involved in your in your treatment.

239
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.700
Um,

240
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.300
Amber Romero: Well, I mean, they're

241
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.050
Amber Romero: The ones who are close to me either. They're involved like as far as them wanting to like

242
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.460
Like

243
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.370
Amber Romero: Jump in, or participate

244
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:38.610
LIsa Anderson: Or just asking like, you talked about your parents being really supportive of your sobriety, or like if couples therapy is something that you feel like you want to work on right now.

245
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.100
LIsa Anderson: Or if you want to just keep, you know, keep the focus on you for the time being.

246
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.420
Amber Romero: Um, yeah, probably me

247
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:57.510
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. Um, so then we kind of wanted to definitely I think have the long term goal as far as

248
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:10.440
LIsa Anderson: Maybe just kind of helping you connect with things that you can kind of do day to day, you know, I know, of course, your phone calls with your kids are really important. And you said you're doing those three times a week. Right.

249
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:12.750
Amber Romero: Uh huh.

250
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.400
LIsa Anderson: Okay, or video chat or calls three times a week. Okay, um,

251
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:29.760
LIsa Anderson: And then maybe just kind of looking at your areas as far as like hobbies, you know, I know you talked about drawing, but that, you know, it was also kind of hard for you to fill your days.

252
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.490
LIsa Anderson: So I thought maybe we could put that as a goal.

253
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:39.120
LIsa Anderson: For maybe like the next three months to kind of increase your like just your recreational

254
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:46.200
LIsa Anderson: Kind of, you know, fun recreational activities and figuring out what you like.

255
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.650
LIsa Anderson: About last week.

256
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.250
Amber Romero: Well, um,

257
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.780
Amber Romero: We can do that. That would be fine.

258
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.890
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, just because

259
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.480
LIsa Anderson: When, when a person has

260
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:18.630
LIsa Anderson: A long time. Um, you know we we know that that's kind of the nature of addiction that a lot of your time. A lot of your day to day, a lot of just you're focused on using right

261
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.030
LIsa Anderson: It's focused on like how to

262
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.180
LIsa Anderson: get money for the drug, how to, you know, the time spent using the drug, right, like that's a lot of what's

263
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.570
LIsa Anderson: Priyanka occupying your time.

264
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:36.600
LIsa Anderson: And so we want to fill that time with with other things.

265
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.760
LIsa Anderson: With. With. With. You know, clean, clean and sober.

266
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:55.110
LIsa Anderson: Activities. Okay, so maybe. Yeah, we can put that for maybe the next three months. Um, another question for you, Amber I know that you talked about you know you had worked at the

267
00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:07.050
LIsa Anderson: Being previously last year late last year. Um, and I know of course you know everything that's happening right now. I'm up in the air, but is is a bank job, something that you would

268
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.500
LIsa Anderson: Try to pursue again.

269
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:26.010
Amber Romero: Um, with that one specifically known to the cat there and you said, No, but I'm with other ones. Yeah. Like, I've already. I've already started that process just, I don't know.

270
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.340
Amber Romero: I don't know what it's gonna

271
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.680
Amber Romero: Start again I

272
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:40.770
Amber Romero: I would think banking would be essential, you know, people need their money or a banking question but I

273
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.820
Amber Romero: Don't know I have applied just haven't heard anything back

274
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:56.190
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. Good. Well, good. Um, yeah, I think we could definitely put that you know on target for me, within the next three months that hopefully you could find something, and there's

275
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:02.670
LIsa Anderson: Steps that you've already applied because. Absolutely. I think banks, you know, banks are still a central banks are

276
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.690
Amber Romero: So already have insurance.

277
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.520
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so you're just kind of applying to different banks around town.

278
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.860
Amber Romero: Mm hmm. Right. What can you hear me.

279
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.290
Amber Romero: All right, good. Um,

280
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.200
LIsa Anderson: You know, I know that, um, you talked about before, some of the treatment that you had done.

281
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:30.150
LIsa Anderson: Previously, um, as far as like any support groups like a a or na um you know I know those kind of arcs.

282
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.820
LIsa Anderson: Probably up and running in person right now. Um,

283
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:42.000
LIsa Anderson: Have you done any. What are your thoughts like about online support group.

284
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.230
Amber Romero: I haven't tried it all.

285
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.280
LIsa Anderson: Like that may be something you want to consider.

286
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.040
LIsa Anderson: Hold off on that for now.

287
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:56.910
No.

288
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.970

Amber Romero: I'm

292
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.750
Amber Romero: Hey, just I wasn't OK, though I wasn't comfortable. I in likely people really came at me.

293
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.730
Amber Romero: A very different spot, you know,

294
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.670
Amber Romero: My dad lives by

295
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.130
Amber Romero: It's been recommended

296
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:38.580
Amber Romero: See that it works, people who apply themselves are pretty successful and once they stop everything like basically goes to shit but um

297
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.440
Amber Romero: It's

298
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.660
Amber Romero: It's not

299
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.750
Amber Romero: My cup of tea, I guess.

300
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.710
LIsa Anderson: All right. No, I hear you. In, in, you know, I'm

301

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:02.460
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, that's okay. You'll have to kind of find you know what works for you. I'm kind of find your path.

304
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:12.540
LIsa Anderson: As far as, you know, support, would you say though that you do have some, some people who are a good support to you like as far as your family or friends.

305
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.610
Amber Romero: We talked about last time. Oh yeah, close friends and your parent like

306
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:34.140
LIsa Anderson: Alright, so, um, you know, like, and then, of course, like those can kind of be some short term goal. Thank you. And then, of course, you know, looking at long term.

307
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:53.190
LIsa Anderson: You know, accepting about how you know your chemical kind of life kind of getting you in in a recovery program that's working for you and then really kind of establishing that sustained recovery. You know that that timeframe where were you trying

308
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.690
LIsa Anderson: To sabotage time of

309
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.690
LIsa Anderson: And we go you for for about

310
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.920
LIsa Anderson: Over a year. Right.

311
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.230
LIsa Anderson: Um,

312
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:07.890
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so

313
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.140
LIsa Anderson: You know, knowing that you have some

314
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.390
LIsa Anderson: And

315
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.850
LIsa Anderson: Just drawn some of those skills that

316
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:15.120
You're

317
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:17.460
LIsa Anderson: Um,

318
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:18.600
LIsa Anderson: And then kind of

319
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.640
LIsa Anderson: Get those positive coping skills back to help you maintain sobriety.

320
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:40.860
LIsa Anderson: Like tools in your tool chest where you put kind of brought from that when you do feel anxious, you feel angry and you can kind of use some other coping skills.

321
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:50.700
LIsa Anderson: That have, you know, kind of relearning right if what you learned in the past was to use substances, when you felt anxious or stressed or angry.

322
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:58.080
LIsa Anderson: And now we're we're taking that out of it. We want to be able to give you some other tools to use

323
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.180
That make sense.

324
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:08.220
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, alright, so then I want to talk to him a little bit about, um,

325
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.360
LIsa Anderson: You talked about

326
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:16.800
LIsa Anderson: Anxious feelings that you were having pretty much every day. And some of that free and

327
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.280
Amber Romero: It.

328
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.890
LIsa Anderson: Around like feeling like people were out to get you.

329
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.930
Amber Romero: Can't hear you. Yeah, you sound far away.

330
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.730
LIsa Anderson: So you you had talked about that those feelings of anxiousness

331
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.960
Amber Romero: And some of those thoughts.

332
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.440
LIsa Anderson: That people were out to get you, um,

333
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:44.400
LIsa Anderson: Any um and you talked about feeling restless on any like shortness of breath.

334
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.050
LIsa Anderson: Racing

335
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.850
Amber Romero: I don't know what you said between breath and racing.

336
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.220
Amber Romero: did mention the heart racing um

337
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:13.110
Amber Romero: Maybe I didn't know shortness of breath would be it. But like, or like rapid

338
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.410
Amber Romero: Like hyperventilating

339
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.890
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Okay, gotcha. Yeah, that definitely does sound.

340
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.340
LIsa Anderson: You know, like just kind of subject, I think it

341
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:40.260
LIsa Anderson: So you did a really good job today of kind of describing some of those thoughts that came up with those anxieties and worries and so that's definitely I think something for the next three months that we can talk about what situations are associated with those

342
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.740
Worry

343
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.840
LIsa Anderson: How that's impacted just your day to day functioning.

344
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:47.940
LIsa Anderson: And then

345
00:30:49.350 --> 00:31:04.620
LIsa Anderson: You know how, how we can resolve that. Okay. And, and I heard you saying some really great things, earlier you know about anger, being a secondary emotion. So I think we can kind of keep working on that to kind of help you have an understanding of

346
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.020
LIsa Anderson: Where some of these emotions are coming

347
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.800
LIsa Anderson: And kind of how those thoughts if

348
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:13.680
That makes sense.

349
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.630
LIsa Anderson: And then

350
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.250
LIsa Anderson: Having ever done like

351
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:22.710
LIsa Anderson: Like

352
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.860
Like meditation or anything like that.

353
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.000
Amber Romero: Yes, we have ever done.

354
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.130
LIsa Anderson: Have you ever been deep breathing practice or meditation.

355
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.000
Amber Romero: Oh yeah, I did.

356
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.770
Amber Romero: We have

357
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:55.530
Amber Romero: I don't know if I just like not very open minded to things, but

358
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.140
Amber Romero: Like mindfulness

359
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.210
Amber Romero: Meditation.

360
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.220
Amber Romero: Like

361
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.310
Amber Romero: Oh no, I never

362
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:16.950
Amber Romero: Just

363
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.580
Amber Romero: So I can do something better with my 20 minutes

364
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.410
Amber Romero: Okay.

365
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:30.240
LIsa Anderson: So,

366
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.470
LIsa Anderson: You know, like I said, there's

367
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:32.850
LIsa Anderson: That's one of the tools.

368
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:40.980
LIsa Anderson: That we're going to kind of explore having an array of tools at your disposal, that if one thing doesn't work.

369
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.880
LIsa Anderson: You know you can reach for something else. So

370
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.880
LIsa Anderson: You know, we can. We'll talk about maybe

371
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.380
LIsa Anderson: writing things down. You know, sometimes

372
00:32:53.610 --> 00:33:00.600
LIsa Anderson: Dealing with worries. We can even kind of say okay this is going to get designated time and space when they write down those for you.

373
00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:11.700
LIsa Anderson: And then we'll kind of go through some things together, where we can kind of like a little bit challenge that worry and talk about like how realistic is that thought.

374
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:19.470
LIsa Anderson: You know that that kind of self talk. And by that we mean just kind of the internal dialogue that we have with our simple

375
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:32.730
LIsa Anderson: And that feels really accurate, but sometimes the messages that we're telling ourselves aren't always the most helpful to us.

376
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.670
LIsa Anderson: So it makes sense if

377
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:36.750
LIsa Anderson: You missed

378
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:46.950
LIsa Anderson: It is, you know, people are following me and being watched. I can't handle this. It's too much for me. You know those thoughts are going over

379
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.930
LIsa Anderson: It.

380
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:57.870
LIsa Anderson: So I think definitely like over like say the next three months.

381
00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.190
What's really put that

382
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.880
LIsa Anderson: Focus kind of able to change that self talk into more

383
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:13.830
LIsa Anderson: Realistic self talk to kind of give give some more positive messages to yourself.

384
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.590
LIsa Anderson: You know, we talked about maybe problem solving strategies so

385
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.710
LIsa Anderson: You know, just specific

386
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.280
Steps

387
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.130
LIsa Anderson: And then

388
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.100
Amber Romero: Kind of

389
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.700
Amber Romero: relapse prevention.

390
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.450
Strategies.

391
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.220
LIsa Anderson: How to manage those anxiety symptoms so that

392
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.140
Amber Romero: You know,

393
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.320
LIsa Anderson: To avoid any any potential relapse.

394
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.860
LIsa Anderson: That all kind of makes sense.

395
00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.500
Amber Romero: Yeah okay um any

396
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:04.410
LIsa Anderson: Anything else, and right now we talked about a lot. Um, last time, just as far as like your history.

397
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:15.120
LIsa Anderson: You know, any, anything else that you feel like I think maybe minister, that's really into play right now that that's significant for you.

398
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.400
Amber Romero: Know,

399
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.220
Amber Romero: The main thing was just beings it

400
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:43.800
LIsa Anderson: thinks it okay um you know in in I appreciate kind of your willingness to try things out. So, um, you know, we'll, we'll try things out and if it doesn't work. It doesn't work. But, um, you know, I definitely want to give every tool and every kind of option.

401
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.350
LIsa Anderson: Available.

402
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.890
LIsa Anderson: Definitely like looking at, you know,

403
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.620
LIsa Anderson: Family

404
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.060
LIsa Anderson: Some sort of

405
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.550
LIsa Anderson: Just activities.

406
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.290
LIsa Anderson: Able to function just a day to day

407
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.520

LIsa Anderson: What does that look like

411
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.160
Amber Romero: Falling asleep, I guess.

412
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.600
Amber Romero: Once I'm I feel like once I'm asleep.

413
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.810
Amber Romero: I'm asleep, but

414
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.310

415
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.000
Amber Romero: Okay, I'm falling asleep, just

416
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.840

417
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:46.620
Amber Romero: Like

418
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:48.840

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.380
Amber Romero: Make night night terrors.

420
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:10.500

421
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.430
Amber Romero: I don't know why all of a sudden

422
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:20.280

425
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:34.980

426
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.650
LIsa Anderson: You know, with

427
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.940
LIsa Anderson: With substance use, you know, of course, the methamphetamine is

428
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.210
LIsa Anderson: You know, an upper stipulate

429
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.480
LIsa Anderson: Definitely cost sleep disturbance

430
00:37:49.770 --> 00:38:00.390

431
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.510
LIsa Anderson: But, you know, we can definitely work with your doctors and and look at

432
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:22.140
LIsa Anderson: You know there's there's various medications for sleep and you know there's about two as far as like establishing like a daily routine like trying to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.

433
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:33.180
LIsa Anderson: And just doing things to kind of promote restful restful sleep so well done like put that on the radar for kind of, you know, the next three months.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.380
LIsa Anderson: Today I would categorize

469
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.130

LIsa Anderson: On for four, she did report depression on the pH q nine, although she verbally denied that but she described more

474
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:37.920
LIsa Anderson: Anger and her related to a number of cycles psycho social stressors related to a fight with her boyfriend her children's father being released from jail. She was definitely a little bit. I think more challenged by those things and just has a really some struggles as far as poor coping.

475
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:53.970
LIsa Anderson: And it really and avoiding coping style and and or use of substances as far as her her coping style, but we did focus on her treatment plan.

483
00:43:41.880 --> 00:44:00.390
LIsa Anderson: I would like her to see her explore and resolve her ambivalence associated to her commitment to her addiction and that will be evidence by her patient report that really committing to to a recovery plan.

484
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:09.690
LIsa Anderson: Commit we'd like I'd like to see your commit to an action plan directed toward her termination of substance abuse by July 16

485

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:29.520
LIsa Anderson: I would like her to look at even acknowledging and then as as a future goal. I would say for about four months maybe august 16

488
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:40.530
LIsa Anderson: Agreed to make amends to significant others who have been hurt by a life dominated by substance abuse within the next four months, as evidenced by her patient report.

489
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.940
LIsa Anderson: I'd like to see your verbalize and increase knowledge of substance abuse and the process of recovery within the next three months.

490
00:44:49.230 --> 00:45:00.390
LIsa Anderson: And then also for her to verbalize and understanding of the factors that can contribute to development of chemical dependence and then have her look at what those risks for relapse would be

491
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:10.590
LIsa Anderson: I'd like to see her within the next three months. Again, identify a level of happiness in various areas of life as identified by her patient report.

492
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.280

493
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:33.480
LIsa Anderson: towards achieving her goals within the next three months and then cooperate with exploration of increasing satisfaction and areas of life that can support sobriety, such as employment recreation and relationships.

494
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:43.530
LIsa Anderson: As evidence in the next three months, which today amber did discuss on that she has applied for several banking jobs.

495
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:56.550
LIsa Anderson: And I would like to see her identify challenge and replace destructive high risk self talk with positive strength building self talk within the next three months.

496
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:03.210
LIsa Anderson: In Sugarland demonstrated today really poor insight as far as her

497
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:26.010
LIsa Anderson: Identifying her thoughts of paranoia REALLY WHICH SHE CONNECTED TO in anxiety episode and she did report a high level of anxiety, but she also reported with amphetamine use. And so I would really like to see her improve insight within the next three months.

498
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.200
LIsa Anderson: And recognize

499
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:29.790
LIsa Anderson: The

500
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.650
LIsa Anderson: You know, psychological consequences of drug use.

501
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:42.990
LIsa Anderson: Really again for her to verbalize and understanding of laps in relapse, as evidenced by her report.

502
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:52.740
LIsa Anderson: And then really look at implementing relapse prevention strategies for managing future situations for her with your high risk for relapse and today.

503
00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:09.750
LIsa Anderson: She talks about her children staff being released from jail. She talked about conflict with her, significant other, she kind of glazed around those cycles social stressors that were really I think triggers for her her use of methamphetamine.

504
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.930
LIsa Anderson: Which she says was was three days ago.

505
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:28.440
LIsa Anderson: So for her long term goals, having amber accept the fact of chemical dependence and actively participate in a recovery program. I'd like to see her establish a sustained recovery free from the use of all

506
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:34.830
LIsa Anderson: All mood altering substances establish and maintain total abstinence

507
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.450
LIsa Anderson: And stabilize both physically and emotionally

508
00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:52.710
LIsa Anderson: And increase her knowledge of the disease and the process of recovery and then to have her acquire the necessary necessary skills to maintain long term sobriety from all mood altering substances.

509
00:47:54.150 --> 00:48:03.600
LIsa Anderson: She will now need to withdraw from the mood altering substances stabilized physically and emotionally and then staple established supportive recovery plan.

510
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:18.390
LIsa Anderson: In we're going to utilize cognitive behavioral therapy Dialectical Behavioral therapy to begin helping her maintain sobriety her discharge plan will look at continuing with with this outpatient

511
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:35.940
LIsa Anderson: Continuing with about patient therapy and continuing with psychiatry and attending support groups. We also reviewed a treatment plan in regard to generalized anxiety disorder. However, I'm going to defer on that until

512
00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.090
LIsa Anderson: We can assess further her

513
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:51.000
LIsa Anderson: You know, I believe that the methamphetamine use over the past week is really what's driving a lot of anxiety, and I would like to see amber

514
00:48:52.140 --> 00:49:04.350
LIsa Anderson: You know she she reported really high severe anxiety on on her measures, but I would really like to see her have some sustained sobriety before further exploring that.

515
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.110
LIsa Anderson: And so

516
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.470
LIsa Anderson: Today was really focused on

517
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.350
LIsa Anderson: Creating that treatment plan.

518
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:19.050
LIsa Anderson: Establishing a set schedule for her group and individual sessions which will be weekly for both

519
00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:34.080
LIsa Anderson: And today we focused on updating her treatment plan for opioid use disorder. We are also going to add to that methamphetamine use. So today we kind of got that verbal agreement around that initial treatment plan.

520
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.070
LIsa Anderson: Looked at for treatment objectives.

521
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.690
LIsa Anderson: And and that was the focus of our

522
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:50.520
LIsa Anderson: Of our session today. It looks like she did complete her family and all of her other measures.

523
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.900
LIsa Anderson: And she is going to continue with group.

524
00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:01.350
LIsa Anderson: Today, I would just characterize amber as

525
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.130
LIsa Anderson: You know as as pretty distracted.

526
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:13.260
LIsa Anderson: Her thought content was focused on the session, but she she seemed highly distractible today.

527
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:23.100
LIsa Anderson: Last week she was in a park walking around. So I think she was a little bit more focused last week this week. She was in a vehicle.

528
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:34.200
LIsa Anderson: Which ended up here and she was in the backseat with someone else in the front seat driving. I could hear a male voice in the background in it appeared that he was maybe

529
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:39.960
LIsa Anderson: Talking to her or talking on the phone. So she was pretty distracted.

530
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:50.190
LIsa Anderson: But she she didn't mention there was no evidence of suicidal or homicidal thoughts today.

531
00:50:51.630 --> 00:51:00.480
LIsa Anderson: your thought process was, she was alert oriented to person in place. She was well groomed.

532
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.520
LIsa Anderson: There were times where her eye contact was quite poor.

533
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.050
LIsa Anderson: Where she she did not appear engaged.

534
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:25.530
LIsa Anderson: You know, other times she she could focus and sustained short periods of eye contact her behavior. Again, it just seemed just a little bit distracted, but her motor activity was within normal limits.

535
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:31.410
LIsa Anderson: Her her mood seen you find make with with a somewhat

536
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:38.370
LIsa Anderson: Depressed to flat and an effect or a blunted alpha effect.

537
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.610
LIsa Anderson: It open in different

538
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:58.860
LIsa Anderson: Her speech seem normal again. Her attitude was was guarded to to even them a bit a bit suspicious, but her her thought process was linear to concrete. It was no evidence of

539
00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:04.650
LIsa Anderson: Those associations her thought content was normal no evidence of

540
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:11.070
LIsa Anderson: Hallucinations. However, there was a bit of a

541
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:14.970
LIsa Anderson: Mentioned a paranoid thought content.

542
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:22.260
LIsa Anderson: Where she she really was pretty guarded about that other than identifying a some paranoid.

543
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:30.540
LIsa Anderson: Content, I believe, related to the methamphetamine use and we will definitely want to explore that further.

544
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:39.180
LIsa Anderson: You know, I think, given her her recent methamphetamine use on her judgment in insight are quite poor.

545
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:43.470
LIsa Anderson: And so we are going to continue with

546
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:51.420
LIsa Anderson: Weekly therapy weekly group with her next appointment being for 23 at 1pm Mountain Standard Time.
