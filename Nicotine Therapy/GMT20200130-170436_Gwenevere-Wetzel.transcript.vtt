17
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a relief.

18
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:42.690
Cynthia We: It is a big relief because when they got all that money. I wrote checks for school for Friday and for this Friday. And, um, and then they didn't pay him on Friday. It was like

19
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.280
Cynthia We: It was got a whole bunch of money.

20
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.130
Okay, annoying. Yeah.

21
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

22
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the worst thing that just happened. Let's, let's do some touching ground on this happened and

23
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's the catastrophic or not catastrophic outcome, like what actually did.

24
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.030
Cynthia We: Not okay that's dropping outcome.

25
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.560
Cynthia We: No one catastrophe. It would have been a catastrophe. If we hadn't found another option and I'm

26
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.530
Cynthia We: That found check that was like $1,000 check that he could deposit any deposited that

27
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.070
Cynthia We: Friday, we would, it would have been catastrophic

28
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.010
Cynthia We: We need to plan to not ever have to depend on these people again. Okay.

29
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.310
Cynthia We: You know what the work to just, you know, supplement our income if we weren't in such a dire situation.

30
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.260
Cynthia We: It would be so bad.

31
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That

32
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.210

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And I, and I want to, um, it has crossed my mind a couple of times and then I just didn't do it.

36
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it also struck me that I wondered if it would get done. I wonder if it would more likely to be done if we were right here in zoom and we're I'm hearing. You're both here. I didn't know if it would end up getting done right. So you tell me

37
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.600
Cynthia We: Nothing, I was looking for it. So I was going to do it.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, something

57
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.670
What was it

58
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.260
Cynthia We: I can't remember what it was. Now, but I wanted to send it to you. It was it came up right after we were talking about all of that.

59
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

60
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.750
Cynthia We: And it was about

61
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.320
Cynthia We: Oh, I know it was about abundance having an abundance mindset I might have sent it to you, actually.

62
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.690
Cynthia We: It and

63
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.540
Cynthia We: I know I sent it to Scott. The, um, there were like four things that you

64
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.000
Cynthia We: That you should watch for. If

65
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.940
Cynthia We: You have, you know, if you're blocking your abundance mindset. So Scott did the first two things, and I did the second two things.

66
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.410
Cynthia We: Really, yes.

67
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's

68
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.480
Cynthia We: So I didn't know what to do with it, but

69
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, are you telling me that you did a little exercise with Scott

70
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:53.160
Cynthia We: Oh no, I deserve. I looked at it and I determined that oh, Scott does those things and you know I was looking only for Scott I really wasn't looking for myself. And then I was like, oh, but I do those two things.

71
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, there is this mindset of

72
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I can either have this scarcity mentality.

73
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah scarcity, or I can be in abundance. Yep. And, but to be very clear. You can go at this awareness from many, many different places, can we rewind a little bit and see where we left off with some of the things that we were putting energy in last week and see, see how you did. And

74
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.230
Cynthia We: Can we, okay.

75
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So believe it or not, it is relevant to this notion of abundance and scarcity, it's still, it's still applies. So let's rewind back to this awareness of parenting.

76
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

77
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.050
Cynthia We: Teagan and

78
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do and we had some idea I threw out some brainstorm contingencies. And you took some notes and yoga. What happened after you left

79
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Our meeting.

80
00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.010
Cynthia We: Well, we

81
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:09.570
Cynthia We: We talked, we talked about that we, I talked about it with take an animal about about the fighting in the car.

82
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.470
Cynthia We: And I'm

83
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.830
Cynthia We: And I said, I'm going to

84
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:31.710
Cynthia We: I'm going to pull over. If this happens again because we cannot we can't be doing this and I told Tikkun that I was disturbed that he didn't listen to her and listen to her say no.

85
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:33.960
Cynthia We: And that he didn't stop.

86
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:52.500
Cynthia We: And I told Lola, that it was an absolute no no that she should not be hitting she should never hit right no matter what. And that she needs the come to me first, or like that can't be her go to. So I did talk to both of them. It hasn't happened this week.

87
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:54.450
Cynthia We: The fighting

88
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.230
Cynthia We: I don't know.

89
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.560
Cynthia We: I don't think that means that they are

90
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:11.430
Cynthia We: That they're listening to me, necessarily, or that they're, you know, worried that they're going to get in trouble. I just think that

91
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.600
Cynthia We: Maybe the opportunity hasn't come up

92
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And you wanted to also experiment or at least I proposed a small behavior request.

93
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Around kitchen. Yeah. How did that materialize for or not.

94
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.600
I'm

95
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.270
Cynthia We: Scott and I are in such a pattern.

96
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:51.450
Cynthia We: That even though I said I need to be the one that talks about this. Um, I didn't. I added and I have I avoided and I like

97
00:09:53.100 --> 00:10:00.090
Cynthia We: Disappeared and let him do it. He did it just because I hadn't done anything. So that was like the first night.

98
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.280
Cynthia We: And then I'm

99
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.650
Cynthia We: The second I like I can't really remember exactly.

100
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.410
Cynthia We: But he handled it like three days and then

101
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.230
Cynthia We: The other day

102
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.310
Cynthia We: Well, last night I was in charge because he was gone.

103
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.690
Cynthia We: And he was playing video games with his friends.

104
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:38.100
Cynthia We: And I did my same pattern of letting him letting him letting him letting him, you know, asking him to get off as can get off as can get off.

105
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.480
Cynthia We: And

106
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:44.250
Cynthia We: He

107
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.820
Cynthia We: He did. Finally, and he did his issues.

108
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.510
Cynthia We: But it wasn't because I tried my new tools.

109
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your opinion of yourself around that.

110
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.070
Cynthia We: Um, I am very annoyed with myself.

111
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to that and what makes you think that you're going to be there for your daughter in the car.

112
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.070
So that she doesn't have to hit taken

113
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.650
Cynthia We: For that I feel like

114
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.680
Cynthia We: Well, I feel like I can I

115
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:41.760
Cynthia We: I think it's different. Okay. Keep talking. I think they're different. I think it's different to stop the car and talk to both of them than it is to demand to you can do the dishes, tell me the difference, um,

116
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:51.510
Cynthia We: Both of them. It's both of them the power struggle doesn't happen like it does when when I asked to do something.

117
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know when your daughter's there that dynamics change.

118
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.170
Yeah.

119
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about it.

120
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.950
Cynthia We: I'm

121
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.340
Cynthia We: I feel like they listened to me.

122
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.970
Cynthia We: A little more than

123
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.020
Cynthia We: And it gets really good at. He's really good at.

124
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:32.580
Cynthia We: Come on, just one more minute, you know, just five more minutes. And he's a good kid. So you want to give him that, because then you know that he will do what you want them to do. If you just give them that.

125
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:40.140
Cynthia We: And on the problem is that that always extends and extended extended so he pushes and pushes

126
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:41.760
Cynthia We: Um,

127
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.730
Cynthia We: But that that whole thing doesn't necessarily happen when it's with Lola him. It's more about the dishes that is

128
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.040
Cynthia We: That make sense, then I'm even making sense. I've met he's right next door. I'm

129
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:06.360
Okay.

130
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is it like for you. And this is just you to set to rain call. Well, was it like for you to be continuing to monitor for those additional minutes or hours of follow up to wash the dishes. What was that like for you.

131
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.750
Cynthia We: Um, I was trying very hard to remain focused

132
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.700
Cynthia We: And

133
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.980
Cynthia We: Not

134
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.360
Cynthia We: You know, just go do something else or just

135
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.490
Cynthia We: Work on the many things I have to get done so.

136
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you actually do during those minutes that you are trying hard

137
00:13:49.170 --> 00:14:02.160
Cynthia We: Today in that room but I vacuums like hey I add things to do. But I didn't go into another room so that I would remain, you know, he would be inside and outside

138
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How long. How long was that from the first time you asked him.

139
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.430
Probably

140
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.770
Cynthia We: Probably an hour.

141
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And what could you have done during that hour I could

142
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.120
Cynthia We: I could have

143
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.670
Cynthia We: Worked my business plan.

144
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you work on your business plan later.

145
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.220
No.

146
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.080
Cynthia We: I fell asleep.

147
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel about yourself and think about yourself that that's how that went.

148
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.150
Cynthia We: No.

149
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.550
Cynthia We: bit annoying.

150
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.890
Cynthia We: A little annoyed. Yeah.

151
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: With what

152
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.660
Cynthia We: All of it.

153
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.430
Cynthia We: So hard to sit down and work on this business plan.

154
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.650
Cynthia We: I'm

155
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.520
Cynthia We: I feel like I've gotten a lot accomplished this week editing.

156
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.350
Cynthia We: But that always gets pushed to the bottom, the business plan does. And that probably should be the priority.

157
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.710
Cynthia We: And

158
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.270
Cynthia We: annoyed that I've created this pattern.

159
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.770
Cynthia We: Of him pushing and pushing and pushing

160
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's talk about how it actually serves you though by continuing to be preoccupied with hovering in the same room.

161
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.130
Cynthia We: Hmm.

162
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it help

163
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.070
Cynthia We: I don't know.

164
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you didn't have to face doing something hard

165
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have to do the business plan.

166
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. Hard to do the business plan.

167
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.040
Cynthia We: Is very hard. Yeah.

168
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now you don't have to. I was busy, they're

169
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.750
Hovering

170
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've got a great excuse. And now you're tired.

171
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.710
Cynthia We: Yeah. OK.

172
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now another day is gone.

173
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That was real. You want to reinforce you have a good son, so you can sort of rationalize that but would it be saying he's a bad boy. If you said

174
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like the car. I'm going to do things differently. And that doesn't sound like I didn't hear that conversation. I didn't hear. Remember we were very meticulous about if you look at your own notes like how this is going to go.

175
00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:04.110
Cynthia We: Did that go, I said that I said that. Yes. And I felt very good and confident about saying it, and both of them listen to me.

176
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't do it.

177
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:12.060
Cynthia We: I did say that to the OH, NOT NOT ABOUT THIS. Well, I know I did say I'm going to do things differently.

178
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do differently. Did you

179
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.230
Cynthia We: do anything differently. Yeah.

180
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.670
Cynthia We: I said I would. And I didn't fairly typical of me.

181
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.460
Cynthia We: They probably

182
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.280
Cynthia We: Expected me not to do anything differently to say I would do some differently and not do it.

183
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.400
Cynthia We: Really annoying. I don't like that at all.

184
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay in there. There's clearly some energy pushing hard to keep things just the way they are, and it must be in service to you in some way that the other side this other way of being.

185
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There's gotta be some perceived threat going on about it. That just is just, it's not appealing enough to get you over there.

186
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stop going at it so directly

187
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's just pull back a little bit. We went direct last time we scripted it we were clear we were step by step. Let's do it come from a different direction. Okay.

188
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Just keep doing the same thing. We got to switch it up. All right, let's shift gears and I'm looking at this, you haven't been in group as much right so you're not getting the sort of week by week

189
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Development.

190
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of these resources. So you may have done some of them, the ones you have just tell me what they are the ones you haven't you go, I don't know what you're talking about the nuts. What we're going to do.

191
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, first one, the container where you in group when you develop a container. Something big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff. Does that sound familiar

192
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:54.480
Cynthia We: Know,

193
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Let's do it. So the invitation and group was and we can do it now.

194
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Use some imagery and picture.

195
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You've heard people say oh I compartmentalize that I didn't think about it. That's what we're doing. But we're doing it in a very on purpose way and it'll, it'll be a resource during some work. I'd like to do if you maybe some em, Dr.

196
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.000
Cynthia We: Oh, cool. So

197
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I've had some success with it through the tele health. I was uncertain that was going to be effective, but it's working, we're, you know it work. So I'm excited. So first thing I want you to picture.

198
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Something big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff.

199
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only that, but also comfy enough that the stuff will stay

200
00:19:51.480 --> 00:20:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We might end up wanting to put whatever comes up at the end of a session. Maybe we run out of time. We've opened up some

201
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Some bridges to old memories or current triggers or fret over the future. We've opened it up and there's been this experience of maybe intensity and we want to put it away and revisit it again together in therapy. But we've got to hold it maybe for a week.

202
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this imagery will serve to say this stuff that's coming up will stay in this container.

203
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what's coming up as I'm just inviting this imagery

204
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.910
Cynthia We: Well, first, I was thinking like a house.

205
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.950
Cynthia We: Okay, and then

206
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:51.210
Cynthia We: When you said it has to stay and you might want to recall it later than I thought, well, it should probably be something a little smaller than that was suitcase. But then that doesn't hold on myself.

207
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.650
Cynthia We: Maybe

208
00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It may involve. Why don't we think about how strong it would need to be for it to stay when she's figure out what the material of it might be

209
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.230
Cynthia We: Just yourself.

210
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You stay out doesn't want to come out with

211
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.110
Cynthia We: No, my stuff stays inside. If I put it in there.

212
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what material we

213
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.940
Um,

214
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:26.130
Cynthia We: Well, you said it has to be comfortable. So, metal is what I was thinking. But, oh, that's not very comfortable.

215
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So this containers made of metal so far. Now you notice that

216
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be comfortable. So let me ask you what stuff because you already kind of have this sense of, oh, no, it's, it's going to stay just fine.

217
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this positive imagery is this negative like what did what came to mind. We were talking about stuff that's a very vague.

218
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:57.930
Cynthia We: Term what came to my. Yeah, I was thinking all my stuff my real stuff here, plus all my emotional stuff. Okay.

219
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about emotional stuff because that's. This is an emotional tank container.

220
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me describe your emotional stuff.

221
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.900
Um,

222
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:15.630
Cynthia We: This that we're talking about with the kids up with Scott the stuff with a shame.

223
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.110
Cynthia We: Oh,

224
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.000
Cynthia We: All that

225
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And all that. Yeah. So do you want all that to be comfortable

226
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, not a question.

227
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.040
Cynthia We: No I don't necessarily want it to be comfortable

228
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then. Think of it like, how will it be kept in there. How will it be

229
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.880
Cynthia We: With the lid.

230
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We got a lid.

231
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.760
Cynthia We: Nice it and a lock.

232
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. Tell me about the lock. It's

233
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:53.850
Um,

234
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.690
Cynthia We: It's a combination lock.

235
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.940
Cynthia We: And I wouldn't a combination on the

236
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.170
Cynthia We: Back so I can remember it.

237
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's written on the back.

238
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

239
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What should we call this container. What do you think it is.

240
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.650
Scott

241
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Stuff. Okay, and let's give it a little bit more form because all I see is metal

242
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:23.340
Oh,

243
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.010
Cynthia We: It's a box.

244
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: metal box. Yes.

245
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It holds all my emotional stuff about kids Scott shame and all that. There's a lid and a lock COMBINATION. COMBINATION written on the back. Is there anything more.

246
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.230
Cynthia We: Um, it should be shiny.

247
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: shiny metal box.

248
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a sense of how big it is.

249
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.490
Cynthia We: It's like as big as the backyard.

250
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:57.630
Okay.

251
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:00.870
Okay.

252
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that feel like it's big enough strong enough to hold all of the stuff, the emotional stuff.

253
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.090
Cynthia We: Oh, definitely. Yes, fantastic.

254
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do the metaphors, the figures of a protective figure a nurturing figure. Yeah. So what was your protective figure

255
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:26.850
Cynthia We: Um,

256
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.510
Cynthia We: Did I say Jim Shaughnessy

257
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I can

258
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:40.440
Cynthia We: Oh, I said uncle Fred and then and then after that, after I changed. I changed it to Jim shot and see

259
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're leaving it as a combination or just

260
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.460
Cynthia We: Yeah, it could be either or, but I think Jim shot us he's better

261
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then that's what we'll do. And you get a real sense of the protective

262
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.390
Cynthia We: Embodiment and Joe. Yes.

263
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Any chance you can help me with how to spell Shaughnessy

264
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:08.610
Cynthia We: S H A YOU G H and E S S Why thank you and nurturing figure

265
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.680
Nurturing figure

Cynthia We: Salary or Lori. Lori or Sally.

267
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.270
Cynthia We: Do you want, but I want Sally, I think.

268
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this just didn't get dropped into this note.

269
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: On didn't move this is should be able to stay in there now it'll move with us as we continue

270
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's in this plan section, which will stay static, it shouldn't get deleted. Sorry about this inconvenience. If it's causing inconvenience.

271
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:40.800
No.

272
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking about why Sager, just kind of what figure comes to mind.

273
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.560
Um,

274
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.780
Cynthia We: Did I say Jim Shaughnessy for wise figure

275
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you did for protective. I don't know what

276
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.210
Cynthia We: I'm wise figure

277
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.860
Cynthia We: Oh, a bob mer my writing teacher

278
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Moment just

279
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of picture this this moment, maybe just use it.

280
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: In the context of

281
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting to

282
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Have followed through. Maybe with what was going on with chicken and the dishes just imagining that was with you. Was your team.

283
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Of Jim Shaughnessy and Sally and Bob

284
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: With you surrounding you. If that's what feels right.

285
00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: A part of you or immersed or some kind of presence, just see if you can

286
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring that awareness.

287
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Really close just bring about that imagery of that team being available to you.

288
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up as you use your imagination.

289
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.250
I think they've made me stronger.

290
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.310
They've made me feel stronger.

291
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.670
Cynthia We: And calmer.

292
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.050
Cynthia We: I can handle anything

293
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.180
Yeah.

294
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And with their presence.

295
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you can handle with taken when it comes up.

296
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:05.730
Cynthia We: I'm

297
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.200
Cynthia We: Back talk in his

298
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.310
Cynthia We: Refusal to comply.

299
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: you'll handle it. Yeah.

300
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.240
Cynthia We: They using my tools. Yeah.

301
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do another metaphor.

302
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a distancing metaphor.

303
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be your own, but I'll bring up a couple just to kind of get the creativity juices gone

304
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just picture that you're maybe on a shoreline and

305
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something that you want some distance from maybe it's shame or maybe it's some of that negative emotional life.

306
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want it to be drifting further and further away. Maybe it's a river, and you can see on a leaf or on a log or some sort of boat or raft.

307
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're seeing it move further and further away from you but you're still there on the shore, but it's not getting closer and it's

308
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a distance moving further and further away, or maybe it's the ocean and you're on the sea on the shore and it's on the sea and it's

309
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving away or maybe a train and it's on a car and it's

310
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of traveling for their distance away from you, or maybe something else.

311
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a metaphor that we might use

312
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If, let's say,

313
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's feeling as if you're reliving something

314
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead

315
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We could put it at a distance.

316
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up.

317
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.230
Cynthia We: A river I'm putting it on a river, it's floating away.

318
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it floating away.

319
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: On a leaf. Okay.

320
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I've got that here in case we want to use that at some point down the line.

321
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, obviously, any of these things that you and I are doing right now.

322
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be using anytime you want to.

323
00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just as effective as feeding a belief of this is too much.

324
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This, I won't handle you can with effort, turn your attention to what was that stuff. Whenever there was talking about.

325
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I want to send inadequacy.

326
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I want to send shame away.

327
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to distance. And what I want in my presence is to maybe by

328
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: On the on the river with with this team just to be present with that as I go and I do something difficult

329
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You can spend time doing that, you're going to be reinforcing those neural networks in your brain and the other stuff will give a chance to prone to dissipate and to weekend.

330
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you spend all that time they're reinforcing it

331
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It just strengthens

332
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a metaphor that science.

333
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can take what we're doing in metaphor and change our brain.

334
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But you gotta do it. It does take effort and it will be effective when you are a little bit activated a little bit because something important is going on your role as a parent, your ability to meet uncertainty and

335
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, not liking confrontation and all of that, when you're in those moments. Those are learning opportunities.

336
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To do the symmetry and be different.

337
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Not when there's zero at stake when it's just nothing when there's just nothing on the line.

338
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not as impactful.

339
00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's also not effective. It's so activating that you're dissociating or in rage, it's not likely to be an effective learning moment. It's going to be right in the middle.

340
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about that.

341
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to plug in a few right now I'm looking at this, the suds thermometer the subjective unit of distress.

342
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be instrumental also down the line. Is that a term I I've said to you.

343
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.530
Cynthia We: Know, okay.

344
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it sounds really robotic and kind of weird, but it's super handy for me to be able to register how distressed. You are during an activity to see whether you're starting to become unconscious or whether you're so activated that that availability.

345
00:33:50.850 --> 00:34:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Of integrating new information is just, it's not there. So I want to put some stories in here so I can register kind of where that is. So right now, I'd like you to kind of picture this scale of zero to 100

346
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's, you know, events memories. It could be a somatic experience you have access to pretty good meant like you have access to some memory so so

347
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the body stuff will come a little bit later, but right now, try and pull up an event that feels like about a 50. It's not the worst thing that's ever happened to you.

348
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the most

349
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like relaxing moment. You ever had. Maybe you know your body at that at zero may have been really relaxed and

350
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It just didn't have much of a care in the world. You know, you were in a relaxed body and your mind was kind of at ease and at peace. Then up there at 100 is I'm so angry or I want to run. We'll talk more about the the freeze piece which is maybe below zero.

351
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And when we start to dissociate. Some people, that's the case. They go unconscious. They are in so much distress were fighting and running are not an option.

352
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But a fainting can happen dissociation a freeze threat response can happen.

353
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you. It's not that I'm not so paralyzed that I can't take action and I'm not so enraged that I can't even think straight. No, I'm, I'm kind of I can think I have access to my frontal lobe. I can reason I can plan. I can organize

354
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: All of my brain is working out of 50 of distress. What's an event that comes up to mine.

355
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.850
Cynthia We: I'm having a hard time thinking of an event.

356
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then let's go a little bit more extreme and we'll get there. We'll try try it. Okay.

357
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.790
Okay.

358
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

359
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to say it out loud, but let's see what happens when you go all the way up.

360
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy crap. THE WORST MEMORY

361
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.100
The worst thing.

362
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a sense of really knowing this is this was at 100 of distress my body, my mind, everything was just this is not okay.

363
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

364
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:35.760
Cynthia We: I'm feeling like 911 or or like instances in my family and

365
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me.

366
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.230
Cynthia We: Well, I could easily say that day.

367
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: 911 11. Okay, got it. And what were the emotions that day.

368
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.570
Cynthia We: Fear.

369
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.320
Cynthia We: Fear.

370
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Your fear.

371
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.120
I'm

372
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.740
Cynthia We: Confusion

373
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.280
Cynthia We: That I'm emotional thing. So, um,

374
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it. You're confused. Sure.

375
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.620
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think that that's that's about it.

376
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.260
Cynthia We: And then relief.

377
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

378
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.180
Cynthia We: You know, after we we were trying to get our methadone.

379
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:52.470
Okay.

380
00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:00.780
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's that 911 for normal reason it's not 911 because I was on methadone.

381
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's the belief about yourself during that time.

382
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.210
Cynthia We: I believe that I

383
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.950
Cynthia We: Did it like I

384
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.260
I'm

385
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.840
Cynthia We: I was successful in my mission.

386
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.010
Cynthia We: And I held it together.

387
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:37.830
Cynthia We: I was starting to fall apart. But I held it together enough to get done what I needed to get done and I was successful.

388
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does that say about who you are.

389
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.380
Cynthia We: Cuz I can. I'm much stronger than I believe I am

390
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

391
00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is it, do you know you're strong

392
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.310
Cynthia We: Uh,

393
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:12.900
Cynthia We: When I remember these things, things like this. I know I am. But I think on a regular basis. I don't think I am.

394
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.270
Cynthia We: You know what I mean like it.

395
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember how your body felt back then.

396
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.590
Cynthia We: Yeah, I had like a stitch in my side.

397
00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:31.590
Cynthia We: And I was I'm

398
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:39.660
Cynthia We: So sore from racewalking so fast like walking so far.

399
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:41.490
Cynthia We: And I'm

400
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.310
Cynthia We: I was almost numb.

401
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And what were the thoughts running through your head.

402
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:58.620
Cynthia We: We're not going to. Oh, we've got to get. We got to get the methadone. We've got to get into town. We've got to get there.

403
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.030
Cynthia We: And

404
00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:09.660
Cynthia We: I didn't really think too much about what was going on outside. I just needed to

405
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.020
Cynthia We: Stay focused on my mission, which was to get to the Methadone

406
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was going on outside

407
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:28.440
Cynthia We: Ball. Well, the towers were following and people were covered in grey cement and there were sirens everywhere and police and

408
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.120
Cynthia We: All these posters, why not. Can people really sad and

409
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.200
Cynthia We: All this just

410
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:46.170
Cynthia We: Like chaos was happening around me and I stayed focus

411
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.050
To get to the

412
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: End. How much distress 02 hundred. Would you say that was

413
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we've got

414
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a couple minutes. Once you do share with me a little bit about what what was important about today for you what you noticed about yourself.

415
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:37.950
Cynthia We: I really don't like that. I don't follow through on things when I have, I get excited about something and and I'll, I'll have a plan in my head that I'm going to do this. And then I don't

416
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:50.940
Cynthia We: I really don't like that. And it's, it happens in a lot of areas of my life. And it's very frustrated. It doesn't make me feel good about myself.

417
00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:00.120
Cynthia We: So I'm glad that I'm the debt. I think I don't know that you pointed that out to me, but it was pointed out to me, I'll just say

418
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important you noticed it. You don't like that you don't

419
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.720
Cynthia We: Like it. Yeah. Not a good trade.

420
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.960
Cynthia We: Whatever, for whatever reason, it's just, it's something I don't want to be like

421
00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you take a little bit just literally five minutes. And when you leave me here, would you write down

422
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What it does

423
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To help you

424
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get to stay never finishing

425
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How it helps you try not to get in your own way and just put your pen on paper and go let that free association happen just free flow, let it, let it out, write it down, how it goes.

426
00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:58.410
Okay.

427
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, I wanted to offer if it turns out it lines up. Do you feel free to text me I'm willing to meet with a couple clients this weekend, just let me know. Yeah, so

428
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.140
Cynthia We: Just saying. Yeah, I, we will want to do that.

429
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:17.040
Okay.

430
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:25.770
Cynthia We: Yes, that is excited about doing it. He's thrilled that we're doing this and thrilled that we're putting together a budget and

431
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.450
Cynthia We: He really was frustrated that he couldn't work it out this week so

432
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys have the the outline. You guys could do that. I'm like, okay, my notes. If you guys could show up with your notes.

433
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:43.410
Cynthia We: Yes, we can.

434
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish it, that'll be our objective won't be a lot a lot of processing and we'll finish. Finish.

435
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.070
