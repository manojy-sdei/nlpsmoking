00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:14.970
Michael Hoefer: Did you ever. You know when you were in prison or out of prison. Did you ever have like work with a therapist like somebody that you would meet with regularly and talk for five minutes, an hour. Yeah.

229
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.340

Michael Hoefer: You know, and you're you feel safe, being in the room, sit down with people and this is a way for some people with trauma issues and anxiety issues. I think this type of communication is actually better than being face to face with somebody and being out in the world can be really

239
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.480
Michael Hoefer: aggravating and kind of activating, you know. Yeah.
