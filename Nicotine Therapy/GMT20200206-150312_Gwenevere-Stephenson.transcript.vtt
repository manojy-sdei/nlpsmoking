00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.540
Jen: Hi.

2
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

3
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, make it a little note open for us keep track of what we're doing. Um, but I can certainly listen also

4
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

5
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What's kind of going on in your life these days.

6
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.010
Jen: Um, things are gearing up to get very busy.

7
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.570
Jen: The play that I'm directing we begin rehearsals, a week from Sunday.

8
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:50.400
Jen: And so that's like slowly like starting to become more like because I'm the director. So I'm starting to get questions more like I just did an interview with this.

9
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.380
Jen: Journalist LAST NIGHT FOR THE ALBUQUERQUE arts magazine in Santa Fe.

10
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.000
Jen: And who I love, she's a talking Broadway reviewer.

11
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:13.800
Jen: So I've, you know, we've crossed paths for like the past decade. And so it was really cool that she reached out to me about it. Um, and the play is. It's called actually

12
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.750
Jen: By an on an animal Ziegler um and it's about sexual assault on a college campus and it, it is between an African American man and a Jewish woman and

13
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:39.990
Jen: It is just those two characters doing like monologues to the audience and then scenes with each other. And it's intense it totally brings up how

14
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:56.970
Jen: You know his experiences a black man in the US and just like a man in a patriarchal society and how like his experience goes into what happened that night, and it also her experience as well and

15
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:11.640
Jen: It's just, it's intense but it's such a beautiful fragile delicate complicated story and I am so excited about it like it's such a passion project that

16
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.440
Jen: So that's really cool.

17
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.190
Jen: But I'm also feeling just because when I have rehearsal and work.

18
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.680
Jen: It's just kind of hellish for about five weeks of my life.

19
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:38.610
Jen: Because it's just you know going to work all day and then going directly to rehearsal. So I'm usually doing like 10 to 13 hour days depending on how much I work that day, um,

20
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that impact.

21
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, food intake emotional eating exercise regimen. Like, how does that impact the things that have been kind of working for you.

22
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.330
Jen: What God such good questions and I am really glad because that's why I really wanted to kind of talk about this today.

23
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.300
Jen: Because it usually like it results in usually like I don't eat all day at all.

24
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:17.460
Jen: So I get to some point in the day where I feel like nauseated. And I have a headache and I feel like I'm going to fall down and I don't know why. And I'm like, oh, it's because you have not eaten.

25
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

26
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.570
Jen: And then exercise goes out the window as well because I'm just tired all the time.

27
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:36.630
Jen: Although to be honest exercise hasn't been a consistent part of my life for a while. So I think now that it is I get to kind of see

28
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:57.810
Jen: How I do that. But basically, I'm, I'm trying to just come up with like very regimented scheduled weeks, especially when it comes to food specifically like I really want to dedicate my Sundays. Unfortunately, Mondays. So they have Monday off during the day, which is wonderful.

29
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.250
Jen: For doing like meal prep.

30
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.800
Jen: Which are things that I've

31
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.960
Jen: heard people talk about and watch on YouTube.

32
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.780
Jen: Been sent you know articles.

33
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.970
Jen: I've referred to many times but have honestly like never done with real intention. Okay.

34
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I can certainly tell you it works.

35
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It works.

36
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.710
Jen: And that's where I want like I want so bad to just go to the refrigerator and like grab it.

37
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

38
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.080
Jen: And I know what it is. And it is exactly what I need to nourish me and yeah

39
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm not a nutritionist or anything, but you know it being a parent in a pretty large family. Typically when there's a window of, hey, I have good energy I I've kind of thought about

40
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: For me it's about two or three meals. So let's say you know I caught I shop at Costco. So there's huge chunks of this these portions are huge.

41
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's this huge amount of chicken and in one setting. So let's say you know actually Sunday I made chicken cordon bleu chicken.

42
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.640
Oh, yeah.

43
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I put cream cheese and using

44
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.650
Jen: Laura.

45
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the Swiss so that's already made but I already have the chicken out my answer gooey. So then I make the chicken parm basically behaves the same way. And now I have these two things.

46
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them is frozen, which can actually be portion, because there's so much and it's just to you. All right. Yeah, but you also might be thinking, if you're not bothered by eating the same food. You also have lunch. Once it's prepared you have for lunch and

47
00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I find the vegetables, don't, don't really bode well to freezing. And so, that tends to be on the fly. Yeah, but, um, you know, if song. If you're open to little Leafy, let us things or

48
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.660
Jen: We my husband and I did the jar salads for a while and they're phenomenal. I don't know if you're familiar

49
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Look that up. It's so cool. So you get you have like a mason jar.

50
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.020
Jen: And you put the dressing on the very bottom, and then you follow it with like

51
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:38.310
Jen: Cheese or girl bonds or beans or something like that, followed by like onions, followed by like cucumbers, like the denser things and then when you have like the greens at the very top price. And so then, like you just take it with you and you shake

52
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.610
It.

53
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

54
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.990
Jen: Just fan of shaking salad because it's the perfect way to dress your salad perfectly

55
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, yeah, I love that. I'm going to give them

56
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A TRY. So now, it happens to be. I have this huge Tupperware and I already have cut up

57
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When I do is I use a when you call those things, it's blood, not a blender. But chops everything. It's a chopper so

58
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.240
Jen: Yeah, I'm familiar, it's like it.

59
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so I do carrots cabbage. I'll put some sweet onion in there and

60
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And then some of the mixed greens. I'm you know maybe it's kale or whatever it is. So it's all chopped up and it's in this huge thing. So when I walk in, when you say your, your jar. It could just be scoop and plop in data.

61
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

62
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's already prepared it will last a week. It doesn't get frozen. Here's cabbage sweet victory. Okay.

63
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I add I put in on my own later because it's shared with other people. I put in the tomato or I use almonds, some people

64
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like them soggy. So I don't put them in there. I'm not fun. I'm not a fussy person. So it doesn't matter. But the idea is it's already in there. And then I'm

65
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: At a you know when kids are coming home or whatever I've put it in the oven, it's cooking is prepared and maybe, you know, oh, I'm here real quick. I'll steam something up or I've got this rice cooker and then I've got the rice gone

66
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but mainly it's the meat that is the prep thing and it's it's a fun thing I make sure you know this might be time where we play and we hang out, we do it together.

67
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I've got. MUSIC PLAYING So I make it a fun experience. It's not a yucky one. Definitely. Yeah, what would work for you. You think

68
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:41.610
Jen: Of i've been i've been kind of making notes as you as you spoke. Um, I definitely I this weekend I intended to purchase Tupperware

69
00:09:42.600 --> 00:10:01.080
Jen: Because we're at a point in our Tupperware where we have like for their oddly shaped and it's wrong. And I want to have, like, yeah, I want it to be like a very neat and organized like ready to go. So I think that I want to do that initially and then, um,

70
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.850
Jen: I really liked the idea of the the greens like especially if it's something that like holds up over

71
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.290
Jen: Here.

72
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And peppers, see the yellow and red bell peppers. Hold up. So you blend those in there and basically my salad is they're all these tiny little bits.

73
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:31.260
Jen: That is so helpful though because of my structure like it because raw vegetables are really hard. And so I think I want because maybe I can get a bullet. I think that's what you're talking about.

74
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. I have a, it's a food that food processor. I happen to have one I fell in love with this. The second one I bought

75
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A it's a food processor. Yeah. And so you just it just shops it into these little bits. Yeah, goes a lot faster. I used to cut it by hand. And no, I don't. And then I put in

76
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So the nuts. Cover the protein because if it's a, yeah. You don't want to risk maybe out

77
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Without being cold or something I don't put meat and and I'll just put my protein will be in the nuts. I might glob a little bit of hummus in there. I might put

78
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the dried cranberries. Okay. Yeah. So it's basically a taste explosion. There's so many different tastes going all over in there. No. Totally, yeah. And it stays interesting but I'm not a fussy. Like, I don't care if I eat the same thing. Like it doesn't bother me so

79
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:28.740
Jen: I am the same way. Yeah, as if my husband. God I adore that about him like he really, he will eat anything

80
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.730
Jen: Prepared and put in front of him. He's like, awesome.

81
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.130
Jen: I love even more about him is that if it's vegetarian or vegan. He's more excited

82
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, yes.

83
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:54.900
Jen: Yeah, so that's awesome. I think that that's also something that I'm struggling with I. We had a very, uh, I wouldn't even call it a fight over the weekend. I like had an explosion. I would say like intense

84
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.030
Jen: And

85
00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.760
I realized that

86
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:18.780
Jen: I had kind of been letting some things go from him for a while. As far as like, just like tones, he would take with me or like him slacking on like the household stuff and it kind of resulted in a

87
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:31.860
Jen: He just said, this one comment, um, because I was scrolling through I was looking at someone's Twitter feed and they were just being trolled so hard.

88
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:43.950
Jen: I hadn't really seen it, something like that. Like, I've seen you know Twitter threads where someone is you know trolled by someone who, it does not agree, for lack of a better word, but it

89
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.890
Jen: And, you know,

90
00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:04.440
Jen: It obviously happens I'm not an idiot. Um, but this was particularly intense and I said something like, wow, I like push it away. And he was like, what, and I was just like, just she's getting trolled. He was like, yeah, like first time here.

91
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.770
Jen: And it was it was three words. It was three words.

92
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Here with that what happened.

93
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.300
Jen: So I was just like,

94
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:32.310
Jen: I just felt so pissed. I felt like it was so loaded. I felt like he was, you know, just making this comment, and I think it goes back to, because it's a it's a theme that has gone on our relationship.

95
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:57.210
Jen: Since the beginning of it really is that he he's a very, very politically informed person and gets very irritated that everyone else is not as informed as him nor cares to be as informed as him and I actually am a person who cares to be very informed and

96
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:09.360
Jen: So the way it feels is that sometimes it feels like he's loving me in with

97
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:22.980
Jen: Everyone else who is wildly uninformed, it doesn't care because I'll say something off the cuff that seems indicative of something here, if that makes sense. And so

98
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.380
Jen: He said, Those three words, he just said for some here and I

99
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:49.530
Jen: I gave it a little bit and I was just silent. And then I said, I am struggling. Like, I think he tried to like like make conversation with me as if, as if everything was fine. And I turned, and he said, I'm not okay and I'm playing with your use of the phrase first time here.

100
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.100
Jen: I was great call was very direct.

101
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. Okay, then what

102
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's an explosion. I'm curious to see how it gets there.

103
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:09.270
Jen: Well, that was what was hard is that he was like, what

104
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.050
And I said,

105
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.160
Jen: Let's just fit. What were you trying to communicate to me in that moment.

106
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:38.340
Jen: That's where I was like, what were you trying. He's like oh my god I I don't fucking know I it was annoying. I was like, I mean, obviously. And I was like, right, right. I get it. So when you chose to use the phrase first time here.

107
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:47.610
Jen: Like, were you holding your love for me at the center of that phrase. Oh.

108
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:49.590
Jen: No.

109
00:15:52.710 --> 00:16:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's so interesting how, you know, even though we know so much about how to communicate and we're in, and it doesn't matter. It just goes out the window.

110
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you want to know from an outsider.

111
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.620
Jen: We have

112
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A beat that you missed

113
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm. Notice how you're you're being the almost the therapist in it, like, like you need to extract this you're working so hard, right.

114
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's what you found you found that skill, right, because you do it all day extract it extract it, but you're not the therapist there what you are. I'm guessing it's something like this.

115
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel undervalued unloved and unimportant and like, like those the same as the way you view these these ignorant people like I'm stupid and it hurts. Now I don't know if that was the intent, but

116
00:16:53.190 --> 00:17:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I found salted now it's the I feel they got missed so I was listening to listening to you, right, you were getting him to do it. You wanted him to do it you say what your intention was right.

117
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.340
Jen: Right. No, you're totally right. Yeah.

118
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:16.170
Jen: Cuz like then eventually, then I got there, but I was upset. So I was like,

119
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:33.900
Jen: It hurts my feelings. It hurts my feelings when you say that like it hurt. And then, then it was just like he, like, all I wanted him to do was soften and say okay by me that like

120
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I taught in that group.

121
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not in that group. Like, that's why I can say that to you because it's good.

122
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah but

123
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got it I with you.

124
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:55.860
Jen: So instead I got up and I like yell, scream so ferociously like just like it was like it was like the yelling was coming out of my pores.

125
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

126
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:01.110
Jen: It was. And I was like, You are the shiniest partner.

127
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:17.820
Jen: Oh, I do everything I do. Fucking everything I have the cannabis card I make sure that you have, we just spoke I do the grocery shopping I make sure everything shocked I cook. Make sure it was

128
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:27.180
Jen: It was just like I was vibrating with such intensity and then I like what did you the living room. I just sat there.

129
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:43.170
Jen: Just like catching my breath. And then he came out and like a hat and scarf and ago it was like I am gonna go and I broke down sobbing and was like, Please don't go. That is not what I wanted. And I

130
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.360
am so sorry.

131
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.060
Was ugly.

132
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so then it took all of that when our value of ourself.

133
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm valued like you look at this man and you see his values, right. It's so strong around this political accurate and

134
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Again and again there's evidence right he puts people in this kind of dumb ass category. And then there's these and right there. Is that right, and I want to be in that one.

135
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And and something about you, you, you look like you lost your own value of yourself as if that tolerance of him not valuing you and look what you did. You went on a dissertation about your No you didn't. Yeah, yeah.

136
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

137
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.660
Jen: dissertation about way value.

138
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm sorry.

139
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's like, I don't know what you're doing because he doesn't see you as an invaluable and that was you I think definitely not being able to just go

140
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

141
00:19:54.210 --> 00:20:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and, and for some reason I'm thinking the right it's that phrasing it the meaning and making out of

142
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: First time here is that I just thought lumped in the dumb ass pile and I today. Today, I want you to see me as this.

143
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: smart intelligent politically savvy woman and that phrase somehow does that what you meant, right, look how much faster that might have gone if you could have sat with it, you know. Yeah.

144
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.240
Jen: Well, and it was interesting because like

145
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:42.000
Jen: I feel like over the weekend, like when things would come up that would trigger that feeling of me.

146
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.640
Jen: I would say that. Uh huh. And

147
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:58.020
Jen: It was interesting because he got to a place where you said, you know, the truth is, sometimes I

148
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:09.480
Jen: Do want to punish you feel frustrated with you and I do say it mean on purpose and

149
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.760
Jen: I was like okay like. Thank you.

150
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

151
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.570
Jen: I was like, I felt like

152
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:29.100
Jen: Really validating it like that must have taken like a lot to say. And thank you. Yeah.

153
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.690
Jen: Do that, in the future, like me.

154
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:52.620
Jen: But then I said, I realize now that what happens is that when I tell you that you said something and it sounded pretentious or condescending, or when I tell you that. It hurt my feelings.

155
00:21:53.010 --> 00:22:05.130
Jen: And whatever response you have for some reason doesn't communicate to me that you care that you love me. That's right. Yeah.

156
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about enough

157
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.020
Jen: Yeah.

158
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you get him to the point where, first of all, do you know what would feel like love at that moment. And did you ask for it. Is he willing to do it. How far did that get

159
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:28.020
Jen: So yeah, so that's when I was like what I need from you is for you to be able to like drop whatever like

160
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:42.900
Jen: Frustration or anything to just make sure that you that I know that that isn't what you're trying to do that. You're not trying to make me feel bad that you don't want me to feel bad and like so. Can you like

161
00:22:43.920 --> 00:23:01.290
Jen: soften your body language. Can you like hug me. Can you hold. Take my hand and look into my eyes. I'm like, can there be like a physical touch. And then, can there be a softening of tone in your voice. Yeah.

162
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.630
Jen: And what you like.

163
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What he said he will. He was like, I will try.

164
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.070
Jen: But I can't promise that I will fuck up.

165
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Did he say what would be difficult for him in those moments. Does he know I get in the way. What might get in the way.

166
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:31.920
Jen: He says that it's so hard for him in the moment to let go of whatever transgression. He feels has transpired and that

167
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.550
Jen: It feels inauthentic.

168
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.070
Jen: To

169
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:44.910
Jen: Like give me a physical touch or do these things or soften his tone. If he doesn't want to

170
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.720
Jen: And that was really difficult.

171
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.140
Jen: For me, because I was like

172
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.300
Jen: Can you do it in like 10 minutes

173
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:08.070
Jen: Like, can we take a 10 minute break and we'll time it and then we'll come back and see if you could do it then, like, because I can understand

174
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.380
Jen: That you might not be able to just like

175
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:15.390
Jen: turn on a dime and like, give me the exact like response that I want.

176
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.460
Jen: But

177
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.240
Jen: Just in the interest of kindness.

178
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.900
Jen: That's all that I

179
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:36.330
Jen: Leading from you in that moment. And so even if it's like, Can you do a meditation on hiatus for five to 10 minutes and then we can revisit it

180
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.280
Jen: And he said he would try

181
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is know

182
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.860
Jen: That. See how it goes. Yeah.

183
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:45.810
Jen: And

184
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you also offer an alternative

185
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what you're asking for this physical

186
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.140
Jen: Stuff. Yeah.

187
00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be harder. Harder to overcome. Yeah, then getting a recipe of just using

188
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I can write mirror you and I can actually validate what you're saying you're not a crazy person. It makes sense. You would have come to this conclusion into this emotional reaction. I actually, I do understand it and let me show you.

189
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And he explains it because the nice thing about certainly the way I explained mirroring and validation is you don't have to agree with the person what it's saying is I'm just this mirror is showing back. I heard you. I'm not going to defend my position or stack up all my arguments.

190
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: About how you're wrong and crazy and not valuable, it's just

191
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, really being present with what you're saying.

192
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's quite what you want, but

193
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:51.990
You know,

194
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.360
Jen: I love the way that you put that

195
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.440
Jen: As far as like mirroring

196
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.580
Jen: Because it doesn't have to be that you agree.

197
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.020
Jen: That like I feel like that just opened up so much for me in so many ways.

198
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.140
Jen: Probably will for him to

199
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It gives people permission. Right, so

200
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I status and mirroring and then later on validation right away or things I teach because it immediately hugely changes the landscape.

201
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this, this means off because a mirror doesn't Sam up or net doesn't say I have really long lashes. It just tells me you got a bunch of makeup on. You know, highlighted hair.

202
00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so like it or not, there it is.

203
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's these neat there's these neat phrases, I guess, over the years, I've come to do it. Maybe everybody does it that way, as I say,

204
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The mirroring person right we get it in our head.

205
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show this person. I'm listening. Yeah, I can listen that much I can do. I'm not going to let her know

206
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I agree with her. I'm not going to portray my own experience, right, if they can kind of see themselves as what this is doing is it's a both and flooding this person know

207
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going through something important and big. And I can, I can hear it and let you know I can let it in and you're not alone in this emotional experience.

208
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.210
Jen: Yeah.

209
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And the phrasing is

210
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we mirror. We say, Did, did I get that right.

211
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And and then, you know, is there more so that would give him a some structure and real solid pieces to have structure and know what to say. If the hug is impossible because you know I am.

212
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I imagined I think this comes out of the Mongo stuff that I I don't even remember where I learned things anymore. But I think it's probably from the Mongo.

213
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

214
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If that physical context. Not possible maybe having some way to communicate it, you know, verbally. Well, let me let me at least let you know what I heard you say, what's your concern is

215
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm hearing you say is, and that's the phrasing. What I'm hearing you say is this. Did I get that right, and just even that because if they use the wrong word.

216
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That will be wrong. It will feel wrong if they use the wrong emotion word especially um it's going to throw you off. You'll say, Well, actually it was it was irritation. Okay. It was irritation.

217
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And did I get that right. Yes. Is there more sometimes they're literally isn't and you can find your way back to self validating where

218
00:28:45.300 --> 00:29:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Those seconds before. So you lost yourself into this external validation need and and just hearing someone let you know you're not alone in this can can be enough sometimes. Absolutely. And I wonder, does he ever say

219
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It does he ever identified because I don't know how you present if if anger is an aspect when you're sharing your vulnerability. Does he ever say it's hard to do that because there's there's anger present or he perceives anger. Does he ever say anything like that.

220
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.880
Jen: Um, no.

221
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.470
It's not an issue.

222
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you're vulnerable and saying, if you do your part. Let's say you were able to tap in instead of because we showed up with was

223
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the armor to protect the underbelly, and so he sees that maybe he's thinking, well, she's going to be asking me to do this. And what I'm going to see is rage.

224
00:29:41.760 --> 00:30:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: resentment and anger, but the gift. Here, the agreement if you're amenable is I'm going to do my part, I'm not going to blame me for my feelings. I'm going to say I feel insulted less than whatever your truth is right. And when you say that and and unimportant to you and

225
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad yeah feared that you won't love me that I'm going to be letting you know.

226
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That right when you're owning your own feelings. He doesn't have to guard up he doesn't have to then brace himself and and when we're being attacked. It's really hard to give someone that space of holding tanning and listening.

227
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you did your part, then maybe he'd be able to do that mirroring. I don't know.

228
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.010
Jen: No, I love that.

229
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:33.690
Yeah.

230
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it has felt and looked like magic.

231
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.570
Jen: Lately,

232
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because in the end, don't y'all end up talking about what motivated us to begin with. He didn't have talking about the feelings and that's what motivates us. You had a threat response. There was no danger, and so he was like, I don't know what is going on.

233
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I don't understand you are ru perceived some serious threat there. Yeah.

234
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.370
God

235
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.750
Jen: Well, it's because I do that like

236
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.270
I was

237
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:28.560
Jen: Well, and I was the thing too is that we had the flu like it was it was such a like, Oh, God. There were so many things going on, like, because I it was the end of the week after I got back from New York.

238
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:51.240
Jen: I was totally exhausted Joshua got the flu Thursday and stayed home and I felt it. Come on Friday morning, but I, there was no way I could miss work. I like I had nine clients. I had a like I do, I had to go like it just wasn't an option when I say that I look back and I know that it was

239
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.080
Jen: But I did not want to go without money.

240
00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:03.660
Jen: So it wasn't so it really pushed myself and by the end of that day I was just

241
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:15.960
Jen: Okay, like I was so physically exhausted and ill, and then I also had helped you know nine people process their shit that day.

242
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the whole that's that real basic stuff. And I don't mean to simplify it, but it's really a truth.

243
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so true. My okay I'm taxed. I am spent I'm not good company. I'm probably going to be, you know, on my land needed nerve endings today and I apologizing in advance, you know, that's right, and you're about to head into five weeks of it so

244
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: They I think now I want to throw something out. I am working with a few people in this program thought I throw it out to you yeah doing couples work.

245
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really fun.

246
00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm I've actually met when I have visited Santa Fe and in Albuquerque and have done been able to. It's kind of cool.

247
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. I know. But if you wanted to. If you wanted to take the pressure off of you. I could go over and instruct and teach you know two or three sessions or one you wanted

248
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: On I statements and you guys are so you're so smart. So, you know, savvy probably wouldn't take very long. And then the mirroring. And then, then it's not you being therapist, then it's neat in therapist and

249
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Get him.

250
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, if you want to tell you

251
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.220
Jen: That if we could work out a time that would work.

252
00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.610
Jen: It like do you do you do anything like it later.

253
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.740
Jen: Like because I imagine, let's family time

254
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In there are a lot. There's a lot of obligations later I have noticed. So one is to winter his days when he is actually home what times of the day and days.

255
00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:05.040
Jen: So he is he leaves the house at 7:30am and he's home around 5:30pm Monday through Friday. And then all day Saturday, Sunday, but

256
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I say you work on Saturdays, though. No. Okay, so I have been seeing people, most recently.

257
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: On on Saturday. So I saw some I think for people last Saturday.

258
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.300
Jen: Oh my god.

259
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I now, but I will be forever because at some point, I'll say, Okay, I got to have this back but

260
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.700
Jen: Understand. Well, can I talk to him.

261
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. You just let me know what you want and throwing it out there.

262
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.900
Jen: I really appreciate that.

263
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You got

264
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.550
Jen: It. Yeah, I know that he has the idea has

265
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.890
Threatened to have in the past like he doesn't like the idea of going to therapy.

266
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.900
Jen: And I have

267
00:34:49.950 --> 00:35:02.550
Jen: wanted him encouraged him for years and to his credit, he is pretty good about like reading and like incorporating his own coping skills, etc. Um,

268
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe selling it a little differently. This is not like all forever.

269
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.690
Jen: Today,

270
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I'll always, always be yours. I'll always no matter what the bias towards you. I can never be your, your couples therapist. That's an impossibility.

271
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also have this really good capacity for objectivity. And so what you could sell this this idea of

272
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey sweetheart. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm going through a lot of changes and this would give you an opportunity

273
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of talk to me about it if you wanted to, but ultimately what what one of yours offering is this this very precise.

274
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Really structured way of communicating and it's around owning our own feeling and it's it's very precise and it might actually mitigate the length

275
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative intensity of our arguing and we might be able to really enjoy talking a little bit

276
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Easier those arguments won't last as long and what she could do is, she'll just teach it to us. She won't be going into content. There's no analysis. That's what I've been doing. I say you guys could talk about a bullet vs. Food processor a benign.

277
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care what I'm you know what showers are better than bad as that's going to be your content, don't care, you can learn this skill now and you because this is yours forever go use it.

278
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This would just be me teaching a skill, where you're not having to both be you know lover partner, your wife, and then therapist to

279
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And it will empower him because you know you have all this knowledge. And wouldn't it be nice for him to know kind of how to communicate with you because you have this grasp on all this communication and you know insight, etc.

280
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can sell it more like, you know, we're thinking, this might be a neutral place to add

281
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.590
Jen: Perfect, yeah.

282
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Not therapy not therapy. I wouldn't use the word of the

283
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:12.180
Jen: Day. Is it like I think that like like she, it would be helpful for her to teach us some techniques. Yeah, just first

284
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.930
Station.

285
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So the other thing I was thinking about, we went into this this other discussion is I was thinking about back to the food. I was thinking about. Are you comfortable at all with crock pot.

286
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:34.980
Jen: Oh, that's so funny. I because I was gonna say I crockpot is like my we call it our wife.

287
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Okay, so

288
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:56.370
Jen: Yes, oh my god, I love crockpot I have like one of my favorite ones that I do a lot is, it's just boneless, skinless chicken breasts and on a bed of, like, who's sorry. Oh, what does he want. Um, and then a can of mushroom soup cans of chicken soup.

289
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:11.910
Jen: Uh, and then I kind of like, we'll just throw in whatever like frozen worries. I have, um, and then or sometimes I'll wait to like the last hour and I'll put like broccoli, because if you put broccoli at the beginning, it's bad.

290
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like you're making a chicken Stroganoff

291
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The most fun stuff. I wonder. Oh, that's me.

292
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.360
Jen: Oh god, I love it.

293
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've already got that. So it being a fun a fun thing and and really seeing it as self care really seeing it as

294
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take it does take effort, but if you can sort of say, I'm worth it. I'm worth this investment right in preparing for these weeks.

295
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, right, from my perspective, I don't want temptation. I don't want this idea of I'm overwhelmed. I'm so and now slips in that old I deserve stuff. I, I just want to

296
00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep an eye on it.

297
00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:07.950
Jen: I agree. Well, and especially because the vortex is the name of the theater where I'm directing and I've done a lot of shows there and it's very close to this water burger and

298
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:17.850
Jen: So I end up playing being like, I will just grab water burger. And granted, I always try to get they have a really nice like grilled chicken wrap

299
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:41.400
Jen: And then I'll get like a small fry. But still, like, I really want to avoid that. Yeah. And so, uh, yeah, I'm excited to see how this meal prep goes excited to like find new recipes, um, because I like to experiment with that I'm probably going to start with chili.

300
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I was about to say chili. I've done both chili some white been waiting with checking in. And then also, I'm regular Chile and I've to give away from some of the red meat. I've been using because of Costco. Right. So they have this ground turkey and it covers up the yucky taste.

301
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:10.920
Jen: I actually, it's funny because I was raised on ground turkey, like with that Turkey tacos like turkey enchiladas turkey burgers and so I prefer it.

302
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:27.510
Jen: Oh, good. I'm actually, I'm fairly addicted to pull tree like the amount of, like, I just want to check in, like poultry chicken. So yeah, I definitely have gotten over turkey. Now, I really don't like turkey very much but I like chicken chicken.

303
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I like it because it's important at me and you can't taste it in Chile.

304
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've covered that I'm talk to you to do. Okay, this is we weren't gonna

305
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.400
Jen: Just one second. I need to get my charger or my laptop.

306
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:48.270
Here.

307
00:40:51.690 --> 00:41:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So I see it's about time to review goals. So maybe I can make a couple little statements here. Yeah, I see. I'd like to not eat refined sugar, one out of seven days a week. How are you out with that.

308
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.900
I am doing well.

309
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.230
Jen: I still have

310
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:18.570
Jen: Days that I have more sugar than I should. But

311
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.820
Jen: Excuse me. Um,

312
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:33.120
Jen: It is less than it used to be. And I always have. I've got basically my husband has gotten on board. He just does what I do.

313
00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:40.230
Jen: But Sundays are just no sugar days.

314
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

315
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.870
Jen: So I just focus on that has to be. Yeah.

316
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your one day.

317
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.770
Jen: It is totally you're doing it.

318
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So, yeah.

319
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.630

Jen: The fourth will be the Oscars. So three so far. Oh, three weeks.

322
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. All right, for you because we didn't say how long, you'd be doing it. It was just whether you could do it all in is in and of itself.

323
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: is reached. Yes. You want to set another one, or do you want it more to be about the duration of doing this particular goal.

324
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.680
Jen: Yes, let's do duration, I would like to

325
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.620
Jen: Let's say, so we've been doing for three weeks. Can we say for five more weeks. Yep.

326
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then quick little statement on i'd like to increase the number of days I exercise from zero days one day a week 30 minutes

327
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: For four weeks where yeah

328
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.590
Jen: Definitely completed.

329
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.580
Ah,

330
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.070
All

331
00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.110
Right. That will say achieved.

332
00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.650
To

333
00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just make a little note. Yeah, you had gone to Palantir class I talked about Nia with you last time. And so just let me write a little note about what you've been doing so we can have it the most up to date, what you've been doing

334
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.470
Jen: Just walking

335
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:29.520
Jen: I got back into the walking after the cold front kind of went away.

336
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days a week.

337
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:37.680
Jen: I'm actually at least two. There was one week that I did three was that last week.

338
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want you wanted was 30 minutes. How did that actually get there.

339
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:54.870
Jen: Yes, but it's only 30 minutes one day a week. The other one or two. It has been less. But one day, week I always get to at least 30 or 31

340
00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. All right, and will will close that one because you do. Okay. They want you to, is it one day a week.

341
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:06.840
All right.

342
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This cut

343
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:14.970
My achieved.

344
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I see, I would like to increase my tolerance for pain.

345
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk on the ninth hour. This is the note on the night report stomach pain makes connection to interpersonal stress and gut distress. Yeah. So I'd like to increase my tolerance for pain because this is a very subjective reporting so heavily, you're going to have to tell me

346
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:56.430
Jen: It's so true.

347
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:58.770
Jen: Um,

348
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Tolerance

349
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.090
Jen: As far as the tolerance is concerned, um, I think that the

350
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.650
Jen: Good. I know that.

351
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:27.270
Jen: Through I'm tolerating the pain like just doing that or like choosing movement as opposed to taking something

352
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:32.370
Jen: Whether it be pill or cannabis or what have you. I'm

353
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.400
Jen: Choosing movement.

354
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:43.740
Jen: Change changed the way I feel like I relate to my body and my pain.

355
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.660
Jen: And so

356
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.630
Jen: Um, I have increased my tolerance for pain.

357
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.320
Jen: In doing so, I feel like

358
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:07.440
Jen: Either my pain has reduced or my understanding of it is different. I'm so sorry I'm like blob of like

359
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What i know i mean how would probably know the difference. Right.

360
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.020
Jen: Yeah, totally.

361
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's take a real close look i'd like to increase my tolerance for pain increase. We didn't have a measurement because it was I didn't do this sort of scale thing. So it's a little hard to see if it happened.

362
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We can close that if you want an open one that is more relevant for you. So check in with have I increase my tolerance or equivalent my pain has gone down if you breach that then we can say achieved and we can create a new goal. What do you want to do.

363
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:57.810
Jen: That's what I would like to do, let's do it cool. It's cool. I really like the top you're wearing. I don't know if it's a dress or a shirt, but I really

364
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Know. Cool. Thank you. Okay, so today in section.

365
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.030
Say this

366
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Sound out. What do you, what do you what goal. Take your time on this because this time I'll do see if I can find a way to catch you some sort of number two, to be able to sort of measure a little bit, but what do you want to do more of what do you want to do less of

367
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.050
Jen: Um,

368
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.830
Jen: I'm so sorry.

369
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:43.170
Jen: Does it do you feel like it needs to be around pain tolerance or can this be anything

370
00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:49.890
Jen: Anything. Oh, okay. Yes. Um, I would like to increase the

371
00:47:53.310 --> 00:48:00.090
Jen: Amount of intentional meal prep or a intentional eating I'm

372
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:04.320
Jen: From zero days a week.

373
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.470
Jen: To two days a week.

374
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:09.330
Beautiful.

375
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody can do that.

376
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:14.880
Jen: People goals I

377
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Medicaid training you know my just stuck with me.

378
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:21.390
Absolutely.

379
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like things in quotes. So that's your goal. And that's actually what the objectives going to be, I think, because you fruit in it so beautifully true. That is the engine. So I'm guessing you know in your own wording is it something like and then you tell me what the truth is.

380
00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to eat more intentionally I want to eat healthier somewhere in there like a little bit like a broad broader stroke of a goal.

381
00:48:52.050 --> 00:49:01.770
Jen: Thinking, I want to eat more intentionally really, I feel like the word intention and the idea of intention has been really stick with me lately.

382
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a nice word in conscious unconscious yeah I'm conscious like because sometimes will be eating, you're like, I don't even know what have I been doing

383
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah, yeah. So we will purchase to increase, which is to increase

384
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Make that an eye increase

385
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Meal Prep from zero days a week to two days a week.

386
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

387
00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Any number of meals.

388
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:59.010
Jen: Yes. Yeah, I'm having trouble with how to quantify this because I'm kind of coming up with a plan in my head like, I want to make like overnight steel cut oats and like put those a little Tupperware is for like morning breakfast and I compare that with like a fresh piece of fruit.

389
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:08.610
Jen: Yeah. And then I'm for lunch. I can do the salad jar and

390
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:27.150
Jen: I can put like a cheese stick on the side or something like that. If I need and then for dinner. Those can be crockpot plans and I can probably do like a crock pot like every two days and we could just eat the leftovers from the crockpot from the night before.

391
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.430
Jen: So I think that

392
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.450
Jen: Like I feel like I could probably be more like, you know, five days a week or

393
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.000
Jen: Four days a week.

394
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And Angie, we're going to go get Tupperware

395
00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:50.970
Jen: Yes Tupperware and and four days a week of intentional meal planning. I'm beautiful. Yes, yes.

396
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: For us, if there's anything else reliant ok so

397
00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The

398
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Substance Use one, I would like to decrease my tendency again only you can measure that.

399
00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To rely on drugs to solve my problems. Now, you use the word drugs, but

400
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be a lot of other behaviors compulsive behaviors, whether its food or sleeping or you know whatever the thing

401
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So in your, in your own assessment. Have you been leaning towards relying on a solution outside yourself or leaning on solution.

402
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you have the answer whether it's meditation is exercise might be some mindful intentional practice.

403
00:51:49.980 --> 00:52:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We're addressing the core problem. You've got the solution or drugs now maybe you'll rely on maybe healthier, more sustainable solutions have you been doing it as a tendency. Have you been decreasing your tendency to rely on substances, yes.

404
00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:12.900
Jen: Yes, I'm

405
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.600
Jen: Both through the physical activity, um,

406
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.470
Jen: Well, I guess it

407
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.680
Jen: I'm not sure how to do because the vitamins are really making a huge difference.

408
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:31.950
Jen: And I know that those aren't

409
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.320
Jen: Like they're not. I want to say they're different from drugs.

410
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: mind altering they're not mood altering they

411
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Are good

412
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:43.860
Jen: They are, yes.

413
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.870
Jen: It was a dumb question. Thank you for your day.

414
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:56.010
Jen: Have a but I think that that's like intention intentional like a really with every

415
00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:03.090
Jen: Thing that I say and do I really want to be thinking about it.

416
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:04.890
Jen: Intentionally

417
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.430
Jen: So yeah, um,

418
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:16.980
Jen: I have met that goal, or at least. Yeah, because I've decreased it it is definitely less than it used to be.

419
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.200
I think so too.

420
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And what are you left with as far as how often you have been reaching to, I'm assuming, things like marijuana or alcohol. I like to put food in there if we could you didn't identify when you originally wrote this or said it.

421
00:53:40.440 --> 00:54:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at your own week just look at the last couple weeks just scan it and see where right you reached for those things for a quick solution. A quick escape. Yeah, but the underlying distress remained and it really but you did reach for how many times a week.

422
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.570
Jen: Definitely at least six

423
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Six days a week. Yes.

424
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:19.710
Yeah.

425
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.590
Jen: And like, um,

426
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:32.730
Jen: I think what's different is that I usually like what's different now is that I will do something else first

427
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:44.010
Jen: I'm like, I'll drink a glass of water, I'll eat something all move. Um, I'll stretch, um,

428
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then are you talking about ingesting marijuana

429
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.740
Jen: Yeah. And then, um,

430
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:59.280
Jen: It's either marijuana or

431
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:13.620
Jen: Like my sciatica has been really awful lately and so Gabba Penton I'm using that to help with the nerve pain. Um, and then Advil

432
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you may want to cut yourself a break with the Gabba pen and the Advil not mood altering

433
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.910
Jen: Okay.

434
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't give a euphoric effect. So I don't think they create this escape.

435
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:43.140
Jen: Oh, definitely not. Okay. Yeah, right, not escape. Well, and that's the thing, too, with the cannabis. It isn't really to get high. Um, it was to treat pain.

436
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Media oil or does it have THC and

437
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:51.840
Jen: Definitely has THC. I just say because I take pretty high.

438
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:55.770
Jen: Edible doses, um,

439
00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.840
Jen: Depending on how much I take and how much pain. I am I don't feel euphoria.

440
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's revisit this remember one of the warnings, you gave me when we first met was, um,

441
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know how you said it anymore.

442
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:19.170
Jen: Oh yeah, something felt like I'm sneaky and like I yeah

443
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Be careful of me right. I'm very, you know, I've got this

444
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I can say one thing, but there's a deeper truth to something maybe that might be what's going on. Yeah.

445
00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this one, I would like to decrease the tendency to rely on drugs to solve my problems is at the heart of why you're here.

446
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't, I don't want to let it go just yet. Totally. So I guess I'm feeling a little bit like maybe we could revisit it again. Let's keep looking at it and maybe sharpen how to and that might

447
00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold you accountable if we get rid of words like tendency and make it more measurable. You may not be ready for that you might find yourself going, No, I still like that wiggle room. I still want to be able to

448
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To wiggle around yeah it out there because we've developed some rapport. We've developed some trust. I'm thinking. So now I'm pushing a little harder.

449
00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:30.060
Jen: No, absolutely. Well, and even as you just said that I was thinking about like that. That wasn't the question that was asked, um, it was like, Have you reached for it to feel. Hi, um,

450
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:37.980
Jen: And so I feel like when I look at that over the last two weeks, the amount of times that I have done that.

451
00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.150
Jen: And actually follow through with it.

452
00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.690
We've been three times. Okay.

453
00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what would feel like progress because I remember it was a decrease it was I think it's coming back to me, hey you know I'm in this program and

454
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm not sure I want to cut this out all together. I just want to decrease delicious. Look, let's look at days of the week. Why don't we just look at that.

455
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What would decrease. What would be a number that meets your goal. How many days a week reaches your goal that you'd be ingesting THC or alcohol.

456
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:29.880
Jen: I'm at all, or to feel euphoria.

457
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, to solve my problems. Okay.

458
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:37.560
Jen: Well,

459
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:48.870
Jen: I don't think that I want to. Well, I think at this point. I don't want to

460
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.040
Jen: Decrease it to

461
00:58:54.690 --> 00:59:01.980
Jen: Eddie day. It's like, I don't want to, I want to be able to have it daily. If I choose

462
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To solve your problems.

463
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:07.710
Jen: All right, to solve my problems. Thank you.

464
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:10.050
Jen: Jen.

465
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice, you're on, just notice what's happening just pay close attention to how you're feeling. If you're having a threat response if your body's having a moment where there's something important going on. Yeah.

466
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:50.550
Jen: Yeah, I would like to get to a point where I never use it to solve my problems.

467
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.060
Jen: But we'll get to it.

468
00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. There it is.

469
00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:03.270
Jen: But for right now. Um, I would like to do it, let's say, five days a week, as opposed to step up.

470
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And you move very quickly. And I wanted to real quick. Get behind what was it like to say that out loud. Before you digressed

471
01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like to say what you just said before you went to second part.

472
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:18.930
A

473
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Repeat the big goal.

474
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:30.270
Jen: Right, I would like to get to a point where I never use THC to solve my problems.

475
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now how do you feel in your body, saying that out loud.

476
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Very strong you do do

477
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.200
Jen: Like, I feel very

478
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.530
Jen: Well maybe shaky still strong

479
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No idea. That's great. Shaky stoic

480
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.250
Jen: Like it's it's a

481
01:00:54.420 --> 01:01:03.180
Jen: It's a knowledge that I can and surprise and shock that I know that now.

482
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.140
Jen: Sorry, I realized that were like

483
01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.370
Jen: Over time. And so for us, the purpose of us like I've got to get out of here.

484
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So right there. Just, just just let's end today with just gently going to acknowledging where you've come from.

485
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was a little bit right at the end to make sure you heard, I'm not committing to it. And I heard that second part two, but just sit with having entered it having said it out into the universe at all.

486
01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, versus the word tendency which is more of that warning that you are giving me that I'm slick. I'm going to do this thing. But to say I would like it.

487
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So compare that.

488
01:01:52.200 --> 01:02:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of who you were, how you were when you first came in here just sort of split screen it and see. Here's Jen saying that out loud.

489
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this how she was when she came into the program and see if it looks exactly the same. It looks different.

490
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.230
It looks different.

491
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You like what you see

492
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:23.310
It.

493
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

494
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We can end on that note, good.

495
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've already got that invitation out there, you're already kind of thinking about food prep. Yeah, thinking about maybe threw out some of these communication skills that I'd love to to do with the both of you, if you wanted to just to take the pressure off of you.

496
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Can feel what it's like to be supported at the same time right as your sweetheart.

497
01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's out there. Um, so when you want to meet again, it's good to have another book so no one takes absolutely

498
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.210
Jen: Just a 20th at nine work. Yeah.

499
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds good. Then I will see you then. Do you need any medication or everything is all hooked up.

500
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: They do actually

501
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And right now, you have remind me people move around a lot. You still have brielle or all of them.

502
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:22.590
Jen: Are real

503
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:28.290
Jen: Which are brielle god, I can say Gabriel this whole time.

504
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: More depends on the day. I, I do sometimes she does a, I don't know.

505
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Dishes name anyway. Her name Smith.

506
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She's an old hippie.

507
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: My thanks

508
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:45.600
Okay.

509
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um,

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so dogs.

Jen: And then I'll be a group on Monday.

512
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need anything, but the size of your printer thing thinking of your supply of Gabba Penton and if there's quantity and and anything else. Nope.

513
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.420
Jen: We're good on everything she

514
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be in group Monday. Yeah. Okay. All right. I will see you then.

515
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:16.380
Jen: Have a good day.
