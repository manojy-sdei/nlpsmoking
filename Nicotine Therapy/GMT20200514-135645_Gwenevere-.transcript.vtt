Gwenevere Abriel: James Johnson.

2
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.389
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, James.

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me, check, check.

4
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Check.

5
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.340
James: Audio

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.030
James: Can you hear me.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me okay, good, good. Sounds good audio. Let's see how long it last. Um, I saw you checked in earlier with virtual clinic. Thank you for for getting there on time. That really that was helpful.

8
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.410
James: And then, and then Sorry I'm late to this, I dropped my phone in my battery popped out. And I was like,

9
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.600
James: A club, it's time to put it back.

10
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Together. Okay. I was wondering, cuz I was like why do all that work to get in there early and then

11
00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Show up here eight minutes late, but okay. So we're here. Let's, let's, we won't run through all of that. I appreciate the apology and you know what it gave me time to do was to poke around on the internet and

12
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll wait. First what happened last night. Normally I hear from you. I get it. Yeah. Yo,

13
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.100
James: What happened. Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.050
James: I got distracted. I was playing video games. I just got shocked. I forgot to respond.

15
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. And there was some chance that I was like, Well, maybe I should book someone else because he ain't gonna be there.

16
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But I didn't book anyone, but there is it you do run the risk when I don't get a confirmation. The night before I do worry that people are kind of have kind of given up and walked away from the program.

17
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So definitely try to at least say yeah

18
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.610
James: No, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. You don't have to be fancy with

20
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.680
James: No good.

21
00:01:43.980 --> 00:02:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But listen, no problem. What I did is, I'm, I'm not gonna lie. It has been on my mind. And it was all I could do to not text you but I didn't want to be a pain in your butt. Um, I wanted to say, Can you take a picture of your as fat book.

22
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's somewhere in your dad's house and you don't know where it is, or did you find it.

23
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you find it.

24
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.850
James: So I haven't found it know about the one of my mom's

25
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.630
Oh,

26
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have to. Are they are they like because I was, I had to kind of see what the heck this thing was. And so then I found as fab. There's all kinds of testing books on it. And there's also a website.

27
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you like is your style. Are you more of a learned really yeah I can pull it up because I saved it on one of my bookmarks just now. Um, are you one of these learners that it's got to be. I need to. I need to write it out or are you a

28
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: auditory learner where you kind of need to hear someone explain it, hear it over and over, because some people don't know the type of learners that they are some people auditory or kinesthetic, which means they've got to like physically do it.

29
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people are they thought it visually kind of write it out and see it and so taking notes is really important and practicing themselves right in front of themselves is really important.

30
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what kind of alarm or you are

31
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.570
James: I'm a hands on and

32
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:41.940
James: Whoa, I don't know. I know I said I think I'm all day. Because like I could get it when people tell me I could get it when when people show me. And also, but I get it. The Muslim hands on.

33
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What about what's the troublemaker. What about with math.

34
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.600
James: I'm

35
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.090
James: Hands on

36
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Hands on. Okay, so you're going to be

37
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.120
James: Gotta be like we're

38
00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Working out the problems. Yes, that's pretty common, even for people that one style of learning is their typical approach, but there's something about writing it out. So for example, let's say I'm in a lecturer and I decided to bring my laptop and I'm typing.

39
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I will retain the information as well as if I'm handwriting it out.

40
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's this

41
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is under this I can be typing, because I can type without looking at blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really thinking through it's not in in this working

42
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Workspace like a desktop. I'm not thinking about what I'm typing. But when I hand write it. I'm actually thinking about what I'm doing. So I could really see how practicing

43
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be useful. So you know where it is that your mom and is that because your mom drug it out or you happen to your eyes landed on it or you went looking for it.

44
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.660
James: Kind of came across the other day that I was at her house.

45
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Where was it

46
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.160
James: It was in my room under some shit.

47
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you kind of it just surface stuff you swipe something off and there it was.

48
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.160
James: Yeah, basically.

49
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this the same, it is it is it as bad for Dummies book, like, you know, concrete work building a house for dummies building a framework for who those books which kind of book, is it or is it a formal one

50
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.510
Yeah.

51
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.580
James: I know, I know it's an actual as fat book.

52
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is it for 20

53
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, bless you.

54
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it for 2020 2020 2019

55
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.820
Oh,

56
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.750
James: No, it's for, like, maybe, I don't know, it's kind of old, but not too old. Recent enough

57
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Math don't change that much. Right.

58
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.540
James: Now now really

59
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.560
James: Hasn't changed all up after all those years.

60
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but they may have in that book that you have. Did you flip through it and see if they have practice tests in there.

61
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.710
James: Yeah, they have practice test. Okay.

62
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like when you when you looked at it. Did you member thinking anything in particular when you saw it this week.

63
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.770
James: No, not really.

64
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.670
James: I gotta

65
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.930
James: Go.

66
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta go through it. Okay, so you sounded just now. Like you didn't know that there was

67
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Online.

68
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

69
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.670
James: No, I didn't know there was online as folk

70
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this is what I just ran across. Now, this is like almost zero research. So I think if you really put effort you could find a whole lot more than I just did. I just pulled it up while I was waiting for you. This is one of them. So here's one.

71
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you create an account and it's going to give you exact a 750 questions and you can

72
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's asked about for dummies, I guess, I don't know. You create a little account and you can nose around in depth rationales know why you got an answer wrong. That's great. So it'll I'm assuming it's like that XL learning. I think, I think I showed that to you. Did I, did I show you accelerating.

73
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

74
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I can show that to you too, but anyway.

75
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What I like about me. Yeah.

76
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.490
James: Yeah, is that he showed me

77
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

78
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good. Because when you get it wrong, that's when you really learn something, because then it gives this long explanation about how to solve the problem, which is what we need a teacher for

79
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And so hopefully when it says in depth rationale, you'll know why you got the answer wrong thanks to detail so it'll explain it. That's great.

80
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so what I said something else to get

81
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: poked around in here is cool.

82
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.180
I know

83
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This was, this was what I just did.

84
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There was another one, though.

85
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

86
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you have you know where it is that your mom's but you don't hang out there that often right

87
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Do you

88
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.820
James: Yeah, no.

89
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:48.750
Okay.

90
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.280
No.

91
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's go into, what do you think would have happened if

92
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I had texted you.

93
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, send me a picture of your as a book at your dad's house, your first response would it have been screw that lady or would it be. Oh, cool. She's, she's trying to help me remember to do this thing I want to do which which version of that.

94
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think have been

95
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.720
James: In here, that would have been more like, hold on, let me find it.

96
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh really, so it would have been a helpful nudge.

97
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.980
James: Said, it would be like on hold up. Let me find it.

98
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay, good. So that's a good thing. So the message I hear from that is you won't be pissed off at me.

99
00:09:45.180 --> 00:10:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay. So let me go down to Oh good. And then I am happily surprised me. It's okay if you are but I'm just saying doesn't help you reach your goal that way. So let me go down to your, your, I want to join the Navy or Marines.

100
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.100
James: And I wouldn't be face.

101
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. Um, so what if

102
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We set that as a goal between you tell me if this works for you that all you gotta do is find it between today and next group.

103
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And way to demonstrate

104
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. And all you gotta do is take a little snap, but it's got to be something that's like in your in your dad.

105
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I know it's in your dad's house. And it's not that one over at your mom's like, somewhere that obviously your dad's house. Like, I don't know, something

106
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Unique about your dad's house like his address or your room has a certain look to it. I don't know. Something where it shows us in your house and then then you've met that task.

107
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

108
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweet, do you have an idea of where to look.

109
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: First, yeah.

110
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.030
James: Yeah, I'm down.

111
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. So I'll put that as a little something. I'll be our first

112
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.500
James: Maybe

113
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Where might you look first under a bed in a box in your garage. What do you think, and

114
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.120
James: Probably somewhere in my room. Okay, I just have to go through some stuff. Okay.

115
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm so send picture of asset book and dad's house.

116
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Before what's Monday the 18th. I'll say, how about honor before so you can procrastinate right up to last minute if you want

117
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Will say on or before

118
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: 518

119
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

120
00:11:52.140 --> 00:12:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you welcome a reminder, so you might, I might send just a little picture of a book or I might send a little emoji. Just a little nudge since you told me that it's not going to piss you off or offend you.

121
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like you might welcome a little reminder

122
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.910
James: Yeah.

123
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Great. Um, I had a chance to look at this stuff.

124
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just real quick, yeah.

125
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.820
James: Is there a delay on the audio.

126
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, yours is really delayed you'll, you'll be talking

127
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the sound comes after it.

128
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty comical

129
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.970
James: Yeah, I could tell

130
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.490
James: Sorry.

131
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not your fault. Um,

132
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll work with what we got.

133
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go to, um,

134
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, oh yeah okay so

135
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Another thing you're doing okay. How often are you, is it running in your head. Oh man, I want to drink 10 times a day 100 times a day, once a day zero times a day, maybe only once a week, how often is it coming at you.

136
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.120
James: Not that often. Maybe once once once a week if that

137
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.200
Really

138
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not very honest and that's pretty good. That's

139
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's that that wasn't like that before about how often were you thinking about it when you first maybe had the that breath away machine, how often were you thinking about it.

140
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.300
James: About every day.

141
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, was it. Okay, good. So that's some progress before it was about every day. Are you surprised that it has decreased to only maybe once a week.

142
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.740
James: Yeah yeah

143
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:23.880
Huh.

144
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.380
James: And I'm glad I did because I really fucking hated drinking, because all it did was fuck shit up.

145
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.370
Yeah.

146
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Last time we we did a lot. You did a lot of work around

147
00:14:52.590 --> 00:15:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting really clear about your sort of dynamic between therapy between, you know, can I can I trust you know going to your is this worth my time. Can I do this and I'm noticing this morning.

148
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I right, is that you're not quite, not quite as irritated with this morning as maybe you were last week. Does it seem like the irritations gone down even a little

149
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.650
James: Yeah, I think so.

150
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see it too and looks like you're able to actually show up. Get in even early to virtual clinic. So when that your attention went down a hole. I got some kid knocking on my door. Hi.

151
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: There's otters. Take a picture. I'm so pissed. I've been waiting 1314 1516 1718 1928 years to sea otters and I'm in here and I can't see him.

James: timber wolf.

230
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.510
Oh,

231
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.500
James: A timber wolf.

232
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

233
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.640
James: Oh, yeah.

234
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's see. I'm noticing around in your treatment plan here.

235
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear a little bit about if I

236
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you sneeze.

237
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Season.

238
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How is

239
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.130
James: Hmm.

240
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we did

241
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The scheduled worry time. Did you try it. Forget it, do it once never do it totally forgot how did that go

242
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.560
James: Okay, did a couple of times, it went. All right.

243
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:17.820
Okay.

244
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you mean. Remember I was telling you about what it's like to do it half assed versus doing it exactly did you do it halfway or totally the way

245
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of taught it to you.

246
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.920
James: I did it the way totally taught it to me.

247
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So, how many times did it wake you up in the middle of the night, either with worry thoughts or you couldn't go to sleep with them. Um, did you write them down on the side.

248
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:03.870
James: Oh,

249
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:17.670
James: I didn't even write them down or anything because it's like I was actually able to sleep after I did some of that meditation. He told me to do, or that whatever the fuck he said to you. Okay.

250
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So is the meditation is the meditation, the one

251
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The mindfulness breathing or all the progressive relaxation

252
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.070
James: Yeah, progressive relaxation and the mindful of breathe breathing.

253
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So once you did that. Did you go up all the way through the body and then progressively back down. Did you do all the way up and then all the way down.

254
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, fantastic. Well, let's add that is sweet.

255
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.050
James: So you did it like once or twice.

256
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Cool, cool, cool. So now we know we've got a couple of things that worked.

257
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: At least once we got progressive relaxation

258
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we have the belly breathing.

259
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And that turned that turned enough attention to the body and away from the the monkey mind that you are able to fall asleep.

260
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Far out. So the only

261
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The only piece that would be handy is to write the stress thoughts down. The only reason why I say that is because those are the things that you could be worrying about at eight o'clock at your 8pm scheduled

262
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Stress session.

263
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.650
James: Worry time

264
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Or time

265
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me just see something. Did you set a set an alarm. Did you remember what to do. Did you have a list to do. And did you actually sit there and worry and eight o'clock or whatever time instead of fourth

266
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm guessing. No, but

267
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.320
James: No, just kind of like sat there and like, that is to say the

268
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:45.000
James: Yeah, I sat there and I just kind of like thought about like what to like to worry about and everything. And what we talked about and then

269
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.520
James: I didn't write anything down or nothing like that just kind of

270
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.580
James: Like meditating, per se, and just sat there and thought about everything.

271
00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's there's a there's a reason why writing it down is is special. Why not pieces there.

272
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's a really bad today. Sorry about that.

273
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna do a lot of hair flip it on the session.

274
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

275
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had written it down.

276
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it would, let's say, let's say on your phone on a notepad. You know, like notes in a little note app and you right I'm

277
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Will I ever find a girl as hot as so and so or will I ever be able to trust again will ever have the house I want will I be able to finish this effin program or whatever, you know, whatever your thoughts are you write them down.

278
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when it's eight o'clock you look at it and you sit there and you just force yourself to do worry, worry, worry, worry, worry

279
00:29:52.680 --> 00:30:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very different than relying on your mind to remember what to worry about. It's something different happens

280
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So we found out a couple of

281
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So I invite you to do it. Remember, all the way through.

282
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you can come back and say,

283
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I did it. I, I wrote them down right before I went to bed. I noticed I wanted to be worrying about A, B and C. I wrote them down on the side. I put them in my phone and then

284
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I worried about them in the middle of the day right on time and I sat there, because then you can come back to me there's still this second piece.

285
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That I don't know if it works yet there's still this is what we did learn though isn't it progressive relaxation works belly breathing works. That's fantastic.

286
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's stuffs free that you can be doing that anytime you want to.

287
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.140
James: Yeah.

288
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, like, let's say you're about to go, let's say you've studied and studied

289
00:30:53.910 --> 00:31:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly, yep you studied and you're about to take a test, you could be in your in your car progressive relaxation progressive relaxation belly breathing belly breathing. You could develop a mantra. I'm the bomb. Doesn't matter what I do, or whatever we you

290
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, cultivate something positive mantra.

291
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then all of your brain is operating effectively and you can use it again if you run into a problem while you're taking the chest. You can do this thing gills. It isn't just for going to bed right we can use it to regulate your heart rate.

292
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.080
James: Yeah, I know what you mean.

293
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can use it anytime you want to.

294
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do keep practicing that just so that it gets habitual so that you have access to it and it's remembered because things will get pruned. They'll get forgotten. If they're not practiced a lot. That's really awesome. So keep practicing that

295
00:31:53.730 --> 00:32:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so that says to me that maybe you had. Did you have a few nights of sleep.

296
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This week that you had maybe six to eight hours asleep.

297
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.240
James: Yeah.

298
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, how many days a week. How many

299
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:13.590
James: Yeah.

300
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.540
James: Maybe these past two days three days three days.

301
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That your brain functions better when you've had six to eight hours of sleep.

302
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.130
James: Yeah.

303
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.360
Hmm.

304
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.070
James: Less era. Plus, I feel more well rested enables actually

305
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.450
James: Get my ass up and come to Susie's groups. Yeah.

306
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all connected. Isn't it less irritable right more reliable. I mean it all. It all comes down to

307
00:32:53.670 --> 00:33:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's so important. And I'm really glad that you brought it up because if I if I hadn't heard that business about the sleep. I wouldn't have known that we needed to address.

308
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece of that. So let's keep our eye on that one. If it, if it starts getting where you you are still not able to fall asleep, just tell me, but I usually ask I'll usually say and getting enough sleep, or even how relationships. How's your mood. I tend to

309
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's part of kind of my routine. Okay, so

310
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing.

311
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What are you noticing the this last week around

312
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Was this theme that you had

313
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What you say, Oh, I'm people being disingenuous and people being dishonest people not being direct and giving you straight information.

314
00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How, in general, are people this last week and you noticed people have been kind of honest with you, or you've been noticing the same old, same old people not really that honest.

315
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.160
James: Same old bullshit.

316
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Where does that bullshit usually come from.

317
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.000
James: People

318
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.280
James: Because random people

319
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so those are customer. So, aren't they,

320
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: random people customers, right, or are, where are you running into random people

321
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Screens frozen on it.

322
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.250
James: Back.

323
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm here.

324
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm. Oh, I was asking if you, you were saying random people, the random people are those customers that you're noticing or kind of followed it.

325
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.960
James: Sometimes, yeah.

326
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that really the primary area that's upsetting, or is it mostly around family that it's most concerning

327
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Frozen again.

328
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're back

329
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm

330
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:42.450
Jimmy

331
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got you right now anyway to help for how long.

332
00:36:47.580 --> 00:37:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the is people like customers is, those are those where you get the most irritated agitated or is it mostly around people like mother's sister where it's the most troubling.

333
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.800
James: A mother's sister and then type other people

334
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the certain other

335
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.400
James: Tertiary other people

336
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:23.010
James: People dumb asses stupid people ignorant people khaki fucking

337
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.800
James: Annoying bugs kids or not all kids.

338
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think they know they're being disingenuous. I don't want to use the word lie or dishonest. I'd rather use a different word because it usually

339
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: People don't really like that word lie. But do you think that your mother, sister, do they, do they know that they're not being honest with you.

340
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.580
James: Probably more than likely

341
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think they know you can tell

342
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:18.930
James: Know they think they think I played dumb, so they think I'm stupid. So then I could see how how far they think they could get

343
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.690
James: And you see how much they

344
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.030
James: Want to push it.

345
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so if you guys have a game, a particular game you act like a know it all.

346
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll do, I'll play dumb and then you get it when you want to

347
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:42.900
James: Play a game.

348
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um, and then when you can't take it anymore. When you feel insulted. I'm guessing, then you say, what

349
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do when you find out salted by what do you say back to them eventually

350
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.690
James: Oh, if I feel insulted. Usually I step two, I stuff up I confront them about it.

351
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:13.200
James: And use them pretty vulgar violent and aggressive about about it. What I confront people

352
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.950
Uh huh.

353
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you're in charge of the game, meaning I'm going to play dumb.

354
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But is there some point where they actually think you're dumb, like for real that you get offended.

355
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:30.780
James: Now,

356
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And what really pisses you off, when do you have to step up.

357
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.920
James: I don't know.

358
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're part of the reason why this is a difficult conversation. You and I are having right now is because there's no specifics

359
00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see.

360
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.270
James: Yeah.

361
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's more useful if we say mom said this to me and I said to myself, she thinks I'm an idiot. I'll just let her think that

362
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is it that she said this week where you were like, I'm going to play this game of I'm going to play dumb.

363
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.230
James: A lot of things.

364
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick one is full of choices you

365
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.480
James: Know, usually

366
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.970
James: I know. But usually when my mom like talks to me or something. I usually

367
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:48.840
James: I don't respond I just kind of like block her out and I just played silent wallet. Like I just sit there quietly. I don't talk to me.

368
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What is something, she said, Just give me a piece of it. Like what did she say this last week that was like, I'm just gonna sip it

369
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.250
James: Anything anytime she opens your goddamn now.

370
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But remember, I'm not there. You, you have this you know what it's like to be in her presence, but I don't know yet. So does your mom sound like this. Oh no, look who's here. The guys, it doesn't do anything. Like, is it like that or like how does she sound.

371
00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.330
James: It's like

372
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a recording

373
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.670
James: But I don't know. I don't know how to explain it.

374
00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.370
James: I don't know how to explain it except

375
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:55.350
James: Except that except you want to know what my

376
00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:01.260
James: Definition of a conversation with my mother is it's like

377
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.500
James: Fuck, I don't know. It's something that

378
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.190
James: It's not good. It's not fun.

379
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, can smell.

380
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It yeah okay so

381
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.540
James: It's like getting

382
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, watch. We're almost there. The only part that I don't know is I can't quite tell

383
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so many years into the relationship between you and your mom that

384
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You are just used. You know what the next step is in the game. You know the rules of the game. You just have to stay quiet right you've taught yourself. I just can't engage with her. I just got to shush.

385
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Because anything I say we're going to end up in an argument. I'm guessing that you've decided that maybe unconsciously, but you've worked it out because if I talked to her will fire.

386
00:42:54.090 --> 00:43:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So over the years you've gotten used to it. But what I what I'm trying to do is try and get a sense because I don't know that yet. I haven't been a little fly on the wall listening.

387
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, all it takes is for your mom to do what as soon as you see each other. This last week all she had to do was maybe it was just to do literally all she had to do was turn her body roll her eyes and I already knew. I already knew. She's in one of those moods.

388
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean it was something she said, you may already know intuitively at this point so many years into the relationship, what is about to go down.

389
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't

390
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Want my cheese, say, Oh, you're

391
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.170
James: Good.

392
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I oh you're sitting on the couch. Again, I see like that could be something that a mom might say that has all of this meaning.

393
00:43:51.960 --> 00:44:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So, what's something she said this last week or something, she did that could bring me closer to your world into what it's like to be around her.

394
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:08.850
James: And

395
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:12.090
James: She's

396
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:24.000
James: She's always trying to fucking check up on me and shit and like I'm 19. I'm like, Mom, I'm a mat on get on basically a why am a young man.

397
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:37.650
James: Like, you need to learn to fuck off, especially if I'm going to be going to the Navy, you're not going to contact, you're not going to hear for me from me for months at a time. So you might as well fucking get used to it since now.

398
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:44.700
James: Because like every day. She's just fucking pestering me with. How are you doing me hit, though, this and that and fucking just

399
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:54.090
James: Sending me stupid shit to us. Just fucking annoys the fuck out of me. And then she's always trying to fucking

400
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.100
James: She's always trying to control what the fuck I do in my life.

401
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's

402
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.300
James: Only told you to go fuck yourself.

403
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So that remember earlier in the session, I asked you, I wondered if you would get offended or mad if I sent you a little nudge, I thought that I might be perceived as annoying and controlling

404
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was my concern. It's why I didn't do it this last week. Do you see why because I thought, well, I might fall because I fell in earlier this sort of category of

405
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:32.670
James: You know,

406
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Women trying to control you aren't really that honest with you. Um, and I didn't wanna I didn't want to recapitulate redo what you already have in your life. So, um,

407
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is hasn't reached the point between you and your mom that even if she really does care about

408
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.210
James: Something you something you just said just hit hard, the

409
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:26.550
James: Of the party said about women wanting to control me that are honest with me cuz my ex. I didn't like look at it from a different standpoint. But as soon as he said that I looked at it from a different standpoint. My ex was a real controlling and real disloyal and and

410
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.610
James: An honest with me.

411
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:30.510
Yeah.

412
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does that make you think like you just snap to it. What did it make you think

413
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.800
James: It means a Holy fuck, I need to find better taste in women.

414
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you know what's interesting, you know what's interesting, James.

415
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not like hearing this

416
00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's pretty common.

417
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: People that haven't resolved issues with their parents, they end up bringing that same relationship into the romantic life. I hate to say it, but so even though, right. You're like, what's one guts to do with the other is sleeping with my

418
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:18.930
James: Mama don't

419
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:28.260
James: I know so like some Sigmund Freud Boyd sharing

420
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, but you know what he was onto something. I gotta tell you

421
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.430
James: Yeah, I mean, he was but like some of his ideology was pretty

422
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.370
James: Disturbing was say

423
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now, some parts of it. But, so maybe we'll just keep the parts that work and let the ones go that don't work.

424
00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:56.580
James: Yeah.

425
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so if all we do. Let's say next time we talk about

426
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How, no matter what your mom says no matter what she does now. It falls under the umbrella of she's trying to control me and I don't think she's being honest, I don't think she really cares about me.

427
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like there's she can never get through. Now, now, anything that she does falls under the umbrella of you're controlling me, you know, believe in me.

428
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're trying to manipulate me

429
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any room at all that she actually does.

430
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Care about you, though, is there any any little space for it.

431
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.680
James: Yeah, probably.

432
00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't sound. Sure.

433
00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.690
James: Because I'm not sure. Okay.

434
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.220
Okay.

435
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is pretty important right now because all she keeps texting you and it's, I don't think she realizes it's not going in the way she wants it to she might be thinking I'm showing my son. I care about him by sending him these little

436
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: These little messages, but it's just pissing you off even more every time.

437
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.580
James: Yeah, it's annoying me

438
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you something. What if she sent you a text that said

439
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Send me a picture of your book.

440
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: One more minute. Then you can log out. You're almost done.

441
00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:48.210
James: But

442
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What if your mom sent you a message that said send me a picture of your ass right

443
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.150
What

444
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.740
James: Oh, probably tell her to be like what the fuck, why

445
00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.600
James: Right, what it looks like.

446
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's coming from her and everything that comes from her is under this umbrella. Right.

447
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't even know.

448
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:16.530
James: Yeah.

449
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: If she really cares about you.

450
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Will pick this up, we're going to pick this up where we left off, but this is pretty important stuff.

451
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you give a little bit more thought to writing, writing the worry us down on your notepad on your phone and then literally looking at it and going worry, worry, worry, worry, worry

452
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay, I'll see you on on Tuesday.

453
00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.160
James: Yeah, I could figure something out.

454
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, bye.

455
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.700
James: All right, bye.
