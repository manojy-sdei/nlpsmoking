00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.170
Dawn Abriel: Know, okay.

7
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.760
Dawn Abriel: I'm such a lazy reader, we have a man with the name. It's almost like your first name and and you're saying last name.

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.360
Andres Chavez: Yes.

9
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.870
Dawn Abriel: And I thought, oh, he's come, he got out of jail. He's coming back to us.

10
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.700
Yeah.

12
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.380
Dawn Abriel: Hello.

13
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.940
Dawn Abriel: I'm Dr brielle and do you pronounce it on today's

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.680
Dawn Abriel: Yes, or Andres. Okay.

15
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.750
Dawn Abriel: I had been trained I have enough Mexico, people who, correct me to start to get it right.

16
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.230
Dawn Abriel: Because

17
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.710
Andres Chavez: I was gonna ask a kid, my mother be in this meeting with us.

18
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.450
Dawn Abriel: Why

19
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.160
Andres Chavez: Uh, I don't know. She just wanted to be part of it. But it's okay if not

20
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.900
Dawn Abriel: I would prefer she weren't

21
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.210
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And, um,

22
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.080
Dawn Abriel: It's a and when you're doing this kind of work, especially doing in the group.

23
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.230
Dawn Abriel: Yes, it's absolutely uninstall unacceptable if anyone else is in the room with you.

24
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.610
Andres Chavez: Okay, okay.

25
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.640
Dawn Abriel: Because if someone should accidentally look on your screen.

26
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.380
Dawn Abriel: And recognize someone who's in the group that would just be horrible. Right.

27
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.340
Andres Chavez: Oh, yes, yes.

28
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.120
Dawn Abriel: I noticing you and saying, Oh, I'm the bases in a treatment group.

29
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.870
Andres Chavez: Okay.

30
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.870
Dawn Abriel: Yes. So yeah, there can't be anyone around

31
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.160
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Um, so we, first of all I have to

32
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.710
Dawn Abriel: Tell the I've got a group of 11 so I've really gotta hurry through this

33
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.820
Dawn Abriel: And I'm sorry for that. Usually I like to, you know, do a little visiting but

34
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.830
Dawn Abriel: So I have to tell the therapist that I can't open the group.

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.680
Dawn Abriel: Usually I do it by now.

36
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.900
Dawn Abriel: I can open a zoom room for 11am group.

37
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.320
Dawn Abriel: I have an intake.

38
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.210
Dawn Abriel: Right, so let's rock and roll. Get into the right place.

39
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.990
Dawn Abriel: And get you started.

40
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.880
Dawn Abriel: Usually I have this all set up, but I had a tutorial that I had to cut short because they said you were waiting for me.

41
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.510
Okay.

42
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.480
Dawn Abriel: Have you been in treatment before

43
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.230
No.

44
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.790
Dawn Abriel: First time

45
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.780
Dawn Abriel: Well, with any luck. Oops.

46
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.460
Dawn Abriel: Wrong one

47
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.280
Dawn Abriel: You have a

48
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.490
Dawn Abriel: rockin and rollin now.

49
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.490
Dawn Abriel: And you're living in Albuquerque.

50
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.090
Yes.

51
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.550
Dawn Abriel: And I need to know the last time you had any opioid

52
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.870
Last night.

53
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.830
Dawn Abriel: What time

54
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.270
Andres Chavez: Around

55
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.290
Andres Chavez: Like 11:11pm okay

56
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.280
Dawn Abriel: And what was it,

57
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.180
It was

58
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.680
Dawn Abriel: About how much do you know

59
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.060
Andres Chavez: Oh yeah, just one package. I think they called 30 pills like the 30

60
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.100
Dawn Abriel: And about how much have you been doing doing per day.

61
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.770
Andres Chavez: Maybe like two weeks ago, I was like at like 10 a day but I stopped. I started doing like one or two a day.

62
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.730
Andres Chavez: And I tried to quit the last couple days and I just have super bad withdraws moment.

63
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.200
Andres Chavez: Yeah, super. Yeah. No, you can't.

64
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.910
Dawn Abriel: You can't just stop taking fit now.

65
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.710
Andres Chavez: My body hurts my leg.

66
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.570
Dawn Abriel: And

67
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.100
Dawn Abriel: So you're in some withdrawal now.

68
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.160
Andres Chavez: Yes, yes, my legs are starting to feel like super uncomfortable, but they're not bad idea.

69
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.240
Dawn Abriel: What else, what other symptoms. Do you have

70
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.260
Andres Chavez: A ti my legs. I just have super, super restless, I get hot, and I get cold. I cannot get comfortable for the life of me.

71
00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:02.670
Andres Chavez: I get really antsy like I just have to like move. I don't know my body. It just really feels weird. I've never experienced something like this before. So to really agree feeling

72
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.180
Dawn Abriel: And so good fentanyl is a really difficult drug to get people onto buprenorphine because

73
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.460
Dawn Abriel: You know how some like oil and water don't mix.

74
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:49.740
Dawn Abriel: Yes that's that's referred to, whether it's soluble in it sent in your, your brain is mostly fat. It's it and fentanyl absorbs into the fat.

75
00:06:51.210 --> 00:07:03.420
Dawn Abriel: And even though it's short acting. A lot of it is still up there in your the fat tissue of your brain and with every heartbeat, a little more comes out.

76
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:11.850
Dawn Abriel: Doesn't necessarily get your high, but it makes getting you started on buprenorphine really hard because

77
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:19.080
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to, I'm going to tell you to take a tight these just the first day, I'm going to tell you to take small amounts

78
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.140
Dawn Abriel: Because if you jam into withdrawal even harder than you know you've got to wait.

79
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:33.900
Dawn Abriel: Another couple of hours before you can take a little more you take some Suboxone the buprenorphine and you feel a little better.

80
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:43.500
Dawn Abriel: That's groovy. That's what you want. You want to feel a little better. And then you'll take more of the buprenorphine until you don't have any more withdrawal symptoms.

81
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.960
Dawn Abriel: But you know that the fentanyl isn't out of your system. Yet, if you get worse by taking the buprenorphine. That makes sense.

82
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.270
Dawn Abriel: Well, good.

83
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:05.190
Dawn Abriel: So we're going to have to, we're going to have to stay in touch over the weekend and check in every day, just because

84
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.690
Dawn Abriel: It's trickier to get you on board.

85
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.320
Dawn Abriel: Yes, morphine. I want you to comfortable as soon as possible.

86
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.200
Dawn Abriel: Here's what we're going to have to play with it to make that happen.

87
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.830
Andres Chavez: Okay.

88
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:29.580
Dawn Abriel: But by Monday, you're going to be taking well your what we're aiming for is once a day dosing first thing in the morning you'll take your films under your tongue.

89
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:38.790
Dawn Abriel: And then it lasts for 24 at least 24 hours. Okay, so that's what we're going to work for

90
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.280
Dawn Abriel: So how old were you when you first started taking any illicit drugs.

91
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:53.820
Andres Chavez: A any era. Yeah, I was pretty young, like maybe I think my mom said she caught me smoking weed and I was like 13 okay oh

92
00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:06.810
Andres Chavez: I had like progress to like Xanax and then I had stopped doing that and it was the hardest time doing that and maybe about three weeks ago I started doing that now and and this is probably been the craziest experience I've ever had.

93
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.500
Andres Chavez: I I'm really scared of the drug, honestly.

94
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.630
Dawn Abriel: You should be

95
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.010
Dawn Abriel: Terrified people

96
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.550
Die.

97
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.080
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

98
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.370
Dawn Abriel: And it's a scary, scary, scary drug

99
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.290
Andres Chavez: Scary really scary. I'm scared of it.

100
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.720
Dawn Abriel: Are you ever using IV drugs.

101
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:25.620
No.

102
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.750
Dawn Abriel: And were you having to take more and more of the nail to get the same. Hi.

103
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.290
Yes.

104
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:45.480
Andres Chavez: I think I'm at the point where like doesn't get me. I had just kind of makes the pain go away. And I think that's the scary part two.

105
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.400
Dawn Abriel: And is it, resulting in problems with relationships and work.

106
00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:10.350
Andres Chavez: So my work is on quarantine. Right now I am supposed to go back on the fourth. I don't think I'm gonna make it so I just told him I'm not gonna be able to be there for that job. Specifically, and I just really want to focus on getting better, before I try going back to work.

107
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.000
Andres Chavez: Because the way I'm thinking right now. I don't think that physically be able to do it.

108
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.460
Dawn Abriel: And are sleeping anxiety issues for you.

109
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.330
Andres Chavez: Yes, I CANNOT SLEEP AND A HALF super bad anxiety.

110
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:33.690
Andres Chavez: That's the worst part because I started doing this drug to help me sleep now. I can't sleep. So I think that's like the scariest part

111
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.520
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, people say that what they don't realize is that

112
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:48.510
Dawn Abriel: Opioids mess with both of those they mess with your sleep center in your brain and they cause anxiety.

113
00:10:49.200 --> 00:11:03.420
Andres Chavez: Yes, definitely. So you should take it away. Like I that's why I did it because, like, I'd be so carefree I just go to sleep now. I'm just have super bad things. I can't sleep. My body hurts. My legs hurt. Yeah.

114
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.590
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever been hospitalized for a mental health issue.

115
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.280

Dawn Abriel: And what what your self esteem right now.

117
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.750
Dawn Abriel: From one to 10 return is the most

118
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.270
Andres Chavez: I'd say that for

119
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.740
Dawn Abriel: And your stress level.

120
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:30.900
