00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.379
Alyse: We're back there. I just

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.410
Alyse: I know all about it.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.170
Richelle Direny: I needed.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.070
Richelle Direny: To get over the cough.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.610
Alyse: Yeah, well doesn't help. I smoke so smoking, you know,

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.900
Richelle Direny: Oh, you know,

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.860
Alyse: I'm willing to give up some things in life. But that's not one of them. Yeah.

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.200
Richelle Direny: You got me coffee.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.080
Richelle Direny: Hey, I hear that I really hear that, but you sound a lot better. You seem a whole lot better than

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.620
Alyse: Yeah, it took a couple of weeks, like I haven't been sick like that in a long time. Like, it took everything out. It's like, about two weeks for me to get back to like

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.520
Alyse: somewhat normal. You know, I mean, and not be like so drained and so exhausted. I mean it's, it was a rough that one and knocked me on my ass for sure.

13
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.660
Richelle Direny: I think a lot of it to in because I know

14
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.260
Richelle Direny: I've been feeling like that just the tactic. A lot of it is because of the fact that you had the babies and you've been on the go.

15
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:29.760
Richelle Direny: So you're so extremely exhausted that your body, the immune system is so low that you just kind of everything just hit you, at one time, so it's going to be hard for you to recruit and a lot of time when you get sick, like that.

16
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:44.010
Richelle Direny: It's your body's cry for rest. That's like when you're sick. They're always tell me you get lots of lots of rest because your body kind of just needs to just recuperate reject, kind of like a recharge.

17
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.810
Alyse: Yeah, I mean, thank God, like for my mom.

Alyse: Like things like heroes always like, oh, take pictures of what I got you. Like for holidays or whatever. I'm like, no, because then people get jealous that people want to run their mouth. You know what I mean.

49
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.730
Alyse: People think I sit on my ass all day and do nothing. And that's so far from the truth.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.100
Alyse: And I know for him. It's like his cry for help, like

85
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:15.450

86
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.050
Alyse: But he's screwing up in school, Michelle. A couple weeks ago we had money sitting right here.

Alyse: Woke up to go get coffee that morning, and that the hundred dollars is missing.

91
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:57.390
Alyse: And I already knew. As soon as that money wasn't there. I already knew. Like, where I was going. And I looked at him, I said, if you do not give me that money back. I'm going. You know what I mean, like, and I kept it from hero because here would have killed him.

92
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:10.260
Alyse: But like he like went and got it and quietly gave it to me. And I'm like, do not realize like steel $5 bills feel 10 you took $100 bill. Are you kidding me.

93
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:24.000
Alyse: And not even that. But like, I've had to go to the school already and meet with them. He was at the library yesterday. Now he can't go to library without an adult, because he was in there playing around and then outside asking people for money.

94
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.470
Alyse: Like

95
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.850
Alyse: What in the holy hell.

96
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:40.740
Alyse: You know what I mean. And the way the way he talks to me is is disgusting like your I'm 11 year old boy like I'm not your friend. I'm your mother. You know what I mean, like,

97
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:52.560
Alyse: He, he still feels like in life, like I owe him something like I have to make up for that time when I wasn't around like dude you been with me for two years, you live a great ass life.

98
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:06.090
Alyse: You know what I mean, like, you don't want for nothing like and that's all I asked do good in school have respect for the people that spend their time to teach you. So you're not some BUM ON THE STREET for the rest of your life.

99
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:14.430
Alyse: You know what I mean. And don't be out of you're doing the stupid stuff they did you think we weren't going to find out. I always find out always

100
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:23.550
Alyse: It's always something with that kid. And it's like, I don't get it. Like I could just see it and it's so I feel so bad saying like, I could see it now. I could see

101
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:33.660
Alyse: Who he's gonna be when he gets older, he doesn't change because I was exactly that same as a little kid trying to steal something trying to is trying to that. You know what I mean.

102
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:49.440
Alyse: Oh, you just like, and it's like, I can't let myself get close enough to him because of how he acts and how he treats me and talks to me. It's like, I'll just go the whole damn kid away. That's just how I feel like boof know

103
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.780
Richelle Direny: What is um

104
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.900
Richelle Direny: You said that you see yourself in here.

105
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.020
Richelle Direny: When Danny.

106
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:08.940
Alyse: Like, you know, okay, so I remember hearing. Once upon a time in like detox turn treatment. You know, like dreaming. You do groups all day and stuff. And like

107
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:20.700
Alyse: That you know a lot of addicts. You can look back and see where those behaviors started with you. You know what I mean, those little just trying to get some just trying to do something for that little thrill or

108
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:30.660
Alyse: Trying to be sneaky. You know what I mean, things like that. And I'm not trying to say my son's going to grow up to be a junkie, like that's not nowhere like I would never in my life wish that on my children.

109
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:44.790
Richelle Direny: It's the because remember becoming an addict becoming addicted to something only for relief for a release your false sense of release. So, but there was always

110
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:55.530
Richelle Direny: It was always the bigger issue this only gave you temporary release, or at least what you thought was temporary respite from your troubles from your

111
00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:07.350
Richelle Direny: Your worries your anxiety, your fear, whatever it is that was that was troubling you. THE DRUGS, WHATEVER force you use was only your release your

112
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:26.370
Richelle Direny: Your comfort but what the whatever the main issue was, was what you're working through. So for you, you seeing yourself in him. You'll identify that it is a cry for help. Was it a cry for help for you at that age.

113
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.190
Alyse: I don't know.

114
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.700
Richelle Direny: Like things

115
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.120
Alyse: Like

116
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.650
Alyse: What were you doing

117
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:57.900
Richelle Direny: In your own life at that, like how you grow up and what and and then there came that introduction to the drugs that gave you this false sense of happiness or um release or it took you away from your problems that you encounter. Think about your life growing up.

118
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:06.030
Richelle Direny: Because if your life was the way it is right now at that age, the life that you have presented to him in the last two years.

119
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:22.440
Richelle Direny: If your life was like that you're giving everything mom was on top of everything going to the school doing everything that you're doing as a model of parent would you have still gone down that road of drug addiction.

120
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:30.870
Alyse: I would think not, I would think not, like, I mean, although my parents were there, they were absent, you know, I mean like never

121
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.890
Alyse: My mom waking up at two o'clock in the afternoon, like first thing she did was go for beer.

122
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.930
Alyse: You know, I mean the struggles of this and that and not being able to go here, like we didn't even have a car.

123
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.520
Alyse: You know, we weren't able to go places or do things like if it wasn't for my best friend.

124
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.010
Alyse: Like I wouldn't experienced a lot of the things I experienced in life, and then to be shipped off to boarding school

125
00:15:53.340 --> 00:16:04.200
Alyse: in eighth grade and be away from my pit, you know, life for four years. I mean, it probably was. It's the best thing that could have happened to me in that time, but still you know you feel you feel some certain type of way inside

126
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:13.320
Richelle Direny: Like, like you were rejected or you felt like you were, you know, you were sent away and you weren't so then that

127
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:23.640
Richelle Direny: Introduction to the life that you ended up creating for yourself, was because it gave you some sense of

128
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:30.450
Richelle Direny: I don't want to say hope but it gave you or if it was hope for you. But it gave you some sense of

129
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:43.980
Richelle Direny: Me maybe acceptance, whatever it created for you in that time, or at least what you thought it was giving you given to you now you're giving him what

130
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:56.160
Richelle Direny: YOU EVERYTHING YOU DIDN'T HAVE because you're saying that mom and dad. They were physically there but they really weren't there for you. You are physically there for your children and other children.

131
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:08.220
Richelle Direny: And you're very involved and you try to put order and structure and you're trying to establish what you would have liked for yourself completely growing up.

132
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:22.500
Richelle Direny: So you're saying that if you the life you're giving him now. I placed that on you. And in fact, age, you're saying that you wouldn't have gone down the road that you traveled. So what do you think that

133
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.420
Richelle Direny: Outside of the fact that he's also entering into puberty.

134
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:35.220
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah, that is a big factor. And that is something that you're going to have to contend with, too. But on top of that.

135
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.170
What do you think that

136
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.350
Richelle Direny: Is going on in his mind, based on his behavior because his behavior is telling you what's going on.

137
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.370
Alyse: I just think it's it's like attention. A lot of its attention for him. He just wants

138
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.640
Alyse: An abundance of attention constantly

139
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:06.690
Alyse: And I mean, for a while. I thought maybe he felt excluded or, you know, like his troubles because he doesn't have a father, necessarily, his father wasn't my ex husband passed away.

140
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.940
Alyse: Like I like maybe like there's a void in him somewhere like he doesn't feel like he

141
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.190
Richelle Direny: Was your answer. Oh, she played

142
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.950
Alyse: He played. Yeah. Yeah. Because that they're consuming for all that time. So that was his father, you know,

143
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:31.350
Alyse: I mean, he does. He does, to an extent. I mean, I guess you would say he doesn't respect him so much because he does the things that he does. You know what I mean.

144
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:42.660
Alyse: But at the same time he he yearns for like that father figuring, you know, for I guess some guidance. Some somebody to learn to learn from to guide him.

145
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:52.380
Alyse: Because when Harold's with him, you know, Harold. They, you know. Lately it's been he gathers the kids up because nobody wants to ever listened to me or do things properly.

146
00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:04.200
Alyse: He gathers them up and it's you take this out or you do this you fold this close you, you know, kind of get them because a household. I can't do it all by myself. I can't, I can't do it anymore now with two little babies. I have to tend to constantly

147
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.130
Richelle Direny: Oh, so then more involved in helping

148
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:18.180
Alyse: Yeah, because they listen to him they listen to him, Rochelle like no tomorrow, but for me it's like over hell or high water, you know, and

149
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.840
Alyse: So, you know, he gets some going. I'll do this, do that and exhibitors running here doing this you know he feels like he's accepted.

150
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.980
Alyse: You know, maybe, maybe Xavier doesn't feel like he's accepted like he feels like he's different or something. I'm not sure.

151
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:41.790
Alyse: But I've started I sent over his information to the school they're going to start counseling with him, because I believe that that's what I said in group on Tuesday, you know,

152
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.750
Alyse: What's his name I can't remember his name.

153
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:46.530
John

154
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.560
Alyse: John. Yeah, he said, you know, he asked me, he's like, well, how do you think you've gotten as far as you have

155
00:19:52.980 --> 00:20:01.080
Alyse: That it's like, listen, you know, after so many tries and detox and doing the same shit. I always bed. You know, I decided I'm going to do something different going to three quarter we living

156
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:11.340
Alyse: I said, but a lot of it, I think, is like talking and I said, if it wasn't for my counselor. I said, I probably would be lost. So the simplest thing. Sometimes they come out of her mouth and I'm just like,

157
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:22.140
Alyse: Why the hell or how the hell can I not figure that out for myself, you know, for me it's if I take my own will and do what I want to do. I'm going to, you know, be doing some shit.

158
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:31.890
Alyse: You know, but I take advice from others. I listen to others who know what they're doing, who gotten so far and I use that, you know, I mean like

159
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:40.470
Alyse: It's as simple as opening your mouth and talking sometimes and being willing to listen because we don't always want to listen. But, you know,

160
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:52.470
Alyse: You take those those things you're told, and you put them into action. And that's how you know you maneuver through your day. That's how I get minute by minute, hour by hour day by day. You know what I mean.

161
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.910
Alyse: Because I know if I'm doing it on my own. I know where my own gets me and then gets me somewhere in a room with a needle in my arm. Like, that's just

162
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.730
Alyse: That's just the the God's honest truth about it. I've had to come to learn and figure it out that way.

163
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:24.930
Richelle Direny: And sometimes emotions that we have it justifies a certain action. It says it makes you think, Oh, well, it's not it's not going to be that bad. It's not going to be that right if I did this, or if I did that. But then, you know, it doesn't tell you what the consequences is going to be afterwards.

164
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:31.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you're on the right path with getting him counseling, but we're so you don't listen

165
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.500
Richelle Direny: Taking it from someone that's doing counseling.

166
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.270
Richelle Direny: I'm not saying that counseling is not good. It is very good.

167
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.140
Richelle Direny: But you are his number one.

168
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:55.350
Richelle Direny: Counselor, you're the one that you're his mother, you know everything. Remember a counter only goes off of, kind of like a doctor, they go off of what you tell them

169
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:09.330
Richelle Direny: They go off of the behavior presentation in the moments you are with him all day long. You see the you hear the verbals and you also see in here, the non verbals

170
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:20.880
Richelle Direny: So you have to say okay this is when I noticed the change. This is this occurred. Then I noticed this action, you will have to say.

171
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:22.650
Richelle Direny: Okay.

172
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.520
Richelle Direny: I think that some of this behavior is due to

173
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:37.770
Richelle Direny: With attention seeking you want attention. So remember we talked about from even while you were pregnant that maybe you should take that time out, maybe once or twice a week.

174
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:52.320
Richelle Direny: However, time permits, and you would just spend that time together, whether it's you and him just go to the park through some throw some hoops, if that's what he likes. But whatever it is you just give him that divided

175
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:52.950
Attention.

176
00:22:54.210 --> 00:23:08.820
Richelle Direny: You've met you set that for him, whether it's weekly or every other week as time permits, especially now with the babies and give him something to look forward to, and try your best not to allow anything to get in the way of that.

177
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:18.090
Richelle Direny: Just try that and see how that works for him and let him understand that mommy can't necessarily give you

178
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:27.480
Richelle Direny: That undivided attention every single day because you have the two babies. But this is what we can do. We can make a plan that on

179
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:36.660
Richelle Direny: Some Saturdays or Friday evenings from six to eight that is your time and we'll, we'll do something together. That is your turn.

180
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:56.130
Richelle Direny: Make the effort always listen, just like you're a mom. I'm a mom, I understand that it is very hard to carve out time to give one child that undivided attention, but in this case it's like being intentional about it, giving him something to look forward to.

181
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.290
Richelle Direny: You understand him saying

182
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.430
Richelle Direny: I'm going to give you

183
00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:08.220
Richelle Direny: A personal example I have, I have one daughter, and that was one of the things she wants that time and I'm sitting here thinking like

184
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:17.760
Richelle Direny: What are you talking about, and so you're going with the hustle and bustle of life and everything else and you could just never in what's what you're creating in your mind of what that

185
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:26.070
Richelle Direny: undivided attention looks like and I could never really find the time to do that. So what did I do, I tried to be creative in it.

186
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.730
Richelle Direny: If I'm going to the store. I say, hey, come with me.

187
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:30.990
Alyse: If

188
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.660
Richelle Direny: You understand I'm saying any little thing that I'm doing. If I'm going to the grocery store. Hey, come with me.

189
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:46.920
Richelle Direny: And when we go to the grocery store. It's kind of like, Okay, what do you think that we need. Okay, let me get this. Let me get that. Okay, what do you think this person like and you get them involved.

190
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:55.140
Richelle Direny: So now they feel like, oh, I'm a part of the situation. I'm a part. She's asking me, she's looking for what it is my opinion.

191
00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:03.390
Richelle Direny: You get them involved in the conversation. Um, if you're an industry, you know, your home and you call him and you say, hey, Xavier

192
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:15.150
Richelle Direny: Look in the fridge is this. Come, tell me all the things that we need. I'm picking you up. We're going to the store. Little things like that. It's just making him a part of the equation.

193
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.270
Richelle Direny: And that's just kind of how you try to make that time.

194
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.310
Alyse: It just hurts my ears.

195
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.630
Alyse: Because I don't think that way.

196
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.210
Alyse: I just don't want them to feel the way he does.

197
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.470
Alyse: No like inside. He probably you're hurt.

198
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.740
Alyse: And it's like, I can't fix it for you.

199
00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.390
Alyse: So,

200
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.210
Alyse: Just feel bad.

201
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:03.900
Alyse: Okay.

202
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.790
Alyse: I just feel really bad for him. Like, I know that he he just probably feel so lonely inside

203
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:26.130
Richelle Direny: And it could possibly be. And if there is also the concept of the middle child syndrome because when we mean, not necessarily. He is the middle child, but kind of when there are children before and after him. He someone

204
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.420
Alyse: Feel I can hear you.

205
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.830
Alyse: Hello. Can you hear me.

206
00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.320
Richelle Direny: I can you still can't hear me.

207
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.530
Alyse: I can't. I wonder what the hell happened.

208
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.960
Alyse: Thank you.

209
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.720
Richelle Direny: Hold on one second.

210
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.690
Richelle Direny: You still can't hear me.

211
00:26:52.650 --> 00:27:03.900
Alyse: I can. Yeah, I had, I had to turn off my my Bluetooth. I don't understand why it you just went completely like quiet. I can hear you. See you talking, but I couldn't hear you.

212
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.250
Richelle Direny: Now you hear me.

213
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.840
Alyse: Yeah, I can hear you.

214
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.040
Okay.

215
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.230
Richelle Direny: So, you know,

216
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:19.230
Richelle Direny: I was saying about the middle child syndrome. So there are there are other factors that because you could like have that financial synchrony where you feel neglected because you're so busy.

217
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.650
That he feels that

218
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.800
Richelle Direny: He feels like he's

219
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.280
Getting

220
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.310
Alyse: Some of the things that you

221
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.830
Alyse: Don't think about doing is

222
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.520
Richelle Direny: One of the other

223
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.600
Richelle Direny: Things that I will do

224
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.060
Richelle Direny: It does he have his own phone

225
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.990
Alyse: Yeah, well it's taken away from him right now. But yeah, he has his own phone

226
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:47.220
Richelle Direny: So sometimes not. Now, a lot of the times of taking a big chance in this allowed to use their phones in school. I

227
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.470
Richelle Direny: Know my kids school they're really they're

228
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.800
Alyse: Lacking

229
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.140
Richelle Direny: In a while like I'll just

230
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:57.990
Richelle Direny: Text and I say, Hey, you know, I know that I love you. Have a good day in school just

231
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.540
Richelle Direny: Little things like that, just so they know

232
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.110
Richelle Direny: Or you'll say,

233
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.770
You know,

234
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.500
Richelle Direny: And you'll know that

235
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.570
Alyse: You'll just say hey you know what

236
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.500
Richelle Direny: You will make that you will figure out that time, make the the provisions for the other children and say okay

237
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.230
Richelle Direny: We're going to go out on a particular day to watch

238
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.300
Alyse: You can't be in

239
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.790
Richelle Direny: A whole day, necessarily, because of the fact

240
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.350
Richelle Direny: That babies.

241
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.850
You have other children.

242
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.770
Richelle Direny: It's just finding that time just to give, not the part of dad not being involved.

243
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.940
Alyse: Or have

244
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.280
That passion.

245
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.080
Richelle Direny: That's just

246
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.440
Kind of

247
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.840
Richelle Direny: And that, you know,

248
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.610
Alyse: Counseling and all of

249
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.380
Richelle Direny: That that it's not necessarily something you can, but you can help.

250
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:50.520
Through those

251
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.440
Richelle Direny: Emotions when they

252
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.810
Richelle Direny: Are you there because you seem like you're frozen.

253
00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.010
Alyse: No, no.

254
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:07.020
Alyse: Oh yeah, good acted you back to YouTube to the Bluetooth because you you were to crackly so I was trying to connect you back. Sorry.

255
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:08.880
Alyse: So,

256
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.980
Richelle Direny: It's just thinking being just finding different ways to be creative.

257
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.250
Richelle Direny: Like I like I always tell you our charter bring

258
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.120
Richelle Direny: It back that

259
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:32.580
Richelle Direny: Understanding from a parent's standpoint that it is not easy. I am not going to be one of those who sit and tell you. I'll just do it. Just do it. It's eat because listen, we live in reality.

260
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:46.110
Richelle Direny: And reality says that life is just so busy and you just get caught up with, you know, cooking dinner, taking care of kids doing you know you're just kind of running here running there. You got to do this you para wants you to do something. And so you're

261
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.470
Alyse: Running

262
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.390
Richelle Direny: In 10 different directions. So it's very hard to sometimes to say okay

263
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:56.820
Richelle Direny: Let me see what this kid wants. How can I carve out time in my schedule to provide this time and attention.

264
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:09.360
Richelle Direny: And then when you do something comes around, then you end up having to cancel it with the kid and you hope that they'll understand, but in the reality saving understand but they're torn into a million little pieces on the inside.

265
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.440
Alyse: Yeah yeah

266
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.240
Richelle Direny: Think about when you were a kid, that's how you felt because you were really looking forward to this.

267
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:25.140
Richelle Direny: When you had plans with Harold, you're all excited about it, you set yourself up about it. You're making plans for it. And then he come tell you some crap.

268
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:33.870
Richelle Direny: And hope that you understand out of you, your mouth. You say that's okay, but on the inside. It's a whole different situation going

269
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.010
Alyse: Yeah, and

270
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:46.500
Richelle Direny: And that's just kind of how if you take that exact feeling and you say, if I, as an adult, feel like this. I wonder how this 10 or 11 year old kid feels

271
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.920
Alyse: Yeah, well I even think about it that way.

272
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.010
Alyse: Really don't

273
00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:02.520
Richelle Direny: You. One of the biggest things like that and i a lot of our times together. One of the biggest things we talked about was feeling neglected.

274
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:15.000
Richelle Direny: Apparel. You just wanted like I just want time away like I just want it to be. You and I, even if it's just going to a burger joint are doing like little old people do. I don't know if they do it in Ohio, but

275
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.130
Alyse: McDonald's 10 separate copy

276
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.440
Alyse: I can't wait outside during 62 and get my book I card. Damn, girl.

277
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:35.640
Alyse: Dying over here. I remember when my, my dad a couple years ago, you know, turning 16 or 61 whatever like over the hill.

278
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:52.110
Alyse: And he got his Buckeye card in the mail and me and my sister. We went in, like, that is the most go get a 10 cent cup of coffee for McDonald's and sit there at six o'clock in the morning like that is life at like six. That's where I want to be a 6070 years old and

279
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:52.590
Alyse: Die.

280
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.750
Richelle Direny: But it's the husband and the wife, they're sitting there sometime this year and that one. Yeah.

281
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.200
Alyse: Not saying a word just just happy to be in each other's presence, you know,

282
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.610
Richelle Direny: There. Yeah.

283
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:10.410
Alyse: And it's, I don't know, I, it's like, I know all these things as I'm talking about them, but I forget about them because life is like, you know,

284
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.670
Alyse: And it's like,

285
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:25.770
Alyse: Like, I mean that, you know, and then sometimes it gets a point. With him where I feel like he's trying to manipulate me or use me. You know what I mean. And it's like, I have. I don't know. I have to get myself.

286
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:34.020
Alyse: I got to understand that kids are kids. It's like I like you are my son. You been around me for years know who I am and

287
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:43.920
Alyse: You know what to do and what not to do. And you still push his buttons like what, what is it what in your head thinks it's okay for you, he said yesterday, Harold said, well,

288
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.990
Alyse: What are you doing painting. And he's like, I was asking people for money. I used to do it all the time by my grandma's house.

289
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.390
Alyse: And I looked at him, I said, you never asked, nobody for money over there. He said, you used to do it. I

290
00:32:54.870 --> 00:33:01.470
Alyse: Am I stood outside and begging for money. I would never sorry I will steal something first like that was just, you know,

291
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:14.610
Alyse: Like my way of getting money like I'm not going to stand out and ask people for money. Like, I looked at him, I said, I don't know what kind of delusional world you're living in, but I never stood outside and ask people for money. You know, like it's this

292
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.790
Richelle Direny: So this is the thing I didn't like the other day, I went to

293
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.640
Richelle Direny: My church they had this

294
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:30.240
Richelle Direny: parenting class like understanding. So like for me, it's more so um

295
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.520
Richelle Direny: I can't remember the concept but like for me.

296
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:50.910
Richelle Direny: I work it's we're raising godly children are having somewhere in the content, but it was more the crux of the whole seminar was just understanding children. And I think a lot of times as

297
00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.020
Richelle Direny: Parents remember

298
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.330
Alyse: We hundred books.

299
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.210
Richelle Direny: Children is unique.

300
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.400
Alyse: Yeah.

301
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:09.210
Richelle Direny: No two children are the exact same every one of them have different personalities and a kind of vibes, very different. So we learn as we go.

302
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:21.930
Richelle Direny: People give us ideas and they give us their opinions based on their experiences and all of the books that people write is based on their experiences in their exposure, but you're learning as you go. You agree with that.

303
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:22.800
Yeah.

304
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.750
Richelle Direny: Now in saying that everything that you just said.

305
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:34.860
Richelle Direny: It's like you said it's understanding that he's a kid I always think that they're wiser than

306
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.110
Alyse: Yes, they do. It's one thing that

307
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:48.930
Richelle Direny: They think that they, you're the kid and they're the adult and they know way more than you and they think that their schooling you you're not schooling them. That's just every child out there.

308
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.530
Richelle Direny: So it's understanding that and being

309
00:34:54.870 --> 00:35:06.030
Richelle Direny: Literally just being understanding and merciful, in that sense, it's that. Okay, this little quick kid he swear he got one on over me, but I'm gonna let him think he got one for me because he really doesn't

310
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.430
Richelle Direny: It's just, just like, Okay, whatever.

311
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:20.100
Richelle Direny: The other part of it is outside of the fact that there is a real true cry for attention and he wants to. You have to bring into full awareness, like you said,

312
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.590
Richelle Direny: There's things that you

313
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.700
Alyse: Would love to do.

314
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.260
Richelle Direny: With it with all of them.

315
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:38.040
Richelle Direny: But life happens and it doesn't always go as you read it but it's trying your best to say if I have time spent with any one of them, even if it's at least

316
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:51.540
Richelle Direny: You know, some of the things that, and I can tell you my experience. One of the things that my children enjoy, even if you're watching the dumbness cartoons. You're sitting there watching the dumbest cartoons and you start asking them questions.

317
00:35:52.110 --> 00:36:04.050
Alyse: Yeah, like I could see it like on his phone like watching a stupid for name videos like He'll even asked me, like we come up here and watch me play for nine. I'm like, dude, you know how I feel about fortnight.

318
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:14.520
Alyse: Whatever, but he's actually really good at it, you know, I mean, he could be one of those kids like on YouTube, like in all reality and in in like it would really bring him so much joy.

319
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:21.180
Richelle Direny: Just to sit there and listen. My son loves to watch cartoons, the characters don't speak.

320
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.870
Alyse: Cartoons or characters don't speak.

321
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.330
Richelle Direny: They don't speak. You remember Tom and Jerry back in the

322
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.590
Alyse: Day, all that's my fav I love me some Tom and Jerry that

323
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.720
Richelle Direny: They sit there and watch. And I'm like, So what's going on. He's like, Oh, it's this girlfriend. And it's that

324
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.600
Richelle Direny: You know that and they don't even see

325
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.830
Alyse: Yeah, it's like I met you like that you see their imagination come out, you know, I mean,

326
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:51.090
Richelle Direny: And you sit there and you get all involved in it but Elise, that means the world to them because the reality of it is

327
00:36:51.420 --> 00:37:01.140
Richelle Direny: When you ask them, like, what would you like me to do with you to me. They have no clue. They have no idea. It is just your presence there.

328
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:11.760
Richelle Direny: That's all it is. And that's what I came down to like even with my daughter. It is just your presence there. So, sometimes I'll sit there and we'll just sit there and, uh, we'll watch

329
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.670
Richelle Direny: Watching because the reality is

330
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.480
Alyse: Yes. See that confidence I want tomorrow perspective, it's just your presence.

331
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.010
Alyse: Your presence.

332
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:33.390
Richelle Direny: Sitting there and watch. I don't necessarily care for the fortnight. But hey, I'll sit there it and I'll try to understanding. So what are you guys doing. So why do you guys do that.

333
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:39.600
Richelle Direny: But that don't make sense and then they're having this big conversation and they're telling you what it's all about.

334
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:50.610
Alyse: I think it comes down to just being able to talk. You know what I mean, just, it's all it is is just a little bit of talking, and that just is enough for them, like I get I under, I get it, I

335
00:37:52.260 --> 00:38:01.170
Alyse: I just get I like don't want to make excuses for myself because of whatever I just, it's just so hard sometimes. It really is just to find that little bit of time to go do something so simple.

336
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:14.310
Alyse: That will make somebody's day and it's like, I know inside that that's what I should be doing. But I don't do it anyways it's my lack of caring, I'm sure, sometimes and tiredness and life.

337
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:22.920
Richelle Direny: It is it. Listen, I can tell you, I completely understand. Think about if Harold was supposed to come home.

338
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.960
Richelle Direny: He makes everybody. He prepared a or he made the arrangements for

339
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:37.890
Richelle Direny: Everybody to have dinner or whatever the situation is everybody is comfortable doing their own thing. And he says, Elise, let's go in the room. We're just going to relax and

340
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.240
Richelle Direny: Whatever show you want to watch and he sits there and he watched the show and he gets all

341
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.550
Richelle Direny: Involved, how much would that mean to you.

342
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.070
Alyse: Oh, that's like, like a kid and and Christmas store. Yeah.

343
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.310
Richelle Direny: Good job doesn't take much. It really doesn't

344
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.200
Richelle Direny: It really doesn't take much.

345
00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:05.190
Richelle Direny: So if you feel like that kid in the candy store. How much so will Xavier feel if you sat there while he is playing fortnight.

346
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.450
Alyse: Or NBC

347
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:12.240
Richelle Direny: Or if you took one of the remote and you played it with him, even though you're getting killed the whole time.

348
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:12.930
But

349
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:25.980
Alyse: I am I actually used to play fortnight, he got me into it a couple seasons ago and I would legit like I think goes actually person when when you started doing counseling.

350
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.490
Alyse: I used to sit upstairs when he was at school and played fortnight.

351
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:38.670
Alyse: And talk to little kids online like creeper. But it was like I got into it so much because of like him, watching him and everything like that. And it was like the

352
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:51.870
Alyse: Best thing for me even said the other, you think, well, why don't you play for tonight anymore. And I'm like, I'm just not into it. Plus, I don't have the time. Unfortunately, but like that was like a so much to him. What are you crying about

353
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.520
Alyse: This fat one. Hold on. Sorry. This was the other bad so

354
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.810
Alyse: Di bad. So yeah, I will be

Alyse: Fat look at them deeper look at him go all in.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.020
Richelle Direny: All gums.

357
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.340
Alyse: Her teeth into.

358
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:20.730
Alyse: Some, yeah. And the bottom. She has been for a while now. They say they compete for months, like legit for like

359
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.400
Alyse: I'm not going away.

360
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.200
Alyse: Yeah, like, I'm sorry. My house is a mess.

361
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:36.540
Alyse: Yeah, she has bumps on the bottom of her gums little white bumps. There's like two of them. And she steady like

362
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.720
Alyse: sucking on her mouth and drooling like crazy.

363
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:48.990
Alyse: Kids are always what around the neck that in their hands are always freezing because their hands are always in their mouth.

364
00:40:53.340 --> 00:41:02.040
Alyse: But yeah, that's they are. Oh my god, they're just they happy as being nice. I got so lucky. Seriously. I just hope they keep these little qualities of there's

365
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.260
Richelle Direny: No, we all wish.

366
00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:10.920
Alyse: God I'm wishing real are do know, but they're just they have their own personalities and they're just like

367
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:23.550
Alyse: How could you like I'll be up at like five o'clock in the morning, laying there watching TV and I could feel somebody staring at me and I look over and summers just looking at me smiling. And I'm like, oh my god.

368
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:29.070
Alyse: They could be crying their asses off. But as soon as my face pops in.

369
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.900
Alyse: That first time it's much crying with a big smile on her face.

370
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.600
Alyse: At all. I just like I just love them just love them.

371
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.540
Alyse: He was like yesterday.

372
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:50.490
Alyse: Exhibit he spent some time downstairs with me. I got sitting on the couch with the babies and he was talking to her and giving her kisses and stuff.

373
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:58.590
Alyse: Because you know he doesn't really interact with them at all like, not one bit whatsoever. And I'm just like,

374
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:06.810
Alyse: I've been trying to get him to, you know, first of all, your sisters. I know their babies and you don't you know you don't get babies and stuff like that.

375
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:15.810
Alyse: But they still need to get to know you. You know what I mean. They want to know your face and it doesn't it make you feel happy when they see when they smile, you know,

376
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:24.930
Alyse: So we sat there and we all, and we talked, and he asked questions about them and stuff. And I mean we spend a little bit of time and doing that last late

377
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:37.200
Alyse: So I just, I guess I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make sure I pick a day, kind of just maybe if it's just something I tried to involve them to like, hey, go. You want to come with me or I'm going to get something to eat. You want to come

378
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:52.770
Alyse: Stuff like that, you know, let him put his own music on in the car, you know, from his phone just simple things. But, you know, to him that's unfortunately I've gotten the understanding that that stuff just wasn't enough like he he wants it all, like, this is how

379
00:42:53.940 --> 00:43:02.340
Alyse: It's like this, everything doesn't revolve like not every the world stops and it's just me and him, and it does. You know what I mean. I mean,

380
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:07.470
Richelle Direny: The balance if you will always you also have to balance it because the reality is that

381
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.020
Richelle Direny: Children are always going to want it's caught. It's always like that, me, me, me, me, me, more, more and more and more.

382
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:13.800
Alyse: Yeah.

383
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:20.970
Richelle Direny: Well, you have to teach them that, like you said, if they have two kids come into the world somewhat empty you teach them everything

384
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:35.910
Richelle Direny: They don't understand me, you have to teach them you have to guide them. So while you you provide that to give him that time and attention. He can't always have your, your whole day.

385
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.510
Alyse: Yeah.

386
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:48.060
Richelle Direny: You have to give him structure, you have to teach you that, you know, this is your time, but everybody else needs their time as well. Summary your time, the other kids need their time.

387
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:55.530
Richelle Direny: And I'm short. Now let me ask you this. The one daughter that has been. I know you said that you've been sleeping downstairs in

388
00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:03.720
Richelle Direny: With you and she gets up and she helps you. Do you find that that kind of drew your relationship, a little bit closer.

389
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:21.570
Alyse: I mean, yeah, it did. It's been rough after they found out everything about their mother kind of the way they've been attitude wise and mouth wise and she's like real distant lately. She's not like has she stays upstairs in a room, a lot. She doesn't

390
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:23.040
Know,

391
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.890
Richelle Direny: That has to do with her missing from mother.

392
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.370
Alyse: Yeah, I know. And it's like, I feel bad for her because

393
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:41.340
Alyse: At 11 year old and 11 years old. I mean, I'm like, I thought what my parents did was a way of life you know she lives a certain life and find out her mom's overdosing

394
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:48.240
Alyse: You know, or I'm smoking crack, you know, they don't. She doesn't care to see her. You know what I mean, like,

395
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:56.490
Alyse: It's appealing. I don't know, because I you know I always had my parents around and to me. I thought that was okay. Everything they were doing at one point, you know,

396
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:05.160
Alyse: Um, so I couldn't imagine you know and then things get rough around here, you get an attitude and I get there too and I gotta remember I'm deal with kids.

397
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:20.760
Alyse: So she's been she's been kind of her doing her own thing. But, you know, she's still like she was down here this morning, playing with the girls and she was playing with summer yesterday, trying to get her to roll ball, you know, she's still pops around. And yeah, it's really

398
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:30.600
Alyse: I don't want to say, out of all of the kids. She's more the easygoing, she doesn't normally get in trouble at all doesn't normally talk back

399
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:40.980
Alyse: She's like the ideal child out of our kids, you know, like, that's kind of what we'd like you all to be like, but you know that's not gonna happen. You guys are all different.

400
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:54.450
Alyse: But um yeah lately, her, her mouth. Then a little sideways, to say the least. But she's going through a lot of stuff inside of her head. So I just kind of let it go. The best I can.

401
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.650
Richelle Direny: It's, it's that concept of I'm hurting. I want everybody else to her.

402
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah, horrible. I want

403
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:11.130
Alyse: I mean, it should at 32 years old, I still feel that way if I'm in a mood. I want everybody else to be in the mood. I'm gonna let you know like yesterday, I was just so over kids in their mouth and

404
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:19.950
Alyse: This and then and whatever, and he'll say what's wrong. I'm like, I'm like, I'm just, I'm just irritated with kids like sorry it's going to happen, unfortunately.

405
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:37.980
Alyse: You know, and that's just the way it is. So I try not to have like that and like he obviously knew something was wrong because though I was acting, but I wasn't trying to be that normal like overly bitchy person I am. We're having smart mouth. I just was like you and just let it go.

406
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.520
Richelle Direny: Um, did, did you

407
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.740
Richelle Direny: So it seems like he's being a lot more involved in more helpful.

408
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:56.670
Alyse: Yeah yeah like he's done all the laundry for shell like it's like God's been answered my prayers around here.

409
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:04.620
Alyse: He's been cleaned up the laundry room. He's been folding clothes with the kids like because literally before I had the babies every day. The kids will go to school.

410
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:10.020
Alyse: I would clean from nine nine to 11 1130 you know i mean clean this whole first floor.

411
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:18.480
Alyse: Vacuum everything map everything clean downstairs, clean the bathroom do laundry, you know, all the stuff I'd have to do for this person efforts and whatever. And it's like,

412
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:23.370
Alyse: My whole day was revolved around clean up after everybody. And I was just like, I'm done so.

413
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:31.260
Alyse: We can live like hillbillies and slobs that that's how you want to do, because I'm not coming and picking up after everybody constantly I'm not me.

414
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:37.800
Alyse: I do not have made written on my forehead. You guys are old enough, you guys can make a mess. You guys concern how clean it up.

415
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:50.190
Alyse: Like I don't ask for a lot and the stuff you guys get on a regular basis. Trump's like anything like you guys should be looking the damn floors clean for the stuff you guys get around here. You know what I mean.

416
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:58.830
Alyse: So I was like, I'm not feeling bad about this no more because I felt bad for a while like I wasn't, I wasn't doing good enough and what and I'm just like,

417
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:07.260
Alyse: I got kids. I got to take care of. I got these kids. I got a household. I got a business do what I can. Whatever. I can't do you guys need to help do period.

418
00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:14.730
Alyse: If you want to have any sort of life outside of this House, because we could just sit in rooms all day. I don't care.

419
00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:20.310
Richelle Direny: So in because you took that stance. He has been a whole lot more.

420
00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:26.460
Alyse: informed on. I mean, he thinks I think he's, he's like, I need help. I can't do it all on my own.

421
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:38.580
Alyse: Yeah, I understand, like, now you're about to be back to work and things aren't going to happen like that. So, these kids are gonna have to listen to me more. And we're going to have to be a team, period. It's not going to happen. This isn't going to all happen on itself.

422
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:40.230
Alyse: Away.

423
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:41.790
Richelle Direny: This home for a while.

424
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.930
Alyse: Oh my god, he's been home for a long time. So,

425
00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:49.530
Richelle Direny: So being home he got to see firsthand all that you were doing.

426
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.920
Alyse: In all yeah and and all the the disrespect. I get and mouth and everything. You know what I mean. And

427
00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.130
Richelle Direny: So maybe that was a blessing in disguise for you.

428
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:16.290
Alyse: Yeah, maybe. Maybe it was. I mean, it's like I said he gets the kids going hey the that all that laundry is done. I mean, we had there was so much clothes, everybody all i don't have nothing. Are you kidding me that more clothes in China got rice. First of all,

429
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:23.670
Alyse: And all of them are on your damn floor in your closet dirty because you're lazy ass don't want to walk two feet and drop them down the laundry chute.

430
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:26.640
Richelle Direny: I love that.

431
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:27.570
One day,

432
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:37.140
Alyse: It was. I mean, it's all my god it's you. I thought I had, I mean I have closed. I've never even touched, but Jesus these kids.

433
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.120
Alyse: Least of all

434
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.930
Alyse: Willing to they don't they shouldn't want for anything for real for

435
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:48.930
Richelle Direny: It, but that's good. I did. Okay. So did you acknowledge the fact that he was being helpful and supportive

436
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:53.250
Alyse: Oh yeah, I think him so much like even joke. He's like, I hate folding.

437
00:49:53.250 --> 00:50:00.360
Alyse: Clothes. I'm like, yeah, that's why I rewatch him about four times before they actually make it into the dryer because they sit in a walker.

438
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:10.560
Alyse: I hate doing laundry with a passion. I really do. So I'm like, so grateful for him that everything is caught up down there and you know like

439
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:20.370
Alyse: Like I just told him, I said, I just need some help. Every now and then, like, things get backed up like he's he's taken into consideration that I hate being in the shoe room where my offices.

440
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:26.790
Alyse: He's like so. Okay. Where can we move it. This house is just so small for us now.

441
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:43.890
Alyse: It's ridiculous. Like every it just feels and I'm not a cluttering person like I might be a little lazy and sloppy sometimes, but in all reality. Like, I'm always like my house, my house, my house everything so Clary and so whatever because we have no room. It's just so hard.

442
00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:48.660
Alyse: No matter how much you try to clean something I don't want clean because it's cuttery

443
00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.780
Richelle Direny: But then getting the kids more involved in in keeping everything organized

444
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:55.560
Alyse: Yeah.

445
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.910
Richelle Direny: I mean, the reality is, because remember, if you if you're

446
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.290
Richelle Direny: A manager.

447
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.740
Richelle Direny: What is this small all you're going to do is just have a bigger

448
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:10.080
Alyse: Space to just get more happy your clutter. Yeah. Yeah, it's true.

449
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:22.140
Richelle Direny: It's always it's better to teach them how to keep things organized then to before you move into that bigger space. So then, because if your troubles are big. Now they're going to mean monstrous

450
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:33.510
Alyse: When yeah and that's the thing like Mackenzie, the older daughter, she can clean when she wants to, you know, if she gets in the mode and the the the want i mean that girl.

451
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:44.670
Alyse: She can she can clean it and that's like she's an asset, I'll tell you because you're like hey, I'll give you $10 you know us together and this House will be spotless.

452
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:53.160
Alyse: For journalists yeah I mean she keeps her room. I mean, normally pretty damn nice, other than if she's like

453
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:59.910
Alyse: Searching for clothes. Yeah, like she got clothes on her for now from like getting dressed. But I mean, like,

454
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.260
Alyse: Her room is normally pretty dang

455
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:14.850
Alyse: Clean, other than the stuff on like the floor and the bed but like you. She is my cleaner for sure. The boys were having trouble now because we have to get them a dresser.

456
00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:22.410
Alyse: And everything. Like there's just all this room. I just want to throw this whole room away so bad.

457
00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.450
Richelle Direny: That's boys. That's

458
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:24.930
Alyse: Yeah.

459
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:30.360
Richelle Direny: And if you clean it today. By the time they come home. It goes right back to how you

460
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.290
Alyse: Yeah, well, they need a dresser. That's why we're not like on them.

461
00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:36.300
Alyse: So bad.

462
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:41.670
Alyse: Right now, because they really need a dresser, to get the room together, but it's just

463
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.850
Alyse: It's just hard are doing the best we can here.

464
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.870
Richelle Direny: You're doing a good job. Despite having how many kids.

465
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:53.040
Alyse: In the house six killers. Yes, six kids six kids.

466

467
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:01.800

Richelle Direny: stay stable.

469
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:19.770
Richelle Direny: Getting through everything that you've gone through even with just kind of with Harold and, you know, with the kids and with CPS becoming involved in your life and just everything I did tell you that they called me the other day. Right.

470
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.040
Alyse: No, I mean, I know that they talked prior

471
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:27.270
Alyse: Then yeah, yeah. The new one. She just called me yesterday, the other day, she's like

472
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:33.990

Alyse: So she wants to see the other kids and she's like, Well, did you get your card yet and I was like less than, there's this place. I was supposed to go to, but I feel like they were pretty sketchy. And I'm going to try to get the card through the

474
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:56.610
Alyse: The doctor I go see that. I tell you, I'm okay. I found this place on. It's called a line centers align health centers.

475
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:15.930
Alyse: So they took x rays of me and about 10 to 15 years ago I wasn't like a car crash. And I don't think that car crash. I didn't see the car crash was that bad, just got hit on inside. It was icy and I guess I suffered like severe with flash. They say it's like one of the

476
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.310
Alyse: One of the worst what flashes they've seen um

477
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:23.100
Alyse: And

478
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:26.790

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:44.730
Alyse: It's a more towards the bottom of my spine. And then I also have an extra vertebrae, um, you're only supposed to have

505
00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:48.060
Alyse: Five. I have six

506
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:55.860
Alyse: And then like this is my hips so my hips are on the line also

507
00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:04.290
Alyse: Which. That's what I thought would have been a problem would have been my hips from that car accident because I remember jerking like I went flying in my feet.

508
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:12.870
Alyse: Yeah. And then I have arthritis in my S nine which is that lower portion of your back down by your bum.

509
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.590
Alyse: I have arthritis in my hips so

510
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:30.750
Alyse: They are like, well, the only way to really fix that is to get a stem cell. And I'm like, I can't afford $5,000 for a stem cell, although I would love it because I basically be 32 years old with like brand new baby hips. You know what I mean, like,

511
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:46.620
Alyse: That that were like one or two years old. They come, they get the stem cells from baby's placenta and their umbilical cords and then they inject that in you and it, it becomes something new. It's like a new body inside your body.

512
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:54.030
Alyse: So yeah, I'd be like, I'd be like 50 years old with 20 year old hips, but I can't afford it. It's myself and others.

513
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:55.470
Wow.

514
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:08.370
Alyse: To me so worth it. I mean this right now. This backs up i'm doing is like 3200 but it's like, to me, it's worth it not to be in the pain that I'm in, um, I found that

515
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:25.530
Alyse: Just within the past couple weeks of going, there's a whole different change in my pasture in the way I hold my my neck. My back pains reduce some I'm still having a lot of problems with like the sciatica, but I can tell the difference in my back already.

516
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:29.460
Alyse: So,

517
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:34.590
Alyse: I mean, make $63 payment, a month for 16 months. That's not bad.

518
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.410
Richelle Direny: That's not bad but

519
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.950
Richelle Direny: It always doesn't sound bad. In the beginning, but then

520
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.880
Alyse: I know, yeah.

521
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.680
Richelle Direny: 63,000 seemed like a whole lot of money. But when you got to come up with it when you don't have it.

522
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.190
Alyse: Yeah I know but it's like, to me, it's worth. It's a

523
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:58.200
Alyse: To do this because I mean like, now I want to get Xavier check to see if he has scoliosis, because it's a genetic disorder.

524
00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.400
Richelle Direny: How old is he

525
00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.210
Richelle Direny: What he's in the sixth grade.

526
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:04.650
Alyse: He will be next year.

527
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.820
Richelle Direny: I think they do it in middle school. I don't know if they do it in

528
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.470
Richelle Direny: Middle School.

529
00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:21.510
Alyse: And said, Yeah, they did it. I did it in grade school, I remember because they told me I scoliosis. They made me. She stood at the one end of the room. I stood at the other. And she made me expand a certain way and bend over.

530
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:28.110
Alyse: And touch my feet. And I remember them telling me, like, oh, you have scoliosis. I'm like, Yeah, okay, whatever, like
