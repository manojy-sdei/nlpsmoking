Alicia Noedel: I've been doing pretty good this week. Yeah, I've been trying to

19
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.000
Alicia Noedel: Like let things go and and not let things affect me so much.

20
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.620
Alicia Noedel: After our conversation.

21
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you think a group he did you kind of get something out of that.

22
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:21.180
Alicia Noedel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, I, I've thought about how the first thing that came to mind is what my triggers used to be things that made me want to use

23
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:40.650
Alicia Noedel: In the past where, you know, like my abusive relationship with my ex and and then I realized that, um, you know, the problems that I was having with my mom made me want to use to because it made me, you know, go back to that place as a kid.

24
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.480
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. And I just, you know, I didn't want to feel like that.

25
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.850
Alicia Noedel: Um, I mean, it still happens. I still have that trigger you know unfortunately I live with her.

26
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.540
Alicia Noedel: Um, most of the time, we're good.

27
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.870
Alicia Noedel: But, um, I do get that thought that's what away biggest triggers.

28
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.790
Alicia Noedel: Is her

29
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the experience of of making contact with other group members, what, how are you feeling in group as its evolving.

30
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:31.500
Alicia Noedel: Um, I love our group, I really do. I love all the people in it. I think we have a great dynamic and we have a lot of diversity in lifestyle.

31
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.720
Alicia Noedel: So I think that that, um, you know, is a good thing is a really good thing.

51
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wanted to show you. I'm like, I'm not making it up like it is just the black hole of no Wi Fi.

52
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:26.640
Alicia Noedel: And that's one of those things to where like you hear your phone go off at like four in the morning. You think it's something like negative and urgent, you know that you need to check your phone right away. I'm so Sparky.

53
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, you guys can call me anytime you want to. Because I have it on. Do Not Disturb unfortunately I won't be able to do anything like in a in a 24 hour period. I turn the phone on Do Not Disturb so I can get back to you, but it won't be right away. I'm

54
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Texting text me anytime. I'll have it on, do not disturb you can do that, fine.

55
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But it does mean I can't pick it up right away and

56
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.740
Alicia Noedel: You know, you have to go

57
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: See room or something.

58
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.810
Alicia Noedel: Oh, of course. Yeah, yours very busy. I'm sure you always have something to do

59
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's scoot down here to your goals, what we get.

60
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We have I wanted, I want to be able to cope with my trauma and future problems better. What a fantastic goal.

61
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear from you. On May 29 that's today. What do you think, how are you doing with I want to be able to cope with my trauma better

62
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.990
Alicia Noedel: Um,

63
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:37.080
Alicia Noedel: I think that since I've had help with wasn't I've had you in my life that has made

64
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.830
Alicia Noedel: So much progress and it doesn't seem out of reach anymore.

65
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:55.140
Alicia Noedel: Oh, you know, I feel like I'm capable of of it happening, you know, completely one day, you know, but I don't feel hopeless anywhere about it.

66
00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:06.870
Alicia Noedel: Uh huh. I realized I don't just have to accept that I, you know, horrible things happen to me and my life is going to be horrible because of it. That's not how it needs to be.

67
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote that down. That is great. I like it. There's hope and this work we're doing is is benefiting because it does sound like for example this week. Yeah, yeah. She was got under your skin. But in a lot of ways it was an okay week right wasn't this big

68
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.840
Alicia Noedel: Emotional

69
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:43.800
Alicia Noedel: Roller Coaster or Friday, we had a Friday. Last Friday, we had a boiling point. And because the whole week I just felt like me and her were butting heads and everything she she does this thing where she nitpicks at everything I do.

70
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

71
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:52.230
Alicia Noedel: So like this is wrong. Then she doesn't do it every day. But like sometimes she'll be like, all the whole day she'll say like

72
00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:02.310
Alicia Noedel: Every like almost everything I do like she'd be like, Why don't you do that, why aren't you doing that, like that or you know with, you know, cleaning with my daughter with whatever and

73
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:10.920
Alicia Noedel: So for like the past three nights before that me and her were arguing arguing arguing and like same time every night.

74
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:21.630
Alicia Noedel: And then Friday I I just couldn't take it anymore. And it got into an argument. It didn't escalate crazy. We didn't weren't yelling at each other. But we did get into a little speck

75
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.010
Can I hear

76
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.380
Alicia Noedel: Ya.

77
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:36.060
Alicia Noedel: It was just something small, but I was still kind of raw from the whole like every single day like and still with the like whole get over it thing.

78
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:53.010
Alicia Noedel: And so she's saying something about how we need to help more like as if we don't do any, like, it made me feel like we don't do anything like with the housework and stuff, which I clean every single day. But I guess you know to her. It's like we're not doing much

79
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.150
Alicia Noedel: And so

80
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:11.550
Alicia Noedel: It's that I'm trying to talk to, because she's dwells on things. So she wants to, like, take one thing where you can just say it and be done with it and she starts stretching it out. And so can you get

81
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The sounds interesting. I'd like to know more about an example of that.

82
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:24.390
Alicia Noedel: Um, so like she'd be like, it's not that hard. You see, the thing I really like

83
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:43.530
Alicia Noedel: More. It's not that hard. I'm really stressed and like, that's fine you but then it starts to be like, you know, you need to make sure that walking and doing what he needs to do. And it just caught like way too personal like and something that's so small doesn't need to be so drawn out

84
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:56.880
Alicia Noedel: After I already said okay, understand, that's fine. Okay. Um, so she kept on you know saying you don't you think, don't you think, and then she was like, Why aren't you talking to me because I just

85
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:15.240
Alicia Noedel: Shut down rather than arguing. I didn't want to argue. So I just was doing I was making brownies. So I just kind of like was focusing on orders doing. And she goes, talk to me and I just looked up and I just, you know, started to tear up and I was just like, I don't want to talk

86
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

87
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:16.920
Alicia Noedel: About this

88
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right there, slow down the pace a little bit. I don't want to talk about this and

89
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what did she say

90
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:39.810
Alicia Noedel: She said, Why not, and I told her, these past few days every single night. You've been getting like this and I don't know what I did to you. I don't know what's wrong. I don't know why you're so angry with me.

91
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:41.730
Alicia Noedel: I'm

92
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.950
Alicia Noedel: Okay, can bench.

93
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, can I try to predict what she said.

94
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.150
Yeah.

95
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't been angry all I was doing was asking you to help out more.

96
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.150
Yeah.

97
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.200
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I mean, I don't see how I i

98
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.980
Alicia Noedel: Mean

99
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, it's predictable that's and I didn't even know what it was. That's how predictable. This is you bet when when you set your boundary. And you said, I don't want to talk about it.

100
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You caved

101
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not, she said.

102
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You owe me nothing you owe her nothing as an explanation.

103
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that it would stay with that. Just let it sit there because you're probably like, oh yeah, but we're in her house. She's helping us with soda I O or an explanation, I have to tell her, but sit with it a little longer.

104
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think you owe me an explanation for why

105
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to talk you owe me nothing.

106
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you owe her an explanation to justify your adult

107
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Behavior.

108
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you owe her because you already said, I don't want to talk that was your limit.

109
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But UK

110
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:25.620
Alicia Noedel: And I've already said okay you know i i to me. I was switch, you know, but she has this way.

111
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:35.460
Alicia Noedel: Of pushing a button to make you talk, you know, like saying something to you to make you argue with her. It's like as if she wants to argument, you know,

112
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's

113
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.610
Alicia Noedel: Let's last word kind of thing.

114
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, let's leave on the table for now is the hypothesis that she wants to fight.

115
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because just for now. It may not be true, but just for this argument a discussion up just for today, because for some people.

116
00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's connection.

117
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's sad, but it's better than the quiet that you were doing the the no talking for many people, that sense of isolation, when you were quiet and kind of May, she may have felt ignored.

118
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She would probably fall unconscious rather be fighting

119
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.990
Alicia Noedel: Like that's worse than a spat we shutting down and not feeding into it.

120
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.160
Yes.

121
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's I'm taking the position of her because if you're trying to wrap your head around. Why, why did she do this because some people, and she may or may not be one of these folks. They would rather have that argument.

122
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, at least, it shows you're invested and you care enough to argue. You know how people have said right you'll know there's a real problem and I stopped arguing

123
00:13:51.960 --> 00:14:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Fighting for us anymore. It's kind of like that so that make that healthy but my point is that there may be that going on. So she may feel this sense of abandonment.

124
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: When you disappear and you do your healthy boundary setting. So I'm not asking you to change. I'm taking the position of her so you can kind of wrap your head around.

125
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would someone do it. Why would someone pick a fight, good grief. It's like I already said okay, why does she keep going, going, going, going, that might be an explanation.

126
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:28.050
Alicia Noedel: I mean that that it really does sound you know like what it could be.

127
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:35.370
Alicia Noedel: She, she's it's also like so weird because she is very argumentative but then she'll

128
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:50.250
Alicia Noedel: Like once the argument gets to where you're making valid points and she doesn't want to hear it anymore. She can always you know be louder than you or just walk away and not want to listen, you know, in a different way of being silent.

129
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stick. Let's stick with this. Let's stick with this little interaction, this one that you just you brought up, which is

130
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to help more and she carried on with it and got into what keen needs to do this and this and this and you were feeling what when she did that.

131
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.930
Alicia Noedel: Attacked okay yeah

132
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.490
Alicia Noedel: And as he

133
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.430
Alicia Noedel: Is so you know he doesn't do anything anybody

134
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.110
Alicia Noedel: felt like it was coming out of nowhere.

135
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, yeah.

136
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

137
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice you did the part about healthy detachment, you did the healthy detachment. You set a boundary. You stayed quiet and I think, in and of itself. That's pretty cool. Um, but it does have a consequence, though, because you're changing the recipe for mom.

138
00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:58.680
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

139
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's going to need you to be upset.

140
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And going to need you to justify your behavior.

141
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What just in your imagination, what do you think would have happened if you kept repeating that and not escalating your tone. But if you just said you know what mom.

142
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I HEARD YOU EARLIER, YOU WANT US TO HELP OUT MORE

143
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like

144
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard you.

145
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but why, why are you been ignoring me, you know, she might say or what what's going on. You look angry. Like what would she say

146
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.930
Alicia Noedel: She would just be like,

147
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.420
Alicia Noedel: A

148
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:59.010
Alicia Noedel: While the one helps me I need help. No one ever helps me like she always true to say that, but like I'm constantly doing things all the time. Okay. And if I take one day to rest and relax. It's like the end of the world, but

149
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.130
Alicia Noedel: It's, it's like

150
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.710
Alicia Noedel: It's like

151
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:11.550
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

152
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so here's the thing, if she says no one helps me in your head, you were already thinking I do, I do these 10 things she's just being irrational. Is that kind of how it went in your head.

153
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:42.240
Alicia Noedel: Um, I mean, I can understand like that she gets overwhelmed with things. But it's like you can't just, you know, go into the kitchen at 910 o'clock at night and decide that you don't like that. There's a few dishes and freak out.

154
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.680
Alicia Noedel: Because I'm not cleaning at 11 o'clock at night.

155
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:55.800
Alicia Noedel: And it's like, she does these little things like um you know that song. I forgot what it's called burritos help. I need somebody

156
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:02.130
Alicia Noedel: To put that on her phone playing and she kept on like going like this to God.

157
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:03.810
Alicia Noedel: Like just

158
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.320
Alicia Noedel: Subliminal like you know passive aggressiveness.

159
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, it really is.

160
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.180
Alicia Noedel: Okay. And I didn't know if I was overreacting, or

161
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:29.070
Alicia Noedel: Not when like I didn't know if I was really the bad guy in the situation or if I had a right to be like, you know, why are you being like this because she always has a way of making me feel like I'm real like I like I should just, you know, submit

162
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't. We'll do a little I'm not everybody, but I'm somebody we could just kind of see if what you're talking about.

163
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have an opinion, it's not the only opinion but if so if the it's different for every family and you have sort of this blending going on right now right you have what you would probably do in your own place. And then how mom likes it.

164
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But the the 11 O'clock thing.

165
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Her reaction.

166
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is she. Are you saying that she walked around the house and said, Who likes the dishes in here. Nobody helps thing. Oh my gosh. No one helps me help. I need somebody help and places music and prayed like this. That's what she did.

167
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that was theatrical and way, way over the top.

168
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.690
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

169
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was about her.

170
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That was nothing about you. Now, if the context is that your mother had calmly come to you and said,

171
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like guys for 24 hours. I don't want to see a single fork butter knife peanut butter spoon in sync. Not 24 hours so y'all hand wash them. You have your car you hand wash those babies put away. I just want my eyes to see nothing on the surface.

172
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.950
Alicia Noedel: Just want to know it's understandable, but because I like

173
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: My whole thing to oh wait, did she say that though so you know now that that's different. If we say listen

174
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a request, I just for a little bit. Let's just be super tiny. I'm starting to feel a little unraveled

175
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of need clean space, then I have a clean mind. Let me just have nothing out of order for just a little bit. Now we can go back to just everyone still having some chaos, but

176
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I kind of just need it, then they are now you've got something. If you said yes. No problem. Each of us and then someone forgot, and left the bowl from a snack.

177
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:39.330
Alicia Noedel: So that's what it that's what that's what it is, is like two months ago, um, you know, we had a conversation where it was the calm version of what it was, you know, Can you guys please help more

178
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.900
Alicia Noedel: Okay. And, you know, walking

179
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:51.810
Alicia Noedel: You know, didn't take out the trash for like a week and you know I did it. And it's not like it's not being done, it's just someone else did it.

180
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.960
Alicia Noedel: And so that's when that yeah

181
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: She does not like that. She doesn't like that you do it.

182
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:12.900
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, she she uses the excuse that you know she feels bad for me when we do in all reality. He's helping me all the time. She just doesn't see him physically doing it.

183
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how he helps you

184
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:30.030
Alicia Noedel: He cleans my the room tidy up the room for the everyday because he knows that I, you know, focus on the kitchen. A lot. Um, he does the dogs mess. He cleans up the dogs messes. The, you know,

185
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Accidents

186
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:39.060
Alicia Noedel: He does the be cleans up the living room because he's in there, a lot. Okay.

187
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's, here's what I wonder my my my curiosity is how is it that she doesn't have that information and I have it.

188
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.600
Alicia Noedel: doesn't ask or doesn't. I don't know.

189
00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.520
Alicia Noedel: Maybe just doesn't want to see. I don't know.

190
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: nobody's told her.

191
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:03.900
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

192
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'll leave it with me. You can let her know

193
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You can not saying that she's going to change anything. Remember, we can't change what other people are doing. But we can share with other people, our logic, if they want to be logical for 20 minutes, that'd be great.

194
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We can say, well, you know, for me, Joaquin is just just picking up where I'm increasing all of this focus in the kitchen. So that's on me with the dishes. I didn't think about 11pm but

195
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: He's he takes care of the dog accidents in the you can't see it so much. Mom, but he takes care of the bedroom while I'm going into the kitchen.

196
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And so for me I we don't see what keane's helping behavior, the same because Watkins helping is kind of behind closed doors to you, Mom, you may not see it but it means a lot to me what he's doing.

197
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Some on what's it like for you to think that you're, you know, I'm being taken advantage of mom.

198
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: See, that's the question. Right. It's a versus defending it's what's going on for you, mom like

199
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you own your truth and you happen to share it. You could not share that and say what what's going on. Mom, you really

200
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want me to be taken advantage of. It looks like huh

201
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that about what what's your concern here.

202
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:42.990
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I mean, I try to get her to open up and talk about you know what's really the problem when things like when little things blow up like what's really bothering you, because I know that this isn't it. This isn't the reason why you're so upset.

203
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:51.390
Alicia Noedel: Right. Um, and she just doesn't open up. She can't she doesn't, you know, like he said she doesn't have those coping mechanisms. She doesn't

204
00:23:52.170 --> 00:24:03.870
Alicia Noedel: She can't. So it's just like nothing, there's nothing wrong. It's just that you're not doing that or just that the problem that we're speaking about, like, it's there is something deeper. I know that.

205
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.520
Alicia Noedel: But I'm

206
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: An accepted the job that we just accept people's answers. Oh, okay. You go, okay.

207
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going, you're done. It's done.

208
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You share perspective, didn't you, I really see what King is doing these things. And I'm so grateful to him. I really feel like a solid partner.

209
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.770
Alicia Noedel: And Mom, what's going on for

210
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You around this and she says, Nothing. Oh, okay. And you just, well, there's your answer.

211
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.900
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it's hard for me though. Like when she gets like that when she gets very like uppity

212
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:49.320
Alicia Noedel: It's, it's hard for me to communicate like an adult, because I start to feel like a little kid again. Like, like I'm being attacked you know and like

213
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:55.680
Alicia Noedel: I'm not allowed to speak because I wasn't allowed to talk back. I was just supposed to sit there and listen.

214
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:15.210
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, I, I just, it's scary for me like I like you know i i'm so my, you know, my mom is already like, so she's disabled. You know, like she you know i know that she couldn't hurt me if she wanted to, you know, and it's horrible that I'm still scared of her

215
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.970
Alicia Noedel: I'm still scared of her

216
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:28.380
Alicia Noedel: And so I don't know how to like I've been thinking about leaving. I want to move to Pueblo, Colorado. I want to move out of New Mexico.

217
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.340
Alicia Noedel: I don't want to leave my family, but like I can't

218
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:42.420
Alicia Noedel: I don't know if it's just the Korean team being stuck in this House, you know, with everyone. The whole time. It's like, I don't want to live here. I want to be somewhere else.

219
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I get it. It makes sense and

220
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All that is true.

221
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Context, it's everybody's amplified right I'm

222
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the intensity ships. Yeah.

223
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't going to happen today.

224
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So, no, no, it's important just not immediately urgent but protecting your psychological well being, is urgent, I do think that's urgent and i think i think that when you say instead of moving away because notice right away and you tried to move away by just being quiet. Yeah.

225
00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.640
Alicia Noedel: I've been distancing myself.

226
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's noticing.

227
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I want, I just, you got to keep it real for me if you said to your mom.

228
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This may not make any sense to you, long but

229
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I'm scared. I get afraid I'm afraid.

230
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that

231
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, this is from

232
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A long, long time ago, but I still have the

233
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Same response as if I'm a little girl. As soon as we start to argue. So if you ever see me kind of get quiet or whatever.

234
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to just kind of go take care of myself and I'm going to, I'm going to just, it's not about you, it's about sort of me taking care of myself.

235
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I do walk out of the room. I kind of just want some quiet time to collect myself. Would that be okay, Mom.

236
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:21.690
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

237
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:30.660
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I think we have good progress because the next morning, you know, it took the whole next morning for us to speak about it.

238
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:40.320
Alicia Noedel: And we, you know, we talked about it we hugged it out. We both cried, whatever. But, uh, there was over an apology. If there's never, you know,

239
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's

240
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:48.420
Alicia Noedel: A sorry for picking a fight, you know, even if the reason why you fought with you was a justifiable reason

241
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me give you a little warning about those apologies. You may think that's what you want.

242
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's the problem.

243
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I leave lots of room to be wrong. So I could be wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. But the thing about the apology is she may apologize and go do the same thing she did the day before you may get the apology you think you're looking for, but it might not be the apology that you want.

244
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Sincere know you might actually want her to behave

245
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Differently differently. Yeah, instead of an empty apology.

246
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

247
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to reef affirm that when you said this, don't really want to talk right now that was reasonable. We all do that that's a limit setting and if she said, why, why don't you want to talk right now.

248
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you say to me.

249
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.600
What can we do

250
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:17.430
Alicia Noedel: I just don't want this to turn into something bigger than it is. And maybe we can talk about it when both of us are a little less heated so that things don't escalate BECAUSE I JUST SHUT DOWN WHEN WE FIGHT AND IT GETS INTENSE.

251
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Your response is genuine and it's beautiful it's long.

252
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:28.980
Alicia Noedel: Oh,

253
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

254
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to slow way down here. So what it's it's a compliment. And it's also a warning. One of the only problem with long is you have words that I can pick out

255
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're the one that escalates it you see you gave me so many words I can find one of them to pick at

256
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If you see if you keep. I love the explanation I like because I like knowing kind of what's going on for you.

257
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But

258
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: For someone who doesn't want to hear any version of know

259
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You gave me a lot of a lot of words that I some of those I could pick out and I could pick a fight with you over.

260
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of just watch this. The technique is he just repeat yourself.

261
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You just repeat it.

262
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I just I just really don't want to talk right now.

263
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why

264
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I just don't want to talk. I'm gonna go

265
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of chill in my room for a bit.

266
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference. I

267
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Stick to what I said.

268
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's less to remember and you're not giving the listener, a long explanation, so they can find something to then

269
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: argue about that and then argue about that then you try and set your boundary again and they argue about that part needs such a boundary again and they don't care about your boundary

270
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right person that pays attention to the boundary is going to be you.

271
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They will only know it over, days, weeks, months, and years of you resetting it.

272
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It will be you.

273
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She will continue to not see it time and time again.

274
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you will reset it. And eventually, eventually, she'll get it.

275
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.090
Alicia Noedel: Hopefully,

276
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

277
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Not and you'll feel more comfortable setting it it'll become natural. Oh, I don't have time right now. How about tomorrow. How about it this time. You'll get it'll get smoother. It'll be less anxious and more playful and it won't be this heart wrenching thing.

278
00:31:50.970 --> 00:32:01.980
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it was just, it was a lot easier when we have problems like that when I wasn't living here, like it was face to face, face to face, then it gets so much more part

279
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You can add this if you want to add this, you could say something like, you know what mom I know both of our intentions are good.

280
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to talk about it right now. It's important. Maybe we could pick this up tomorrow. I'm just, I'm in a lot of distress right now.

281
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you just walk out. I know. Or I imagine our intentions are both good now. She doesn't have to be offended. You don't have to write. I know our intentions are. I imagine our intentions are good.

282
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts on that.

283
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:53.040
Alicia Noedel: That's amazing. I think that is what they need, because they don't know what to say. That's why. Yeah, I don't know, it's a so I feel like that, you know, there's no room for finding anything wrong with it.

284
00:32:53.340 --> 00:33:10.530
Alicia Noedel: Uh huh. And, you know, even though I don't have to explain anything. It just is like, you know, because she knows that I have hard days that I don't want to do anything like that. And so I feel like that would help. Okay.

285
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:12.150
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

286
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: He just sees that, you know, I didn't invent them these came from many, many different places. But look what it does its intention is create safety because in the absence of safety.

287
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What we do

288
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: We get angry we defend ourselves or right someone starts attacking. So if we create safety, we're more likely to kind of chill.

289
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that does.

290
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it presupposes it's the most generous of assumptions which is

291
00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what mom I am I imagine your intent is really good and minus two.

292
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to talk about it tomorrow morning if we can. I'm just gonna go rest for a little while.

293
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And you do it.

294
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're an adult woman.

295
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:08.130
Yeah.

296
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.770
Alicia Noedel: I think that's one thing that she has a hard time dealing with

297
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.150
Alicia Noedel: I'm not a kid anymore and I, you know, you can

298
00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:28.530
Alicia Noedel: Boss me around, you know, if I'm so nice. I'm so willing to help out, you know, asking me is all that it takes

299
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.090
I have

300
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can you may know that intellectually, but remember what you said about five minutes ago. I feel like a little girl. Yes, he like a little girl who feel like a girl so

301
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.000
Alicia Noedel: You know what, extremely treats me like a charm.

302
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So take a look at how

303
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:46.650
I

304
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I have

305
00:34:52.650 --> 00:35:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: an expectation that you will be able to handle whatever it is that I bring to the table, or do you end up feeling like you're treated like a little girl in here. Be honest with me.

306
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel okay. Well, good, because I see your capability and I meet you there.

307
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the difference. I see. It's in there and I'll meet you there.

308
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see what's missing what's missing what's missing and what you can do for me what you can do for me and I don't see the wound that I've caused you you and your mother have a

309
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: One story. I don't have that with you. I can see the adults and

310
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see your strengths

311
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a threat to me. You know what I'm saying, like men, none of that's there. So I can see as an adult.

312
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't

313
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know the pathology there but

314
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to see yourself as an adult and it's going to be scary and hard

315
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're asking your mother to see it in you before you see it in you.

316
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.280
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it is hard to figure it out.

317
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so right you're used to do in this getting your, your data from the outside. You saw this in group to

318
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's your data has who you are is determined by how you being treated in any given moment, that means it's going to fluctuate, and it's going to be changing and roller coaster ride. But if instead you get into the breath, and you feel how you feel.

319
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel your little foot on the floor, you feel your body feel your. Oh, wait a minute, I'm, I'm an adult woman I'm a woman.

320
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Get back in here. Stop getting your data from the outside about who you are.

321
00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feel inside this is how I physically am in my body.

322
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a woman I'm all I'm, I'm a grown up. I'm an adult. Right, I feel that a minute.

323
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I feeling emotionally overwhelmed and sad getting triggered from something old, because this is a stupid ditch and dislikes. There's something bigger must write this be going on.

324
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now what do I want and quietly in your mind. Well, what do I want, I need to go refuel I need to be alone for a little bit. I need to set a boundary. Okay. Oh, there. Now I go outside and look at her.

325
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what mom I'm going through something right now. I, I know both of us we have good intentions yours as well, I imagine. And mine, too. And I just can't talk right now.

326
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We talked about it.

327
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:51.720
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

328
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.630
Alicia Noedel: It's so good for me to have something to say when

329
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.390
Alicia Noedel: Because I, I feel like I there's always something to be picked up.

330
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.660
Alicia Noedel: ends up making it worse.

331
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do at least three real quick scenarios. And this is pretty pretty common. A lot of people, they need to just have these words right in the forefront of their mind so that they're ready.

332
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone. This is people need this. We've got to have that stuff fresh in our mind so that we know what to say. So that if we're caught off guard. We've got something memorized.

333
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.520
Alicia Noedel: Um,

334
00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's role play

335
00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's give me two things worse things that could be said to you that will trigger that that inner little girl that vulnerable sad helpless. I can't speak. I have no voice.

336
00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.290
Alicia Noedel: You're worthless. You always want to

337
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:09.210
Alicia Noedel: Sit. You always want to fuck around. You never want to do anything in this House, okay.

338
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful and another one.

339
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.710
Alicia Noedel: I'm

340
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.610
Alicia Noedel: Everything. It's just more just being ignored.

341
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:37.650
Alicia Noedel: Really watching TV, leave me alone. Yeah, okay. Like if I'm speaking trying to like if I'm excited. Like I would come home from school and be like my I got something really cool to tell you

342
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:44.820
Alicia Noedel: And it would just completely zoned into the TV like completely ignoring me for it and then telling me to get all the room that

343
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually was busy.

344
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that when actually, I've got one of those. I think in our in the temperature one. How does that show up. Now, when you're living with your now.

345
00:39:53.310 --> 00:40:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You can try and catch it, that same thing shows up in a subtle way, maybe even her back is turned or even her face is turned away. It can be a trigger for that. Whereas the shop now.

346
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:11.910
Alicia Noedel: I mean, she's still kinda does that. Oh, except for telling me you know to leave or the fuck alone, like she used to

347
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now she just says I'm watching TV.

348
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:23.340
Alicia Noedel: Or she'll be on her phone. And she just won't see anything. She just completely ignore me that's, you know, and then below what like 10 minutes later.

349
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would look like this. So I'm like this, you would see me and how would it go

350
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.580
Alicia Noedel: Watching something like a video or something.

351
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you be trying to engage me, how would it sound.

352
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:46.530
Alicia Noedel: Come up in the room, y'all. Hey, Mom. I found this really cool thing I wanted to show you on the internet or something or whatever article

353
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.020
Alicia Noedel: Of something I know is her interests.

354
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at me, this whole time. So, do it again. But this time, don't look away.

355
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.160
Alicia Noedel: Hey, I found something really cool. I wanted to show you

356
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So, does she do this where she turns her head toward you like that. No. Okay, so it looks. It's this she just keeps her eyes down

357
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.360
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it's like I'm not even there.

358
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.730
Alicia Noedel: It's like I didn't never even said anything.

359
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then later on, she'll say what

360
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Got it.

361
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.840
Alicia Noedel: And then you get mad at me for

362
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:22.890
Alicia Noedel: getting upset.

363
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

364
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

Alicia Noedel: Tired.

368
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be enough.

369
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:55.680
Alicia Noedel: Me asking me for asking me to do something I asking me to do something. And if I don't like to jump up and do it that very second I'm I'm ignoring her and I don't want to help.

370
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You. But what does she say

371
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:15.030
Alicia Noedel: Never mind. I'll just do it, or she'll just start doing it like she asked me, you know, to clean the bathroom and so I'll be like, Okay, let me just finish you know i'll be literally like doing something that's, you know, important like let me just finish doing this.

372
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:23.160
Alicia Noedel: And, you know, if it's not being started within you know two minutes of her asking me

373
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.020
Alicia Noedel: You know,

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get it.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got it.

377
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:51.000
Alicia Noedel: I guess. And it's like, I wish that if she wanted it done, you know, right, then in there to tell me because I would you know I wouldn't think that I have all day to do it because it's not like I'm doing anything. You know, like be having to leave the house or anything.

Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to put feel but feel. I mean by body is not not emotion. Feel the first word sequence of events for you to memorize is feel, but you want to put felt sense, which means whatever it is for you to remember that it's how the body's doing so for me it's felt sense

390
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That comes out of this medic somatic transformation work. So there's adult sense there's

391
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Just heard my mother's voice so your as soon as you hear your mother's voice My guess is your body's going to have a response to it.

392
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm guessing there's so much history back there, that it's going to have some either tension is going to happen. Something is going to happen as soon as you hear her voice.

393
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:51.300
Alicia Noedel: It's the tone. Yeah, the way it depends how she comes to me.

394
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

395
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.900
Alicia Noedel: So the way she says, My name, whether I know

396
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.420
Alicia Noedel: It's a good thing or bad thing.

397
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear that. Let me hear your name on that tone. Let me just hear how it sounds. So I can do it.

398
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.240
Alicia Noedel: In the negative way.

399
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:03.900
Yeah.

400
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:13.050
Alicia Noedel: So usually, she would just be an alley or baby. But if it was negative, she would

401
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.240
Alicia Noedel: Call me Alice

402
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it like she says it

403
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice

404
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.030
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

405
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:28.590
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

406
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:30.600
Like desperation.

407
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that close.

408
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's loud. It's a really high. It's pretty high, high in pitch to whereas Allie, it's lower yeah it's lower in volume and it's it's slower and it's it's not as high screechy it doesn't have a screech to it.

409
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

410
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:57.060
Alicia Noedel: Got it would be followed by stomping rather than just coming towards me would be

411
00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.880
Alicia Noedel: Hard. Hard something. Yeah.

412
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's you've got written down, you've got feel that's the body and then you have breeze write that down.

413
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you have mirror

414
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:23.820
Okay.

415
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll do this word validate, but what you already know, let's do what you already know. Let's do the

416
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The intent because you like that. Let's do

417
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the word with write this down. I imagine

418
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's the memorize thing. I imagine we both want the same thing here. I imagine that we both want to feel good. I imagine we both have really good intent.

419
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I know we want the best for I imagine we want the best for it's that phrase, I imagine.

420
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And then short and sweet. So the first one, you're probably not going to even be able to say a word. You ready for that.

421
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's right on time, because this might feel overwhelming, but that doesn't mean you didn't do it right. It means you did it right, because first time we do a role play it's you're just going to be freaked out.

422
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. And then we start again and we'll review, we'll do it again, it's okay that you don't remember anything when you get flooded with those feelings. So I'm just letting you know there's no way for you to do this wrong.

423
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:40.770
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

424
00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no way

425
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.420
Alicia Noedel: So I'm just supposed to respond in a healthy way here.

426
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to look down on paper, you're going to cheat your way through the first one, you're gonna cheat cheat cheat with a cheat sheet going to have it right in front of you and you don't even have to look at me. Okay.

427
00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body.

428
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all you have to do on the first one, then you're going to inhale through the nose, big belly breath.

429
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to breathe this beautiful nourishing breath into your body and then your brain will work.

430
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll mirror and I don't think I taught you mirroring and but it's basically say the words back like a mirror, mirror doesn't interpret doesn't defend it says, oh,

431
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a female with granting strings glasses and a white shirt. It doesn't say you're a brunette with lush thick hair big puffy lips, you know and and you know you're you're six feet tall. It doesn't it mirrors what is

432
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a very specific thing, but just for now. That's basically what it is. So it would be something like

433
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So, mom, what you're saying is you're finding me worthless and

434
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm always fucking around

435
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I literally say back verbally what they said to me, but I do it in a nice tone.

436
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not most my allies. This just go with me here. Okay.

437
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

438
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what this person is going to say, we'll see.

439
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we say, well, I imagine our intent is both good here. I know we both want to clean house. I know we both kind of want to have disharmony in this home. We've talked about it this weekend.

440
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's validation. I know our intent is good.

441
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is loving and I know we both one sort of the same thing. So I imagine we want the same things. So I'm throwing a lot at you at least if we only get one piece of this, that's fine. Okay, we'll keep working on

442
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So the first part is I'm going to, I'm going to start, I'm going to walk off screen. I'm going to come on and you're going to be looking at your piece of paper, you can cheat. Okay.

443
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You can draw a little picture of a body.

444
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it feeling soon as you hear my voice. Okay.

445
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice

446
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you clean that bathroom.

447
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how are we doing

448
00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:31.200
Oh,

449
00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:37.950
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it's spot on ahead, um,

450
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.070
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, a kind of froze up

451
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. How far did you get, did you notice the body at all, or as soon as you heard my froze.

452
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.590
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, no, I, I noticed. Yeah.

453
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:50.520
Alicia Noedel: I get

454
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.080
Alicia Noedel: Really tense on

455
00:50:53.790 --> 00:51:03.630
Alicia Noedel: On my stomach ache. My stomach starts to get really nervous. I feel my shoulders. They kind of like in the back like tense up and do the thing where I call my toes.

456
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Toes toes.

457
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.300
Oh, yeah.

458
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So, go, go. Which one is got the loudest message to you to stomach shoulder with the loudest message to your stomach. Yeah, absolutely. That's our intuition. That's our gut response. That's where we we have a sense of I belong. This is a pretty important messenger

459
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So go there and breathe into it.

460
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And reassure that tummy.

461
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're not in physical danger.

462
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body is responding to perceived threat.

463
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Will not be in perceived threat once you relax the muscles.

464
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You can feel safe.

465
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body can relax the muscles.

466
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a perception of threat. It's all this can be

467
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no actual danger of life and limb.

468
00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.540
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

469
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're going to remember that piece of paper. So we've got maybe draw an image of a body. Maybe the tummy. Draw the tummy because I drew one

470
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I put a little circle shoulders and the tummy and I put toes.

471
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're, you're going to need to remember to check into your gut. So when you as soon as you hear my voice. I'm going to check in your see how you're feeling. So remember to breathe into it and to say to self and then maybe we'll do some will add self talk self talk

472
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

473
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

474
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: With that do it for you. With that, that thought work to bring you to center.

475
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

476
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to add that one. So after breathe, you'll go to self talk. I'm okay.

477
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what's that supposed to do is is meaning I'm in

478
00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: an overreaction to perceived threat and I look around, right, I mean, there's more steps to this, I guess there's lots of pieces. You're not actually in danger. You already told me she's not going to throw something in the bathroom and she's not going to slap you punch you kick you.

479
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but we've got to remind the body about that. We've got to remind it that we're not in danger. So, okay, means I'm not in danger, my body's just responding to an old

480
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Awaited perceived threat.

481
00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get that far. And then would be great. I don't know that. We'll get to it, it would be. You want me to clean the bathroom right, Mom.

482
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I don't think we're going to get that for everyone to see what happens. Look at your cheat sheet. Look at you'll have to look at me just cheat cheat cheat.

483
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice

484
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you clean the bathroom.

485
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:23.640
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

486
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:25.050
Oh,

487
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Nevermind. I'm already doing it.

488
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How'd you do

489
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.630
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I almost got to, you know, explain explanation, you know,

490
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was coming on.

491
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.800
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I got like

492
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.010
Alicia Noedel: You know, it's like, yeah.

493
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Wait, so

494
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If I hadn't started slamming things in the bathroom.

495
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you remember how did you feel your tummy.

496
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.560
Alicia Noedel: It went back into like the

497
00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:16.590
Alicia Noedel: To the scared mode again. Yeah. So I went from like feeling myself to to, like, oh shit, you know,

498
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So yours might be, maybe you won't move out of breathing for a while, you might stay there for like 10 cycles.

499
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You might have to get safe. It might take long longer than one breath. It might take 20 I don't care how long it takes. I need you to feel safe before you go back out out out there before you say a word. She can clunk around who cares. Let her clean the bathroom.

500
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the bathroom, who cares.

501
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

502
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.690
Alicia Noedel: I need you and approachability

503
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

504
00:55:50.910 --> 00:56:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I need you to feel safe. I don't care how many dishes are uncleaned and bathrooms are clean. I need you to feel safe with you and in your environment. And if it takes sitting there for 10 minutes breathing, then fine.

505
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to go anywhere until you are okay that you have a sense of, I'm safe that nothing else can happen until you have a sense of safety.

506
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:15.210
Right.

507
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Soon as you hear that screeching voice. If it isn't alley maybe

508
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If it isn't, that if it's up there, you get in your body get it in it and breathe.

509
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: She comes in and says, well, weirdo thing are you doing you say just breathing.

510
00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the truth.

511
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you persevere.

512
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just keep breathing. Okay, nothing else can happen until you're safe.

513
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:54.000
Right.

514
00:56:57.270 --> 00:57:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I think right where we are. This is some pretty good stuff. Let's have transcribed the following three things to work on next time. Number one,

515
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to role play, quote, unquote. You're worthless. You always want to fuck around. Number two, mother, standing with eyes fixed on phone while being approached by daughter.

516
00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And followed up by passive aggressive behavior, including statement of gets. Why are you getting so upset over this. And number three, a statement of request to do something, but not immediately getting up and doing it which is responded by passive aggressive hostile

517
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: task completion. We have some self regulation steps.

518
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Which are

519
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We have focus on body as felt sense, followed by Daya for matic breathing several of them until safety is felt, and then we have

520
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.500
Alicia Noedel: One two stars there.

521
00:57:56.190 --> 00:58:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, and self talk of I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

522
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

523
00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay okay in your head over and over and over.

524
00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then we have mirroring which we, I can teach that that sometimes take I throw it at you, but it can take as many as two or three sessions so

525
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I just throw it out there. See if it, if it was a thing that you already kind of knew so no worries. I'll go into that in more depth and then followed by

526
00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The validation, so we can get into felt sense breathing self talk mirror validation, we can get into that later but for now, the concept is nothing else can happen until I feel okay

Gwenevere Abriel: And the worst thing that anyone can say is what weirdo thing are you doing right now. Right. I'm just say you're breathing. I'm getting centered

528
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:57.240
