00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.460
Dominique Pozo: Throughout the whole and

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.710
Nathaniel Sims: I didn't have your

3
00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
Nathaniel Sims: I guess I don't know. Do I call the virtual clinic every time.

4
00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:11.910
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah did

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.530
Dominique Pozo: Was that not clear to you.

6
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.100
Nathaniel Sims: Know I had, I had, I had

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.840
Nathaniel Sims: These other numbers written down, and I get a yes. None of them work so

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.520
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.770
Nathaniel Sims: I call them the

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.930
Nathaniel Sims: The 408 number before before every meeting.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.640
Dominique Pozo: What I'm not sure what the actual numbers for the virtual clinic is that the 408 number

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.550
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I think that's the main number. Okay.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:57.030
Dominique Pozo: So yeah, so yeah, so before every group or before any individual session that we have, you need to call that for a number and and then they'll give you a link to what the zoom room that we're in.

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.070
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.450
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, great.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:16.590
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, no problem. So we're going to do a bio Sykes social today, which is it's kind of like a lot of them just historical questions about what's you know what your history has been up until this point that you're now in the program.

17
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.820
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I'm going to be

18
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.590
Dominique Pozo: Typing a bunch and

19
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.250
Dominique Pozo: Just so you know, I am with you and listening just actually recording everything that you say on to the note.

20
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.510
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, so

21
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.550
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm just pulling up your file here. I was about to actually log off. I didn't think you were going to make it because it's already where

22
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.680
Nathaniel Sims: I knew that I

23
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.600
Nathaniel Sims: Might not because of work that I got out early and everything and I just didn't know what to what to do so. Okay.

24
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.430
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I'm glad I got the number, but I got it figured out. Yeah, me too. Okay.

25
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.510
So,

26
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.030
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so the first

27
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.550
Dominique Pozo: The first part of the intake is just getting some basic information like can you tell me what

28
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:26.070
Dominique Pozo: Um, what what it's been quite reusing what what brought you to the program. Did you hit a super point that brought you here, just kind of

29
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.040
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I was using heroin.

30
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.330
Nathaniel Sims: And

31
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.990
Nathaniel Sims: You know, alcohol, little bit of alcohol. Little bit of lead.

32
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.080
Nathaniel Sims: But mostly howling

33
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.880
Nathaniel Sims: And

34
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.520
Nathaniel Sims: I've tried

35
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.970
Nathaniel Sims: Multiple times to quit. I guess that

36
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.050
Nathaniel Sims: The longest I've probably been accident from it since.

37
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.690
Nathaniel Sims: Will say the year 2000 was probably about a year.

38
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.140
Nathaniel Sims: Like maybe 10 months or something like that. Okay.

39
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.800
Nathaniel Sims: And and then often on periodically for the last 20 years. Okay.

40
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.300
Dominique Pozo: And how did this speak in what, how did your

41
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.120
You said

42
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.160
Nathaniel Sims: I had a friend. Well, I guess it started with pills pain pills.

43
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.840
Nathaniel Sims: And then I had a friend who who said he can get opium. He called it opium, but I know now with black tar heroin.

44
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.180
Nathaniel Sims: And he said it's cheaper and it's stronger.

45
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.660
Nathaniel Sims: And

46
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.060
Nathaniel Sims: He said that it wasn't going to be addictive because it was opium. You know that

47
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.280
Dominique Pozo: Oh, gosh.

48
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.980
Nathaniel Sims: So, yeah.

49
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.150
Dominique Pozo: So,

50
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.350
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

51
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.520
And

52
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.890
Dominique Pozo: So you said the longest

53
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.400
Dominique Pozo: You you

54
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.800
Dominique Pozo: You

55
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.350
Dominique Pozo: didn't use for a year. Were you in a treatment program. Can you hear me.

56
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.280
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, you're kind of breaking up. Oh.

57
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.450
Dominique Pozo: Can you hear me now.

58
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:08.190
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay. So I'm wondering when you had that one year where you weren't using anything. Were you in a in a treatment program or how did you how to do that.

59
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.480
Nathaniel Sims: No, I

60
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.980
Nathaniel Sims: I I told my parents about my problem. And they offer to buy me a plane ticket to Oregon, a one way plane ticket.

61
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.580
Nathaniel Sims: Where my, my older sister lived

62
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.810
Nathaniel Sims: And so I I decided

63
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.410
Nathaniel Sims: To just cold turkey and I flew out there.

64
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.020
Nathaniel Sims: And

65
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:43.470
Nathaniel Sims: I guess I was probably clean for about three months and then i and then I was able to find it in Portland.

66
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.570
Nathaniel Sims: And

67
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.810
Nathaniel Sims: I used for about

68
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.480
Nathaniel Sims: Nine months.

69
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.770
Nathaniel Sims: Out there out in Oregon and then

70
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.350
Nathaniel Sims: I didn't like Oregon anymore. I was doing construction at the time, and it when it rains a lot Morgan and

71
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.370
Nathaniel Sims: They don't stop construction companies don't stop when it rains out there, otherwise they wouldn't be money.

72
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.620
Nathaniel Sims: So I decided I didn't want to be out there anymore and I

73
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.970
Nathaniel Sims: I bought a little truck for like 400 bucks and I loaded up all my stuff and

74
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.920
Nathaniel Sims: I was planning on driving back to Albuquerque. But I ended up

75
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.800
Nathaniel Sims: I ended up losing my wallet somewhere in California Stockton, California. I think

76
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.660
Nathaniel Sims: It's like $4,000 in it and

77
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:49.680
Nathaniel Sims: I had, I had broken $100 Bill and I had put the change in my front pocket. So I had about 60 bucks left and I

78
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.490
Nathaniel Sims: I was able to get enough gas to make it to Flagstaff

79
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:06.960
Nathaniel Sims: And I, I ran out of gas in Flagstaff, and I had a friend who lived in Albuquerque. He was kind of a mentor to me, he

80
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.410
Nathaniel Sims: He owned a mechanical shop here in Albuquerque, and he he

81
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:26.490
Nathaniel Sims: taught me how to work on cars and stuff. Well, he moved to Flagstaff, about six months prior to me running out of gas there so I ended up tracking him down and

82
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.650
Nathaniel Sims: It was it happened to be Thanksgiving Day.

83
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.060
Dominique Pozo: And

84
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.970
Nathaniel Sims: So he invited me over for for dinner.

85
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.390
Nathaniel Sims: And then he he knows my my situation with drugs.

86
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.960
Nathaniel Sims: And he said,

87
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.300
Nathaniel Sims: You don't want to go. You don't want to go back to Albuquerque that place. It's not a good place.

88
00:07:52.950 --> 00:08:00.720
Nathaniel Sims: Though he offered room and I ended up staying there with him.

89
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.290
Nathaniel Sims: And him and his wife.

90
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.380
Nathaniel Sims: Were kind of keeping an eye on me.

91
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.750
Nathaniel Sims: And that's when I

92
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.620
Nathaniel Sims: You know, got about a year of cleanliness and without using anything. Okay.

93
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.660
Dominique Pozo: So you were with. Okay, so you had. So you're with them in Flagstaff, and that was

94
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.020
Dominique Pozo: That was the year, the year of sobriety.

95
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.260
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, and he he would drug test me

96
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.460
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

97
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.650
Nathaniel Sims: And if I ever came up dirty, he, he said he would kick me out of the house.

98
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.640
Nathaniel Sims: And I ended up getting a job that day.

99
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.610
Nathaniel Sims: Doing construction.

100
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.500
Nathaniel Sims: And

101
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:55.020
Nathaniel Sims: The same day, I ran out of gas. I, I met a guy at at the Thanksgiving dinner, who owned a construction company and he offered me a job. I started that Monday.

102
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.550
Nathaniel Sims: I kind of landed on my feet pretty good there and

103
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.470
Nathaniel Sims: And then just to get myself clean and busy.

104
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.020
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, about a year, you know, and then and then

105
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.400
Nathaniel Sims: I think it started off with pills again.

106
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.050
Nathaniel Sims: pain pills and like it kind of just

107
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.760
Nathaniel Sims: went from that to

108
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.630
Nathaniel Sims: in Flagstaff stuffs, not a big town so it's

109
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.130
Nathaniel Sims: It's harder to find stuff there, but

110
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.690
Nathaniel Sims: I mean I eventually found it again.

111
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.210
Dominique Pozo: Okay and. And why do you think you started using again if you were kind of back

112
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.140
Dominique Pozo: On your feet. What, what was maybe the deeper layer of what moved you to start using again.

113
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.310
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know. I guess I just

114
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.430
Nathaniel Sims: wasn't done with it. I mean, I

115
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.840
Nathaniel Sims: Don't know i i started like I said with the pills.

116
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.770
Nathaniel Sims: And I was able to kind of maintain

117
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.930
Nathaniel Sims: I don't, I don't know, I just bored. I don't know. Boredom or

118
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.430
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know. Okay.

119
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:31.980
Well,

120
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.030
Dominique Pozo: Did you ever

121
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.530
Nathaniel Sims: Hear breaking up again.

122
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.980
Dominique Pozo: After that, oh, shoot. How about now. Can you hear me now.

123
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:58.560
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay. Just wondering, did you ever enter a program like some sort of intensive outpatient program or treatment facility.

124
00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.610
Dominique Pozo: After that,

125
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.890
Nathaniel Sims: No, I, I went to na meetings, but

126
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.350
Nathaniel Sims: No, I didn't.

127
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.460
Nathaniel Sims: I, I actually found

128
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.850
Nathaniel Sims: Suboxone on the street.

129
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.570
Nathaniel Sims: And I use that to

130
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.410
Nathaniel Sims: I use it to quit several times. Like for

131
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.870
Nathaniel Sims: Like short spurts like

132
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.230
Nathaniel Sims: Couple months here and a couple months there.

133
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.330
Nathaniel Sims: And then I

134
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:39.420
Nathaniel Sims: When, when I would run out of or when I couldn't find it on the street, then I go back to

135
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:41.730
Nathaniel Sims: using heroin.

136
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:53.880
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and then during that this up until most recently, have you had any times when you were suicidal.

137
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.230
Yeah.

138
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:56.700
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

139
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.000
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

140
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.730
Dominique Pozo: And then what led to

141
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.070
Dominique Pozo: You come into the program with a separate heart health. What, what happened that caused you to make this move.

142
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.270
Um,

143
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.650
Nathaniel Sims: Why I had it.

144
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.900
Nathaniel Sims: I had

145
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.720
Nathaniel Sims: met a girl who

146
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.630
Nathaniel Sims: Had done a Suboxone program not not with you guys, but she had done one

147
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.640
Nathaniel Sims: And she had given me the number to her doctor

148
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.840
Nathaniel Sims: And every time I call they'd say there was like a three month waiting period.

149
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:06.960
Nathaniel Sims: And so I would wait, you know, for three months. But that by by then I was back you know

150
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.200
Nathaniel Sims: Doing what I was doing and

151
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.670
Nathaniel Sims: So I could never make it to that.

152
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:23.070
Nathaniel Sims: initial visit with the doctor and in her program in the program sheets are good.

153
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.230
Nathaniel Sims: And so I

154
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.810
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know, I just, I guess I just started Googling it one day in

155
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.680
Nathaniel Sims: Your, your number pop jumped in.

156
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.290
Nathaniel Sims: And what

157
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.060
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

158
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.000
Nathaniel Sims: All right, we'll see you later.

159
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.510
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. So, okay.

160
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:57.090
Dominique Pozo: And one more thing when when you've been at your worst. What has that looked like for you.

161
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.120
Nathaniel Sims: Know I'm a highly functioning addict.

162
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.180
Nathaniel Sims: I guess it's like

163
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.020
Nathaniel Sims: I guess my worst has been like

164
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.920
Nathaniel Sims: Well you know when when I first started using

165
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.800
Nathaniel Sims: I, I remember I was homeless for like a year.

166
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.900
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, that was probably the worst but okay.

167
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.680
Nathaniel Sims: But that was a long time ago. Mm hmm.

168
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.360
Nathaniel Sims: I, I don't like

169
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:51.570
Nathaniel Sims: When I run out of money and as the ability to get anything is when I

170
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:53.760
Nathaniel Sims: When I would

171
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.230
Nathaniel Sims: Really stress out and start

172
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.870
Nathaniel Sims: You know, thinking that I need to change things, you know,

173
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.840
Nathaniel Sims: But i don't know i i just i learned China ration and

174
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.470
Nathaniel Sims: Doing, doing enough to get by, but not overdoing it.

175
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:56.700
Dominique Pozo: So, so aside from being homeless for that we are when you first started using it doesn't sound like you lost like jobs or your home. I imagine you probably lost some significant connections to people in your life.

176
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.230
Nathaniel Sims: Like, you're good.

177
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.930
Nathaniel Sims: I'm lost to fiance's and

178
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.880
Dominique Pozo: I

179
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.670
Nathaniel Sims: I've lost jobs. Yeah, sure. Okay.

180
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:19.050
Dominique Pozo: So, so that's not really that I mean maybe highly functioning at times. Yet, if you're losing jobs and people that are very special to you, that seems like something's not functioning.

181
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:26.490
Nathaniel Sims: Right. Right. Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah. No, no, I'm I guess I'm highly functioning in the way that I

182
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.460
Nathaniel Sims: Have done it for 20 years and

183
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:40.290
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, I have, I have three degrees. I have bought us i i have I own I own like eight cars I

184
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.060
Nathaniel Sims: Mean

185
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.380
Okay.

186
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.140
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

187
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.680
Dominique Pozo: And have you ever been diagnosed with any sort of

188
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.530
Dominique Pozo: Like mood disorder or any any diagnosis at all.

189
00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:01.320
Nathaniel Sims: You know, I have, I have never really been to a doctor. Okay.

190
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.960
Dominique Pozo: Is this your first time doing therapy.

191
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.110
Nathaniel Sims: I'm

192
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.260
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I mean,

193
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.700
Nathaniel Sims: There was a time when my parents.

194
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:21.240
Nathaniel Sims: They made me live with a with a pastor a minister for a while.

195
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:21.960
Uh huh.

196
00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.800
Nathaniel Sims: Like, I don't know what was probably like a month or two.

197
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.620
Nathaniel Sims: And I think it was kind of therapeutic. OK.

198
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.770
Dominique Pozo: OK.

199
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:48.090
Dominique Pozo: OK, and then okay now I'm gonna move to some family history. So can you tell me a little bit about

200
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500
Dominique Pozo: What it was like growing up and how many siblings, you had

201
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.110
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I have.

202
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.480
Nathaniel Sims: I have three three sisters and a

203
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:01.950
Nathaniel Sims: Brother.

204
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.300
Nathaniel Sims: I have a twin sister. I have two older sisters and my brother is younger than I

205
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.840
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so you're kind of somewhat in the middle.

206
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.620
Yeah.

207
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.170
Nathaniel Sims: And

208
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.140
Nathaniel Sims: I grew up on an Indian Reservation in Arizona.

209
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.940
Okay.

210
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.420
Nathaniel Sims: And

211
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:37.290
Nathaniel Sims: I went to a Christian parochial schools from kindergarten to eighth grade.

212
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.690
Nathaniel Sims: I

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.740
Nathaniel Sims: graduated high school

214
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.710
Nathaniel Sims: And college

215
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:51.960
Okay.

216
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.860
Nathaniel Sims: My parents are still together.

217
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.470
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

218
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:12.540
Dominique Pozo: And can you tell me a little bit about your mom. And if there's any history of substance use on her linear journey.

219
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:13.140
Mental

220
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.830
Nathaniel Sims: She I think she's bipolar. But she's like she's never been to adoption.

221
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.010
Nathaniel Sims: But I mean, for specifically those kinds of reasons, but

222
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.200
Nathaniel Sims: She

223
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.040
Nathaniel Sims: Her her brothers, I guess we're like,

224
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.820
Nathaniel Sims: cartel members and Mexico.

225
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.230
Nathaniel Sims: And they were in fact our one of our brothers died of an overdose.

226
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:56.670
Nathaniel Sims: Back in like 2007 Oh gosh. And I guess he was using heroin. I didn't know at the time, but

227
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.890
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, and and then her other brother.

228
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.380
Nathaniel Sims: Who was also part of

229
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.920
Nathaniel Sims: Drug running and

230
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.870
Nathaniel Sims: He, he died because of her

231
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.880
Nathaniel Sims: Now, malnutrition, I guess.

232
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.700
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I don't really know the whole story. Okay. Okay. But I do know that they

233
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.310
Nathaniel Sims: They were definitely part of

234
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.730
Nathaniel Sims: You know, back in the 70s and 80s part of

235
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.470
Nathaniel Sims: Drugs and Drug running. Okay.

236
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.010
All right.

237
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.440
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And how is your relationship with her with your mom.

238
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.830
Nathaniel Sims: You know it hasn't been great.

239
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.630
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, she

240
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.120
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I don't

241
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.350
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know. She

242
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.750
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

243
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.420
Dominique Pozo: What it seems like you're on the edge of saying something about her and

244
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.680
I'm just wondering

245
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.260
Dominique Pozo: What's coming up right now.

246
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:52.230
Dominique Pozo: Were you were you close to her at some point, and I could be completely miss perceiving. I'm just wondering if

247
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:54.990
Dominique Pozo: If you're

248
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.380
Dominique Pozo: If you're experiencing grief around the loss of the connection with her what's coming up.

249
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.220
Nathaniel Sims: This. The first time I remember

250
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.720
Nathaniel Sims: being hugged by her was when I got on the plane to go to Oregon.

251
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.320
Dominique Pozo: That's the first time that you ever remember being hugged by her

252
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.310
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Wow. Wow. How old are you,

253
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.410
Nathaniel Sims: 21

254
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.870
Dominique Pozo: So there wasn't much

255
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.350
Dominique Pozo: Much touch her affection or closeness that sounds like

256
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:44.850
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

257
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.690
Nathaniel Sims: I think that's why I gravitated towards her.

258
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.770
Dominique Pozo: And I would I would really agree i i recall one of my

259
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:07.860
Dominique Pozo: One of my most significant mentors told me once that when folks get, you know, drawn into and hooked on heroin.

260
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.810
Dominique Pozo: You know, like the great mother embracing there's a certain

261
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.260
Dominique Pozo: Weren't weren't that

262
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.020
Dominique Pozo: That comes with that and I really

263
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:31.560
Dominique Pozo: When you just said that it it kind of some of it makes some sense to me that you know maybe this substance offered you something that sounds like it was a huge missing piece for you this affection.

264
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:35.400
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

265
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:45.690
Dominique Pozo: How have you and have you have you been able to find this in other ways in your life and have you been able to cultivate some

266
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:57.330
Dominique Pozo: I mean, this is a huge. This is a huge piece, not having that from mother is a piece that probably never goes away, but being able to start to create that for yourself in a way that's not self destructive.

267
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.670
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know.

268
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:12.420
Dominique Pozo: Have you had. Have you had counseling with your mom or, no, no. It sounds like you've never been to a counselor, have y'all ever talked about these things.

269
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.710
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, oh yeah.

270
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.690
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Uh huh. And how is. How has she has she been responsive.

271
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.400
Nathaniel Sims: Sort of, I mean she

272
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.080
Nathaniel Sims: She a few couple years ago, she had her own

273
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:38.760
Nathaniel Sims: bout of depression and I get it, it got really bad. And I remember she came over.

274
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.360
Nathaniel Sims: And she she apologized.

275
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.910
Nathaniel Sims: For not being a good mother.

276
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:47.700
Nathaniel Sims: And

277
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.250
Nathaniel Sims: She said that

278
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.060
Nathaniel Sims: She felt like she needed to do that because

279
00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.620
Nathaniel Sims: That was going to help her get over depression.

280
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.660
Dominique Pozo: To apologize to you.

281
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.560
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I mean I think she went around all of us kids.

282
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.640
Nathaniel Sims: Had a had her little

283
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.650
Nathaniel Sims: Statement.

284
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:11.910
Mm hmm.

285
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:26.250
Dominique Pozo: I'm curious if that it sounds like from what you're telling me it was more for her, not so much for you. Do you feel like she's met you in a way that you've really needed for you, not just for her.

286
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:27.720
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

287
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.970
Nathaniel Sims: I don't think so, but

288
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:32.760
Nathaniel Sims: I mean,

289
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.930
Nathaniel Sims: I know she cares enough to want me to

290
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.810
Nathaniel Sims: To have a life without drugs in it. I mean,

291
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.270
Nathaniel Sims: She's willing to

292
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.650
Nathaniel Sims: She's loving God help me and

293
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.020
Nathaniel Sims: But I don't feel any kind of real closeness with her.

294
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.140
Okay.

295
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.730
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, she's she has treated all of our

296
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.900
Nathaniel Sims: All of us like shit and like my dad who

297
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.710
I mean,

298
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.260
Nathaniel Sims: Their, their relationship is like non existent. I think

299
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:28.740
Dominique Pozo: Have any of your other siblings have they dealt with addiction issues.

300
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.690
Nathaniel Sims: My oldest sister.

301
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.400
Nathaniel Sims: Use

302
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:36.960
That

303
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.260
Nathaniel Sims: To the point that

304
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.120
Okay.

305
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.880
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, my, my

306
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.150
Nathaniel Sims: My other sisters are like

307
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.120
Nathaniel Sims: Straight narrow

308
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:01.500
Nathaniel Sims: Like

309
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.690
Nathaniel Sims: One of them's a missionary and

310
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.530
Nathaniel Sims: And my twin sister.

311
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.980
Nathaniel Sims: Is never really done anything like what I've done.

312
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.200
Okay.

313
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:25.050
Nathaniel Sims: So,

314
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:40.740
Dominique Pozo: Let's just take a moment before we continue on and I have a feeling that let's I'm going to, I'm going to break this bio psychosocial up into two sessions. Just because we've only kind of gotten not even through half and I don't want to rush through anything or skip over

315
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:49.560
Dominique Pozo: What's coming up for you. So go ahead and if you could just take a moment and rub your hands together and create some warm for there.

316
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.160
Dominique Pozo: And wherever feels

317
00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:07.560
Dominique Pozo: Like soothing and nourishing to place your hands. You know, maybe it's your cheeks. Maybe it's your chest or maybe it's like wrapping your arms, your hands around your shoulders and kind of

318
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:15.750
Dominique Pozo: Giving yourself a, an, yeah. Great. Okay, and just take a few deep breaths. They're just recognizing that you're

319
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:30.870
Dominique Pozo: You're here showing up for yourself in your recovery. And at this point, you know, unfortunately, you're an adult. Your parents already went through their parenting stage and they may or may not come around. But at this point it's

320
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:40.350
Dominique Pozo: You showing up for you in the way that maybe you needed. And if you can just take a moment and feel the care that you're giving yourself.

321
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.180
Dominique Pozo: And it definitely doesn't replace what was needed at another time.

322
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:48.660
Yet

323
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.300
Nathaniel Sims: You know,

324
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:57.870
Dominique Pozo: Hopefully we can keep working on ways that you can tend to that part that does tender.

325
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:21.600
Dominique Pozo: In your own time. When you're ready, what if you're you're hands that are here, you know,

326
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.640
Nathaniel Sims: I can contact with

327
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.730
Dominique Pozo: You if they could say something. If your hands could speak as you know as they're tending to you, what would they say

328
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:12.570
Dominique Pozo: About the you that has brought yourself to this program, what would that part of you say to the part that's been using for so long.

329
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.640
Nathaniel Sims: I guess, don't give up and

330
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.370
Nathaniel Sims: Put, put 110% into

331
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.350

Nathaniel Sims: Try to accomplish it.

334
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.310
Dominique Pozo: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Good.

335
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.600
Nathaniel Sims: I've been

336
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.980
Nathaniel Sims: I've gotten so many things accomplished, you know,

337
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.790
Nathaniel Sims: Even with this monkey on my back.

338
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:09.750
Dominique Pozo: It sounds like it sounds like you're very capable and I'm hearing your, your motivation and I'm I am wondering too and I want to know what

339
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:19.110
Dominique Pozo: Why do you want to do this at this time, you know, if you have been relatively functioning. What, what is the motivation at this time to

340
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.340
Nathaniel Sims: To stay clean I'm I just, I don't, I'm not happy.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:31.980
Nathaniel Sims: It's not

343
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.590
Nathaniel Sims: It's not doing it for me.

344
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.930
Nathaniel Sims: I just hate the daily grind of being a drug addict.

345
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.250
Nathaniel Sims: It's so consuming

346
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.200
Nathaniel Sims: That you don't have much time for anything else.

347
00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:01.800
Nathaniel Sims: And if you if you want time for something else. You have to really work at it. Yeah.

348
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.000
Nathaniel Sims: I'm just tired. Yeah.

Nathaniel Sims: I don't get any satisfaction or anything.

354
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.400
Nathaniel Sims: Things they used to be satisfied or just

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.410
Nathaniel Sims: Every day.

356
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.180
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think it's going to take time and as if, as some of the other

357
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.350
Dominique Pozo: Group members have named it has taken them time to

358
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.790

Dominique Pozo: We still have a little bit of time left in the session. So I'm, I'm thinking, let's

367
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.700
Dominique Pozo: Keep moving with the

368
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:44.430

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:05.040
Nathaniel Sims: So he never almost never got frustrated or

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.290
Nathaniel Sims: Upset

376
00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.560
Nathaniel Sims: And he always

377
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.150
Nathaniel Sims: He always

378
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:24.270
Nathaniel Sims: Tried to kick us and let us experience different things like we we go camping all the time.

379
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.850
Nathaniel Sims: Fishing and

380
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.130

383
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:06.540
Nathaniel Sims: Was willing to to let me try it. Even though even sometimes I would only be interested. It's like a couple weeks ago it

384
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.810
Nathaniel Sims: Was money on all this equipment.

385
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.100
Nathaniel Sims: But he didn't have a problem with it.

386
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.030
Huh.

387
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.610

Dominique Pozo: What is your relationship like with him. No.

390
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.860
Nathaniel Sims: It's, it's pretty good. I mean, the thing that I don't

391
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.190
Nathaniel Sims: And I guess.

392
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.600
Nathaniel Sims: You know he he is her husband, but

393
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.260
Nathaniel Sims: He will. He will

394
00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:59.970
Nathaniel Sims: He will take my side.

395
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.050
Nathaniel Sims: Even though he knows it's wrong.

396
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.580
Dominique Pozo: And how has that played out between the dynamic with you and then

397
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:27.240
Nathaniel Sims: Just I mean there's there's been times where I haven't talked to them in years.

398
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.570
Nathaniel Sims: And not because I don't want to, but

399
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:46.020
Nathaniel Sims: Because he rather except that

400
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.320
Nathaniel Sims: My body is

401
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.520
Nathaniel Sims: Right, or

402
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.290
Nathaniel Sims: Is the right for whatever she's doing

403
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.770
Dominique Pozo: Sounds like he's very devoted to your mother.

404
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.610
Yeah.

405
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.550
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I don't think he has a choice.

406
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:12.660
Dominique Pozo: What does that mean,

407
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.230
Nathaniel Sims: Because she's she is very

408
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.590
Nathaniel Sims: Upbeat she she has been the, the head of the household.

409
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.210
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, she is the world calling the shots.

410
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.520
Nathaniel Sims: He

411
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:53.790
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm gonna, we're about halfway done there with the intake. So I'm going to stop there. And then we have a couple minutes left.

412
00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:02.970
Dominique Pozo: So I, I recommend weekly sessions to start with. What's your availability and

413
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:14.850
Dominique Pozo: What are you, what are your thoughts. That's just my recommendation and you know as you progress in the program, then we can kind of, you know,

414
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.150
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, the later in the evening, the better. So me

415
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.370
Nathaniel Sims: I work like

416
00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:29.940
Nathaniel Sims: Anywhere from seven to six. So, but, I mean, I can, I can make time

417
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:35.670
Nathaniel Sims: But sometimes I'm about the field and I don't get home, till

418
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:41.040
Nathaniel Sims: Because New Mexico goes from here, but new access to the big state.

419
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:52.350
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I know I that's and that's fine because I'm in Hawaii and our time difference, it works out just fine. I'm four hours ahead of you all.

420
00:39:53.370 --> 00:40:00.480
Dominique Pozo: The earlier than you also what what time in the evening is best for you that you know you can make it because

421
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:11.730
Dominique Pozo: I don't want to be scheduling things with you, potentially, making it potentially not that's that interferes with my schedule, too. So if you know a time that you actually can make it. What do you think that would be

422
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.430
Nathaniel Sims: I would say probably around 630

423
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:17.730
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I mean we can even do seven o'clock. If

424
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:23.460
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. So, and we remind me. Is your group day on Tuesday or Wednesday.
