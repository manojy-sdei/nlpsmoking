Brian Kern: Going on, you know, like I haven't, I haven't left the house. I mean we we actually went to the park earlier.

3
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.530
Brian Kern: That was the first time I'd like

4
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.340
Brian Kern: left the house.

5
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.460
Brian Kern: For a reason other than going to the store.

6
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.950
Brian Kern: Or like to pick up my meds, you know,

7
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.480
Was kind of cool.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.210
Brian Kern: Like nothing really going on too much. Yeah.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: for you this week.

11
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.370
Brian Kern: Oh,

12
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.500
Brian Kern: No, really, I looked, I looked at the list and stuff, but I didn't really have any thoughts like that this week and all

13
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.930
Brian Kern: That Oh good. Yeah.

14
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, you have access to them whenever those thoughts visit you can access them, you already

15
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know how to access

16
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.850
Brian Kern: Yeah, I have it on

17
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.970
Brian Kern: I haven't saved on my phone.

18
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.130
Brian Kern: Document.

19
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.280
Brian Kern: Good.

20
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.280
Brian Kern: Yeah. Yesterday got

21
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.870
Brian Kern: Emotional for some people. I don't remember why but

22
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.590
Brian Kern: Everybody was getting like emotional

23
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.390
Brian Kern: Oh,

24
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.350
Well,

25
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.350
Brian Kern: The topic was just like

26
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.190
Brian Kern: You know name like it was, it was like a check and and she was basically like okay

27
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.500
Brian Kern: You know, just say how you're doing like spiritually.

28
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And like physically

29
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.270
Brian Kern: Just like all around, you know, like, How are you doing, and then

30
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.760
Brian Kern: One person.

31
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:39.120
Brian Kern: started crying because I don't remember like I couldn't understand what she was saying like, I didn't understand it really like something about her brother, you know, and then

32
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.050
Brian Kern: The people who shared after her start getting really emotional

33
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.700
Brian Kern: I couldn't like I

34
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.910
Brian Kern: I couldn't like I wasn't cognizant of, like, what

35
00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.830
Brian Kern: She was actually talking about the other than she said that she thought she was going to relapse. Yeah, I think that's what got people emotional really

36
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.730
Yeah.

37
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was there anything

38
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That arose for you while she was speaking

39
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.360
Brian Kern: Oh,

40
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.470
Brian Kern: No, I mean like I could you know like

41
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.240
Brian Kern: She was talking about how she was like really anxious, all the time. So like I can relate to that like

42
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.170
Brian Kern: When I relapsed in January. That's how I felt.

43
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:38.670
Brian Kern: You know, like I felt like I just was super anxious all the time that it was like, you know, like heroin was like the only thing that was going to help it so like I could relate, but

44
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, no, I'm actually going to say that to

45
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.430
Brian Kern: Tell her era, but I didn't have a chance to

46
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.450
Brian Kern: This group and shortly after that, but I can definitely relate to her. Yeah, yeah.

47
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.430
Brian Kern: It wasn't something like

48
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.490
Brian Kern: get emotional about though.

49
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think

50
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was challenging because I'm not an emotional person.

51
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.090
Brian Kern: Um,

52
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.880
Brian Kern: Yeah, might be it honestly like

53
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.310
Brian Kern: I don't know that I just, you know, like I understood you know like I understood

54
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.530
Brian Kern: You know, I just didn't

55
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.890
Like

56
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.960
Brian Kern: You know, I said it just

57
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.860
Brian Kern: You know, like I can definitely like put myself in their shoes. You know, I

58
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.890
Brian Kern: Understand it but

59
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.900
Brian Kern: You know, this is not something

60
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.840
Brian Kern: Get emotional over really

61
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.170
Brian Kern: Does that make sense.

62
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you can definitely relate to it, but it doesn't create an emotional response for you.

63
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.370
Brian Kern: Yeah, exactly.

64
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:17.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that makes sense. I was just curious if that's across the board, you know if there are any certain certain challenges or issues that do create an emotional response or emotional reaction from you, such as crying.

65
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.900
Brian Kern: Are there any

66
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.710
Yeah.

67
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.130
Brian Kern: It's hard to say really because

68
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.630
Brian Kern: You know, like I didn't, you know, I didn't

69
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.110
Brian Kern: I didn't cry on my mother died, really, I just got high, you know, and

70
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.430
Brian Kern: Same with. Same with my brother really

71
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.530
Brian Kern: Yeah.

72
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.460
Brian Kern: I mean I can definitely like

73
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.640
Brian Kern: You know, I guess there's been times when I've been upset.

74
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.540
Brian Kern: I mean like only get upset.

75
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.670
Brian Kern: Necessarily

76
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.540
Brian Kern: Be outwardly

77
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.750
Brian Kern: Responsive to it. You know, I mean,

78
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's always been that way for you.

79
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.830
Brian Kern: Yeah, so

80
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.960
Brian Kern: For the most part,

81
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do

82
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You think that comes from

83
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:55.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being a male. Do you think there's cultural influences trauma. What do you think creates kind of like that that protective shell.

84
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.440
Brian Kern: I don't know, honestly, I might like because I think my dad's the same way.

85
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.250
You know,

86
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.610
Brian Kern: Like maybe I just got it from him or something.

87
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.430
Brian Kern: He's like exactly the same like

88
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:12.960
Brian Kern: No.

89
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:20.250
Brian Kern: He's Just Not every late. Our Lee emotional person at all, you know,

90
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just can't imagine on the losses that you mentioned, and

91
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not crying, but I'm you know I asked because

92
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:43.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I asked because just if there is, you know, there are certain

93
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:53.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Things in our upbringing, that doesn't allow for us to express the issues and maybe learn how to express

94
00:08:53.190 --> 00:09:05.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Emotions to our childhood experiences we watch how our periods, we react to challenges. And if that reaction is shut down. Then, as adults, we may tend to shut down.

95
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If the reaction is to override overreact and either get anxious or overly emotional about it.

96
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:23.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's probably what you're doing your adulthood, because we mirror and we are you know we are sponges as children. So we absorb whatever childhood experiences, etc.

97
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:32.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then we model that in adulthood, unless in our adulthood, we realize that we don't want it to be this way for whatever reason.

98
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:49.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If it doesn't feel emotionally connecting if you feel detached, then you try to reverse that cycle through figure out other ways to express your emotions. So Brian is an outlet for you. What is an outlet for you when

99
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're having something that triggers an emotional response. But did you do when your mother passed away and your brother.

100
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.160
Brian Kern: Times.

101
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.980
Brian Kern: That's, you know, basically what I did.

102
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:20.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what you want to be mindful of Brian is if there's something that happens in the midst of my sobriety that naturally require

103
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A tearful response or an extreme emotion.

104
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What will I do because in the past it was us.

105
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now, one to learn new skills so

106
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:44.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that look like, you know, just some for you to think of you may not even have the answers now and that's okay, but have that on the back of your mind. So you're not surprised when

107
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:54.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something happens and you just don't know how to respond because you don't want to use the you have no other alternatives and so

108
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: don't identify other alternatives and now

109
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You might just go with the ladder and decide to you and I don't want that for you.

110
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

111
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You see my screen here.

112
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Work Environment feels so stressful, have you come home from a meeting feeling like you know

113
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.340
Brian Kern: Everyone's out to get you, or does your home feel like

114
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:35.040
There's a lot of tension. Maybe you want your teenager to feel comfortable talking with you, but it's just not working. If any of these are the case for you, then you might have a problem with emotional safety.

115
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:54.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: creating an environment of emotional safety is essential for a productive workplace a healthy home and positive relationships. If you feel tense or like you're being judged all the time.

116
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or if you create an environment where people don't feel listened to, or understood

117
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then your environment is not emotionally safe. Today we're going to talk about a few ways you can increase emotional safety in your environment.

118
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:18.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Emotional safety is when people feel appreciated valued worthwhile when they feel like they can trust their environment to be fair and consistent and kind

119
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In an emotionally safe environment people feel like they can share

120
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:30.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Their vulnerable and sensitive feelings without being mocked blamed or judged feedback and correction can be given in a calm safe and loving manner.

121
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People take accountability for their own actions without blame or defensiveness differences of opinion can be shared.

122
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:44.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And also accepted, people don't feel like they have to change to be okay in emotionally safe environments. There's a feeling of honesty.

123
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's a feeling of clear and safe expectations, some of the indicators of an emotionally safe environment or you feel comfortable around each other.

124
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People don't feel like they're going to be attacked.

125
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:07.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There tends to be open and clear communication when someone messes up repairs are made quickly, you'll see an increase in Vulnerability and openness, where people are sharing their really sensitive feelings.

126
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:16.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And people feel connected. Now, if you'd like to create an environment like this. You have to focus 95% of your effort on changing yourself.

127
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:23.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We are responsible for our environment and what we what we put out there and what we allow to come into our environment.

128
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:35.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So most of your effort should be focusing on yourself. I say this because when I talk about emotional safety. I get a lot of people say, Oh yeah, the people around me. They're so dangerous. They're so mean there's attacking there so judgmental de de de de

129
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they don't realize that by saying that and thinking that they're actually creating an emotionally unsafe environment.

130
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:51.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or perhaps the people around them actually are attacking and dangerous, but they aren't taking any steps to create safety for themselves by setting healthy boundaries.

131
00:13:51.900 --> 00:14:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when it comes to emotional safety focus on yourself. What can you do to create this the opposite of emotional safety is judgment blame attacking

132
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:11.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a lot of closed off emotions so people use anger instead of sadness or they express frustration.

133
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:18.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of, you know, expressing that they feel discouraged some other indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment.

134
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is people are constantly giving advice. Instead of listening.

135
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:35.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or constantly judging someone else or trying to change them if they don't agree with them in emotionally unsafe environments. People feel a sense of conditional love that means well i love you if you change or I love you when you're good.

136
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:42.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But not when you're bad and that creates this constant sense of insecurity now on the receiving end of that.

137
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People who are constantly feeling like they aren't good enough or questioning their own self worth.

138
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:59.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are going to project that on other people. So that's something that needs to be worked on in order to create a feeling of emotional safety other indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment are yelling

139
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:10.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Threatening or obviously any physical violence that creates, you know, a completely unsafe environment defensiveness blame using voice tone or a lot of attitude.

140
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: also contribute to a negative environment, as do passive aggressive statements.

141
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:28.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of the most common indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment or using things like personal attacks. So instead of saying, I don't like it when you forget to do your tour. You say you are the laziest person in the world.

142
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:36.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know that attacking their character just calling them a lazy sob. The other thing that's a big indicator of emotionally unsafe environments.

143
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is when the rules are boundaries are standards are constantly changing. People don't know what to expect.

144
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or when there's a feeling of walking on eggshells like if you say the wrong thing, that person is going to blow up. Or if you

145
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:58.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you do the wrong thing, that person is going to be offended. So those are all indicators of emotionally unsafe environments. We can actively create an environment of emotional safety by working on ourselves.

146
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:07.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We create an environment of love, where we aren't trying to change other people, but rather we put our focus on trying to understand them and listen to them.

147
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:14.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When the time comes for correction. We are consistent for clear and fair we're honest with people.

148
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:24.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we share our, our vulnerable emotions like Sadness or hurt instead of only expressing secondary emotions like frustration and anger.

149
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:32.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We create internal safety by building ourselves up and you know standing on offended not taking offense by what other people say.

150
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:42.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We also got to make sure never to use the word emotional safety as a way to badger or try and change someone else so going up someone's in you're creating an emotionally unsafe environment.

151
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is not going to be helpful if the environment is actually unsafe, then what we need to do is set boundaries around other people

152
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:59.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ask for change. Invite change and when necessary leave to create emotional safety we always have to focus on what's within our own realm of control.

153
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:08.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we focus on changing ourselves instead of trying to change other people, if we're in an emotionally unsafe environment we're less likely to create change by asking someone else to change.

154
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:20.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then we are by setting clear, consistent and firm boundaries. It is fair to ask other people to change to make requests and to, you know, tell them how they're affecting you.

155
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:28.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it is rarely fair or helpful to expect that someone change or to demand that they change in order for you to accept them.

156
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:34.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This creates a feeling of powerless in yourself because you're demanding that someone else change in order for you to feel okay

157
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:43.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We can take back our emotional safety by focusing on our own actions and creating clear, firm and consistent boundaries with others. Thanks for watching. I hope that was helpful and I

158
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:49.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thought

159
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.920
Brian Kern: Oh, made a lot of sense to me. Oh.

160
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:06.030
Brian Kern: I guess the part that really stuck out was like, if you're like anxious or insecure that can create emotionally on a safe.

161
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.240
Brian Kern: Environment is as you know I get anxious, sometimes, you know,

162
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:22.590
Brian Kern: Yeah, I'm, you know, other than that, you know, I mean, I feel like home. At least it's very

163
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.280
Brian Kern: emotionally safe place, though, you know,

164
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:37.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What what stood out what characteristics about emotional safety, did you see we're already included in your home structure.

165
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.020
Brian Kern: You know, like

166
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:41.940
Brian Kern: Just

167
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:50.760
Brian Kern: Like the honesty in like, you know, we don't yell or anything like that.

168
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.650
Brian Kern: Um,

169
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.320
Brian Kern: What else did he say

170
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.640
Brian Kern: He was one of them.

171
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm judgmental.

172
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.320
Brian Kern: Yeah, exactly.

173
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:25.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when mistakes are made there corrected, but in a non judgmental way so the feedback is given in a safe and respectful manner because

174
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No one's married to anyone that's perfect.

175
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:36.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there will be opportunities to help your spouse to improve in something that may

176
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: pose as a hindrance or

177
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:51.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: unhealthy for you. And so how do you communicate or express that to your spouse in a way that doesn't create depends from someone else.

178
00:19:51.990 --> 00:20:09.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that doesn't make it seem like oh I don't know how to have this discussion, because there's several people that are in, they don't have the fortune, like you to be in those relationships and all state relationships. So it becomes challenging to express their needs, their wants

179
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:17.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you going to have fun. So what do you think works well for your marriage to keep it as an emotional safe environment.

180
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.170
Brian Kern: Was

181
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.670
Brian Kern: Like what I do.

182
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:36.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, you say you guys already have that. So what do you think people like if you were talking to other couples, what would you say that you and your wife do to keep an emotionally safe, healthy relationship.

183
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.650
Brian Kern: Oh, like we clearly communicate

184
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.430
Brian Kern: You know, I mean,

185
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.590
Brian Kern: Like I say, that's like the biggest thing, you know, I mean,

186
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:48.930
Brian Kern: Like

187
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.800
Brian Kern: That definitely that like like clear communication and not

188
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.450
Brian Kern: Not being like passive aggressive at all.

189
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.700
Brian Kern: That's the lawyer late you want to feel like, oh,

190
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.430
Brian Kern: Yeah definitely like just being like non judgmental at all.

191
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:25.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what if the other person in relationships, apple, what do you guys do when there's issues. How do you, how do you work through that even when they're upset.

192
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.730
Brian Kern: I mean, every time we

193
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.800
Brian Kern: Had issues we just

194
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:33.420
Brian Kern: We

195
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.880
Brian Kern: Talked it out, you know, I mean, like we just

196
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.920
Brian Kern: You know, like, like when I relapsed in January.

197
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.090
You know, I mean like

198
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.740
Brian Kern: We just

199
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.750
Brian Kern: You know, I mean like talked about and

200
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then like decided that I should

201
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.740
Brian Kern: Go back into treatment.

202
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:54.630
You know,

203
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.520
Brian Kern: And then, um,

204
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:05.550
Brian Kern: Yeah. Yeah, we just we spoke about it. I mean, she was like very she was non judgmental of all you know i mean she

205
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.750
Brian Kern: You know she was very upset, but it wasn't like

206
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.330
Brian Kern: You know she wasn't like yelling or anything like that. You know what I mean.

207
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.080
So,

208
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know we just like work.

209
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:25.590
Brian Kern: Work through it and like you know like took steps like the, you know, we need to do this and this.

210
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:27.900
And then

211
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.240
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean it.

212
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.020
Is just

213
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.020
Brian Kern: Communication just like not

214
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.220
Brian Kern: A word like

215
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.120
Brian Kern: Non hostile you. I mean, just like not

216
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.680
Hostile

217
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.650
Brian Kern: Speaking no

218
00:22:48.480 --> 00:23:02.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So then this is the formula that would help if there are the question I posed at the beginning. If there are emotional triggers for you now. Hard to process in

219
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Outwardly expressing that emotion is something that you're not naturally inclined to do

220
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:18.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You are aware now of the emotional faith relationship you have with your spouse and so rather than being reactive

221
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:33.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And saying, hey, I relaxed being proactive and communicating what's coming up for you and even be a princess non judgmental space. So being vulnerable enough to say, I feel like using

222
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.980
Brian Kern: So that she can create that environment and give you that safety to

223
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: express your emotions outward

224
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.500
Brian Kern: Yeah, I'm actually already

225
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:47.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

226
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.410
Brian Kern: promised her that I felt like using like tell her.

227
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like a thing.

228
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:54.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I mean,

229
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He didn't do it during the last minute.

230
00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.940
Brian Kern: I'm

231
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.910
Brian Kern: Honestly, I just was

232
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.080
Brian Kern: I was just like so anxious and everything that I just

233
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.990
Brian Kern: You know, I mean, it was like

234
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.890
Brian Kern: Just getting high then was like the only thing on my mind.

235
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.800
Brian Kern: And like he was

236
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.210
Brian Kern: You know, it was like

237
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:25.020
Brian Kern: She was like working so I just like went and did it. You know, I mean,

238
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:37.650
Brian Kern: Yeah. Since then those is when I've promised her that, like, you know, if I ever probably using you know definitely tell her.

239
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yo, yeah.

240
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another important

241
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:50.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Formula to be mindful of is like in the video. They said emotional safety starts within you.

242
00:24:51.300 --> 00:25:11.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's great that you have a social support being your wife that can create that safety for you, but internally doing the work, so that you can also create a safe space for you that if your wife is at work again. The next time you have a strong influence craving.

243
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For Brian to be able to be

244
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: self sufficient to fight the cravings and they are when he's able to

245
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:31.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Communicate with his wife say, hey, this is what I went through and look. I didn't use to be able to put on that rescuer Kate that hero case that you mentioned last session.

246
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:40.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That I don't want upon the victim Kate and my wife has to figure out how to help me in my next relax.

247
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:50.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can say that I was a hero for my own sobriety and that is something that's going to help her to to build the trust because I'm always curious to know

248
00:25:51.810 --> 00:26:08.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When there's in a relationship. And when there's a relax. If the other spouse kind of feels nervous about when will this happen again. And does that nervousness decrease the trust me anyway.

249
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.040
Brian Kern: Yeah, I definitely feel like a little bit

250
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.390
Brian Kern: Definitely and

251
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:23.550
Brian Kern: You know she felt really like the trade when when I when I used

252
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.410
Brian Kern: It's definitely taken

253
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.590
Brian Kern: It's definitely taken time

254
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.170
Brian Kern: Since then, you know, I mean,

255
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:43.440
Brian Kern: But yeah, I mean, definitely. Yeah, I mean, you know, she felt very, very betrayed and I didn't

256
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.860
Brian Kern: And I didn't come to her first, you know,

257
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:51.840
Brian Kern: Yeah.

258
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.980
Brian Kern: I mean it's it's it's done better though.

259
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:06.540
No.

260
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.210
Brian Kern: I was gonna say like as long as I'm like, you know, honest.

261
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.980
Brian Kern: Like it's it's good, you know,

262
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What ways have you created emotional safety within yourself.

263
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Did you hear my question.

264
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.720
Brian Kern: I heard the first half.

265
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: X. In what ways have you created emotional safety within yourself.

266
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:52.980
Brian Kern: Oh,

267
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.520
Brian Kern: I mean, I am

268
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.270
Brian Kern: I tried to just like

269
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.210
Brian Kern: Make sure I'm not like all like, anxious, all the time. Now that's like the biggest one, like I

270
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.900
Brian Kern: Gotta keep my anxiety and check, very much.

271
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.130
Brian Kern: I feel like that's like the biggest thing, you know. Oh.

272
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.450
Brian Kern: I just tried to take care of myself, you know,

273
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:39.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But my favorite part of the video was allowing yourself to communicate the vulnerable emotions and not just secondary emotions because second

274
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And yeah, the secondary emotions are anger and irritation.

275
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:52.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And often times on here patients, they'll say, I have an anger issues I get frustrated, real easy.

276
00:28:53.160 --> 00:29:03.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when I push them a little harder about really what's been behind that. So always something else that was underlined that led to the anger or the irritation.

277
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:14.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's always some type of trigger, whether it be feeling disrespected not feeling valued or feeling loss of control that, then that anger rises.

278
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:26.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the secondary emotions or for you in this case because you are very open like even though I understood and I felt for that group member I

279
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:35.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: couldn't understand why everybody was out weeds person their emotions. You know what I heard in that was listening, a little awkward to be in the middle.

280
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:47.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, to be in the midst of that and like okay yeah this is hard. But I think we're kind of crying you know so begin in that space in that capacity, you know,

281
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:58.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You may not know what your primary emotions or even the secondary one because you've been in this emotional numbness for so long because of the trauma us

282
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the work would be really identifying

283
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:14.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What you mentioned Jeff and Dan vulnerable enough to acknowledge it.

284
00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:33.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what you do next is totally up to you. But some people have acknowledged it in general, it can be by knowledge and share with other people because it helps them in being accountable as well. So I'm going to pull up my little emotion start

285
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:40.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it is captures that there's so much more to just being happy, sad or mad.

286
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:45.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah complexities of emotions.

287
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:54.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there is this is actually two pages long. So I'll scroll once once we get, you know, towards the bottom

288
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:10.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There any emotions that you can identify that you felt today.

289
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.820
Brian Kern: Today I'm

290
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.360
Brian Kern: Probably

291
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.510
Brian Kern: Calm definitely you know I'm

292
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.860
Calm.

293
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.990
Brian Kern: Oh yeah, I felt really all earlier. I'm

294
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.010
Brian Kern: Hungry. He's on there. I felt hungry are

295
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.080
Brian Kern: You hungry is on there. Oh.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.640
Brian Kern: Yeah, I probably just say like column and just

297
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:46.680
Brian Kern: Hungry.

298
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.170
Brian Kern: Just

299
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:03.840
Brian Kern: Probably those three

300
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What am I should be accurately conveys what you felt in group.

301
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me scroll down

302
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:35.670
Brian Kern: Cut off.

303
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.610
Brian Kern: Probably honestly

304
00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.340
Brian Kern: Maybe a little

305
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.710
Brian Kern: Scared for

306
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:03.570
Brian Kern: No.

307
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.220
Brian Kern: You know, like

308
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.290
Brian Kern: Yeah, exactly, because you know nowadays when people relapse. They usually

309
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.860
Die.

310
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.380
Brian Kern: Sorry is connecting yeah my connection sucks right now. Um,

311
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.720
Brian Kern: Yeah, just kind of scared, she might like overdose and die, you know,

312
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.200
Brian Kern: That's probably the biggest one.

313
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.280
Brian Kern: You know, it's just like

314
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.760
Brian Kern: I wouldn't like outwardly. You know, like Show show that, though, you know, I mean,

315
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.340
Brian Kern: I don't even know how to

316
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.720
Brian Kern: You know, except maybe just

317
00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

318
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:09.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's it. Brian, even though you can't out will show the emotion, being able to say it is equally powerful

319
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.400
And

320
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:19.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would, I would say that that would help your wife to in identifying vulnerabilities and best ways to support you.

321
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:29.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: from a woman's perspective, I can imagine if you had someone that puts on that rescuer world whenever their struggle and

322
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:42.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For the most part, does not display emotional vulnerability and the only way I find out that my, my husband has some vulnerability is through his addiction to relax.

323
00:34:43.170 --> 00:35:01.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She might miss it. She might miss those little signs that opens up doing okay you know because there's no outwardly displayed. And so we take on the hero complex and you know she feels comfortable. She was protected in that, but then

324
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:14.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Here comes. Hey, I had a relapse. And now, like you said she had as soon as a feel betrayed because also what that was communicating was I never seen the sun.

325
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No hurry motion may have been surprised worried, and scared to

326
00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:31.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Process. She probably question herself, what could I have done to prevent this from happening.

327
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.420
Brian Kern: Yeah.

328
00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:47.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the best gift you continuously give her in this beautiful marriage is even though I won't show it outwardly. I will tell you how I'm feeling.

329
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:57.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even if what I'm feeling does not match up with what the rescuer typically you're supposed to feel like

330
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The common oil because so for alone. I'm going to tell you that

331
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:13.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If I'm annoyed because I went back to work, but that drug, you know, drug addict co worker still shooting up in the bathroom.

332
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:23.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm gonna tell you and I might even have to stretch a little further and say I'm a little nervous, working with me because I don't want to be tempted

333
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.370
Brian Kern: Yeah.

334
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.440
Brian Kern: I'm actually pretty

335
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.730
Brian Kern: Pretty sure the

336
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.780
Brian Kern: I'm not gonna go work for back there after this

337
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:34.650
Brian Kern: You know,

338
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.040
Brian Kern: As soon as things open back up and

339
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I think that's a smart thing to do. Yeah.

340
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm happy that that group experience that shows me that that group has emotional safety.

341
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:54.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For her to express

342
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. That's amazing. That's powerful.

343
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.560
Brian Kern: Yeah, they are. It gets

344
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.330
Brian Kern: Doesn't get into quite that emotional every week, but definitely everybody's like, comfortable talking

345
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.250
Brian Kern: Through everything in that group.

346
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:16.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you think keeps that group cohesion comfortable so that people can do that.

347
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.660
Brian Kern: I think it's, it's like when the first person does it

348
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

349
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:27.090
Brian Kern: When the first person is like truly open like that then gives other people

350
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.790
Brian Kern: Courage to like be open like that, you know, I mean,

351
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:30.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

352
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.250
Brian Kern: I kind of give some

353
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.230
Brian Kern: You know, they get the idea that, like, oh wait, I actually can't talk to stuff in here.

354
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:51.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because humans on wireless connection. We want to be understood to someone allow themselves to be vulnerable. It's like, oh, I was born that way. The other day too.

355
00:37:53.370 --> 00:38:02.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so that's good. And I would encourage you that you have a time that rises up for you, but you have something that's going on.

356
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:14.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you identified that this is an emotional safe environment, you know, maybe you would want to take it a step and practice it in that environment first at the same group, you know,

357
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:22.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hey, I'm feeling scared for you and what you shared because you know when people relax. He died.

358
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:29.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By you sharing that information that might be exactly what she needed to hear. Like you know what he's right. I don't want that.

359
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:48.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it may not feel as comfortable with your wife right now, only because you want to continue to be that strong role, you may not want to expose that vulnerability, because you don't want her been to get worried about your sobriety.

360
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:50.910
Brian Kern: Exactly.

361
00:38:52.260 --> 00:39:06.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't want to transfer your emotions onto her so group here in this session. It's a good way to practice that emotional safety to express through words how you're feeling so that

362
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, when the going gets tough.

363
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'll be able to tell my spouse, but also I will let her know that this is my team.

364
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't want to project this on to you. This is me just letting

365
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.840
Brian Kern: Me select a sense

366
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:44.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So if you could, I can either email it to you or you can take a picture, because I would love to share this with you, just so that you could do a little emotional safety check in with yourself daily

367
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To figure out, you know what's going on with you.

368
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.220
Brian Kern: Yeah. Do you think you could email to me. I don't, I don't know how to take screenshots my

369
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.210
Brian Kern: Phone actually don't. I don't think I can take a screenshot with it.

370
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I want to know how to do it either.

371
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It says one person impressed me when they said, oh, I took the picture of it. Maybe they were aligned to me. I don't know. But ever since then I'm like, Okay.

372
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.710
Brian Kern: No, you definitely can. Like I had a phone for this.

373
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.630
Brian Kern: I can take a screenshot.

374
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything else you would like to discuss

375
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.570
Brian Kern: Um, nothing I can think, oh,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said, I'm doing this the same time next week.
