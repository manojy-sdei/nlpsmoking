330
00:26:49.470 --> 00:27:00.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Until you know you are able to manage it. Because when you act on it. You know, sometimes she could hurt. Some people though, you mentioned you're not into punching people are doing things, but sometimes

331
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.680
Jocelyn Corrales: People could feel that you're angry because you know

332
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:17.700
Jocelyn Corrales: You're stomping or you know you you would make everyone aware that you're angry. So try to do some deep breathing exercise when you're hungry. So try to close your eyes and thing and read

333
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.490
Jocelyn Corrales: And read and out
