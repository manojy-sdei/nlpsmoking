00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.020
Six.

2
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

3
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.320
Good morning.

4
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.330
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Morning.

5
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning. I'm setting up a note here and I'm assuming today. You're all set up and ready to go. Hmm.

6
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: All the kinks worked out okay let's see we got

7
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: 640 45. All right.

8
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I saw your text. Right. Um, there was sort of this. Well, maybe I haven't forgiven myself completely

9
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.090
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah. Well, I was just yeah as kind of rushing up with a thought together at the end.

10
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.930
I'm

11
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.340
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Just thinking that does not. Not quite.

12
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: quite accurate to say that I have 100% forgiving myself for

13
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: For that. Or yeah, everything, but it

14
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:27.180
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I feel it's like it's not exactly just like a single event or, you know, single thing to forgive yourself for there's like a, you know, kind of ongoing things that come up that you know I

15
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:45.720
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, will get upset with myself for and then realize I need to, you know, it's something else that isn't serving me and I need to forgive myself for it. So I'm sure that that will continue, you know, things will continue to arise that

16
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.630
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I am not happy with myself about that. I still needed to forgive myself for but um yeah

17
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe. Maybe just get a little, maybe some feedback for me just to hear yourself and see how prolific that is because

18
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I don't really understand what's so unforgivable about what you did. So is this is ongoing. Can you can you let me in on what what is a few things you find sort of on forgivable at this point.

19
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.280
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, I mean I wouldn't

20
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: haven't forgiven yourself. Let me use your words.

21
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta be really careful with you because if it's a word that's off, then we'll get distracted with that.

22
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.800
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, like to use that, you know, the examples from group with, you know, the

23
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.960
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know having blowing savings that you know

24
00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:01.830
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Like, there will, you know, be things that will come up or so, you know, man. I be in this different position. If I still have that money and have

25
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.520
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know I

26
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.460
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I'll get

27
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:23.880
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: upset with myself and then kind of have to go through a process of, you know, say well you know that that you know it is what it is. I've already kind of thought about it. I've addressed it there's no

28
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:35.910
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, beating myself up still isn't doing anything so you know it's it's something that I need to just forgive and, you know, move on from so it's it's not

29
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.660
It.

30
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:51.300
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess what I mean is that, you know, forgiveness is kind of like an ongoing process. It's not just like one one static moment.

31
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it come up in other places, aside from I believe my savings.

32
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.640
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

33
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.490
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah, I mean I think just

34
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.840
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know in general with

35
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.520
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know when it's easy for me to

36
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:31.890
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know tell myself oh well you should be somewhere else in your life that you know your age or, you know, that I should be, you know,

37
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:44.070
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Either you know more advanced in a career or, you know, more advanced towards creating a family or, you know, all sorts of

38
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.630
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know,

39
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.180
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: metrics that you know I can have a tendency to apply to myself.

40
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.830
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: And then, you know, say like, Oh, you know, if you had

41
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.580
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Gotten addicted, you know, thinking where it could be now and it's

42
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.850
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: So, and I think at this point. I feel like I'm

43
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:21.120
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: A lot better at recognizing that those aren't really beneficial thoughts and that

44
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.920
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know,

45
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.140
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Process them a lot more quickly. But it doesn't mean they don't come up

46
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can we spend a little bit of time right here today.

47
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.810
Sure.

48
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, just the money part just want to explore a little further and then maybe get into, you know, this assessment of yourself that you would be more advanced in career and family had you not been addicted.

49
00:06:52.140 --> 00:07:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going back to the savings. Tell me sort of what's connected to, if I had not blown my savings. How is it that you imagine you would be somewhere else in your career. Let me just help, help me understand the train of thought there the causality, that's, I don't see it.

50
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:31.410
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Oh, that I don't think is necessarily connected to the career piece of it that that's just, you know, something separate but um you know like if I bought a house instead of spent money on drugs. I'd be in a very different position financially Nass it

51
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wait, wouldn't you have more debt would she be committed to a mortgage

52
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.090
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

53
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.970
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well,

54
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.830
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: We'd have the look.

55
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Of stability, right, you'd have you'd be a home owner. It sounds like you'd like that image of yourself like I hey I have a home.

56
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.610
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I mean, yeah, I mean, there, there would

57
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.770
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I mean it's it's

58
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.810
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Not just about the image, there's, you know, a

59
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.540
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Definite you know benefit to having a place that you

60
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.550
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, is your own and that you feel comfortable and and you know it's

61
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.970
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um, but, I mean, you're right there. They're still, it's not like

62
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.730
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's, um,

63
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:50.940
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know there are, you know, other you know expenses and commitments and whatnot that go along with that. That, um,

64
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.890
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: But, um,

65
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It, you know, it's been

66
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's been there, you know, kind of

67
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:16.710
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess it's you know worthwhile expense in my enough to because you're you're building, you know, equity or built you know your final place to live and stuff. It's not

68
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Fashion unless it's 2007 eight, you know, most there's a recession which we can't control either right and then it's just a

69
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: living nightmare truly live through it.

70
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back. Let's go all the way back to

71
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

72
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What was an opiate use a solution to because it was a solution was a solution to what problem. See if in simplest terms, if you could name what that was.

73
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.010
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

74
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.930
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yes.

75
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.680
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Depression. Okay.

76
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are you addressing depression now.

77
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

78
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.850
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, I

79
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.490
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Guess I'm trying to

80
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.870
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: To to not

81
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.880
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Forget about it. I'm trying to

82
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.680
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know,

83
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:53.610
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: can confront emotions that I have even when they're, you know, negative challenging things and you know I don't

84
00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:00.510
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Really have like a way that I've solved it or anything but but i think that

85
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.700
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's like

86
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:16.920
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's by ignoring it or escapee to it's something that kind of just grew and grew and grew, and I think that

87
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.410
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, but but not

88
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:28.260
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The biggest fan of trying to do is not run away from, you know, emotions, even on their unpleasant and, you know, try to

89
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay yeah you you you named what you are doing.

90
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And identified and reflected to what you were doing.

91
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said this a few times, you know, that maybe this is uncomfortable at times therapy right this sitting with uncomfortable emotions you are confronting your emotions directly

92
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That is different for you right

93
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's important.

94
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Had you confronted emotions.

95
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Back then,

96
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.190
Right.

97
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have you think

98
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Kept your savings.

99
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe, where would you be in your career.

100
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:22.920
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well,

101
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.770
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I mean,

102
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:35.760
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That's, that's what I realized, you know, the fallacy and thinking is, you know, I, I could have done something stupid with that money. That wasn't

103
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:48.390
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, there's no guarantee that it will, there's no guarantee that I would have gone back to school or, you know, and you know, gotten a degree that got me a great job or anything, it's, it's so it's

104
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:58.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That that's, that's where I realized intellectually that you know those types of thoughts don't are aren't real. But it, they can still

105
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.430
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Exist, even though I know that there so

106
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's a convenient.

107
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Blame maybe it's easier to blame that on

108
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The addiction than having to look at a maybe a deeper, more difficult struggle with. And this is the work we're in right now in the work we've been doing. And it's in

109
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's my comfort. What's my resilience around

110
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I have an idea of what I want to do, can I trust myself to do it, regardless of what people say.

111
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You see,

112
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the work we were doing last time. And I want to continue that with you because if it, if it means that we're getting closer and closer to the route.

113
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the barrier that's holding you back.

114
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to continue doing that. Do you think we're, we're getting some somewhere meaningful in the work we were doing.

115
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.480
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah yeah

116
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.560
Me too.

117
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I see, I see this do like wherever I see little notes of mine, I see it in a lot of places, which is right, this and I watched your body right and I watched what looks like this energy that is like you have it in there. There's this energy and it doesn't get expressed

118
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I see it in like, Gosh, I wonder, I wonder if that's how the belief is about how he needs the world like

119
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna get in trouble. Like I if I, yeah, I have this idea of what I want to do, but there will be a negative consequence and I might hurt. Some one. And so I hear that I'm me and I'm like,

120
00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if you have sat with that and what you think that someone is or

121
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: If that is really a block for you, you know, whether you sat with that outside of our sessions together.

122
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.830
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um, it's definitely

123
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.800
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Something that I'm

124
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.400
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, thought, thought about mount

125
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:24.840
It.

126
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.020
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I mean, like, kind of going back to something you know talked about

127
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.780
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: A while ago is just kind of

128
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:41.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Trusting instinct or, you know, knowing when to trust instinct. It's, um,

129
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.570
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It, it's, you know, they it

130
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.300
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I

131
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:55.800
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, when I look at you know most of the times in life that that I have kind of

132
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:04.440
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Went off of instinct is its overall usually served me pretty well until

133
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.970
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: This you know kind of recent period of, you know,

134
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.890
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: With you know with everything being wrapped up in addiction and whatnot, and it

135
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.440
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: So I do

136
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.590
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Like I i

137
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:39.330
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I think I need to get back to a point where I do have that trust in myself and you know with that there's

138
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:52.800
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That acknowledgement that that I don't completely have that and and that is harder for me to pin down where that comes from. Exactly. Um, it's, um,

139
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.400
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: But, um, it

140
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: On top of that, do you believe that it's there.

141
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That that that marriage and that ideology is there inside like memory somewhere in there that you will maybe through this morning, continuing to do some of the EM Dr. Just letting that

142
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever those neural connections are just, you know, having this is the distraction that lets stuff just come up without you, concentrating on it. I'd like to see what keeps coming up because interesting things, at least for me or I'm seeing

143
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you'll find a connection that really gives you this off. Oh my gosh, that's the summary. There's a nice feeling that happens for people when they go, oh,

144
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it actually do get a little dope. I mean, once you have the summary and you've come to a conclusion in your head, you get a nice feeling

145
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want that for you.

146
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you so on top of all that, do you believe in this notion that you are a self healing system that ultimately your body, your mind it wants to heal itself that are mechanisms in place for self healing.

147
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.240
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I do

148
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, me too. And, and I think

149
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can get out of our own way. If we can see that there's no pockets no corners that are unapproachable.

150
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the things we're fearing those those shadows might have some information. And so maybe this stuff we're doing might let it come up

151
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And if we sit together and you know so through this sort of Socratic dialogue going back and forth.

152
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You can hear your own voice. You can hear is what I'm saying. Really, this is really what I believe. You know, so I'd like to continue because we, I know I didn't get too far. And I remember, I have this feeling like I wanted to keep going.

153
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt cut off because time ended so I'm a little easier to go back to what we were doing. Are you amenable to that this morning.

154
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.980
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah, okay.

155
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to read a little bit. These notes. Um, I don't type them. They are transcribed. So sometimes, like my notes hand once that once I right here like better, they catch exact phrases. So if there's some things that are off.

156
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It means that when it was dictated it just didn't get like exact or something. Okay.

157
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But they, the way it's organized is kind of nice. We've got

158
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I just read through it to bring you back.

159
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:42.630
Okay.

160
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's I'm doing it with you. Now let's really have this this breath. This mindful breath really set the intention.

161
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Of self healing.

162
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's your body, your mind, your soul, your spirit.

163
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there for you that it's there.

164
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: in your best interest.

165
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to access all the parts of the brain.

166
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: At least so that they can communicate that no parts are cut off because then it's under functioning, we want

167
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Want the whole body functioning optimally.

168
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just set your intention today and really find it in your own like what do I want out of today what what mystery or

169
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What new thought wisdom.

170
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Motivation curiosity.

171
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece

172
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To see what you want to experience today and just sort of

173
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Acknowledge that longing.

174
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That desire.

175
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That goal.

176
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just turn my brain off. Sorry.

177
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with that and I'll go through some some pieces.

178
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: One thing you had mentioned was this awareness of an event that happened when you were

179
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: rambunctious

180
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This is something I want to solve. There's a thinking insect tonight. I

181
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It was an accident that happened right

182
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're just focused on a relational importance. Now, that's my phrasing, which means he cared about you.

183
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a material thing.

184
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.270
Right.

185
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And thanks for taking care of that fly, he said.

186
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

187
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you noticed after that some sort of release or a less tightness in the shoulders and less fidgeting you it was interesting because there was less fidgeting in the hands, I think.

188
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are actually focusing on it, fidgeting reduced

189
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And the negative cognition or what you were saying yourself was I was worried. I would get in trouble.

190
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then later.

191
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: having a difficult time acknowledging team.

192
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And not understanding. I guess the resource of the imagery of a protective figure having it be around you near you.

193
00:22:51.690 --> 00:23:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can give more clarification about that as a grandma having Andrew saidi Grandma I think all present

194
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can add a little bit of clarification there. And so, and in fact I think it's so important that will do more weaving of that positive

195
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagery so that you get really comfortable with it first, because it's so important and so the basic premise sort of comes out of, sort of, you know, ego state psychology, which means

196
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this to be true. I have this resource and, indeed, I have this resource in me. I can feel it. Now it's here present. That's the goal. Right. We use imagery, but it's not separate from you because as soon as you can feel it and sense that, and it's a part of you.

197
00:23:49.680 --> 00:24:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's with you all the time. If you want it to be there. See, not in the habit of doing that most of us are brain tends to, you know, the negative. What else. But if instead you get in the habit of summoning up

198
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: For me to acknowledge these things and others, I need to know it in myself. In fact, it's just, that's a truth. If I can see this attribute and someone else I'm I must know it on some level in myself and

199
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me let me really on that I have the ability to have this protective nature. This is a part of me. And sometimes what happens when when I do the those three figures, the wise, the nurturing and

200
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The protective I might say it might actually be your adult self that is one or two or three or all those rights. Now you can really hear, Oh now. Yeah. Part of the ego state. It's a part of me and I'm not

201
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The past. I'm not a little boy, subject to the power and the threat of punishment and all of that, that goes on with being dependent on an adult, you know,

202
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're an adult now and you may indeed acknowledge that you have these resources inside of you.

203
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So the goal, right, is that that get blended all together. And it's basically you

204
00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that helpful at all.

205
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.130
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah yeah

206
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.130
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I think so.

207
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I will. I'll probably spend a little bit of time on that this morning. So there was also this after about the seventh iteration.

208
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Your subject to Canada lives distress went to 35 I can't see where it had started, but it had gone down and you were thinking about how immediately aware, I am of a mistake after smashing the lamp, where the sinking.

209
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling in the stomach and that's the one that really has my attention because, in general, it's the stomach. That's on bad and its inner personal it's it's out our core

210
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And look what it is that intuition that sense of my gut feeling is right in there too.

211
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might all just be sort of inner weaved with not wanting to hurt anyone. And can I trust that interacting with people. I'm going to make a decision that's

212
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to hurt someone. So there might be really some important information in there. So then it moves on to an acknowledgement of corresponding with the acknowledgement of making a mistake. There was also anger at myself for not thinking it through.

213
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Still sort of

214
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: A charge in the stomach.

215
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of sinking. It was tight.

216
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then after another iteration fear that I will make the same mistake again.

217
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I knew it was stupid. But I did it anyways.

218
00:26:54.690 --> 00:27:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And then tightness in the arms and legs and the cognition being told that if I make a mistake, it will be okay.

219
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not sure, you know, that might be a transcription piece, but some pieces of that seem familiar

220
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now let's let's go to current moment. And let me get a sense of what's coming up for you. Now, what

221
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts running through your head.

222
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.230
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

223
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.380
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, I

224
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.460
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Think that I'm

225
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.500
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Thought about

226
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:04.530
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, if you're making the same mistake again. That was kind of more moving into the present and, you know, kind of processes for

227
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.470
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Their current things that that can trip me up where it

228
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.340
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It is if I'm

229
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.580
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: At It kind of connects to, you know, the

230
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.200
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Trusting instinct and stuff where if I'm

231
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.520
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Know that I've done something I shouldn't have in the past it. It's

232
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.340
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: challenging for me to

233
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.620
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: give myself permission to, you know, do something where I might

234
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.070
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: make that same mistake again or

235
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.650
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I might be at risk of doing that.

236
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go with that. I want you to take the current, the current

237
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Trigger. So there's something either happening, maybe in your current life or maybe you're looking into the future, one of those. I won't be able to

238
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Trust the intuition doing this. Do you know what that is. Maybe let's have an actual story, whether it's a current trigger boy and remembering. Oh, I really stopped myself right here, or I'm looking in the future.

239
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I hear an actual little picture you got

240
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.250
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

241
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.250
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, like

242
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:42.960
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Like with with going back to school. I

243
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.080
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Mean, so much of my

244
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.780
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Identity.

245
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.890
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Around who I was when I was in college before

246
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.600
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Kind of connected to drug use and even though I wasn't really using opiates. At that point, I think that

247
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.210
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's where a lot of, you know, patterns, kind of started that that ultimately

248
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:17.730
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Led to that. And I have this, I guess fear that if I go back to school all

249
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:30.210
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Either fall back into those patterns or I just won't know how to act without who to be with without having that

250
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. Yeah.

251
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I will be

252
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Going back to school, you wonder if you'll fall back into those same patterns and you wonder who will I be

253
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How will I behave. Right.

254
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.330
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Or if I don't, you know, without them. Who will

255
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Who will I

256
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Say that one more time.

257
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for reference.

258
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just congeal, but I didn't hear you. I just want you to really make it concise.

259
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.080
Um,

260
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.710
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: If I don't go back into the same

261
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.010
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Patterns that define my personality before who will I be without them.

262
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's give a little label to who you were before. What was your identity, kind of in a phrase or a term or

263
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.310
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I'm

264
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Like party guy fun guy, you know, I mean, like a little phrase some

265
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.390
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess I'm

266
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.690
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: extremely confident, I'm

267
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.710
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, about who I was.

268
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.640
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: A but also

269
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:22.290
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's hard to something just a phrase, but um but yeah I felt

270
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:26.640
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It.

271
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:35.400
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The best way I know of interacting with people was was was through partying.

272
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The best way you knew how to interact with people was to party or

273
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: As to overcome those I was

274
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.700
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: very shy. Enter personally and

275
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.820
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Having

276
00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: A layer of intoxication made it a lot easier to overcome that. So,

277
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the solution, right, the perceived challenge was, I'm shy.

278
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:09.720
Yeah.

279
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your belief about yourself around I'm shy.

280
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.820
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I'm

281
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.120
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: And I think that that's

282
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's part of

283
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.650
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Man, I

284
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with I'm shy.

285
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's part of who I am, because that's current today to right

286
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is the same.

287
00:33:53.250 --> 00:34:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to hold that I want you to hold and you decide because it can be effective, whether it's in the past, the present or the future if you think most of it is fret over, you know, a kiss can't seem to move forward and maybe maybe

288
00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Sending imagery into this worse picture you have about the future, like, oh, here I am shy. I'm in school. Hmm. And there it is. You can see yourself and that worst image you see yourself doing okay let me know when you've got that picture.

289
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hypothetical, but you're busy doing it all of us do we project first imagination is the future.

290
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you've got it in your head. You don't have to tell me, but it can are some stuff to you.

291
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.860
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah, I mean I guess it's just like

292
00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: What if I am not not able to find connections and make friends.

293
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:13.380
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Because it is always so easy in school before. So if I go back and it's not. I can't do it there. Where else could I do it.

294
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now I want you to pull up the image of more team be present with them.

295
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, Andrew.

296
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're nurturing figure

297
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Your grandpa. Can you bring that into your mind.

298
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Check and make sure that imagery is very present inside of you. See, see what changed when you made that awareness visceral as in, do you know how to toggle between I wasn't aware of it before. And boy, I noticed in my body as soon as I said, Oh, I have this within me.

299
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection nurturing switch wants your development and growth and wisdom.

300
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know it in your body when it's present when it's not there.

301
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you're picturing with your team, let me let me kind of hear more about that.

302
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.050
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well,

303
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.910
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess just kind of thinking of, you know, the

304
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:57.750
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Thinking about that three of those and kind of different, different lenses that

305
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.200
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That you know

306
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.760
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That

307
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.510
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: My, my grandma would, you know, be telling me that

308
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.470
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know that

309
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.330
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The connections were, you know,

310
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:37.230
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Based on on common interests and, you know,

311
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:47.280
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Doing, you know, being passionate about things that the you know intoxication was just kind of a

312
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:58.320
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: An easier way to uncover those things. But that's not really what matters when it, when it comes to connecting with people and

313
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.560
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: My grandfather would be telling me that

314
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.250
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It.

315
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.710
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The

316
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:25.500
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That it's it's okay to be shy. And the people who are really going to matter the most are gonna appreciate that about me as well and

317
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.820
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Protect the figure just kind of reminding me that

318
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Everything that I worry about and kind of that realm is, you know,

319
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.110
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Worst case scenario is

320
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:56.070
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I might be embarrassed if I did something that I

321
00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.760
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Thought was stupid or whatnot, but it

322
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:06.870
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: No one else has ever gonna, it's not really gonna ever matter how silly that myself.

323
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's really be present with that that notion of

324
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: grandma's wisdom. There she shared some some sage advice and grab up if you are yourself you know he'll be accepted that shyness.

325
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Turns out, which will notice is, you'll be around people that meet you there they meet you there. You get to find out for real. Who likes you. Your true temperament.

326
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're not something else. And there's no fool and nobody right. It's right there. It's if you yourself. Let's call it shy.

327
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: People around you and you'll notice. Well, if they stick around.

328
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: must work for them well enough.

329
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

330
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You might like you, you might like them.

331
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn very

332
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: pointedly to being present with all of them and you and they're all in the same space together interacting see their faces. See if anyone's close to each other. If there's

333
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:23.730
Anyone

334
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:25.830
You know,

335
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Touching hugging anything where there's laughter or smile or something. Just really get into the imagery with them. Okay.

336
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what I do an iteration on the

337
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Should be at the right speed. So hold that in your awareness, your team president with you, just that you may also kind of noticed the body to

338
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Can spray them together. Nice. Inhale.

339
00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

340
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go.

341
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What observations, do you have about what's going on right now.

342
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.390
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

343
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.380
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess.

344
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.640
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Kind of

345
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.660
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Tension and my chess.

346
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.590
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: stiffness in my arms.

347
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.780
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

348
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that. I want you to turn your attention there and see if your team can lean in and seek understanding and support to tension you decide whether it's in chest or stiffness in arms. See if they care, see if there's any

349
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Any support available there really be present with that.

350
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.110

Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I'm

353
00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.470
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Trying to

354
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.190
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess.

355
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.150
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It accepts you know the tension and

356
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:17.580
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Not

357
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.530
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Not fight it.

358
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:31.170
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: And then also thought of, you know, trying to think about, or the team would tell me is you know all what is, what does that mean it's it's it's not

359
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.010
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's your body trying to tell you something.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:37.980
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Let's

362
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that you present with that part right there. You just said setting tension not fighting it and asking, what does it what does it mean

363
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing together nice inhale.

Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

367
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.390
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess I'm

368
00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.400
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The

369
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.200
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Physical

370
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:21.930
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Presentation of thoughts that I'm trying to avoid or don't like having

371
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:23.910
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Or

372
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm avoiding some thoughts and it's presenting physically you'd be present with that.

376
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming up

377
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:47.130
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I was

378
00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:53.130
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Picture myself as

379
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.770
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Being so

380
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:11.040
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: So confident about who I was and the path that I was on in the past and tell myself I want to get back to that. But

381
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:13.380
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That

382
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.370
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Might not have been

383
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:21.930
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Real that might have than

384
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.660
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Me trying to

385
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:34.440
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Put on I guess a front for myself in a way. So that's not something I can ever get back to

386
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.660
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Because that wasn't

387
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:38.730
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Real

388
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.560
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: So then

389
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:42.780
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Where am I now.

390
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How about how about the belief about yourself, what's your belief about yourself right now, which is which is came up

391
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What's true. What do you believe about you.

392
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:03.870
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I

393
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.830
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Don't know exactly who I want to be.

394
00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Present.

395
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:19.170
With

396
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your team around. I'm not sure who I want to be.

397
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing

398
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection.

399
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend together nice inhale.

400
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

401
00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go.

402
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing.

403
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:26.400
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I'm

404
00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:35.070
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Lots of fidgeting as my my see

405
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:42.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That

406
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.920
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The team would tell me that

407
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:54.000
That

408
00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.730
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That that's

409
00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:03.270
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Okay, that, you know, you don't have to know

410
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:05.940
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Where you're going to

411
00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:12.210
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: To be, you know, to head in a direction and

412
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That intellectually, most people probably don't know exactly the annual is

413
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.250
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That

414
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:36.720
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: All you know be okay. No matter where I end up

415
00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.840
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: See myself going there.

416
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would be okay.

417
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that I will be okay.

418
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And your team present with you feeling that support.

419
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.710

Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

421
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.570
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess not exactly attention, but the

422
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:45.150
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: More like sinking feeling is kind of move back towards the stomach and I guess I feel like I'm sure that arguing back saying that, well, even if I'll be okay, you know, not knowing

423
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.330
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Where I need to go still

424
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.610
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: makes me nervous.

425
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel nervous, not knowing there's a sinking.

426
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling in the stomach.

427
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You turn your attention to your feet.

428
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, are they fidgeting right now.

429
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:13.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah.

430
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What did they want to do.

431
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.230
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I just want to kind of

432
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.120
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You

433
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.170
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Know, tapping moves back and forth.

434
00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: turn your attention to your stomach. It shifted, although there was feeling or calm. There was also it moved and went back to this sinking in the stomach.

435
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hold up.

436
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This projected worse image of the future. Can you bring it up into your awareness.

437
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And that stomach, you put those two together. Hold that got this sinking stomach.

438
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This worries some vision of the future.

439
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to

440
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold them the same time.

441
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to change this.

442
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple that awareness worst vision worse picture of that projected future event sinking stomach.

443
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This is gonna be a little faster.

444
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe in together.

445
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale it out, letting it go

446
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.530
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yes.

447
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:37.290
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's like

448
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.370
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: One of the worst.

449
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:47.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: possible futures. I guess that comes up for me now is

450
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:53.610
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, not having genuine connection with anybody.

451
00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:55.680
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: And

452
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.900
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I

453
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.130
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: always used to think that

454
00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.960
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That i i'd

455
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:22.530
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Be fine completely by myself, you know, as long as I was on the path that I really wanted to be on there are other people, they're not, it wouldn't matter. But now that just seems so

456
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.740
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Opposite of how I feel.

457
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your belief about yourself right now.

458
00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be an I am. See if you can grab it.

459
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.340
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Somebody who

460
00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.870
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Really does

461
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:05.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Want

462
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:11.580
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Connections with others. Okay.

463
00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in your team.

464
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring a present.

465
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: In the most genuine and honest way.

466
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And make sure you register if there's any part of you.

467
00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It signals something

468
00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Where these don't all align

469
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: My team.

470
00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Of protection nurturing and wisdom are present with you in the symmetry and the belief. I'm somebody

471
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Who really does want connection.

472
01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in your awareness.

473
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend together.

474
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And inhale and exhale it, letting it go

475
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you find yourself.

476
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.100
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess physically more

477
01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.910
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Like Tightness in my shoulders.

478
01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:40.860
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Not really fidgeting. Right now I'm

479
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.890
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Thinking, I guess about how

480
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.050
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Hey, yes, it's highly that

481
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:19.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yeah, acknowledging that about myself is

482
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.650
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It isn't

483
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.800
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It doesn't make me a weaker that's it's actually

484
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:35.190
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Something that

485
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:39.060
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That is

486
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.480
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Is making is gonna make me stronger.

487
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This is their belief I I am getting stronger.

488
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I am strong.

489
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Starting at those

490
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.500
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

491
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about you right now.

492
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:51.180
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Really trying to be honest with myself about how I feel.

493
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:53.340
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: And

494
01:03:59.220 --> 01:03:59.640
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That

495
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.550
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Is

496
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.950
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: More important than

497
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.710
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: How I want to project myself to the world.

498
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You are trying really trying to be honest about how you feel. And it's more important about how you project yourself to the world.

499
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.320
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well,

500
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.170
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's more important to

501
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:44.040
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Be honest with myself about how I feel about myself then

502
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.450
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: To tell myself that

503
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.750
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I

504
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:56.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: feel a certain way that is

505
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.480
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Based on how I want the world to see me.

506
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you say it one more time.

507
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.110
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um, it's, it's more

508
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:12.780
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Important

509
01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.200
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Instead of

510
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:23.850
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: telling myself that I feel a certain way because I want the world to see me a certain way.

511
01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:33.600
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's more important for me to be honest with myself about how I feel and

512
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.980
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Build the person that the world sees around that instead of the other way around.

513
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: From one to seven. How true is what you just said.

514
01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Seven being absolutely true.

515
01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:55.920
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

516
01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:19.110
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Do you think it's true I

517
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now how true is it that that exists right now, which was it that's real for you.

518
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Seven is absolutely true.

519
01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:32.910
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um, I guess.

520
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound uncertain to say, not quite.

521
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.250
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um, well, I guess I'm just

522
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.750
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The

523
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.970
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Scale of truth is having

524
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:52.860
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: But

525
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say this.

526
01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission to try my words on. Okay.

527
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's true that

528
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Being real about how I feel is more important than fronting it's true at a seven. It's absolutely true. Now if you can't say that and say your truth.

529
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working so hard, Isaac.

530
01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We worked so hard. I know words are coming too long before you other than, can't you give yourself permission to just say it without it being said perfectly

531
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.270
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Well, it's

532
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.680
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: It's true that

533
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.280
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: In this moment, I feel that

534
01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:59.040
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That's how I feel. I

535
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it.

536
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Not what I said it's not that bad. But you make a statement.

537
01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel

538
01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:09.690
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

539
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.310
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I it's true that I feel

540
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.640
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That it's more important.

541
01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.340
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: For

542
01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:22.980
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Me.

543
01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:38.010
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: To present myself to the world based on how I feel. Then base my feelings on how I want the world to see me.

544
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel right now. I mean, emotion word

545
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a combination of a couple

546
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:50.010
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess.

547
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.310
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Nervous, but

548
01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.550
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Happy and

549
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.830
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Yes, excited over

550
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's hold that and check in with your team watch their faces get a sense of their input around I feel nervous but happy and excited

551
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up that first image on that projected future

552
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's take a look.

553
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling and letting go.

554
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you noticing.

555
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.520
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess.

556
01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:39.690
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: So,

557
01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:52.290
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Some, some tightness in my chest.

558
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:54.090
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: But

559
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:56.820
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Not

560
01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:03.330
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Not as much discomfort as before. Okay.

561
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.060
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess.

562
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.120
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The thought that was telling me that

563
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:28.590
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: The only way to end up in that

564
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:33.390
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Worst case scenario future is if I

565
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:35.250
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Am

566
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:40.590
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Dishonest with myself about how I feel.

567
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we're going to do a little closure here.

568
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: share a little bit about what this today was like for you. What was important for you.

569
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.000
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Um,

570
01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:15.840
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: I guess it was

571
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.790
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Important to recognize that

572
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.220
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That maybe

573
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:41.190
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: This ideal of who I had of who I was in the past.

574
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.930
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Maybe wasn't so ideal and

575
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.930
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: That

576
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.630
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Maybe wasn't as genuine as I thought it was

577
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice that you felt happy, right. Earlier you had some nervousness and excitement about the future, right, or at least you noticed it in the moment.

578
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So as leave today I'd like to invite you to register this are

579
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Our stomach that turning that stuff that goes on, it can get

580
01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Activated or can feel the same being excited and nervous. There's no way break. That's the same kind of activation

581
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just instead maybe interpreting it as important. Something important and attuning to the gun maybe saying this, and this might be an exploration. This week is to say

582
01:13:53.550 --> 01:14:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I noticed my stomach turned or maybe it'll be a chest or it'll be somewhere and check in and see if something important is going on about where you meet

583
01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Other people, meaning how is there an inner personal thing about to happen is they're worried about an interpersonal interaction.

584
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Either projected made up in your mind or it really happened or about to walk and they're about to interact with someone, or I kind of like this person, so pay close attention to see where your body says something importance, about to happen in her personally

585
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And listen to it and then right after that, see if you can apply the

586
01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be excited

587
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I might have an impulse to do something, meaning lean toward

588
01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Because fear says I'm nervous says backup excitement. Curiosity is a leaning forward.

589
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just see if we can play this idea of changing the meaning a bit

590
01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body and you've been doing that. I can hear that through that text when I check in with you. Right. There's a lot more awareness.

591
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's see if we call it excitement and and value it not something to be aversive right and is something in a personal going on. And maybe I can apply this idea of

592
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Something important is happening.

593
01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is it happening.

594
01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it happening right now with this person is it about the past, is it about the future. What was the trigger just now what am I environment just got that going when you consider that

595
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:34.590
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Alright.

596
01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.240
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: Cool.

597
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's anything left over with charge anything negative, feel free to put it in the container, send it down the river, put some distance between whatever feels good for you and hold on to the stuff that's exciting and happy. Keep those near

598
01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, want to continue doing what we're doing, meet and same time on Wednesday.

599
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.040
Isaac Sullivan-Leshin: You know, good.

600
01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will see you then. And of course in group. If you decide to go

601
01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye.

602
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.200
Bye.

603
01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning. Oh.

604
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, good morning. All right.

605
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: nice sunny day over there. I see behind you or above you.

606
01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your emotions.

607
01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:39.570
Nick Graham: Have been

608
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:43.590
Nick Graham: stable enough pretty stable.

609
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:51.900
Nick Graham: I don't think any know

610
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think I was life without that

611
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Without that going that dark. I think

612
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.350
Nick Graham: I think, yeah, I think it's still like a little doll, but it's better than wanting to kill myself.

613
01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So life is a little doll, but it's better than wanting to kill myself.

614
01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:12.240
Nick Graham: Yeah, okay.

615
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What down any more processing from right you can tell I have a very strong belief around this notion of shame or you probably registered like it's one of these things that I feel very strongly about is at the core of addictive or compulsive behavior.

616
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you process any further. After that, or

617
01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:41.430
Nick Graham: I was trying to like search

618
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:47.250
Nick Graham: What I think surrounding like those two and

619
01:17:50.640 --> 01:18:02.550
Nick Graham: I don't know. I think like I couldn't really come up with much. I don't know if it would need to like prompt a little bit more, I think, a little more into it as like pretty pretty busy almost all day after that, but

620
01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.300
Nick Graham: I think that

621
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.680
Nick Graham: I was just kind of thinking about how we were talking last week and how most of it probably stems from like

622
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:16.080
Nick Graham: Self like

623
01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:18.600
Nick Graham: Self.

624
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:20.550
Nick Graham: I don't know, like

625
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:24.690
Nick Graham: Patriot herself, you know, whatever the word would be

626
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:26.700
Nick Graham: Like

627
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.140
Nick Graham: low confidence.

628
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:34.800
Nick Graham: Yeah, and I got a pretty like in depth discussion with my stepmother with him, I was like fighting before

629
01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:36.900
Nick Graham: About that yesterday.

630
01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.590
Nick Graham: But how they do some stuff that my mom did. I don't know.

631
01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me ask you, can we start to

632
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Move towards preparation, you know, as we're in this phase of sort of preparing resources because I do want to do some some EMT er with you.

633
01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can get her station and maybe some some integration of some positive conditions.

634
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And can you tell me, were you in group without pre probably weren't but sometimes the transcription. They don't drop in things that I have finished it doesn't follow me. So I just want to check

635
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you and I, at some point, develop the three figures, the protective figure the nurturing figure in the wise, so you're. Do we do that yet.

636
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:33.450
Nick Graham: No, I don't think so. Okay.

637
01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do that right now. So once you to picture.

638
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's sometimes it's helpful to actually picture an uncomfortable kind of distressing events, not, not just picture you know 5060 of distress not not over the top, but sort of being present with

639
01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't

640
01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: A negative thought memory.

641
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to

642
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of a figure that has the quality and bodies, the quality of protection protectiveness

643
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can be real or imagined. What's the first few things that come to mind me a morphosis of different things. So I just don't don't edit.

644
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:30.510
Nick Graham: So I guess I'm like a little bit unclear. So you said. Think of like a 50 to 60 and then think of a protective

645
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.130
Nick Graham: Figure so in relation to that event for

646
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I only wanted a little bit of distress to be present. You don't have to go into the story of the event.

647
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:42.870
Yeah.

648
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: More interested in the real or imagined.

649
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, amen and quality of protective savior.

650
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:53.610
Nick Graham: See who can find it.

651
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:59.700
Nick Graham: I like my like my grandfather, who's like since passed yet he probably comes to mind.

652
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it about it really has that quality grandfather what see

653
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:10.590
Nick Graham: The picture. I don't know. He just like like despite all of his like moral flowers, he kind of

654
01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:13.920
Nick Graham: And I, for one, he owned a bunch of guns. So that would

655
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.430
Nick Graham: Be one, but he just kind of had like a

656
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:22.590
Nick Graham: Like a solid dependable.

657
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:31.110
Nick Graham: Kind of like personality like he was, he would always be there. Like if someone needed him.

658
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, got it. Anyone else come to mind when you think of protective figure quality.

659
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.640
Nick Graham: Now, I don't

660
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's

661
01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:40.740
Really

662
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.030
Nick Graham: Really

663
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, Grandfather solid in dependable personality always there. If you needed him. He happened to own a bunch of guns.

664
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:53.610
Nick Graham: Okay.

665
01:21:54.540 --> 01:22:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now move to this notion of the quality in a figure real or imagined that is a nurturing figure someone that

666
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: embodies encouraging your growth and development in May, or not, including an affection, but the nurturing of

667
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You

668
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.220
Nick Graham: Yeah, I would probably think like

669
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.780
Nick Graham: I don't know, like a like a

670
01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:31.740
Nick Graham: Like a mother holding a baby.

671
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.680
Nick Graham: In terms of

672
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:45.990
Nick Graham: Like any more detail, I don't know, like I'm trying to think of a nurturing figure

673
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Scam books and

674
01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Stand philosophy and spirituality and

675
01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Scan imagery from movies or conversations, something that you're like huh

676
01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That really seems nurturing

677
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:16.560
Nick Graham: I don't know, probably

678
01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.020
Nick Graham: Like Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

679
01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.000
Nick Graham: Pretty nurturing

680
01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:25.680
Nick Graham: Nurturing

681
01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You people have mentioned this one.

682
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone said Gandalf the Grey. Is that a thing.

683
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:36.450
Yeah.

684
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:45.630
Nick Graham: Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, he's definitely niche like a nurturing figure that's cool. Okay. Gandalf. Got it.

685
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I mentioned that only because in case you were doubting your figure that comes up, just to let you know that

686
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.310
Nick Graham: Yeah, I totally and utterly doubted it. But yeah.

687
01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to normalize it for you. Okay.

688
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That grandfather solid is dependable right there's predictability there and that feels protective and then we have Gandalf and then I want you to picture the quality of allies figure

689
01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:00.720
Nick Graham: I don't know. All I can think is like

690
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.810
Nick Graham: Maybe like the biblical depiction of God.

691
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So now patient them all together.

692
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they're in a space somehow together.

693
01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:30.510
This predictable personality.

694
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.970
Always there if you needed him and your grandfather

695
01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And Gandalf in this sense of a mother holding a baby, it's holding that all in the same space, allowing your imagination to see these interactions with these qualities. These seniors.

696
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: As well as God

697
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:05.400
Nick Graham: I think you know i think i would like to, to change the God when I can. Because I can't even I can't even picture that like in any

698
01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:07.950
Nick Graham: Way I would I would more think like

699
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.260
Nick Graham: Like the spirit of like

700
01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:12.720
Nick Graham: I don't know, like, like a

701
01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.220
Nick Graham: Like a spirit of like a mountain or

702
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.000
Nick Graham: Like a forest. I think that would probably be a

703
01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:23.190
Nick Graham: Lot better. Yeah.

704
01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice there was something in congruent and you corrected it

705
01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good really smart, we need it to be useful saleable

706
01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:35.220
Nick Graham: As a result,

707
01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can now see these interactions, work hard at this imagery see grandfather in his predictable dependable solid personality.

708
01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And Gandalf

709
01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And a spirit of mountain and forest.

710
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of have that

711
01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And no pieces of it. Or like, you know, rejected or anything. Okay.

712
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll probably be coming back to this and I might call it your team. I might be talking about this sort of this group of these these qualities, being a team a resource team for you.

713
01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to do another

714
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagery and has to do with a distancing metaphor. This is the one where you could picture. I'll just give you examples. So you can do your own or let's say you and I are working in session and

715
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Something intense comes up and you want to get a little bit of distance from it.

716
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You could picture standing maybe on the shore of a river bank. Right on. Right. And you're with your team, sort of, surrounded by protection nurturing and wisdom.

717
01:27:59.550 --> 01:28:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you send that imagery of, maybe, you know, uncertainty or disappointment or heartache or

718
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Unfair whatever you send it down a log and it's moving further and further away. So that would be a distancing metaphor, being able to picture that some people have said it's a train.

719
01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's moving down the tracks slowly moving away. You can picture, you know, sort of that sound as it moves away and down the tracks and you build a set of spaceship. That's treading out

720
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Farther and farther away very fast.

721
01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone's mentioned a shooting star.

722
01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: For you and you think of an imagery. A distancing metaphor, what

723
01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:52.230
What do you think of

724
01:28:55.830 --> 01:29:01.590
Nick Graham: Really think of like a tram like going like a, you know, like a mountain tram like going down.

725
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.240
Going down

726
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.430
Nick Graham: Yeah, like some put it in there and it's just sending it down the hill to the base.

727
01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now in the space that you're in right now says you're in your car.

728
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Challenging, but it doesn't mean we can't do it. Do you happen to have

729
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: For people today that I've been able to have some preparation. I've asked them to bring little a little bits of tape or something that they

730
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Some little objects that could be put on the dashboard, something that sits up that way.

731
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But the half away. I don't know what the things are as long as they're kind of right at your eye level.

732
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.560
Nick Graham: Real quick.

733
01:30:10.890 --> 01:30:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can happen today, and I'll just

734
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:15.600
Nick Graham: Something I can make it happen.

735
01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do a little

736
01:33:04.410 --> 01:33:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Technical like checking. I want to see how your eyes move when I share my screen with my blue light. There's not tonight.

737
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I mental stimulation

738
01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

739
01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I don't want the eyes to strain. I do want them moving left and right. So we get that

740
01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Cross hemisphere stuff going on. So,

741
01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.420
See

742
01:33:44.190 --> 01:33:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: No that's not it may stop, stop. One more time.

743
01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Here share

744
01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Your items are about half apart.

745
01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:04.380
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. Yes, I would say that they are okay.

746
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So you

747
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: might end up needing to sit back, I don't know where to find out I'm gonna be able to watch your eyes here.

748
01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. So again, we don't want all the way left all the way right we want this movement BACK AND FORTH YOUR EYES OF look much like this you can see me.

749
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But not all the way right. We don't want it hold away strange. Okay, so here we go let's let's see how we do here, and I'll keep an eye on you.

750
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, want to move the head. We just want the eyes.

751
01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can barely see your eyes moving left and right. So it's interesting you see them going left and right. You feel and going left and right. I think

752
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I should be able to

753
01:34:57.090 --> 01:35:02.070
Nick Graham: Well, I mean, because like my screen is small. So, this is only like this, much like movement so

754
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:03.240
Nick Graham: I can look

755
01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:05.250
Nick Graham: So I can look at my object, the

756
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:06.720
Nick Graham: Object.

757
01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I made a mistake. I'm so sorry.

758
01:35:11.610 --> 01:35:12.630
Nick Graham: Probably more noticeable.

759
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Ya know, the like. That's why you have the objects know you're going to actually all be all be pointing to the corners of your yup here and that's great. So you'll basically. So now let me see you. He'll be looking

760
01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To the different objects that you've set up and you'll just go at my pace with my fingers.

761
01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to watch my fingers just go back and forth. Maybe at it. You know what I mean. Kind of peripherally know the peak the pace. I won't change it in the middle. Once you get a feel for it and just kind of kind of go left and right.

762
01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To those objects. Does that make sense.

763
01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:58.800
Nick Graham: It does.

764
01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it straining your eyes are you to close. Do you need to sit back, do you need to

765
01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:03.840
Nick Graham: Kind of

766
01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Go since. Okay.

767
01:36:05.730 --> 01:36:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do that,

768
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:06.990
Nick Graham: You should

769
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull back a couple inches.

770
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to make sure I strain that because we'll be doing quite a few iterations. Okay.

771
01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:15.240
Nick Graham: Okay.

772
01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, I will sometimes have since it's my hand, it's really easy. I don't have to have technology.

773
01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: When there. There'll be times when I go slower and other times, a little faster. Okay, but I won't be switching it up. Typically, right in the middle.

774
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm put this puppy away. So let's do this.

775
01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When you

776
01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about your, you know, maybe why why you're pursuing this part. Why, why the therapy, what you're hoping to gain from it. Like what's your primary concern in your life.

777
01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.740
Nick Graham: In regards to the therapy.

778
01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.880
Nick Graham: The primary concern is being able to pay for it.

779
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:05.550
Nick Graham: Like that's

780
01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:06.240
Nick Graham: Like the

781
01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:07.560
Nick Graham: Absolute Truth.

782
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.090
Nick Graham: Surrounding it is being able to pay for it.

783
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.030
Nick Graham: If you're talking in terms of like

784
01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:18.300
Nick Graham: Something else I mean obviously like

785
01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.360
Nick Graham: The concern is like

786
01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:37.500
Nick Graham: What I ultimately like dwindled down to nothing like having no medication. Like, how will that be kind of thing, like that's like my big concern. Like, I mean, obviously I know it'll be okay but

787
01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So how will, how will I be on no Suboxone eventually

788
01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe you will be

789
01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:57.570
Nick Graham: I believe it's going to be fine. And I'm going to be like back to normal. But getting there is like

790
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:05.550
Nick Graham: You know, going to probably be not like super easy. I don't know. Maybe it will. I'm not sure.

791
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So is that what preoccupies your mind, most of the time.

792
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.380
Nick Graham: No, it's really, it's mostly like

793
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:26.130
Nick Graham: How can I pay for coverage that's truly what mostly preoccupies my mind is will I be able to go to this next appointment. How will I do this, how would I do that and pay my rent.

794
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:32.670
Nick Graham: That's what mostly preoccupies my mind in regards to this treatment. Okay.

795
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me take let me take a look at your treatment plan because that's I'm surprised at what you're saying. So let me just take a look in here.

796
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:41.670
Nick Graham: I mean, you know, I mean,

797
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:56.190
Nick Graham: When you think about it like it's not even a lot like it's only. I mean, I guess with group. It's like 350 it's only like I mean I guess it's like 375 a month, which is like, you know, sister, and

798
01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So you would identify early on.

799
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, which is consistent with what you said, I want to get off of Suboxone that was a goal you identified when you came in.

800
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And also identified more connections with people going through the same thing.

801
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you also said, I'd like to be out in nature more often.

802
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

803
01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.150
You see if there's any more down below here.

804
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any other goals because sometimes we talk about depression. We talked about this negative appraisal of yourself. We have this, you know,

805
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.290
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah i mean

806
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Personal upheaval and that's really what I'm trying to get I'm trying to say.

807
01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you concerned about you. Oh.

808
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:51.480
Nick Graham: Are you talking about like in relation to viewing the treatment like viewing the

809
01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:58.410
Nick Graham: Treatment. Okay. So yeah, I missed, I missed you know took that so um

810
01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:07.980
Nick Graham: Well, like certain things like the end to come up like that. I don't know where things before I started treatment. You know, so

811
01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.120
Nick Graham: I would presume that goals would in should change.

812
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.900
Nick Graham: Anyways, but that was like the thing I was thinking about most recently was like what you said is like

813
01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:23.160
Nick Graham: Why do I always hate myself like

814
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:30.060
Nick Graham: That's that's like probably a pretty good goal to, you know, find a little bit of

815
01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:32.520
Nick Graham: Self love in there. Yeah.

816
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so with that. So hold on to.

817
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds. I mean, if that's a very core powerful thing. You just said. So let's just sit with that for a second.

818
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you to think about

819
01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is the most intense or earliest recollection of I hate myself.

820
01:40:56.850 --> 01:41:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Like track back and Bridget back if you can, to the earliest age.

821
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:04.320
Nick Graham: Probably

822
01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:09.000
Nick Graham: Let me think.

823
01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.140
Nick Graham: I think I did an hour I

824
01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:14.820
Nick Graham: Think

825
01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:20.040
Nick Graham: Like I hated myself, but I remember like feeling like

826
01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.870
Nick Graham: Hated probably as early as like

827
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:27.000
Nick Graham: Five.

828
01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.540
Nick Graham: Five years old. Yeah.

829
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:34.260
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah

830
01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.140
Nick Graham: So,

831
01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:47.370
Nick Graham: Basically, like my parents split up when I was like three or four, and it was like really messy situation and like

832
01:41:48.690 --> 01:41:53.370
Nick Graham: I remember like we were camping out in my front yard at my mom's house and she was like

833
01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:56.130
Nick Graham: saying stuff like

834
01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.990
Nick Graham: Yeah, your, your father left you and he hates you.

835
01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:28.500
Nick Graham: Yeah, and for like a kid like this. I'm like,

836
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:33.360
Nick Graham: Kind of looked up. So yes, so I remember

837
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:39.060
Nick Graham: We're like, like in the in this tent and we're like, she like

838
01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:46.440
Nick Graham: Like in reference to

839
01:42:52.650 --> 01:42:56.490
Nick Graham: Yeah, I was like, I'm in reference to my step mom at the time she was like

840
01:42:57.630 --> 01:43:01.500
Nick Graham: What's your name, and like me and my brother were like cockroach like she made us like

841
01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.280
Nick Graham: You know, like, say, some like

842
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:10.980
Nick Graham: Some like kind of hateful things about

843
01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:16.620
Nick Graham: I think like she was not not quite my step mom at the time.

844
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:20.610
Nick Graham: In so yeah I remember like feeling like

845
01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.220
Nick Graham: Like hated and like a trade at that time.

846
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling right now what emotion.

847
01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:45.330
Nick Graham: Well, I don't know, like, I'm just like, recently, like registering like

848
01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.250
Nick Graham: I would say, like, if I had to say it.

849
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:59.760
Nick Graham: Probably hurts.

850
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:03.780
Nick Graham: Maybe stemming from betrayal.

851
01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: look sad. Is there any of that there

852
01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.660
Nick Graham: Oh yeah, yeah, definitely like

853
01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:17.070
Nick Graham: I think that all like I kind of like rationalize that like

854
01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:23.040
Nick Graham: Sadness like stems from hurt generally

855
01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:28.650
Nick Graham: So yeah, I mean, it's like, I don't like to think like

856
01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:32.910
Nick Graham: I really like just started thinking about that, actually.

857
01:44:34.290 --> 01:44:35.280
Nick Graham: It's like pretty new.

858
01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Raw and fresh and tender. Let me see.

859
01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. I got you, from zero to 100 what level of distress to you. And right now.

860
01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.860
Nick Graham: That would be like probably like

861
01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:57.120
Nick Graham: Maybe, yeah.

862
01:44:57.570 --> 01:45:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me how Where's where's this landing in your body.

863
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.050
Nick Graham: To a scale like like yeah, like the chest, for sure. Like,

864
01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.880
Nick Graham: Like super, super tightness and I would say

865
01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to do.

866
01:45:24.150 --> 01:45:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of imagery and this stimulation, the bilateral is going to be slow right now. Nick, I want you to pull up the presence

867
01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Of quality right in this these figures.

868
01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Of wisdom.

869
01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Spirit embodied in the quality of mountain

870
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And forest.

871
01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You present with that perfect quality.

872
01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Of spirit.

873
01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Sometimes we'll get sounds and they'll be distractions. Just bring yourself back

874
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to bring the presence of Gandalf and a mother holding a baby, if that works. You want me to continue to mention the mother holding the

875
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Time. Okay, so we got wisdom nurturing

907
01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.210
Nick Graham: The tightness has like

908
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:28.710
Nick Graham: Mostly subsided, but still exists, like a close to like distro nearly

909
01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 there. It kind of moved, maybe even up into their to be very that not turning away from it but attending to it and acknowledging the wisdom of self healing and communication.

910
01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a message there and I want you pull in that imagery, the quality of those figures.

911
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:53.430
Nick Graham: Yeah, I would say that

912
01:49:56.490 --> 01:49:58.230
Nick Graham: Like the moment that

913
01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.840
Nick Graham: When I was like thinking about it.

914
01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.480
Nick Graham: It was almost like

915
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:06.690
Nick Graham: I was like,

916
01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.280
Nick Graham: In wilderness, like in the mountains and there was like

917
01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:16.800
Nick Graham: Almost like a

918
01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:20.070
Nick Graham: Like a mother and baby but not like

919
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:23.130
Nick Graham: Not like a

920
01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:26.460
Nick Graham: Shopping like soccer mom. It was like a

921
01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.760
Nick Graham: Like a mother from

922
01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:35.940
Nick Graham: Like early man, almost like there's like a naked mother and like a naked baby like in the forest.

923
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:37.110
Nick Graham: And I was like,

924
01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.160
Nick Graham: Yeah, like really primitive and I was like,

925
01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.860
Nick Graham: In the forest.

926
01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.810
Nick Graham: Like becoming like one with

927
01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:54.690
Nick Graham: With like that spirit and like just I watched like a flash, like a

928
01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:59.430
Nick Graham: Almost like a slight like a fast moving slideshow of like

929
01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:10.320
Nick Graham: Like thousands, hundreds of thousands of years of like life events that were just like passing. And one of the snapshots was like

930
01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:18.240
Nick Graham: Like one of the reflective moments that I had. And it just passed on, with all the rest.

931
01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a snapshot and it's in the past. I want you to go with that. Okay. And watch my finger bring up your, your nurturing team now.

932
01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Also

933
01:51:30.090 --> 01:51:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: With that flash

934
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:34.950
But it's past

935
01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together a steep diaphragm Matic, bring it down into the bottom of your lungs. Okay.

936
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure it goes deep in there pushing that diaphragm down, and then exhale

937
01:52:16.170 --> 01:52:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow all that arrow letting it go

938
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:29.700
When do you finding

939
01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:36.450
Nick Graham: I'm definitely I'm

940
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:41.760
Nick Graham: Finding

941
01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.100
Nick Graham: Like relaxation and like

942
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:49.710
Nick Graham: In relation to like trying to think of like the nurturing figure

943
01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:52.560
Nick Graham: Is almost like

944
01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:56.100
Nick Graham: I was like, being like

945
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:03.120
Nick Graham: Embraced like into this like

946
01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:08.940
Nick Graham: Nurturing figures like wisdom or whatever that word. I've never, you'd probably use that word.

947
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:11.850
Nick Graham: I presume that's the word I'm looking for.

948
01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:13.290
Nick Graham: Yeah.

949
01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:16.590
And

950
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:20.640
Nick Graham: To kind of like

951
01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:26.520
Nick Graham: Most of the feelings are like like subsided, like the

952
01:53:28.050 --> 01:53:29.820
Nick Graham: stress responses and things like that.

953
01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you check on your throat and other parts they communicate with you.

954
01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:43.740
Nick Graham: Yeah.

955
01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:50.970
Nick Graham: And it just seems like it keeps like moving up so it was like down in the like base of my third now it's kind of like

956
01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:56.550
Nick Graham: Smaller but moving up almost like the base of my like skull.

957
01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep working. Let's go with that. And why should pull up you know it takes effort really imagine

958
01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagining being surrounded, just as you were with all of the qualities protection nurturing and wisdom. And as that.

959
01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Activation in charge moves up to the base of your skull.

960
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you have that in your mind's eye open your eyes. And we'll do another iteration.

961
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're ready just open your eyes.

962
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:51.600
Nice and slow.

963
01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together nice deep breath.

964
01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.880
Nick Graham: I just kind of like pictured

965
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:00.060
Nick Graham: Like a dark

966
01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:06.570
Nick Graham: Really like it dusk like forest like

967
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:10.770
Nick Graham: Liquids like Twilight and like a fire burning and

968
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:20.640
Nick Graham: The only figure that I was there was still like that.

969
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.860
Nick Graham: Like the nurturing figure

970
01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:25.650
Yeah.

971
01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What to stress level are you at from zero to 100

972
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:36.510
Nick Graham: Really close to, like,

973
01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:43.980
Nick Graham: Maybe like 10

974
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a harder one to get out. So just try not to edit it.

975
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your belief about yourself right now.

976
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:01.710
Nick Graham: Probably that I'm flawed.

977
01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that from one to 1010 being I'm absolutely I am flood and it's absolutely true.

978
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And one is man that's not really true.

979
01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:28.560
Nick Graham: Probably like

980
01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:30.990
Nick Graham: Four or five

981
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to be thinking right now about yourself.

982
01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:47.010
Nick Graham: Um,

983
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:49.080
Nick Graham: I probably like to

984
01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:50.760
Nick Graham: Feel like

985
01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:54.690
Nick Graham: Like I

986
01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:58.410
Nick Graham: Like I'm accomplished like I've arrived.

987
01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I have arrived. Yeah.

988
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it different scale one to seven seven being I have arrived. That's absolutely true. And one now.

989
01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:17.580
Nick Graham: Um,

990
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:23.430
Nick Graham: I would say, I'm on the way. So,

991
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.960
Nick Graham: Maybe another I get for

992
01:58:36.630 --> 01:58:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little, a little faster pace. This time working with the working memory of this worst image that you had earlier.

993
01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to pull up

994
01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm flawed.

995
01:58:53.730 --> 01:58:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative cognition.

996
01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You gather in your mind's eye that negative image he had right that camping perhaps I'm flawed and a little faster left and right here watching my thinkers

997
01:59:36.090 --> 01:59:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

998
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Breath into the bottom of that long and

999
01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: should all go

1000
01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you observe in the self.

1001
01:59:58.410 --> 01:59:59.070
Nick Graham: I was kind of like

1002
02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:01.860
Nick Graham: Big room at the exchange and

1003
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:08.100
Nick Graham: The weird memory of that experience and I don't

1004
02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:13.290
Nick Graham: Even think registered was, I was just like, it was like, um,

1005
02:00:14.490 --> 02:00:16.260
Nick Graham: I was like, outside of the tent like

1006
02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:21.840
Nick Graham: Like viewing it like like

1007
02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.960
Nick Graham: 10s closed up just like hearing like

1008
02:00:26.850 --> 02:00:28.200
Nick Graham: The words that were being said

1009
02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.510
Nick Graham: And I was like outside, they're

1010
02:00:31.650 --> 02:00:32.610
Nick Graham: Just like listening.

1011
02:00:35.250 --> 02:00:36.000
Nick Graham: Listening to it.

1012
02:00:38.010 --> 02:00:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there more distance from it.

1013
02:00:44.250 --> 02:00:44.610
Nick Graham: Close.

1014
02:00:47.850 --> 02:00:49.170
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think it's, it's still

1015
02:00:52.530 --> 02:00:54.420
Nick Graham: It's still closed, but I can't help it, like

1016
02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:01.530
Nick Graham: Feel like the the

1017
02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:05.520
Nick Graham: Kids in the tent were just like kids, you know,

1018
02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:08.460
Nick Graham: Just like doing like they're

1019
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:12.540
Nick Graham: Told to do like saying what they're told to saying like

1020
02:01:14.370 --> 02:01:20.190
Nick Graham: Feeling like rebellious because this is the first time they've ever been allowed to say something mean about somebody like

1021
02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:24.330
Nick Graham: Like, I'm a lot like I remember we were saying like

1022
02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.580
Nick Graham: She's a bitch.

1023
02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:27.960
And

1024
02:01:29.190 --> 02:01:36.390
Nick Graham: It was like okay like curse words we're not okay insults. We're not okay. But when it came to

1025
02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:39.660
Nick Graham: This situation all of the

1026
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:46.050
Nick Graham: You know, frustrations were were led out and then I look at

1027
02:01:50.730 --> 02:01:54.480
Nick Graham: The person guiding this the adult guiding this

1028
02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:55.890
Nick Graham: And

1029
02:01:58.050 --> 02:01:59.370
Nick Graham: More than anything to see like

1030
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:05.880
Nick Graham: A hurt scared person similar in age to myself.

1031
02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

1032
02:02:11.070 --> 02:02:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I am hurt and scared. She is hurting scared.

1033
02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go with that picture of this is the desensitization part and this will be our last iteration. So once you pull that worst image that picture.

1034
02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm hurt and scared.

1035
02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at this left and right.

1036
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend together.

1037
02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gently connect with comes what comes up for you.

1038
02:03:49.290 --> 02:03:50.370
Nick Graham: Probably that

1039
02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:56.610
Nick Graham: I don't like

1040
02:04:02.970 --> 02:04:03.960
Nick Graham: Those things to happen.

1041
02:04:06.150 --> 02:04:07.680
Nick Graham: I understand that they happen.

1042
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: There's understanding

1043
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:16.440
Nick Graham: Yeah, there's understanding

1044
02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we've got a little bit of time I'd like you to pull up your team, the qualities, especially

1045
02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: spiritual connection.

1046
02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That primal peace, whatever that imagery of of nurturing says

1047
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in protection to

1048
02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The wisdom.

1049
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing into your awareness.

1050
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That it saturates you surround you.

1051
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you're one with it and immersion.

1052
02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And integration.

1053
02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the presence of that or image.

1054
02:05:11.190 --> 02:05:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look left and right. When you're ready, open your eyes, hold that in your working awareness and memory.

1055
02:05:18.690 --> 02:05:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This

1056
02:05:57.090 --> 02:05:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's read them together. Nice.

1057
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: medico

1058
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you finding

1059
02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:27.210
Nick Graham: This event, among other events are like

1060
02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:43.290
Nick Graham: And I see them all as like almost like like blood cells and they're in like this vast network of like different cells like not in a linear way but like cells here and here and here and here, like running through veins.

1061
02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

1062
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:49.320
Nick Graham: Almost like every event like this event, specifically is just another

1063
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.020
Nick Graham: red blood cell just coursing through this vast

1064
02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:57.390
Nick Graham: System and network of

1065
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.020
Nick Graham: Names and

1066
02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:02.820
Nick Graham: I don't like like

1067
02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:09.960
Nick Graham: That was really the only like metaphor I can think of. I just picture like just everything is just like liquid, just like blowing

1068
02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Their function to get a sense

1069
02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:17.700
Nick Graham: I think this sense is that like

1070
02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:28.530
Nick Graham: At this time, I don't really see much of a function. It's just exists and it just flows and passes by, and

1071
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.050
Nick Graham: moves along and

1072
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:36.390
Nick Graham: Just like put down the river. You know, like

1073
02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The passes.

1074
02:07:43.650 --> 02:07:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: scan your body and see what charge is left

1075
02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So self cells.

1076
02:07:51.690 --> 02:07:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Among others pass by.

1077
02:07:54.570 --> 02:07:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Still there.

1078
02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Are passed by.

1079
02:08:02.670 --> 02:08:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: They exist.

1080
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Move along.

1081
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever charges left

1082
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do that distancing metaphor and give it a chance to

1083
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of distance between you and yet whatever comes up for you. Whatever is appealing.

1084
02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: down the river, perhaps, or something like that.

1085
02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the town.

1086
02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to the base, if that one still works.

1087
02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that enough that that tramp stops at the base. Is there any sense of maybe wanting it further away.

1088
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:06.360
Nick Graham: I think it's all right. I think

1089
02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:09.150
Nick Graham: It has a right to exist.

1090
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it happened, maybe

1091
02:09:13.110 --> 02:09:14.250
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean,

1092
02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: To coexist with you.

1093
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:23.190
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think that's

1094
02:09:24.630 --> 02:09:25.470
Nick Graham: That's the dream.

1095
02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, tell me what's left now like checking with your

1096
02:09:39.090 --> 02:09:39.690
Cleaning

1097
02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:52.320
Nick Graham: Yeah, just like fleeting like moments of, you know, and somebody comes up and you know when you're first like start to feel sad and you get like a burning in your maybe your nose or your that'll come up like here in the air, but

1098
02:09:56.310 --> 02:10:00.690
Nick Graham: I would like to live in a world where I can just, you know, and it feels like maybe we're close but

1099
02:10:02.850 --> 02:10:04.590
Nick Graham: Where it's okay that that exists.

1100
02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1101
02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're beginning. So notice as we come to the end of the session

1102
02:10:10.890 --> 02:10:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You identified the call it would be nice if I could coexist with this. I could

1103
02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Have some maybe some distance with it too. And we're kind of on to something.

1104
02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we doing some meaningful work. Are we getting at important things that still have charged left in you.

1105
02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:36.630
Nick Graham: Yeah, totally. Okay.

1106
02:10:37.110 --> 02:10:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're doing some meaningful work.

1107
02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I want to do is say that these this distancing metaphor is not to be taken lightly. Like, make sure you do it.

1108
02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: In preservation of your peace throughout the day that you don't have to go at it consciously, the way I've asked you to pull it up in your memory.

1109
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be either in a container or sent down the tram because you and I in a in a safe way. And to the degree that you're comfortable will come back here if you want to. And we can work with it. Again, you don't have to put energy into processing it throughout the day.

1110
02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:21.120
You can do it together.

1111
02:11:25.710 --> 02:11:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see that I hadn't set up a container for you so that word probably sounded confusing just now. So for some people, what we do is

1112
02:11:34.410 --> 02:11:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would like to do that with you at some point soon is and you can do it. Now if you want to. If right away. You got an image of it. If this whatever's left over.

1113
02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever emotion or something. Maybe on that negative census is you can put it in a container. It's emotional container.

1114
02:11:52.200 --> 02:12:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And the instruction is that it'd be big enough and strong enough and welcoming enough or secure enough that that stuff will stay in there until you're ready to take it out.

1115
02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And of course, it sounds like what it is. It's compartmentalizing it's putting it in there, but we use the imagery to say, you know, either doesn't want to stay in there. What's comfy about it in that space, or is there a locking system that you have control over keeping it there.

1116
02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To what comes up for you and I'll make a little note about what comes up for your container.

1117
02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:28.740
Nick Graham: I think it's like a

1118
02:12:31.650 --> 02:12:34.740
Nick Graham: Like a metal barrel like

1119
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:38.820
Nick Graham: One of them that you like burn things in kind of

1120
02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:46.170
Nick Graham: And Rich closed up and sealed off like a metal band around it.

1121
02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it.

1122
02:12:51.210 --> 02:12:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for now. How will you if you want to access that stuff again. Do you have the ability to get to it again.

1123
02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:01.620
Nick Graham: Yeah, I do.

1124
02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe picturing putting whatever's coming up for you. Whatever charge and emotion and thought memory.

1125
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's put it in this container this metal barrel and really picture putting that metal band around it and get a sense of whether that stuff's going to stay there until you're ready to look at it again.

1126
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.750
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think it will.

1127
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:25.830
Hmm.

1128
02:13:26.850 --> 02:13:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how are you doing right now as we end our session.

1129
02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You worked hard.

1130
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:40.290
Nick Graham: Yeah, no shit, man.

1131
02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd like what

1132
02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:49.770
Nick Graham: Do you like I was like trying to describe that to someone, I was like, yeah, my therapist like puts me in an imaginary room, and then I cry. It's like

1133
02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:55.380
Nick Graham: It's like the only way I can describe it, they're like, what the fuck are you doing

1134
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's cookie.

1135
02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:00.150
Yeah.

1136
02:14:03.570 --> 02:14:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I hear you. I mean, and I will tell you if I thought that just Socratic dialogue and me challenging irrational beliefs.

1137
02:14:10.890 --> 02:14:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is what cognitive behavioral therapy offers if I thought it was really going to address core trauma developmental trauma, I would still be doing it but it fails, it fails to heal the trauma, I

1138
02:14:24.750 --> 02:14:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I love rational. This caused this cause this. I love it. But I had to take a look at the work I was doing and it has limitations. It's beautiful. Yeah.

1139
02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: look from the top down. It's lovely. We have lots of irrational thoughts to get in our own way, but we're forgetting about our body. I mean, other our body was there with the trauma happened like it was there.

1140
02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.660
Nick Graham: Yeah, why don't you do is

1141
02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:52.950
Nick Graham: you incorporate the body into basically wow and

1142
02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll notice how the breath. Did you catch that. That's your breaths.

1143
02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You saw and that's working bottom up. That's that breath, even though I wasn't doing that intentionally as an intervention, you picked up on how good that felt yeah that that diet for matic breathing is your go to when it feels

1144
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much. Nope. We need that that that confrontation of my mind is saying there's all this danger all this threat. All this perceived threat, but when I breathe, there's a contradiction, maybe, maybe I am okay

1145
02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that is, that's just a perception. No, look, I'm in a relaxed body we can put those like the challenge, they don't match up. I'm worried worried worried. But wait, I'm in this relaxed body.

1146
02:15:41.610 --> 02:15:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And the mind can start to change. So it's working from the bottom up. Okay, so I want to work horizontally top down bottom up. I want to work all of it. And this end our stuff.

1147
02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1148
02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:56.910
Nick Graham: Well, I'm proud of you.

1149
02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:58.290
Very hard.

1150
02:15:59.730 --> 02:16:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I can't help but notice the piece about the financial constraint. Only you can decide that

1151
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The value of what you're doing or whether you think we're heading in the right direction. I'm guessing that those pieces about that you mentioned the self-reproach piece that keeps coming up. I think if we keep working on that.

1152
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of looking to the future without a substance to having to escape to will not be as daunting. I mean, that's really the big goal here.

1153
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But you

1154
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:29.160
Nick Graham: Yeah, I agree.

1155
02:16:29.490 --> 02:16:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me when you want to meet again.

1156
02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:34.350
Nick Graham: Continue at the

1157
02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:36.540
Nick Graham: Rate that we're doing any a weekly

1158
02:16:38.370 --> 02:16:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm right now. I plugged. Oh yeah, no, I've got you. Is this works. I have to switch to a Thursday, February 3 at eight. Could that work.

1159
02:16:50.670 --> 02:16:51.390
Nick Graham: Yeah, that can work.

1160
02:16:53.250 --> 02:16:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And we already know. You don't have to worry about the

1161
02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The group for another 30 days. Okay.

1162
02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need anything else.

1163
02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:07.020
Cool.

1164
02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

1165
02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:11.190
Nick Graham: I don't think I don't think I do.

1166
02:17:13.470 --> 02:17:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

1167
02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, if anything comes up, you can reach out text me and say, Boy, something's coming up, let me know.

1168
02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.370
Nick Graham: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.

1169
02:17:24.930 --> 02:17:25.560
Nick Graham: Alright. Have a good day.
