Jocelyn Corrales: Is okay

393
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.900
Stevenk Campbell: That was a it was a Wi Fi thing.

394
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, okay. Uh,

395
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.940
Stevenk Campbell: You were saying something about church.

396
00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.400
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Have you considered going back to church.

397
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.550
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah, if it's if it's like, you know, like I was saying knows

398
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:13.650
Stevenk Campbell: If it's if it's like I have somebody preaching or something. If there's like an event, you know, then

399
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.070
Stevenk Campbell: I wouldn't mind going to that. Yeah, I will go out, but

400
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.010
Stevenk Campbell: Not like on a regular basis, you know,

401
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.270
Jocelyn Corrales: But because

402
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.560
Stevenk Campbell: You always have your weddings and stopping on people with weddings and stuff so

403
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.020
Jocelyn Corrales: But

404
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.150
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah.

405
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.920
Jocelyn Corrales: But you can also do

406
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:40.470
Jocelyn Corrales: Like for example, if you're not able to attend church should also attend online. I think they do online sermons or online worship.

407
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.310
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah, like now they do. Oh yeah, good.

408
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.540
Stevenk Campbell: So instead,

409
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, especially now.

410
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Especially nice difficult to go to church because of the, you know,

411
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.510
Jocelyn Corrales: The pandemic, but

412
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:02.100
Jocelyn Corrales: To start maybe if it's not very hard for you. I think it's easier to attend online.

413
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:10.350
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah, it is actually right now at this time. It's really easy to actually attend some type of service online.

414
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Because they they have on pre recorded. You know what I mean.

415
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

416
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.180
Stevenk Campbell: Yes. Oh, that's how they probably that's I think that's how they actually stay above

417
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.740
Stevenk Campbell: You know what I mean about the need for to do the

418
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Online here. Yes.

419
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.080
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah, sure. Gospel. Yes, go to share the gospel.

420
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:42.570
Jocelyn Corrales: So maybe you could try attending online service for us, then once you're able to you know what's up. And that makes over and once you think you have the time to go to church. Maybe you could attend to the church physically

421
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.550
Stevenk Campbell: There for half the time.

422
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.330
Stevenk Campbell: You know, yeah.

423
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:51.030
Jocelyn Corrales: You could try, but you could try online online worship service.

424
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:55.320
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah, I could try to, you know, check it out.

425
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.290
Stevenk Campbell: It's kind of hard to find a good though.

426
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.740
Stevenk Campbell: A good passion want to actually sit there and listen to, you know,

427
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah I know, right. So it's about there. Yeah, at least for a start, it's better to listen to an online service, you know,

428
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.970
Stevenk Campbell: Yeah yeah

429
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so

430
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:11.790

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I know.

433
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually, it's also very difficult to find a church.

434
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.040
Jocelyn Corrales: That

435
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:30.720
Jocelyn Corrales: You know goes with your own beliefs and, you know, which you think you are comfortable also to attend to. So, are you married or do you have a family.

436
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:43.380
Stevenk Campbell: Um, well, I have, I have a son, you know, I mean, in a baby. It was she is my wife, you know I'm saying, but no, it's just not. We don't have it legal, like that anyway.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Only problem that you mentioned right now is

579
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:52.860

Jocelyn Corrales: Getting in touch with yourself and going

584
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:13.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Trying to go back to church. Maybe I'll just suggest you instead of going there physically. You know, I think you're not yet ready to go back, because as you mentioned, it's

585
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:22.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Very difficult to find a good pastor that you know you think that works out well for you at the same time. Maybe it's good to start with doing online.
