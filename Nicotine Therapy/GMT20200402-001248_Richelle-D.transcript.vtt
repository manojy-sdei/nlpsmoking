Richelle Direny: Did you go like the first Monday of every month. Like, how was it

Dianne Siefker: Not MONDAY, TUESDAY. Well, I went, yeah, it's on Tuesday.

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.830
Dianne Siefker: I went on I think was the 10th.

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.580
Dianne Siefker: Was that the first Monday or Tuesday.

23
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.930
Richelle Direny: Probably. That was the last one. You went to. You mean

24
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.960
Dianne Siefker: Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.310
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then your

26
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.990
Dianne Siefker: Second,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.570
Richelle Direny: Tuesday. So then you're if you go once a month and you will go next Tuesday.

28
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.940
Dianne Siefker: Okay.

29
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.420
Dianne Siefker: Yes.

30
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.610
Richelle Direny: Yes, I do have you here. The

31
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.080
Group on Tuesday.

32
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.740
Richelle Direny: I know the last time that we spoke

33
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.750
Richelle Direny: Are that I saw you in through

34
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.420
Richelle Direny: Um, I guess you had some like you had to go to court. You had some legal things going on.

35
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.830
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, with my son. He had some

36
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.760
Dianne Siefker: truancy issues. Last year, he's been through all his court stuff and

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.090
Dianne Siefker: Then I had to go to court, they

38
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.340
Dianne Siefker: Because he which I'm still not understanding. He missed a drug screen, I guess, cuz he was on put on probation after that and

39
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:57.540
Dianne Siefker: They said they mailed me a letter which I don't ever recall seeing. And so I got charges on me that were related to the truancy charge on it. You know what I mean.

40
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.540
Dianne Siefker: So it was. Yeah. So they got the charge was like contributing to

41
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:17.700
Dianne Siefker: In the way that the juvenile system works. It's not for true and seemed like they want a tree and see. It's called delinquency, I believe, is what it's called.

42
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.940
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, for

43
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.110
Dianne Siefker: It. Well, it

44
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.470
Richelle Direny: Means that he has been traveling for a PSA have

45
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.500
Richelle Direny: Been out of school so great a portion of the school year for them to charge you for it.

46
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:42.210
Dianne Siefker: Well, I wasn't charged with the truancy or anything. It was a contributing after the fact, because he's already. This was he got the truancy last year.

47
00:03:42.720 --> 00:04:02.100
Dianne Siefker: And he was still on probation. And I guess there was a meeting where he was supposed to show up and do what drug screen which I still have never seen this letter to date that she said she sent to me his probation officer and I've never seen so it was all say rise.

48
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:15.630
Richelle Direny: Again, because usually they send like letters and they try they find ways and sometimes I mean I don't know how it is in your state what sometimes they will send like a social worker out to your home. So they have

49
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.490
Dianne Siefker: All these different accounts.

50
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:32.430
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, yeah, there, there was all that involved to. So yeah, there's definitely been people that showed up at the home and everything, which in the court papers.

51
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.610
Dianne Siefker: She told me the probation officer told me she mailed it, but in the when I finally got like it. They call it the discovery packet my attorney called it

52
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:55.230
Dianne Siefker: The probation officer said she handed it to my mother, which my mom said she never received anything that I guess when she went to that house for an evening checkup. She handed it to my mom.

53
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.030
Dianne Siefker: So,

54
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.600
Dianne Siefker: I have no idea where this letter went to

55
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.560
Oh,

56
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:18.990
Dianne Siefker: It's conflicting so I'm like, I don't know that they told me they mailed it and then they told me that they are in the discovery back and they said they handed it to my mother when they showed up.

57
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.780
Richelle Direny: And she don't remember that.

58
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.310
Dianne Siefker: No, she don't

59
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.270
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then how did the

60
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.870
Richelle Direny: How did everything go with the court then

61
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:40.470
Dianne Siefker: Well they I mean of course I pled guilty because I didn't, there wasn't. That's what my attorney recommended

62
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:51.180
Dianne Siefker: And the they put on there. I guess the way you can get was $1,000 fine and six months jail time. But they suspended all that

63
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:13.950
Dianne Siefker: So this is, this is why I've been so frazzled and stressed and just because I've never dealt with the court system for anything. First of all,

64
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:25.680
Dianne Siefker: And then dealing with the juvenile court, which was, I guess a lot different my attorney didn't felt like my attorney was didn't know much about the juvenile system. So it was

65
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.360
Dianne Siefker: It's

66
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.830
Richelle Direny: Been

67
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.530
Richelle Direny: Here it is stressful and then this is

68
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.920
Dianne Siefker: The thing.

69
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.940
Having

70
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.560
Richelle Direny: A part

71
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.830
Richelle Direny: Of the juvenile system or I should say work in the juvenile system doing exactly that.

72
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.140
Richelle Direny: So sometimes

73
00:06:48.300 --> 00:07:03.930
Richelle Direny: How can I put it. I think sometimes they're not because they deal with so many children that our juvenile delinquents, especially ones that have a history of not just true truancy due to substance abuse.

74
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.960
Richelle Direny: Due to, you know, different thing, whether they're doing petty crimes, whatever the situation is

75
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:29.280
Richelle Direny: parents that are somewhat on evolve, what they call on Him evolve, or they have like this permissive parenting style. They somewhat become desensitized. So I think based on my observation of it, they kind of take everyone and like group them into one and they treat everybody the same. So,

76
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.590
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, you try to come and plead your

77
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:40.290
Richelle Direny: Case and say, Hey, well, you know, like you said, I never received a letter, you're saying that you gave it to my mother. My mother is here saying she never got anything

78
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.530
Richelle Direny: You know, they kind of

79
00:07:44.790 --> 00:08:00.300
Richelle Direny: They become like no nonsense and having deal with officers and it's just so many different aspects of it is just that, in my opinion, how I've seen it the way the system is set up. They said they're there to help the child sometimes

80
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.170
Richelle Direny: The child's behavior worse because of how they treat the kid.

81
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.160
Richelle Direny: But you saying you're not treating them like an adult, but in essence, you are

82
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:23.130
Richelle Direny: The way they talk to them the way they lay the law down depending on how involved, you are in trying to meet the situation. So, like, one of the things that I used to do.

83
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.320
Richelle Direny: Which was helpful.

84
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:46.290
Richelle Direny: Is anything haven't there. It's something that you can look into. Um, they had a specialized type of therapy program for the children. And that's what I do, were in, I would they would be referred to this program that was funded through like the city.

85
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:56.760
Richelle Direny: That you live in and or the county that you live with more the county that you live in. And that therapist would work with the child.

86
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:05.010
Richelle Direny: The child is the one that brought the counseling in the home or the services in the home because of their truancy and everything.

87
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.360
Dianne Siefker: Right.

88
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.880
Richelle Direny: I would always tell the kid. I'm like, y'all want me be here. Well, do what you need to do, because

89
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.020
Dianne Siefker: I'm here.

90
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.990
Richelle Direny: Now, like, I'll just, it's your fault, why I'm here. So you don't want me up in your business, go to school, do what you need to do.

91
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:31.530
Dianne Siefker: Exactly what he was doing was going to school. He was getting on the bus and going to school, he was leaving school

92
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.690
Richelle Direny: He was which I know he can you think he was going to school, so

93
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.100
Richelle Direny: Well, he got on the bus when he got off the bus.

94
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.330
Dianne Siefker: School is this way.

95
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.170
Richelle Direny: He had that way.

96
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:44.850
Richelle Direny: The

97
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.030
Richelle Direny: The programs that we were in with that will help the situation.

98
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.720
Dianne Siefker: Was like I said

99
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.940
Richelle Direny: It was the therapist came in the child brought them in. But then it was working more with the parent

100
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.950
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, I went to find

101
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:05.760
Richelle Direny: What was the issues with whether it's at home them individually or at school. And what was the reason why they weren't going to school.

102
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:27.150
Richelle Direny: So then, my job was to find out in all the very important areas in their life and do an assessment of all the areas. One of them that I found outside of it being home the next the second biggest area. I found that when they go to school, they face so much challenges in the school.

103
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:33.180
Richelle Direny: Teachers, that it was when I would sit in a meeting with the kids.

104
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:42.120
Richelle Direny: I would tell the parent. I'm just here to kind of just observe and sometimes I would feel bad for the kid.

105
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:49.680
Richelle Direny: Yeah, sometimes I would feel bad for the kid because of just how they treated the child.

106
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.670
Dianne Siefker: Yeah.

107
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.770
Richelle Direny: Just like you wouldn't want to come to school.

108
00:10:53.070 --> 00:11:14.100
Richelle Direny: Because I again. So I'm so you just have to, you know, I understand and see this is the other part, I understand that we have to work. We have to provide society doesn't allow us necessarily to be as involved in our children's life as we would like.

109
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:21.390
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, definitely. And at that time, at that time, I was working second shift and I just kept telling you know

110
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.220
Dianne Siefker: Please.

111
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:38.790
Dianne Siefker: Don't mess up. I'm setting up a second shift, it's already been arranged the, the moment I think it was a day or two after I finally got on first shift and switch so I could be there in the evening to know what was going on and and everything.

112
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.640
Dianne Siefker: That's when

113
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.390
Dianne Siefker: The friends that he was with hanging with and I

114
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:56.580
Dianne Siefker: Didn't care. Not good. Yeah, they gotten a bad car accident. So this bit this bad car accident which then I think

115
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:10.530
Dianne Siefker: Just brought that to the forefront and intention and then these that's when he got charged with that truancy, which was almost a whole year later from went where it stems from so

116
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.090
Dianne Siefker: Yeah.

117
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.500
Richelle Direny: You're a single mom.

118
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's just you and him are you have other children.

119
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.040
Dianne Siefker: I have other children, but they're older. They're out of 19 and 20

120
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.650
Richelle Direny: So it's just you and him in the home.

121
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.490
Dianne Siefker: Mm hmm.

122
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.080
Richelle Direny: How does he. Yeah.

123
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.660
Dianne Siefker: 16 now he just turned 16

124
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:41.160
Richelle Direny: So you're on. So then, basically, when you're at work. He really it's his responsibility to go to school and come home and pretty much do what needs to be done until you get there.

125
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:49.770
Dianne Siefker: Right. And at the time I was living with my mom so she could help me out you know with with him because she worked during the day.

126
00:12:50.220 --> 00:13:06.330
Dianne Siefker: We'll get home, about five, six o'clock. But he was still home you know alone for a couple hours. My dad usually got home about 435 o'clock, but at the time I was working second shift and missing a lot. Yeah, yeah.

127
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:21.210
Richelle Direny: I mean, it is it is hard. Whether you. The thing is, whether you're working first shift or second shift because second shift is convenient because if you need to be readily available to get to the school you you being on first shift you have that time during the day.

128
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.320
Dianne Siefker: But then

129
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:32.100
Richelle Direny: The problem. The flip side of it is if you work first shift that when he's home you can be there. It's hard to leave work to get to him or to

130
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.040
Richelle Direny: Cry. So it's kind of like you're

131
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.380
Richelle Direny: Doing you're working with a double edged sword. So

132
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.550
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, it's

133
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.860
Richelle Direny: It's, I mean, so if there's so many other things that's involved. And that's, you know, part of the reason why

134
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:53.820
Richelle Direny: It, you know, you having for him. And I would encourage if it's something that they offer there in in Ohio.

135
00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:07.110
Richelle Direny: I would recommend if you can find through the county, because I know here in Florida. That's the program. It was provided through the county. The here with the families didn't have to pay for it.

136
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.010
Richelle Direny: And you got it for

137
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:28.080
Richelle Direny: I would say like I was you were in the home for like three, four months. Yeah, you were there in the home for like three, four months, but it was pretty intensive because you were there all the time like I was there all the time in the whole like two, three days a week, I was there.

138
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:33.810
Richelle Direny: And so having that consistency for the child. Sometimes you saw that improvement.

139
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.730
Richelle Direny: Because it's someone being there.

140
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.630
Richelle Direny: And it's just like, you know, like it's just involvement and sometimes that's really hard.

141
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:52.770
Richelle Direny: But I definitely get a stress that it puts on you because now that's time away from your job to go to court that if he's on probation. I'm sure he has to pay a fee.

142
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.130
Dianne Siefker: Right. Oh yeah, he's gonna find he's got to pay

143
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:03.330
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that's that's money out so you know history and see your bill to pay

144
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.190
Dianne Siefker: Mm hmm. His

145
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.350
Richelle Direny: His, His fault or his

146
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.310
unwise decision.

147
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.410
Richelle Direny: So,

148
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.170
Dianne Siefker: I definitely get that

149
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:18.990
Dianne Siefker: And he wasn't hurt.

150
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.270
Dianne Siefker: Her on the job as always I'm

151
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.980
Richelle Direny: Not I'm no sorry so

152
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.930
Richelle Direny: He wasn't hurt in a car accident.

153
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.770
Dianne Siefker: Oh yeah, he was hurt. Yeah, you got he had

154
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:43.530
Dianne Siefker: Last lacerated liver punctured lung broke a few ribs cracked his pelvis. Yeah, he was hurt. We were in the hospital.

155
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:52.200
Dianne Siefker: Them. Yeah, yeah. He's yeah he really got hurt and quite a few of them really did.

156
00:15:54.210 --> 00:16:00.660
Dianne Siefker: And there was actually the second day I had switched to first shift and then was just all headed on my way home.

157
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:11.490
Dianne Siefker: Is still in the car when I got the phone call that he was being life flighted Dan was actually being life flighted in the town that I was working in which was like a 45 minute drive from home.

158
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:22.380
Dianne Siefker: So yeah, and then I ended up losing my job over that because I wasn't going to leave them when he was an ICO

159
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:31.290
Dianne Siefker: And I you know I just told them they told me they needed me in there. And I said, I need to be with him so

160
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.740
Richelle Direny: So he um if they they someone hit them or they hit someone

161
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:48.960
Dianne Siefker: It was the driver had lost control of the car and hit it was a Brit. It's like the concrete on a bridge across the bridge.

162
00:16:49.620 --> 00:17:03.180
Dianne Siefker: She lost control and smack in actually was the passenger passenger backside, where he was sitting where he and hit them bridge that concrete like wall type thing that was there that they get

163
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.540
Richelle Direny: All the person that was driving the car. He was in lost control.

164
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.190
Dianne Siefker: Yeah yeah

165
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.060
Richelle Direny: So then how did the truancy come up because of the fact that

166
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:21.270
Dianne Siefker: I believe that just kind of brought it to the forefront and this was an accident that everybody knew about the principal because it was

167
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:41.340
Dianne Siefker: Right after school when it happens, and the kids must have all just left school. So when they heard about the accident right away. I guess the principal had went in Jeddah to the hospital where they were all brought initially before there was a couple of my flight it out.

168
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:50.730
Dianne Siefker: Huh. So I was, you know, when I got the call. I got the call from the ER and the county that they you know that they were in

169
00:17:51.210 --> 00:18:07.200
Dianne Siefker: And the principal had called me and I, you know, and told me that they were she was there with him since I was already in the town, where he was being life flighted she stuck with my son that got life flighted to the town where I was at

170
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:23.040
Dianne Siefker: So they were all there. I mean, the schools were involved teachers. I mean, it was and I, it just, it's something that's the whole town heard about. And I think it just brought it to the forefront that and looked into that and yeah

171
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.470
Richelle Direny: Oh,

172
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.310
Richelle Direny: But you said all of this happened, how long ago, almost a year ago.

173
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.490
Richelle Direny: But, but you're still having to go to the court and deal with all the truancy and everything else.

174
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:39.690
Right.

175
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.400
So how has things now.

176
00:18:47.190 --> 00:19:02.520
Dianne Siefker: Kind of settling out, you know, which I still got to deal with the whole accident and the bills and not settlement on that which I kind of put on the back burner for now while we're dealing with why I dealt with all

177
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.460
Dianne Siefker: This truancy. All this other charges.

178
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:23.220
Dianne Siefker: But now that that's all done. And ironically, it was just so strange so that you're that week I was a couple weeks ago I told him, I said, now we can focus on this. I was so worried about not being able to keep my attention and focus on two different core issues.

179
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.670
Dianne Siefker: So I end up getting a call from actually the insurance company.

180
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:43.800
Dianne Siefker: It was like two or three days after after our court was all done. I'm like, How ironic because I'm just telling you the night before. Actually, I was telling them the night before. I think now's the time we are dealing with.

181
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:54.750
Dianne Siefker: The insurance company and and because they said a settlement offer and everything. So, but you have to go through the probate court since he's under 18

182
00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:01.770
Dianne Siefker: To determine how he's going to receive the settlement, but of course we got. I got to get all the bills online and

183
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.540
Richelle Direny: See what nobody knows the accident. Right.

184
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:17.610
Dianne Siefker: No, not another vehicle or anything. It was the insurance that the the girl, the girl that was driving the car. It's her insurance company.

185
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.530
Richelle Direny: Oh, so this was an adult person that was driving the car.

186
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.870
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, actually she wasn't a doll. She was 18

187
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:26.130
Oh,

188
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:29.940
Yeah.

189
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:38.640
Dianne Siefker: So yes, it's, it's a very, very big mess. And I'm actually the girl is still in jail because of it.

190
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.260
Dianne Siefker: Well,

191
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.740
Dianne Siefker: I'm

192
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:53.790
Dianne Siefker: I've got the accident report and it doesn't say that like she was under the influence of alcohol. I don't know if there was anything else found in her system, but

193
00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:03.570
Dianne Siefker: The accident report doesn't doesn't say that she was there was are actually, it states that there is no alcohol involved.

194
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.600
Dianne Siefker: So wasn't alcohol.

195
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.890
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, that is a lot

196
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.980
Richelle Direny: That is that is a lot to

197
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:35.910
Richelle Direny: To still the financial aspect of it, but I mean even no matter what, how much the settlement is or whatever, financially, that doesn't you know

198
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:36.600
No.

199
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.540
Richelle Direny: Body back to wholeness, um,

200
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.080
Dianne Siefker: No.

201
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:45.930
Richelle Direny: No. Is there still, you know, damages that he's recovering from pain and all this different things and

202
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.550
Dianne Siefker: I can just ride.

203
00:21:47.790 --> 00:22:01.110
Richelle Direny: You know, bring life to hopefully not to other things. But, um, but, you know, has. Do you think that it has turned him around and he his outlook on

204
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.620
Richelle Direny: Life is

205
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.180
Richelle Direny: A bit different or

206
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.340
Dianne Siefker: Oh yeah, definitely, definitely.

207
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.830
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, definitely do.

208
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:15.450
Dianne Siefker: I mean, he's had to eliminate a lot he he's not allowed to be with any of those people around that were involved in that accident.

209
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.190
Dianne Siefker: So that kind of

210
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.640
Dianne Siefker: A little happy about that. But

211
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:35.970
Dianne Siefker: But then again it worries me because he doesn't have any friends or anything so that are really, really worries me because he's at such a vulnerable age and his dad also

212
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:48.780
Dianne Siefker: has bipolar and I know this is the age that it starts coming out. So I can see the depressive side coming out, you know, no worries me.

213
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.930
Richelle Direny: I mean, since he

214
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.280
Richelle Direny: Does he get counseling or

215
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.630
Richelle Direny: Do you take him in for counseling.

216
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.530
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, he goes to counseling, the

217
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.060
Dianne Siefker: Resource Center, and he sees a counselor there.

218
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.660
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's good. And so what is your self care routine going through all of this.

219
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:30.930
Dianne Siefker: Well, and like I said, I've been trying to take everything one thing at a time. I knew you know i couldn't take all this all at once. I knew that I couldn't handle that, you know, I've never dealt with the court systems before. So I know this deal with this and

220
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:39.990
Dianne Siefker: I know they kept my mom and everyone kept pushing them but like I know how much I can handle. And I'm not taking on all this always wants

221
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.640
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, that is that is absolutely true.

222
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.100
Dianne Siefker: Because

223
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.670
Richelle Direny: You know that will definitely um

224
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.190
Richelle Direny: Become very burdensome for you if you try and take everything at one time.

225
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:06.930
Richelle Direny: So, um, what, like what but you. Who is your, your support system is just your parents.

226
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.210
Dianne Siefker: Right. We parents. I have a couple friends. I talked to

227
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.070
Dianne Siefker: But as far as like, you know, my support system. It's my parents.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.650
That's what you gotta do.

280
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:58.380
Richelle Direny: So I just wanted to, because I know we um you go once a month, and we don't. I'm kind of how we meet its kind of probably once a month, or what have you. So just kind of

281
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.670
Richelle Direny: Your treatment plan. And that's what I would want to do that, we just check in.

282
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:13.380
Richelle Direny: Maybe monthly and, you know, kind of review your treatment plan, but so far since the last time.

283
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.950
Richelle Direny: I know that one of the things

284
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:18.660
Richelle Direny: That

285
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.320
Dianne Siefker: Which was kind of

286
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:24.870
Richelle Direny: Ongoing was for you to attend. Which of you have been doing attending group once a month.

287
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.480
Dianne Siefker: You did mention

288
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.850
Richelle Direny: That you were going to the outside meetings.

289
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.330
Dianne Siefker: That you have talked about losing your

290
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:33.780
Richelle Direny: Job.

291
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.870
Richelle Direny: And until you you find new employment.

292
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:43.380
Richelle Direny: So, like, what is this now that you're working on that you would like to work on what you're working towards your personal

293
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.430
Dianne Siefker: Actually what

294
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.990
Dianne Siefker: I'm getting the house in order. It's got a lot of

295
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:58.530
Dianne Siefker: Real modeling and everything that needs to be done, which actually I've been working a lot on this week and

296
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.380
Dianne Siefker: Since we've had to stay and more

297
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.600
Dianne Siefker: So yeah, I've been stay pretty busy at home with with that which

298
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:15.930
Dianne Siefker: keeps me busy and keeps my mind occupied and it gives me something to look forward to when it's all done. It's coming along so nice.

299
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:23.010
Richelle Direny: So, um, you said keeping busy. So like you would you say um

300
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:31.230
Richelle Direny: It wouldn't be self care because then this is what you're doing, you're saying that what you're working on is to

301
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:38.160
Richelle Direny: Pretty much organizing and organize your home, your just your personal things

302
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:38.820
Yeah.

303
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.380
Dianne Siefker: Yeah.

304
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:50.730
Dianne Siefker: Getting the home organized. Well, I mean, I had a lot of pain and there was a lot the flooring we I just read carpeted so

305
00:35:51.270 --> 00:36:06.060
Dianne Siefker: I mean, I'm doing a little bit at a time where I'm not getting so overwhelmed with it but I kind of like the breakfast, like I'm making it my own and it makes me feel good, you know, that's that helps make it feel good when my house is in order.

306
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:19.950
Richelle Direny: So it sounds like time management, learning how to restructure because time management is what captures being able to to plan your time, your time better to be able to to

307
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.880
Dianne Siefker: To yeah

308
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:26.790
Richelle Direny: Um, organize what it is because it does feel good when you, I can tell you

309
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.140
Richelle Direny: When you when your house is

310
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:33.180
Richelle Direny: all nice and structuring when you. It's almost like the air that you breathe is different.

311
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.180
Dianne Siefker: In the house and exactly

312
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:37.950
Dianne Siefker: Exactly.

313
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:59.280
Dianne Siefker: So I tell them when I when I'm ready to sit down and relax. And I'm like, going into I have been watching on Netflix or no, it's on Hulu, Netflix, but I have been bingeing on a show on that. But I like to make sure everything's in order before I can sit down and relax and enjoy that. So,

314
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.130
Richelle Direny: Better time management and being more

315
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.550
Richelle Direny: Intentional

316
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.360
Dianne Siefker: I think it would

317
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:08.910
Dianne Siefker: It's been pretty stressful the work and everything, because you know what's every coronavirus going on and short staff that

318
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:21.660
Dianne Siefker: I know have been putting in a lot more overtime hours because of it. So I and I definitely have learned that I've got to watch myself on that time I quit or not work because I will get sick.

319
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:34.590
Dianne Siefker: I dragged my body down when it and it gets sick if I didn't overdo it. So I know I definitely cannot do that used to have a hard time saying no wonder like, can you stay over and work you know who live there.

320
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:40.830
Dianne Siefker: But now it's like, nope, if I if I know I've already worked with, but enough my time it

321
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.750
Richelle Direny: So working on on on better self care and learning how to say no.

322
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:57.030
Richelle Direny: That's very important because sometimes I have to learn that too. It's learning how to say you

323
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.040
Richelle Direny: Know art of saying no, because

324
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.440
Richelle Direny: Sometimes you look at your circles.

325
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:13.440
Richelle Direny: You look at your circumstances and your situation and you think, Oh, well, it's going to give me extra money. So then you say, yeah, and you forget about the fact that you're exhausted. You're tired, you need to go home to your son, and there's things that you need to get done.

326
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.510
Dianne Siefker: And then I ain't gonna do nobody any good when I'm sick.

327
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.470
Richelle Direny: So it's, um, so, the objective is to be more aware

328
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.020
Richelle Direny: Of

329
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.140
Richelle Direny: Just being more mindful like knowing that

330
00:39:44.610 --> 00:40:00.210
Richelle Direny: Your own self care, which means that you're going to be more intentional about taking care of yourself, whatever that may look like. So whatever if you say that this is being I'm being a better manager of your time.

331
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:01.800
Dianne Siefker: Yeah.

332
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.010
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, definitely.

333
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.640
Richelle Direny: And would you say listening more to your body, because that's the other thing, like when you said that, um,

334
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.320
Richelle Direny: It's gonna do anybody any good if you're sick, it's listening because someone said that

335
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.490
Dianne Siefker: Earlier is listening to your

336
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:29.880
Dianne Siefker: Body.

337
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.160
Richelle Direny: When your body says enough is enough.

338
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:32.940
Yes.

339
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.680
Dianne Siefker: Yes. Yes, definitely.

340
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:42.780
Dianne Siefker: I mean, I just had somebody come asked me this probably a few days ago.

341
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:54.390
Dianne Siefker: And you know, I know. I've already I'm already in overtime. So it's like, I know I cannot pick up anything extra right now i i just

342
00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:12.900
Dianne Siefker: Because learning from past experience, you know, done it so many times. And it's like, I know I and I'm getting older, I know that though i can't i can't work them hours like I used to. Because I run my I wrote myself down. That's my immune system down and and they'll get sick.

343
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.660
Dianne Siefker: So I had to tell her. Nope. I can't do it.

344
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.200
Richelle Direny: And you know, it's funny because, like, in light of everything that's going on with the whole coronavirus and everything.

345
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:32.100
Richelle Direny: It's like they're just so they're more focused on, I have to wash my hands. I have to do this. I have to do that. But then if you're

346
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:32.640
Dianne Siefker: Asking

347
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:42.300
Richelle Direny: Yourself down to a rut, guess what, naturally, your immune system is coming down because your body is running on fumes. At this point, there's no more energy. So, listen.

348
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.050
Richelle Direny: To grow your

349
00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:50.280
Richelle Direny: Open up to get any whether it's Corona or the common cold. It doesn't matter what it is you're opening up yourself to catch

350
00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.030
Dianne Siefker: Anything right

351
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:57.360
Richelle Direny: Number one, you're, you're mentally you're overwhelmed. Your body is super stressed because it's just like

352
00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.910
Richelle Direny: It's just so tired. It's just

353
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.770
Richelle Direny: So depleted, you're

354
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:02.880
Richelle Direny: Not getting a whole

355
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.620
Richelle Direny: Lot of rest. You're not just like you say, sometimes it's to

356
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.610
Richelle Direny: Some people, it sounds like really you sit there and you binge watch TV. Yes.

357
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.140
Richelle Direny: Because all I'm doing is my

358
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.550
Dianne Siefker: Eyes is looking on something.

359
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.140
Richelle Direny: My body is right.

360
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.310
Dianne Siefker: That's all.

361
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:23.250
Richelle Direny: My body is relax it is in homeostasis and all I'm doing is watching something and that's

362
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:23.940
Dianne Siefker: Right.

363
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.560
It's okay.

364
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:31.500
Dianne Siefker: Yeah, yeah. It's my job required it's it's taxing on the body.

365
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:36.990
Dianne Siefker: I'm sorry.

366
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.290
Richelle Direny: I said, Yes, you have to listen to your body. Just be

367
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.280
Richelle Direny: A better manager.

368
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.950
Dianne Siefker: Of your time and

369
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.010
Richelle Direny: And who you lend your time to

370
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.920
Dianne Siefker: Right. Oh, yeah.

371
00:42:54.510 --> 00:43:00.660
Richelle Direny: So what about, like with your son in terms of the relationship and everything in, like, in light of all that occurred.

372
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.010
Dianne Siefker: Over the last year or so.

373
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:18.900
Dianne Siefker: My son and I have always been pretty close. But he, I mean he has an extremely difficult time opening up and it's really, really are to get it out of them.

374
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:24.810
Dianne Siefker: My daughter, does the same thing. And I know I do the same thing. So they probably got about for me.

375
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:26.970
But

376
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.940
Dianne Siefker: I do feel like he

377
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.070
Dianne Siefker: It has

378
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:51.870
Dianne Siefker: Opened us up more and, you know, connect war because of it. Just because I well I make a point to try to, you know, remain more involved in what's going on, especially with

379
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.250
Dianne Siefker: schoolwork, and things like that so

380
00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:05.970
Dianne Siefker: I know before like I know that was what was tearing me down when I was working second shift. And I know I wasn't as involved as I needed to be

381
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.700
Dianne Siefker: So it's in that

382
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.700
Dianne Siefker: I think that a lot of guilt on me.

383
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.650
Dianne Siefker: At that time,

384
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.360
Dianne Siefker: Okay, so when I think

385
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:29.310
Dianne Siefker: You know, when everything happened. I'm like, No, I've got to be. I can go to work on my son's in ICU. I'm not. I can't do it because I think I already had all that guilt from

386
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.630
Dianne Siefker: Not being there in the evening when

387
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.030
Dianne Siefker: I probably could have them.

388
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:40.260
Okay.

389
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:49.920
Richelle Direny: So it's been so he said, make a point of being more aware of what and that was and that was one of the things, like I said, because I did, I did it for maybe

390
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.660
Dianne Siefker: Two years.

391
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:57.360
Richelle Direny: Um, that was one of the number one things that I did identify

392
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:10.950
Richelle Direny: It's one thing, because sometimes we have to assess you say you have a good relationship. Sometimes we have to assess that. That was the number one thing that I realized it's that having a good relationship it saying, hey, what's your son's name.

393
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.510
Dianne Siefker: Austin.

394
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:25.740
Richelle Direny: Saying, hey, Austin, how's your day. Oh, it's good. Mom, you know, you know, just kind of talking to them, just about any little random thing. So like it's good in that aspect. But then, do you really truly know

395
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:31.680
Richelle Direny: What is going on in their lives. So you're really truly know what challenges they're dealing with in school.

396
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:41.520
Richelle Direny: What challenges there. You know what type of peer pressure, they're involved in who is coming in and out of their lives, who is saying or whispering things in their ear that's contrary to what

397
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:51.180
Richelle Direny: To what you're saying and what you stand for. And do we really truly know and sometimes because of the fact, like you said you are a single mom.

398
00:45:51.600 --> 00:46:00.960
Richelle Direny: And you have so many other responsibilities. Sometimes they become protective of you and they don't want to add any more stressors to you to get you overwhelmed because they already know how

399
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.100
Dianne Siefker: Overweight. Yes, or

400
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.890
Dianne Siefker: Yes. Yeah, I send it

401
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:27.900
Dianne Siefker: The nail right on the head with them because I know he does that. He's a worrier and worries a lot. So, and I know you can pick up when you know I got a lot going on or when I'm stressed and he will keep his mouth shut. Just to eliminate any more stress, you know,

402
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.700
Richelle Direny: And let me know trust.

403
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:31.440
Dianne Siefker: Yeah.

404
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:33.570
Dianne Siefker: But

405
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:41.130
Richelle Direny: But it's just like having that so like, you know what I used to encourage is with parents is just

406
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:58.440
Richelle Direny: Make it, like you said, like in even in your own self, your own personal goals for yourself in the things that you want to do is better manager of your time is just making it a point of saying maybe weekly you set aside on a set aside uninterrupted time just for you in him.

407
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.120
To do like a check in.

408
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:01.680
Dianne Siefker: You know,

409
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.610
Richelle Direny: Like you said,

410
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:03.900
Richelle Direny: How is he doing

411
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.220
Richelle Direny: And really trying to get

412
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.640
Richelle Direny: Deep, whether it's that both of your you're going out to get a bite to

413
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:21.510
Richelle Direny: Eat just the two of you or catching them something I'm just so to that uninterrupted time. Hey, you know what, let's watch Netflix together or if it's something that he likes to watch if it's a particular sport or video game or what have

414
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:27.870
Richelle Direny: You you sit there and try to be involved to try to strike up a conversation. I mean granted at 16 years old.
