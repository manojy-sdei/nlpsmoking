12
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do sound like it's not. I mean, as far as aspect goes. It doesn't look like the intensity

13
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is quite as high as it sounds like. So how are you pulling that off. What are you doing to balance right. The, the worry. Some things you could be preoccupied with worry, worry, worry but instead you're doing what

Alicia Noedel: Relaxing week

Alicia Noedel: I've been. I've been pretty I'm exhausted. I'm sorry, I'm exhausted. I didn't sleep all night last night. The baby's been teething. So she's having a really hard time

21
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so

22
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Relaxing and there's exhaustion spending time with family, you're not having to be preoccupied with, you know, is Joaquin getting getting the

23
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The right the virus on his skin and going to bring it here and okay so so real combination

24
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Combination of both positive and negative things going on.

25
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me open up a note here poet and get him to see what we were working on last time.

26
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how are you feeling about group.

27
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.090
Alicia Noedel: Okay, pretty good.

28
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's ever anything that comes up in there, feel free to journal it, feel free to write a little note and you can always process because I never, never have any fun to go into anything in there. It's like, what do you see any individuals, everybody.

29
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.370
Alicia Noedel: I know a lot of and then this group had like nine people. So there's a lot

30
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.180
Alicia Noedel: I know introductions, when it was already the time to be over with.

31
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No know yep that's sometimes how it is.

32
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: For that group was starting to get really small. We got down to like hardly anybody. And so we're like, Hey, we got to build it back up again and we sure did. I'll tell you what.

33
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Some nice folks in their own life.

34
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see.

35
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see, we did review of resource figures. Yep.

36
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What else did we do we get some good stuff.

37
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoo. I know what we can do today.

38
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I see what homework. We didn't integrate imagery of resource figures with belly breathing. That's nice.

39
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Some belly breathing and then keeping right also doing the imagery of protective figure nurturing figure wise figure just really breathing it into that that belly in your in your

40
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: meditation or prayer. I don't know which direction you kind of go there.

41
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.230
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I've been putting a lot

42
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.640
Alicia Noedel: Frame really

43
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, prayer. Yep.

44
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we need to send it all the good vibes, we can

45
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.010
Alicia Noedel: Definitely

46
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was an invitation to practice some thought stopping you know to write down tangible lives it thanks for sharing and you write down exactly what you need to do.

47
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

48
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Just do those things and then stop ruminating instead just say thank you. Yes, I'm on alert. I wrote those down to that inner dialogue.

49
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:15.540
Alicia Noedel: That helped me significantly. This week, it really locking it away and throwing it away and helped me a lot.

50
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just, you did a lock and throw

51
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Did that come from the default picturing default. Yep. And oh, this was this the drop off the gorge.

52
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Yeah, there we go. That's it, because I saw you do this. And now I see

53
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.160
Alicia Noedel: And

54
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. So okay, so it was the fear the unknown. Let me drop that off. I've already got my list. Yes, thank you for the reminder

55
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.430
Alicia Noedel: As a combination is like I got an argument with my

56
00:05:47.430 --> 00:06:04.740
Alicia Noedel: Mom and I was really, you know, and I don't like getting like that with her because me and her, you know, have a very close relationship. Okay. And, you know, I'm, I'm one of those people that I dwell on things and I stay angry and upset about things for way longer than it should.

57
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.680
Alicia Noedel: And that helped me to like really let it go right away faster.

58
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.970
That's beautiful.

59
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And now the tricky bit and this is the thing. When you say well I let it go faster. So I'm also sort of compassionately sort of vigilant around

60
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to let go of you.

61
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.230
Know,

62
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

63
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: There, you know the difference right here is something that this is a short term little misunderstanding. It's not a core issue.

64
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to let it go for the sake of relationship.

65
00:06:50.340 --> 00:07:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maintaining this relationship over being right over you know you shouldn't keep the baby outside for more than an hour, you know, that was random but you know

66
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: At something else. Okay, I'm being nope, I'm not going to fight for this. I'm not gonna argue right you're investing when you let go of a petty thing, something that's really not a core value.

67
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're investing in the harmony, you're investing in the relationship. And it sounds like you like that.

68
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.280
Alicia Noedel: Huh. Okay, that's cool.

69
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you know how did you know whether it'll let it go or not. Well,

70
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.110
Alicia Noedel: Um,

71
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.850
Alicia Noedel: That's a hard, that's a harder one because I, I just thought about you saying you know

72
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:50.490
Alicia Noedel: If there's something that you have a problem with or there's something that you know you can't deal with right then just, you know, put it to the side, you know, put it away so that it doesn't affect you and um

73
00:07:51.900 --> 00:08:00.090
Alicia Noedel: You know, I was very ready to dwell on it all night and be upset because I was very my feelings were hurt and

74
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:10.770
Alicia Noedel: I started questioning like things that, like, really have no business being in it, like, oh, you know, she does, she really even loved me, like, you know, things that

75
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:21.930
Alicia Noedel: You know, just ridiculous. And I think that just comes back from me, you know, starving for her approval for so long as a as a kid, you know. Yeah.

76
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

77
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe it's not

78
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe if you knew. Let's try this out. See if you like this, you can always reject it. If it doesn't feel right. But it's not throwing away.

79
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be put in default. And the reason why the default is handy because we can open it together. And it's not forgotten. It's not to be said it's not important. It's just not to be running around kicking things breaking windows.

80
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Run a muck.

81
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but it on the I'm starving for approval. It's hard for a therapist to want to say we're going to drop that off the gorge.

82
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's, it's more like I wonder, like you said, I'm gonna put it in a container. Maybe that goes in the vault. That's where you and I can do some healing and in fact this activity. I want to do to you today around the anchor room.

83
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That might come up and visit it safely and on your terms.

84
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in a hijacking

85
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: My life is dependent on it. It's coming up again. Well, I know.

86
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: This is important to look it's it's making me cry. I'm questioning my love ability. This is an important one. It's got to go in the fault and I'm gonna bring it up with one of your

87
00:09:47.520 --> 00:10:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I'll do it on a time when I feel like journaling, but I'm going to do it on my terms, but not off the gorge just the right now goes off the time schedule off the gorge, maybe, but the topic goes in the whole spin it will pick it back up again.

88
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, yeah, yeah.

89
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:12.210
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, because I didn't, I didn't forget about it either. You know, I just, you know, tried to make it to where it wasn't gonna

90
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:23.940
Alicia Noedel: affect me know because it wasn't important anymore at that exact moment, you know, even though no one said sorry to each other, which, you know, I really wish I would have gotten some kind of apology out of it.

91
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:32.400
Alicia Noedel: I just, you know, I just didn't want to deal with it because I didn't want to ruin my day. Okay.

92
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're saying some pretty important stuff.

93
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm wondering if it's going to come up in this in this activity. I'm going to invite now.

94
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take because we've got a good chunk of time and this one can take sometimes multiple sessions.

95
00:10:53.340 --> 00:11:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What I like to do with you, is I'd like to develop an anchor room and

96
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your only job really is and you're really great at it already, you just give me your next thought

97
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of free stuff free association.

98
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all right. Brain Stuff. It's all creative, the kind of the same way you were doing with metaphor.

99
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The things that clients need to kind of be keep alert to there's a tendency to want to push memory into it. Well, I remember it was red is so it's red. Well, this anchor room is perfect. This is a safe.

100
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect space. And so although you may be interested in pushing memory on it. Give yourself permission to get what you really, really, really want in there or really, really need

101
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll all be able to probably pick up on when you're forcing memory. Well, it wasn't, it was, it was this okay well that's memory.

102
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll be doing a little activity. So your only job, you just say what comes up. I feel sick. I feel like throwing up oh my so tense my teeth grinding.

103
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: On crying, but I'm interested in all of it. You're whatever there's some soma, the body's feeling, whatever the thought is maybe have a belief about yourself.

104
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a judgment on, you know, right, one of those I'm starving for that you know are you do an analysis. Right. I was starving for for approval. I'm going to want to hear about that your job, you just whatever comes up.

105
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'll be guiding with question then question then.

106
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:35.820
Alicia Noedel: Question.

107
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you do is first answer than I do question first answer. I do question first answer.

108
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no possible way for you to do it wrong.

109
00:12:48.870 --> 00:13:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: There's any people pleaser Enya or perfectionism or control or, you know, sort of, I'm not good enough. Anything in there. I want to say up front. There's no way you can do it wrong can't make a mistake.

110
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

111
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.750
Alicia Noedel: Okay, yeah, that's nice.

112
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to dive right into it. And the basic instructions are this let's identify a target. Let's identify

113
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And they see a where you're still feeling stuck this may be something you've tried to resolve or still something that upsets you deeply

114
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you touched a little bit on something earlier and we'll start there.

115
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.990
Alicia Noedel: The way I feel about me.

116
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.940
Alicia Noedel: I'm like the thing like the way things left off. And my dad passed away.

117
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.710
Okay.

118
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So I might say, I'm feeling blocked.

119
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Around my grief or how our relationship was when he passed, like, see if he can help me.

120
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.070
Alicia Noedel: Um, I feel like I wasn't there.

121
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:34.740
Alicia Noedel: For him in in the way I should have been. And you know there were signs of him, you know, trying to tell me that he was having problems and I wasn't picking up on them, or I wouldn't pick up the phone when you recall

122
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the meaning you make out of your behavior. What does this say about who you are and what you think.

123
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:51.990
Alicia Noedel: I don't know. I mean, at the time I was in an abusive relationship and and he played my ex thought that I was

124
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:59.070
Alicia Noedel: Having guys because my little sister lived there at my dad's house and she was pretty promiscuous.

125
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:11.070
Alicia Noedel: And he thought that I would have guys go over there and I would you know do stuff with guys, which I would never do it. My father's house, but he stopped letting me go there and he didn't want me to, you know,

126
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.660
Alicia Noedel: Be around him, or be around his house so

127
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.160
Alicia Noedel: That meant you know my name. My father's relationship suffered for

128
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I invite you for today. I can do.

129
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The job of analysis, you don't have to do the analysis. So just notice you'll just be keeping your eye out for my next question. You'll let me do the analysis.

130
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you get to be the client, you get to pay attention to you. It's a hard enough job to sit with whatever's coming up. You don't have to analyze it.

131
00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let this process unfold. But remember, the I the agenda, just, you know, we're not heading towards something that's unraveled

132
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Unhappy we're heading towards a space in this room. It's going to be imagery that that you can use anytime you want.

133
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's also very on purpose for a particular activity. I want to do with you. It's available to you anytime you want. So not only is there a place to talk away some negative things that you don't want to do. There's a safe sanctuary to go to to think through

134
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To take time to reflect, to get centered

135
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an anchor room.

136
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a safe place. That's our destiny. That's where we're going. Today, tomorrow, however long you know next session. However long it takes us to get there.

137
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So why you know where we're headed. It's not going to be uncomfortable. It might be some of some of the time. But remember, the destiny is it, it's going to be a perfect

138
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect safe place. Okay.

139
00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: your happy place.

140
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I kind of have an idea.

141
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you're talking about.

142
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's get started. That's the block, there's still some turmoil. Maybe I it looks like he had tears.

143
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.750
Alicia Noedel: Right.

144
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the label of the emotion, we get this, what do you, what do you feeling around this block.

145
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.720
Alicia Noedel: Pain Sadness. Sadness.

146
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Sadness. And do you feel anything in the body. When you were

147
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.480
Alicia Noedel: Bringing up stomach's hurting someone credit

148
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:47.670
Alicia Noedel: It feels like almost like butterflies, but like sinking kinda like a sinking feeling

149
00:17:51.180 --> 00:18:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's going to be a total of three times that I will you know how earlier I said this is not about memory that's true for the most part, but if I'm honest. There are three three brief moments.

150
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The third one which may not be even today may take a little longer, but

151
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to ask you age, that's a memory, right, you got to think about the just, just the age not happened. Nope. Just age.

152
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nickname. And then the question that I'll ask maybe next session or two. So that's all that I'm dipping into memory.

153
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The rest of it just pay attention to what comes up. Don't force it. I'm trying to remember trying to remember trying to remember know just try to answer my question. And let whatever comes up.

154
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Just share that with me. That makes sense.

155
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see how we do. Here we go.

156
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that kind of sadness and that sinking feeling in the stomach.

157
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Go into it lean into it a little bit really pay attention to it less of what you're seeing through through your eyes.

158
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see. Is that part of the brain. It's sort of the insula part of the brain that has the ability to acknowledge physiological psychological

159
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Experience in internally, can it can feel itself, we can note the self, see, feel the gut. It's sunk in that sadness.

160
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you to as best you can track back and see the first stage of that you had that feeling.

161
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you have to do is say the age. I won't make you retell it

162
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.060
Alicia Noedel: I

163
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.970
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I do have been a young age. I know that it wasn't the first time.

164
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.740
Alicia Noedel: Because I always get the same feeling of like dread.

165
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's a way we can do it. Just pay attention, huh, yeah. Was it there at

171
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.290
Okay.

172
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one feels true just to make this activity which one seems more real. Go to go to nine.

Wrong.

303
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.560
Alicia Noedel: Not much.

304
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Not much. That's usually a difficult one for people

305
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How much

306
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

307
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want in there.

308
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:12.900
Alicia Noedel: Huh.

309
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing in there.

310
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.740
Alicia Noedel: They're sitting in it.

311
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you sitting

312
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.290
Alicia Noedel: On the floor. Okay.

313
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little scan of the body as you sit on the floor. Maybe now you can maybe your hands touch that clean soft fluffy carpet.

314
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, pay attention to it.

315
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you still feel your body as it is now see it on the carpet and underneath that. What's the under

316
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Foundation Center that carpet.

317
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Concrete. So how does it feel to be seated.

318
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.070
Alicia Noedel: Know the comfortable list but

319
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.280
Alicia Noedel: Man like

320
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.080
Alicia Noedel: I don't want to say manageable. But like

321
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:22.350
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

322
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, for

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. OK. So I can say that, I'll say

325
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: more pleasurable intolerable.

326
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere in there.

327
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what

328
00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion, you're experiencing. If you can tolerate a closing your eyes to really be present with this imagery won't confuse pieces of this. What's the emotion, you're feeling in this room.

329
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.220
Peace.

330
00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.010
Alicia Noedel: Safety

331
00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: peace and safety.

332
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice your body. See if it has any charge in it. If there's tension. If it matches the words peace and safety.

333
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Does yeah

334
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.490
Okay.

335
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

336
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say the body has no

337
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: No charge

338
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You scanned and you checked you checked the head face shoulders, arms chest got

339
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: All the lower parts here by our hips on her buttocks thighs and knees and calves and feet and

340
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You say, no, there's nothing there.

341
00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That right

342
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:54.690
Yeah.

343
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to add a little bit of magic and somewhere.

344
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Wherever you want and you decide right whatever comes up, there's a secret compartment.

345
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Where there's a magic wand can be something else magic that you know about that you can get to

346
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.330
Okay.

347
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you forget and don't remember to use it.

348
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All remind you

349
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But is there.

350
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get a sense when I I laid out that invitation what imagery came up

351
00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.680
Alicia Noedel: Was it on like a trap door kinda

352
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And was it a magic wand in there.

353
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.730
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, okay.

354
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I can change if it needs to. But for now, you got a trap door.

355
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:08.880
Alicia Noedel: I dropped you

356
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Question I get them all the time.

357
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, we've got our trap door and you can see it. Can anyone else see it.

358
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:20.700
Alicia Noedel: No.

359
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: trap door hidden

360
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: View as magic wand. Okay, cool.

361
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, my ears are acting up

362
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.430
Alicia Noedel: My nose is acting up

363
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

364
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Here comes the funny question. This is the one that they remember there was a third thing that was memory related

365
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is it.

366
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And

367
00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be just sort of this compassionate patient witness to whatever comes up for you, okay, because it's an odd question. So I'm going to repeat it, and rephrase it in three or four different ways and times just sit with it.

368
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with it.

369
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Until your truth emerges.

370
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

371
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice

372
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: As this nine year old.

373
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to believe something in order to survive.

374
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: She had to absorb misinformation. She did it because she needed to survive.

375
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: At least you knows that's not true.

376
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But

377
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice at the time.

378
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to survive in her environment had to take that on.

379
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we absorb these things from our culture we absorb them from or caregiver from they're carrying their lack of caring

380
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: we absorb it nonetheless an hour.

381
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to believe it to survive.

382
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: With the morsel and crumbs

383
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: She did the best she could

384
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Only see knows that's not the whole truth.

385
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the misinformation that Alice had to absorb as a young girl.

386
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.790
Alicia Noedel: I guess I tried to pretend that nothing was happening, nothing was going on, like it was

387
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.680
Alicia Noedel: Like

388
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.940
Alicia Noedel: I would tell myself I was over exaggerating or

389
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:04.620
Alicia Noedel: You know,

390
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:13.200
Alicia Noedel: That everyone's life was like this. So, you know, why was I

391
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.620
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

392
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:23.340
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Yes. Like that everyone's life was like that so

393
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:30.090
Alicia Noedel: There was no reason for me to be upset about it or

394
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.940
Alicia Noedel: Anything like that.

395
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion, you're feeling

396
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:51.540
Alicia Noedel: Sadness.

397
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body.

398
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.760
Alicia Noedel: Tense feeling

399
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.440
Alicia Noedel: very tense up

400
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.390
Alicia Noedel: Everywhere.

401
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And fearing everywhere. Okay.

402
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can give a voice to that everywhere tense feeling

403
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.460
Alicia Noedel: Nobody

404
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a way that I might listen

405
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:40.650
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

406
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to know.

407
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's yell. Sometimes it's a pleading. Sometimes it's a cry.

408
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But

409
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want to hear it.

410
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But just that tense all over body have to say try not to censor

411
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it has a message that instead of tenses up all your muscles.

412
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.550
Alicia Noedel: It's just overwhelming.

413
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, this is overwhelming.

414
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

415
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: trap door.

416
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over to it.

417
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Open it up.

418
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's bring the presence and quality.

419
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what is needed for this overwhelming experience about us and

420
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We have it.

421
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I noticed the room.

422
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have

423
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Anybody anything. And there was peace.

424
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was safety.

425
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we put the overwhelming somewhere else.

426
00:41:53.760 --> 00:42:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What does magic maybe magic even knows what to do, does magic know exactly what to do with this overwhelming.

427
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Body tense experience.

428
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:09.570
Yeah.

429
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So magic just makes it to what

430
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.360
Alicia Noedel: It easier to deal with.

431
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The room in order for it to be easier to deal with.

432
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:34.530
No.

433
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Does anyone know how to handle overwhelming.

434
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:49.620
Alicia Noedel: Probably

435
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Does Tupac

436
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.130
This

437
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is john the poet.

438
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.420
Alicia Noedel: Probably

439
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see if something emerges in this room where the overwhelming.

440
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be dealt with.

441
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.910
Alicia Noedel: A notebook.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: This activity is about, I don't know how it'll go from here, but we might be about halfway through it. Okay, you got pretty far into it but we there's still a distance to go there certain

565
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:16.080
Certain pieces.

566
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:18.000
Alicia Noedel: Well,

567
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a group to starting in a couple minutes. But first, I want you to, if you can just sort of, let's do a little reflection. Let's see what came up for you. That was important.

568
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.790
Alicia Noedel: I'm fine. I'm okay.

569
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.210

570
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:50.520
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

571
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.540

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I would invite that the

573
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretending to be fine that phenomenon that only you know when those moments are

574
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I am suggesting they may still exist.

575
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we do some more work around that.

576
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can do it safely. We can do it together in that space. But for now, the solving of it, the psycho analysis of it all of the introspection will just vaulted up

577
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're fine. Your muscles are fine, there's actually no danger. Right now, there might be some perceived danger more work to do.
