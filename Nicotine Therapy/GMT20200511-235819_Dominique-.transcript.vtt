15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:01:04.800
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay. So you do. Okay, so stop the share and then you need to go back to when you're sharing the screen, you need to start over, so that I can hear it. And on the bottom, it's going to say turn on audio. There's two little bottom

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.330
Dominique Pozo: Check.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.650
Martin Price: Share computer sound.

19
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.680
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you have to check both of the boxes.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.190
Okay.

21
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.310
Martin Price: I'm not doing it anymore. Hold on.

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.150
Okay.

23
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.590
Martin Price: Alright, so we're going to do this.

24
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.450
Martin Price: Somehow I got out of the

25
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.670
Martin Price: Can you still hear me.

26
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.420
Yes.

27
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.310
Martin Price: I'm trying to

28
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.190
Martin Price: Like maximize the screen here. I can't see the screen anymore.

29
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.580
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Why don't you stop your share

30
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
Martin Price: Oh, I see. Okay. Oh, OK.

31
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.590
OK.

32
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.840
Dominique Pozo: So now you start the share over and then check those two boxes on the bottom.

33
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.670
Dominique Pozo: Are you trying to find you need to also pull the video up so it's on your screen before you share it. That is also very helpful.

34
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.590
Martin Price: Okay.

35
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.650
Martin Price: It's okay. Now, this is great. I'm so happy to hear that you've

36
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.000
Dominique Pozo: created something and

37
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.940
Martin Price: So I still don't know.

38
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.610
Martin Price: Let's see.

39
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.340
Martin Price: I guess I'm still trying to get good at zoom

40
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.670
Martin Price: Now can you see it.

41
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.560
Martin Price: Yes. Okay.

42
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.200
Martin Price: It was really a beautiful day.

43
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.800
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I will leave it.

44
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.340
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that looks deep to me. And there's, it's got all that Rocky patch to

45
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.040
Dominique Pozo: That was awesome. So, so you said this was on your bucket list what what

46
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.140
Martin Price: I'm because you have to climb up

47
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.950
Martin Price: First of all you gotta do it in the spring. Otherwise, there's like really bad avalanche danger else

48
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:42.690
Martin Price: It's a scary and it's by our town. So you got to climb to the top of the ski area which is like a 1700 foot climb then walk across these mountains to get to that drainage, you're just looking into. And then you ski down it. But unfortunately, we have to climb back out.

49
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:55.860
Martin Price: Or it's a seven mile hike to get out of there that basin. So we ran up to that video was done. We were going to start climbing out right

50
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.600
Martin Price: No, it was really it gotten really warm. And so when you stepped on the snow you we need all the way up to your thighs.

51
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.620
Dominique Pozo: Oh, hey guys.

52
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.470
Martin Price: Hey, you can't tell that from the ski picture but

53
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:22.410
Martin Price: So we had a hell of a time. So we had to go find this big rock out Crump cramping and put our skis on our packs and like you know shimmy up these rocks and I thought I was gonna die.

54
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.910
Martin Price: We finally got back up to the top and then walk back over the scary and then skeet back down. So

55
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.500
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that was that this morning or

56
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.720
Martin Price: No, that was yesterday. Yesterday, Yesterday morning we got up there, about eight or something 830

57
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.760
Martin Price: I finally met he kept telling me to get a guy friends I finally met a guy friend up at that area last weekend.

58
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:56.190
Martin Price: Right. He was from Amarillo, so he drove up at three in the morning yesterday. And then we met up there and did all that but

59
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:06.660
Martin Price: You know, I just it climbing on the rocks, trying to get out of there was really, it just took it out of me.

60
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:14.910
Martin Price: I just I there was times and I was like, I didn't think I was going to make it. And now he's retired as kind of fall backwards, you know, and

61
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:23.010
Martin Price: But I knew that I like if I didn't make it up the rocks and I'd have to hike seven miles out from that.

62
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.960
Martin Price: Yeah, that was pretty cool. So that's like, that was one of the ones I've wanted to do for a long time.

63
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:37.410
Dominique Pozo: Awesome. I'm, I'm really happy for you how. So even though you're physically exhausted. How does your spirit feel

64
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:47.970
Martin Price: It feels good. I just was so tired today. You know, I had to work today and it's like I was trying to get motivated and get things done and there's like no amount of coffee could

65
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.550
Martin Price: Kind of get me going, you know, so it was sort of a long day.

66
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.180
Dominique Pozo: When

67
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.590
Martin Price: I still got stuff done. And finally got, you know, a bunch of

68
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.490
Martin Price: Like deliverables in that I needed to get in. So

69
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:11.730
Martin Price: Yeah, I was just glad to get out and do something different because this whole lockdown thing just makes it feel certain trapped, you know,

70
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.010
Martin Price: Can you go to the beach. Are you allowed to or

71
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:36.660
Dominique Pozo: Thankfully I have not had the same experiences so many folks were allowed to go to the beach surfing as any central activity running on the beaches swimming. So we've we've actually been, I can just speak for myself. I have been on a really lovely time during all this. Yeah.

72
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.740
Martin Price: Juicer for

73
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:45.810
Martin Price: Yeah. Oh, you do. Okay, you should wear like a GoPro. I've seen guys but GoPros on the tip of their boards.

74
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:57.300
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think I want to one of my friends was just saying he almost got one at Costco, the other day, and the the view of the reef. Sometimes when you know when you drop into a wave, it's just

75
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:09.450
Dominique Pozo: Like spectacular and it's kind of cool. Yeah, senior video inspired me because I'm often, you know, catching the waves thinking, oh my gosh. I'll never see this again. This is so beautiful and

76
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.560
Martin Price: Because the water gets so shallow and you can see the reef below it.

77
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:23.700
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's shallow and clear. And so we can see the refund the patches of sand and sometimes the fish and yeah yesterday saw these amazing

78
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.390
Martin Price: Moment.

79
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.720
Dominique Pozo: For a moment, because you know you glide right buyer. Yeah.

80
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.110
Yeah.

81
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.430
Dominique Pozo: But

82
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:38.460
Dominique Pozo: I think I would like to get one. Thank you very much. You've really inspired me. I, I, it's, it's just so cool because when we do do these things in nature.

83
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.250
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes we'll never see it again.

84
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.560
Martin Price: Right. Yeah. Those are like

85
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:57.450
Martin Price: The you had to wait until it got cold enough. The night before, so that there was a hard enough surface to ski on but it still wasn't cold enough to firm up the snow underneath so

86
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.050
Martin Price: You know we just had to do it that day. We both wanted to so

87
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.130
Great.

88
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:17.340
Martin Price: But like if you had like some kind of, I mean nobody wears helmets. I'm sure when they're surfing. But if you could, you know, because that's how the amount of GoPro when you're skiing is on your helmet.

89
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.120
Hmm.

90
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.190
Martin Price: Only thing I saw was putting it on the tip of your board or maybe

91
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.070
Martin Price: I don't know, wearing some kind of light like a bicycle helmet or something. Mounting and on that.

92
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.180
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

93
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.310
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so we

94
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.110
Martin Price: Haven't seen people

95
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.760
Martin Price: Like where they

96
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.720
Martin Price: Video what they're doing with a GoPro like on a helmet.

97
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:50.040
Dominique Pozo: I've seen I've seen the GoPro at the tip of people's boards. There are little casings that you can stick it on, although it's a different view than what been

98
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.600
Dominique Pozo: Looking down

99
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.110
Dominique Pozo: On a day when it's not too big could wear some sort of headgear thing too.

100
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:05.310
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. They're pretty light. So how big is big, like 20 feet 15 feet or

101
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:20.430
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean, he kind of call it like had higher overhead or double overhead, and it's been we've had some a big swell lately. The last week. It's been really big like double overhead, like, two times the size of me.

102
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.770
Martin Price: You do those at bay.

103
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.300
Dominique Pozo: No, I don't do that. No.

104
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.650
Martin Price: It's just too scary or like it's hard it's just

105
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:40.140
Dominique Pozo: It's not fun. It's really for me, you know. It's hard. It's hard to get through waves that big for me because I my board. It's not a super short board. It's not a super long word, but it's in the middle and

106
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.610
Dominique Pozo: It's hard to get through.

107
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.420
Dominique Pozo: Waves that big. So I had high is about as high as I like to go

108
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.590
Martin Price: And that's fun.

109
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.420
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, very fun.

110
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.440
Martin Price: Well that's pretty cool.

111
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.190
Yeah.

112
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.510
Martin Price: Oh,

113
00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:00.000
Dominique Pozo: Good. So, so aside from that's so great. What else is on your bucket list. Tell me more about that.

114
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:07.290
Martin Price: You know, like hell this game somewhere. I've never done that cat scheme.

115
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.230
Martin Price: Kayaking

116
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.280
Martin Price: Yeah and this girl I met in Milwaukee. She kayak. So that would be cool for her to

117
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:28.770
Martin Price: Show me how and then I used to sail a lot. So we talked about sailing on Lake Michigan Milwaukee's right on Lake Michigan.

118
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.700
Dominique Pozo: So,

119
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:40.350
Martin Price: I don't know if. Have you ever seen a sailboat called a laser or they had a sudden fish to their about like a 14 foot boat.

120
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.460
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

121
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:49.230
Martin Price: Removable keel, and they're pretty much treacherous and rough water but in

122
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:57.960
Martin Price: You know, fairly calm water. They're really fun you know if there's some good wind and you with two people on them, you can really

123
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:11.100
Martin Price: You can probably get to like 15 or 20 miles an hour. And you know, it's just a really fun experience, but I don't like Lake Michigan is so big it has waves all of its own, you know,

124
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.700
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

125
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:18.600
Dominique Pozo: Well, that sounds really fun when you are telling me about this and all the things you want to do. I have this vision that

126
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.970
Dominique Pozo: Potentially, that could be a lot of play down the line for you, you know,

127
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.250
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. The last year or the last nine months. Anyway, I've been really focusing on

128
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.170
Martin Price: Work.

129
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.260
Martin Price: Trying to get my finances back in order and

130
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.680
Martin Price: You know, keeping my invoicing up

131
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:54.810
Martin Price: So yeah, it'll be like, unfortunately, April, I think she's gonna let her son moved back in. Unfortunately, so she's in a duplex so they'll each have half of it, but

132
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:03.150
Martin Price: You know she had to call the cops on her son and his girlfriend and I don't know her sense. Sounds like a disaster to me.

133
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.800
Martin Price: I guess the idea would be that

134
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:15.870
Martin Price: When we're together. She wanted to spend like every other week. Like if I got a place in Janesville

135
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:23.640
Martin Price: With you know hanging out with me. I think just to get away from that old situation. SHE'S GOT GOING IN MILWAUKEE.

136
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.040
Martin Price: It's

137
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.180
Martin Price: Yeah, I just, I hope I'm not getting into another

138
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.970
Martin Price: You know situation where

139
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:42.390
Martin Price: Like my second marriage, where my wife was so devoted to her daughter and then towards the end of the marriage when I

140
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.860
Martin Price: started focusing more on my daughter, she didn't like that so

141
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.870
Dominique Pozo: Well, I imagine with really clear communication.

142
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Avoid recreating the similar situation, you know, naming like

143
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:03.660
Dominique Pozo: Are you willing to get a pen and a piece of paper out and do a little right in here. I have a few ideas.

144
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:21.960
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so. Okay. Can you name what you do want in this relationship, how you would like it to be. What's your intention. So if you could do one column for intention.

145
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.020
Dominique Pozo: And then

146
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:39.780
Dominique Pozo: How about some expectations. Maybe you can write expectations that you have. So you can become more aware of what those might be

147
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.550
Martin Price: Another column.

148
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:42.960
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm

149
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.590
Dominique Pozo: I am not sure if I want to put it in, but I'm just gonna say fears. So naming any fears that you have

150
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.570
Martin Price: Tension expectations and fears.

151
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.020
Yep.

152
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.820
Martin Price: Okay ever sundown.

153
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.480
Okay.

154
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.880
Martin Price: Like under intentions. I had fun companionship intimacy. So mutual support.

155
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.020
Martin Price: Okay and shared goals.

156
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.660
Martin Price: And then expectations was kind of like understanding and loyalty

157
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:16.620
Mm hmm.

158
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.940
Martin Price: And then under fears. It was fear of her son feeling threatened and not letting her go.

159
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.650
Dominique Pozo: You know, not

160
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.670
Dominique Pozo: letting her go.

161
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.510
Martin Price: Yeah, cuz he he's like 23

162
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.540
Martin Price: And he was married once had two kids from that now he has a girlfriend, she might be pregnant, you know,

163
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:46.680
Martin Price: April is like she takes care of the two kids every other week. And the guy just has kind of a

164
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.570
Martin Price: I don't know if he's bipolar or what, but he

165
00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:04.440
Martin Price: She's in a duplex and she's trying to set it up so he can him and his girlfriend or just him can stay upstairs and then she'll stay downstairs, but

166
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.320
Martin Price: It just sounds like it kind of like swings, like a pendulum like

167
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:25.350
Martin Price: We get back together and then he kind of goes crazy on or he keeps pushing your boundaries, you know. And then finally, She snaps and throws him out or, you know, late, you know, last time she had to call the police and

168
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.510
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know.

169
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.260
Martin Price: I have to be really careful in this one.

170
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:37.200
Dominique Pozo: How much from what you've written down how many of these things.

171
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.040
Dominique Pozo: View All communicated about your intentions, your expectations in your fears.

172
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.600
Martin Price: Mostly just the fun part, you know, and that

173
00:19:51.120 --> 00:20:01.920
Martin Price: You know, I said, well, at least we'll have weekends together. And she said, well, no, no, I won't. I am week I have one weekend and then the whole week you know when she's not taking care of

174
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:10.350
Martin Price: The kids, you know, but her son got it just seems like if he has yet another kid or whatever. It's like

175
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.400
Dominique Pozo: Oh, it's just begun. Yeah.

176
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.880
Martin Price: Yeah, I could just see her having to take care of three kids and, you know,

177
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.410
Martin Price: And

178
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.250
Martin Price: I have to be willing to like

179
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.440
Martin Price: Not sacrifice myself like I've done before, you know, like

180
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:41.790
Martin Price: My second marriage. I just did a lot of therapy. I did a lot of work on, sir, the jealousy. I felt through the

181
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.240
Martin Price: You know, the way

182
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.570
Martin Price: My wife handled her daughter, you know, and what I thought she was like

183
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.470
Martin Price: You know, just a spoiled brat, you know, and

184
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:03.960
Martin Price: But that was like a conversation that if we ever went there. If I ever went there. It was an immediate fight, you know,

185
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.470
Dominique Pozo: hesitant to bring this up with April because of your history, like you're not

186
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:17.490
Martin Price: Talking about really anymore. I mean, I think I would definitely bring this up. I mean, right now it's been all about

187
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:28.140
Martin Price: You know, I've been trying to tell her you know it's your house, you got to set boundaries and you got to hold your ground. And it's like, once you let him back in after this last episode.

188
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.580
Martin Price: It's probably going to all happen again, you know,

189
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:33.270
Dominique Pozo: He'll want to

190
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.150
Martin Price: Bring his girlfriend in and you know

191
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:45.510
Martin Price: And so, so far it's just been me trying to like

192
00:21:46.620 --> 00:22:02.730
Martin Price: Culture and supporter and you know I was basically I didn't think she should let him back in, but she has this guilt, she feels about towards him. You know, I don't know why. Maybe the father left a long time ago. Who knows, and

193
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.180
Dominique Pozo: Do you think she's mirroring back to you.

194
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.270
Dominique Pozo: Your own challenges of setting boundaries. Do you think you've you've magnetized someone who maybe struggles with similar

195
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.010
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

196
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.130
Martin Price: Um, because I, you know, this is like

197
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:31.860
Martin Price: My second wife split because you know she felt like I had this unhealthy relationship with my daughter, because you know I was

198
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.470
Martin Price: Because of the schizophrenia and all that. I didn't know how to take care of her. And so

199
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:46.170
Martin Price: She just got more and more upset with the amount of time that I was spending on taking care Wiley.

200
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.860
Mm hmm.

201
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.200
Martin Price: So yeah, this is like it's almost like

202
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.100
Martin Price: I learned a lot out of that and

203
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:05.220
Martin Price: Kind of like what I learned with Wiley was that if you stick with her and you keep trying to get the therapy and you send her to a

204
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.840
Martin Price: Recovery Center that, you know, now she's doing much better. You

205
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:22.440
Martin Price: Know how to deal with it more. And so if I hadn't hung in there. And if I hadn't coughed up the money to send her a trip to the treatment center. She I don't think she would have gotten any better.

206
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.110
Dominique Pozo: So. Mm hmm.

207
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.480
Martin Price: So like I can empathize with April wanting to take care of her son, but it just

208
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:37.080
Martin Price: You know she thinks she needs to be on medication. And then he needs therapy and he doesn't

209
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.340
Hmm.

210
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:53.550
Dominique Pozo: Well, I mean, it sounds to me like you've established enough of a friendship with this woman and enough trust and being able to talk about the positive things. I'm wondering when the more difficult conversations might

211
00:23:54.570 --> 00:24:00.660
Martin Price: Right. And I don't. It's kind of like, all I can do right now is wait and see what happens.

212
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:11.250
Martin Price: You know if he moves into the upstairs of the duplex and if the girlfriend moves in and then the whole thing reignites and

213
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.010
Martin Price: And he just like

214
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.790
Martin Price: He sounds like a pretty crazy 23 year old, you know,

215
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:34.110
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean, that's a really valid concern and maybe apprehension of what are you opening yourself up to right if you to really engage with this person, which it sounds like there's a lot of

216
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.030
Dominique Pozo: There's a lot of potential, it's just getting really honest.

217
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.270
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's

218
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.960
Martin Price: These are lessons that I went through and

219
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.160
Martin Price: You know, I'm not trying to be mean, or like

220
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.970
Martin Price: I'm compassionate, but it's

221
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:02.820
Martin Price: I don't know, it's just hard situation in this when there's like a crazy kid in the middle of it with two

222
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.020
Martin Price: Daughters, and a series of girlfriends. You know that he

223
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.540
Martin Price: Apparently keeps getting pregnant.

224
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.580
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

225
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.640
Dominique Pozo: Well, I've done by you.

226
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.870
Dominique Pozo: In the next couple of weeks to approach some of these topics and see how it goes.

227
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.250
Martin Price: Yeah.

228
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:41.850
Dominique Pozo: For your own, you know, because what I've heard, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you've, you've really overextended yourself in the past and wanted to make sure that the others. Okay. And maybe bypass some of your concerns or needs or

229
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.170
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so

230
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.470
Martin Price: You're very well identifying my needs.

231
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.660
Martin Price: When it comes to like intimacy and companionship.

232
00:25:52.770 --> 00:26:01.560
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna pull up the needs list again. So I'm going to invite you to make a list of your needs here with her.

233
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.860
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm going to share this screen here.

234
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:29.910
Dominique Pozo: And maybe pick or pick as many as I mean I think most of them are just like I could say yes to all of them. So maybe

235
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.500
Martin Price: That's kind of what I was thinking.

236
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.790
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, maybe pick your top top five. That's I think that's a good

237
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.570
Dominique Pozo: A good number to start with.

238
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.120
Martin Price: Out of the whole list.

239
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.020
Yeah.

240
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.520
Dominique Pozo: The top most five essential

241
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.090
Dominique Pozo: Between five and 10 i get i guess

242
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.660
Dominique Pozo: What are you really what what which words are really alive for you.

243
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.190
Martin Price: Nine instructing

Martin Price: Just read them offer

248
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:47.430
Martin Price: Yeah, just basically there from a list on the left. It was like acceptance appreciation consideration nurturing

249
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.660
Martin Price: Clearly, wait, wait.

250
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.680
Dominique Pozo: Can we can we slow down. I was already losing what you're saying.

251
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:53.940
Dominique Pozo: It's

252
00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:03.420
Dominique Pozo: I THINK YOU READ YOU ARE YOU recited some prayer to me one time and and we slow down with it. So we could really fit. Yeah, let's

253
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.980
Dominique Pozo: Can we try that. Okay.

254
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.350
Martin Price: Acceptance.

255
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.100
Martin Price: And appreciation

256
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.250
Martin Price: Consideration

257
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.910
Martin Price: Nurturing

258
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.030
Martin Price: Trust.

259
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.610
Martin Price: Closeness

260
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.400
Martin Price: Authenticity.

261
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.380
Martin Price: And companionship.

262
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:40.470
Dominique Pozo: When you read those. Did any of them really jumped out at you with like maybe elicit some warmth or

263
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.930
Martin Price: Appreciation.

264
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.160
Martin Price: Appreciation. Yeah. That kind of consideration.

265
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.100
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. So yeah, so it sounds like there's there's a real need to be acknowledged.

266
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.690
Dominique Pozo: Like you have your needs and you want them honored

267
00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.790
Martin Price: Yeah, my

268
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:09.720
Martin Price: You know, I guess I was thinking about it for like my two main relationships for the last 34 years it was like

269
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.620
Martin Price: You know, I was the breadwinner, and all that and

270
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.310
Martin Price: I just never really felt like

271
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.990
Martin Price: There was much appreciation for it.

272
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.830
Dominique Pozo: Have you communicated that to April before

273
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:34.920
Martin Price: April.

274
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:36.570
Martin Price: Know,

275
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.040
Martin Price: About the appreciation

276
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.620
Martin Price: Know about that.

277
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:59.610
Dominique Pozo: It sounds. It sounds like I heard before. We looked at this list, I heard you say you want intimacy and intimacy is definitely past physical intimacy. It's this piece of naming, you know, in a vulnerable way.

278
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:05.910
Dominique Pozo: What we what we wish for desire for what we're afraid of all these things so

279
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.940
Dominique Pozo: I, yeah, I really am going to invite a conversation that is maybe a little more vulnerable.

280
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.250
Dominique Pozo: That goes, maybe a layer deeper around

281
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.310
Dominique Pozo: What you've been through what you haven't

282
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:26.550
Dominique Pozo: Enjoyed that you don't want to recreate and what you do wish to create moving forward.

283
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.000
Martin Price: Yeah, I think it's important. I mean,

284
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.310
Martin Price: I don't want to like

285
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.390
Martin Price: Jump in, as the savior again and try and

286
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.640
Martin Price: Like be the guy that makes everything work between her and her son, you know,

287
00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.990
Martin Price: You know, just like I

288
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.320
Martin Price: Like I really try to

289
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.340
Martin Price: Go at what I felt was great lengths to support

290
00:32:54.420 --> 00:33:00.870
Martin Price: My second wife's daughter, you know, to help her out financially and with vehicles and stuff like that and

291
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.780
Martin Price: She you know her, and I just didn't have any kind of connection at all.

292
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:17.130
Dominique Pozo: Are you have any interest in role playing, and I can play April and and tell you, you know, I'm thinking of letting what's her son's name.

293
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.200
Martin Price: Reese.

294
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.010
Dominique Pozo: I'm thinking of letting Reese come live with me again and

295
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:33.360
Dominique Pozo: Are you willing to give it a try and just maybe voice some concern because I'm not sure how many maybe not necessarily push back. But how much you are challenging her

296
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:45.090
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean I, at first I did. And then I just realized she wasn't it just seemed like what she was going to do you know

297
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:54.480
Dominique Pozo: So, okay, actually, I want to twist this not so much challenging her, but more speaking your needs and your concerns so that she's aware of what's up for you.

298
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.220
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

299
00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.990
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so we're talking and

300
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.860
Dominique Pozo: Cash Marty, I am going to play. April. Now I

301
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:09.360
Dominique Pozo: I'm afraid for Reese, I think I'm gonna let him move back in. I think things are getting a little too out of control and

302
00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:13.800
Dominique Pozo: It's so much I have more

303
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.440
Dominique Pozo: I can just see what's happening when he's near me. So I think I'm gonna let him move back in more for the kids.

304
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.730
Martin Price: At once, but I mean after the last blow up. I'm just worried that it's going to happen again.

305
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.100
Martin Price: I mean,

306
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.530
Martin Price: I get worried you won't even be able to be in your own house, you know,

307
00:34:46.710 --> 00:35:00.930
Dominique Pozo: So I'm going to pause right here. So you're so I'm hearing you speaking about her. And what I am inviting you to do is to speak about you, rather than then your concerns for her. The what comes up for you.

308
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.370
Dominique Pozo: This is where honoring your needs is

309
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.760
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean, it comes across as selfish, but it's like

310
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.630
Martin Price: Are you going to be able to

311
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.680
Martin Price: Like distance yourself from him or

312
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.030
Martin Price: You know,

313
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.890
Martin Price: Trying to figure out the right words even

314
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.210
Dominique Pozo: Why would

315
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:36.900
Dominique Pozo: Why would that be important for you if if she could give him the space to individually and allow them to have their own lives, what, how would that be important for you.

316
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.070
Martin Price: Because then we could move forward and have our own thing going.

317
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:51.480
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like that's a need, you're, you're wanting to develop something with her. And that's something that's important to you.

318
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.990
Martin Price: Yeah, but am I worried about

319
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.140
Martin Price: You know him just like

320
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.590
Martin Price: Throwing out all these land mines that

321
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:12.270
Martin Price: You know ultimately wouldn't let us have like any meaningful long term relationship, I guess.

322
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.750
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. That's, that's really valid.

323
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.280
Dominique Pozo: Um,

324
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.680
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I just want to validate

325
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:33.000
Martin Price: Uh huh. I've always been like, you know, well of course a mother's going to have, you know, this love for son or daughter and, you know,

326
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.320
Martin Price: My needs are secondary to that, you know,

327
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:46.950
Martin Price: And then it's always that fear that, you know, if I push back too hard, that they'll get pissed off and and not want to be in a relationship anymore.

328
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.600
Martin Price: Yeah, so there's that fear component to

329
00:36:53.220 --> 00:37:09.030
Dominique Pozo: So how can you share all of this. Imagine I'm her. I just I just said, You know, I think I'm gonna let Reese come move back in for the kids. I just, I'm trying to think of them. And I'm afraid that if he is out there on his own. It's just going to get even more chaotic.

330
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:11.970
Martin Price: All right.

331
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.660
Martin Price: Just worry that you know

332
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:22.320
Martin Price: Eventually you're going to be taking care of the kids full time and you're not going to have any time to for us.

333
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.960
Martin Price: Yeah, that's kind of, basically. Yeah.

334
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:51.930
Dominique Pozo: Are you willing to switch roles and I can be you and you can be her. Can I try something out for you and see how that how it feels when I communicate. So okay, so will you be April and just share with me whatever you want to share about Reese.

335
00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:06.540
Martin Price: I've changed all the locks and I've moved all my stuff downstairs, and I've either put his stuff in the truck or in the hallway and those guys are going after he's gonna have to move it upstairs and self.

336
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:19.380
Martin Price: But he he texted me and he apologized and that really meant a lot to me. And so

337
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.840
Martin Price: I'm gonna let him move back in that not his girlfriend, because she was a monster to me.

338
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.430
Martin Price: And we'll see where it goes from there.

339
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:46.980
Dominique Pozo: April, I have to be honest, I noticed when you tell me you know what you're considering doing and where this may lead

340
00:38:48.330 --> 00:39:05.820
Dominique Pozo: I notice I some fear and concern comes up for me. And the biggest fear for me is that I want to develop a relationship with you and I'm afraid that having your son so close in is not going to allow that to happen. A I'm afraid that

341
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:15.990
Dominique Pozo: His ups and downs are going to get in the way of you know any potential for us to to really develop something of our own.

342
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:23.010
Dominique Pozo: Because I see how much you care for him, and how, in a sense, you know, you want to rescue him and and

343
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:32.520
Dominique Pozo: that worries me because I have. I've got you know I'm dreaming and I'm having hopes for us. And I am wondering if I'm

344
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.720
Dominique Pozo: If they may not happen.

345
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.160
Martin Price: Yeah, cuz he'll kind of take over your life.

346
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:49.920
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, how does it sound when I when I delivered that. How did that. Did you did you notice as April. Did you get defensive or

347
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.590
Martin Price: It sounded exactly like Pam me

348
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.000
Dominique Pozo: Who is Pam.

349
00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.630
Martin Price: Pam was my second wife, and that's just exactly where she was coming from. It's like you've been

350
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:16.800
Martin Price: Seeing you get depressed starting six years ago, or eight years ago when Miley started having this thing and she's just been manipulating you and you know you spend more time caring about her than you do me and

351
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.420
Dominique Pozo: So,

352
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.930
Martin Price: Like I judged her for that. But in reality, that's where she was feeling and she was just saying it to me.

353
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:44.760
Dominique Pozo: An interesting that you've called in the same or a similar situation. Now you're on the other end. What do you think, what do you think the big lesson here could potentially be or the big growth, you know, the big growth potential.

354
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.970
Dominique Pozo: For you.

355
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.600
Martin Price: Would be like

356
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.830
Martin Price: Just don't pursue it any further the relationship, you know,

357
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.250
Martin Price: Well, because it would be like

358
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.500
Martin Price: Um,

359
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.540
Martin Price: I don't know. It just seems like kind of a recipe for disaster if she can't

360
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.780
Martin Price: Let go of caretaking for her son.

361
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:16.800
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

362
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:23.460
Martin Price: I mean, my whole excuses that Wiley had schizophrenia, you know, but him didn't buy into that.

363
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:31.380
Martin Price: And Reese, they are. I mean, April things her son, you know, needs medication and therapy but

364
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.970
Martin Price: Man, I just don't know what to say.

365
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:49.500
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, this is the tricky one. It's it I'm seeing this is very interesting to me that you're experiencing both sides now because you've been in the position with Wiley and now you're having feelings that similar to Pam's so

366
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.210
Martin Price: This is really even before Wiley, that whole thing, or I thought, Pam was

367
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.670
Martin Price: Totally enabling her daughter, but I had to really stuff those feelings, you know,

368
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.540
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering if

369
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:12.780
Dominique Pozo: The big growth here without making any decisions of move forward and the whatever is not stuffing your feelings I

370
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.890
Martin Price: Think you're right.

371
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:27.840
Dominique Pozo: I think without making any drastic black or white, you know, determinations. It's simply how can you express yourself and and really honor what you're feeling without judging it making it wrong, thinking that you're

372
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.070
Martin Price: Not feeling like I'm being a big baby or, you know,

373
00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.880
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know why I feel like that, or why I'm that way.

374
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:41.940
Martin Price: I just have a really hard time expressing you know my needs. I always feel like I'm being a baby.

375
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.860
Dominique Pozo: I think I can relate. You know, I think it's, um,

376
00:42:49.380 --> 00:43:06.600
Dominique Pozo: I think it's a part of the process of learning to really honor you know what you want and what you need. And it's not not caring what anyone thinks yet really honored and saying, hey, these are valid feelings, this is these are valid needs and

377
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.300
Dominique Pozo: This is me, you know, basically.

378
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.490
Martin Price: Yeah, and be willing to

379
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.260
Martin Price: Know what the word is expression and accept the consequences, you know,

380
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:22.800
Definitely

381
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:28.050
Martin Price: The consequences must have been when I grew up, must not have been good.

382
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.970
Martin Price: You know, because I certainly am fearful of expressing it.

383
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.790
Dominique Pozo: Well, what I'm hearing too is that you're fearful that

384
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.170
Dominique Pozo: You won't be loved or accepted if you

385
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:44.490
Dominique Pozo: Can

386
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:50.670
Martin Price: Be really, I wanted to have somebody to hang out with and Wisconsin, you know,

387
00:43:52.770 --> 00:44:08.250
Martin Price: And we talked about all these you know cool things to do like sailing kayaking and hiking and you know she's a great cook years always showing me these dishes, she cooked and everything you know and like

388
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.260
Martin Price: Of course,

389
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.510
Martin Price: I project and

390
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:20.820
Martin Price: Think about, oh, the weeks were together. You know, I could come home to a nice meal and be taken care of and that kind of thing.

391
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:22.290
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

392
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.660
Martin Price: And then I don't know. Reese will get shot in the head and she'll have to take care of the kids forever.

393
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.280
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Um, I think.

394
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:46.230
Dominique Pozo: I think it's very natural and human and healthy to start dreaming and and it seems like you're hitting a point where you're you're wanting to get real with okay we've been talking about all these dreams. What is the reality.

395
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.640
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

396
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.970
Martin Price: LT that she can really

397
00:44:52.230 --> 00:45:03.930
Martin Price: Leave you know for a weekend and the following week and not have to worry about Reese and his girlfriend and the kids or is it just going to be like this.

398
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.850
Martin Price: You know, kind of non stop circus where there's always going to be something that

399
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.780
Martin Price: flaring up there because of him.

400
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.600
Martin Price: I guess I don't understand why he's not working.

401
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.220
Martin Price: Gotten there it's kind of hard in the beginning of a relationship to like

402
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:37.950
Martin Price: Know where to draw the line and what to say about somebody else's kids, you know, I've never even met this woman, and like, but just everything we've texted about and everything. It's

403
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.560
Martin Price: He doesn't sound like he's

404
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.980
Martin Price: As very good values, you know,

405
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.920
Dominique Pozo: Have you all done any FaceTime, yep.

406
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.300
Martin Price: No, you know, that's a good idea, like to do a zoom

407
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.130
Dominique Pozo: I think I'm

408
00:45:53.310 --> 00:46:11.130
Dominique Pozo: Scared. Yeah, I think before anything. It'd be really good to have some as much contact as possible because it you know there's a lot of fantasies building and if you haven't seen each other yet. I think that seems like a really realistic next step.

409
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.940
Martin Price: Yeah, we've created a lot of photos and everything like that, but

410
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:23.700
Martin Price: No, maybe, each one of us is fearful to do that, or who knows I you know this whole online dating things, especially when you're talking about

411
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.750
Martin Price: 1500 miles apart, everything

412
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.650
Yeah.

413
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.210
Martin Price: You know, there's a letter really like about her. And then, but the hurt.

414
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.400
Martin Price: Yeah, the whole thing with their son is kind of scary.

415
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.350
Martin Price: And he, I mean, I hate to say it just looks like a thug, you know,

416
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:58.230
Martin Price: And I'm not really like like I kind of think about, well, like, what if I ever wanted to stay there, you know, and I was like, Oh my God, he's like, flip out

417
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:06.240
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean it. I don't, I don't want to get dramatic, but I don't hear that you feel that safe in the situation.

418
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:09.420
Martin Price: Well yeah, I just don't know.

419
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.170
Yeah.

420
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.500
Martin Price: So yeah, I'm gonna have to like

421
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.690
Martin Price: You really I don't know careful and express my needs and

422
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:26.700
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know if I'm ready to do the whole zoom meeting with her yet but

423
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.750
Martin Price: I mean, I've heard her talking on the phone and stuff like that.

424
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:50.250
Dominique Pozo: I think there's a lot that gets read by the visual cues to and getting a sense you know a felt sense of someone that it seems seems important to to have some sort of real time contact like this.

425
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.150
Yeah.

426
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.040
Martin Price: And then like

427
00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.080
Martin Price: You know,

428
00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:01.020
Martin Price: If we started phone calls or FaceTime, would they have to be like scheduled every day. I really

429
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.850
Martin Price: Can't really

430
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:14.730
Martin Price: Talk during the day, like that. I mean, I can text, but I can't really talk and then by evening. It's like, time to go walk the dogs eat and go to bed, you know, and then do it all again the next day.

431
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.370
Dominique Pozo: Well, these are good. These are good boundaries and limits to be clear on you know

432
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:22.680
Martin Price: Yeah.

433
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.770
Dominique Pozo: I think you have a lot of opportunities here.

434
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.510
Dominique Pozo: Mighty of opportunity.

435
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:34.830
Dominique Pozo: To know what your limits are what you're comfortable with what you're not what what you don't want to recreate there's a lot

436
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:44.070
Martin Price: I think she's probably just as, like, you know, it took a while before she opened up about her sign and everything like that and

437
00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.650
Martin Price: You know she's probably

438
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:57.270
Martin Price: I'm sure she was it took her a while before she would like to start sharing about what he was really doing, you know,

439
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:05.280
Martin Price: So she I'm sure she has. I guess what I'm saying is I'm sure she has her fears to, you know,

440
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.720
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

441
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.690
Martin Price: It's sort of a pretty much a ball and chain that she's got around her and

442
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:25.590
Dominique Pozo: I imagine I wonder, you know, if you start sharing some of your fears, I wonder, she's actually has similar ones, and it might actually that is the intimacy piece that

443
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:33.720
Dominique Pozo: Might be in the conversation for her to say I know I'm afraid of the same thing I really want the same thing, or whatever.

444
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:40.050
Dominique Pozo: You know, I really want, what you want to. And this is in something that's

445
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:46.620
Dominique Pozo: Hard to consider. Whatever. Whatever, I don't want to put any words in her mouth. I don't know who she is. But

446
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.290
Martin Price: Yeah, and it's like, so far we just kept the conversation.

447
00:49:53.430 --> 00:50:00.180
Martin Price: Not so much about the future. Just going like, what's been going on. And you know, I don't even know when I'm going back

448
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:01.470
Martin Price: Is part of the problem.

449
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:02.280
Martin Price: It's like I keep

450
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:13.920
Martin Price: Like I found a rental. And she was going to look at it and it both through because there was a scammer. And then another rental and they did already got picked up and she keeps saying to go look at it and

451
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:25.830
Martin Price: So yeah, it's like I need to try and figure out if I'm going to rent a house and bring my dogs. They're just leaving here, what

452
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:32.220
Martin Price: And you're just kind of on hold because this whole whole coven thing because

453
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.330
Martin Price: The company is saying, you know, like

454
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:51.660
Martin Price: The State of Wisconsin should lift the restrictions, you know, towards the end of May, but we're not really quite sure how we're going to respond to it. You know, like we're going to keep you guys in to physically separated teams. So in case one.

455
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:57.750
Martin Price: team gets the virus than the other team can at least keep most of the word going

456
00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:00.840
Martin Price: Oh, there's just all this weird

457
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.530
Dominique Pozo: You know,

458
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.040
Martin Price: They may leave me here for the whole summer.

459
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:06.090
Martin Price: Well, no.

460
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.260
Dominique Pozo: It's just like

461
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.010
Martin Price: I feel like I'm in a wartime situation or something like we're

462
00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.950
Martin Price: Star crossed lovers writing letters and World War one or something.

463
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.020
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it sounds like it. It's just

464
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.970
Dominique Pozo: Such a strange time

465
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.410
Martin Price: Yeah, it is.

466
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.790
Martin Price: I keep forgetting about it, but it's it's out there.

467
00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:32.190
Dominique Pozo: Well, what do you think would be something that would maybe kind of

468
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:44.370
Dominique Pozo: Look like you leaning into an edge of discomfort with her. I'm gonna really encourage you to kind of move into something that's not comfortable and and then see what happens when you actually

469
00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:47.850
Dominique Pozo: lean into

470
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:54.480
Martin Price: I mean, part of it is like what if I meet her. I don't like her. And I've already like gone into this whole

471
00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:01.920
Martin Price: You know, try to get all this intimacy going and you find out there that are that you don't like.

472
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:14.040
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think this is at least I'm going to propose this possibility that this is about a process and you're being faced with your fears your patterns.

473
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:22.920
Dominique Pozo: Your so there's some learning whether you end up liking her or not you're getting these opportunities to break patterns or do things differently.

474
00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:30.600
Martin Price: To do the therapy thing. That'd be good, like do counseling with you, like I talked about with Michelle.

475
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.090
Dominique Pozo: Sure, for sure. I'm so happy to

476
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:33.660
Dominique Pozo: Do that.

477
00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:42.030
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah, it is hard for me. I don't know why I'm here. I am six years old. And it's like, I can't even say what I want, you know,

478
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:51.330
Dominique Pozo: Oh I it just takes practice. And I love working with couples. So if you want to bring her in. It's actually one of my favorite. I love couples and family, work.

479
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.680
Martin Price: Alright, well that's a thought. I don't know.

480
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.590
Martin Price: I guess I could broach the subject with her.

481
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.920
Martin Price: Sure, yeah. I've never seen you and

482
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.570
Martin Price: Worried about your son.

483
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:21.090
Dominique Pozo: I really keep highlighting that you're putting it on her when it's it's really convenient to not own what's up for you, you know,

484
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:25.920
Martin Price: And that is what's up for me.

485
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:36.450
Dominique Pozo: Right. But it's saying I'm worried about your son and and then there's more. Because here's what I'm needing and wanting and I'm afraid that might not be met.

486
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.700
Martin Price: Okay, don't just like

487
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:43.740
Martin Price: make it sound like they have this bad situation.

488
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.520
Dominique Pozo: I think it's completing the concern which it comes back to you.

489
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.440
Martin Price: Okay. All right.

490
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.190
Yeah.

491
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:55.890
Martin Price: Okay, well,

492
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.790
Martin Price: I'll have to get some bravery together for this one.

493
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:14.670
Dominique Pozo: Let's check in. Let's do a check in, because we did a lot you know the real plane stirs up a lot and even considering all these things. What, what are you noticing right now. What are you feeling, if you could put it in a phrase. What is, what would that be

494
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.310
Martin Price: I guess I'm fearful or scared of like going to the next level like that.

495
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:32.940
Dominique Pozo: Have intimacy with her.

496
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:38.610
Martin Price: Yeah yeah yeah talking about my own vulnerabilities and everything I've done it a little bit, but

497
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.680
Martin Price: Not to that extent.

498
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:48.180
Dominique Pozo: What is the fear is it the fear of potential loss and rejection or is it the

499
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.580
Fear. Okay. Yeah.

500
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:52.740
Martin Price: Yeah.

501
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.030
Okay.

502
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:57.720
Martin Price: Fear of rejection.

503
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.470
Martin Price: Some somebody that

504
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:06.390
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, well, I'm going to invite you to keep being with that and

505
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:21.120
Dominique Pozo: And tending to that so that and really maybe looking deeply within like okay, what is that part that is afraid to be rejected, who, who's that coming from what part of me is that, you know,

506
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:32.580
Dominique Pozo: Because that's the the invitation for the until we meet again is to think about, you know, what does that rejection tied to and

507
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.850
Dominique Pozo: How can you keep soothing yourself with the possibility that that may happen or may not

508
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:43.830
Yeah.

509
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:48.270
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

510
00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:59.460
Dominique Pozo: And it's rooted in something historical so I just wanted to kind of validate an honor to that these fears don't come out of nowhere.

511
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:12.240
Martin Price: Every, every therapists and counselors, said the exact same thing to me. You know, it comes from somewhere in your childhood. That way you know your razor either. You didn't get

512
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.980
Martin Price: Like any nurturing from your mom or

513
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:28.230
Dominique Pozo: Or it could have happened in relationships. This isn't necessarily, you know, your parents fault or a caretaker. This could have been as an as an adult. You've played out a pattern that has

514
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:33.000
Dominique Pozo: Led to, oh gosh, I don't want to experience this again and it could have happened.

515
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:35.040
Martin Price: Yeah, that's possible. Yeah.

516
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.300
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like this real basic need and

517
00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.700
Martin Price: It's very

518
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.550
Martin Price: Because causes me a lot of pain when it happened when I go through the whole rejection thing.

519
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.260
Martin Price: Or relationship breakups

520
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.200
Martin Price: It's just like, oh my god, they're horrible, you know,

521
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.970
Dominique Pozo: Well, you're not alone, Marty.

522
00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:55.560
Martin Price: Yeah.

523
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.480
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

524
00:56:59.760 --> 00:56:59.910
Martin Price: It.

525
00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:02.100
Dominique Pozo: Makes sense.

526
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.490
Dominique Pozo: Okay, this hour flew by. When

527
00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.290

528
00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:10.470

538
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:54.150
Dominique Pozo: Sounds great. Why don't you just when you figure out your schedule. I'll see where I'm at, at that point, and we'll look at the calendars.

539
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:56.400
Martin Price: I'll be expecting a video though.

540
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.990
Dominique Pozo: Well, I don't have a GoPro

541
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.390
Martin Price: Like you can put it on your head like those lamps that the mind.

542
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.370
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I

543
00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:18.630
Martin Price: Actually do have that kind of mouth. That's I'm not kidding, it's like a just a strap that goes around your head in it. Now it's right there.

544
00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:24.030
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm inspired. I'm not sure if I'll have it by the end of this week, but I'm definitely inspired. Thank you.

545
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:25.890
Martin Price: I think it'd be cool to

546
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:34.440
Martin Price: You know, to get because like when I was watching the ski video. It really made me like I could get into it really easily.

547
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:35.130
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

548
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:43.860
Martin Price: I would think surfing, it'd be the exact same thing. Like you're waiting for this moment to like jump on the other side of the wave, you know, and

549
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.020
Martin Price: It just sounds fun.

550
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:56.790
Dominique Pozo: It sure does. Totally. And I'm thinking I could I could you I could put it, if it was like a headlamp I could put it around my neck when I'm paddling out and

551
00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.280
Dominique Pozo: Pop up. I just pop it up.

552
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.650
Martin Price: Yeah, and they are waterproof so

553
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.910
Martin Price: I don't know. They might be like for $2

554
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.140
Dominique Pozo: They are. That's another consideration, my friend just left. He's like, I didn't know if I wanted to drop

555
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:13.800
Dominique Pozo: $450 yesterday on this camera but um

556
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:18.300
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. But the video qualities, really good.

557
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.240
Martin Price: Yeah, it's amazing optics.

558
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.390
Dominique Pozo: Hmm. Cool. Okay.

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.010
