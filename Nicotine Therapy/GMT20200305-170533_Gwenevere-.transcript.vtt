Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I had a little bit of a computer thing. So I'm on my laptop.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.400

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.620
Right.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like,

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.020
Cynthia We: Wow.

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.220
Cynthia We: It was like weird

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It was like poltergeists D.

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.330
Cynthia We: Wow. So I hope you have a way to get it fixed like like

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.000
Cynthia We: Did you have the board.

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.440
Cynthia We: Well,

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's on.

19
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It came back on. Um, I haven't voted it back up. I mean, I'm just gonna stay here on the laptop until

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I can like deal

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.680
Cynthia We: Oh, that just happened today.

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Or an hour ago.

23
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.680
Cynthia We: Oh my goodness. Yeah.

24
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's it's it's backup and I'm just going to assume that

25
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it was a power surge.

26
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.180
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.590
Cynthia We: And yeah.

28
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe that's all and

29
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.820
Cynthia We: Hopefully you have it plugged into a surge protector.

30
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's hope, but it doesn't visually look like that.

31
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:40.950
Cynthia We: Oh, okay. So, Gwen. That's the first thing that you must do is go purchase a surge protector. If you do not have it plugged into one.

32
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

33
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:53.670
Cynthia We: Mysteriously like my cousin got, um, she got hurt the front the tree out in front of her house got struck by lightning.

34
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.450
Cynthia We: Or something like that. And it created a power surge in her house and it fried everything that was not connected to a surge protector.

35
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:18.450
Cynthia We: Just freak like all of her all of her VCR her TV all electronic equipment got fried her computer was plugged into a surge protector, it was safe yes meal. Okay.

36
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.340
Cynthia We: Well, not, not sure, very important.

37
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe that's the message I needed and

38
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.020
Cynthia We: That said, mine is not

39
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.980
Cynthia We: Isn't plugged into the wall like an idiot.

40
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so yeah, something to my to do list.

41
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.560
Cynthia We: So scout went off to work.

42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:54.090
Cynthia We: He's meeting the truck and loading today. And he's been at the office all week. I'm putting stuff together. He is

43
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.910
You know, just

44
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.670
Cynthia We: He just needs to go to work. He's just a shadow work. And then, and then, you know, things can calm down around here he freaked out on Teague. And last night.

45
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.490
Cynthia We: I came home from working out and Teagan

46
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:24.120
Cynthia We: He anti gun. We're talking, but it seems that maybe Scott had gotten big and angry and trick taking out taking it was like cuddled down was crying.

47
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.890
Cynthia We: And I'm

48
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:38.340
Cynthia We: Scott was apologizing, but I know it was about because I totally I had asked him to do his homework and he had promised that he would do it and

49
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:48.630
Cynthia We: And he just ignores is. I mean, this is this job is a 13 year olds. It is his job to ignore us and not do what we ask, but

50
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.930
Cynthia We: He has to understand that it makes us really mad.

51
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:13.140
Cynthia We: Why, why does he have to understand, um, because he acts so surprised. Every time it happens. I'm like, but you are ignoring us and playing on the computer and not doing your dishes and not doing your homework. Like, why don't you be bad.

52
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.170
Cynthia We: Makes perfect sense to me. Okay, let's take this as a let's deconstruct that yes, work with that.

53
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.020
Or

54
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.690
Maybe not.

55
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.790
Maybe

56
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.010
Cynthia We: What he needs to learn is there'll be a consequence. And it's my anger. Oh, yeah.

57
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.830
That's what you learned

58
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.590
Cynthia We: Now you're hoping oh I consequences and anger.

59
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.740
Cynthia We: What my consequences were out you know they were outrageous.

60
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.920
Cynthia We: Outrageous. Yeah, they did. They made no sense. No.

61
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They didn't. They didn't match the crime at all.

62
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.430
Cynthia We: No. So I think that that is the important thing that they have to match the crime.

63
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.410
Cynthia We: We have, we have I, this was Scott dealing with it though. Not me. I, I

64
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:20.670
Cynthia We: Walk. I went and I exercise last night and I got enough sleep, I was very into taking care of myself because this is going to all fall on me in just a day or two.

65
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we can do go a lot of different places. I will tell you it's been on my mind. I've been if I can I share something I've been thinking about with Scott. Yeah.

66
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The elephant, then sometimes the elephant is your shame that we don't address directly, but sometimes it's his anger.

67
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.140
Cynthia We: Yeah.

68
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the elephant in the room. We're not talking about it shows up in in in individual therapy. It shows them in couples, it shows up in family, which we haven't done, but, um, you know, when we talk about parenting. It's there, too.

69
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like, well, I'll let I'll let that anger work for tea. And over here, maybe tins response to his anger will finally get Scott's attention this anger has been something that's been playing with we're trying to go at it and various ways.

70
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Initially I thought there was domestic violence. I told you that I'm transparent and

71
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do with it because

72
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I've you are. You want to spend the rest of your life with it. Is this so

73
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa, unacceptable that you want to say this needs undivided attention and and Scott, it must stop.

74
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is not okay not okay. I mean, okay. And you, this is what we're modeling for the kids. It's got to stop. We need some so but I don't know that might be me. Because remember, right. I know, go ahead.

75
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:59.910
Cynthia We: I do, I do feel like I'm that explosive anger that like crazy anger.

76
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:11.580
Cynthia We: Mm hmm. That scares me is not okay. And it's not okay to scare the kids, either. I don't think, um, I wasn't here when it happened, but

77
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:23.130
Cynthia We: You know, it should just happened like three weeks ago and I initially I thought, well, it's so infrequent that it's it's okay like he's working on it.

78
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:35.910
Cynthia We: But I got him a list of therapists, I tried you know because I thought maybe grief was we talked in here. I think about him getting therapy or I don't know who I talked to a lot it but I'm

79
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.510
Not

80
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, you're not doing it.

81
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:51.030
Cynthia We: He's not any doesn't take it seriously he agreed that he would. And then he just blows it off. Every time I've given him names I've given him names of people in network and out of network.

82
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.730
Cynthia We: People who deal with grief.

83
00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.960
Cynthia We: He's he doesn't think it's hidden think he's the problem I'm the problem Antiguans the problem.

84
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.990
Cynthia We: And soon, I'm sure, Lola will be the problem.

85
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.390
Cynthia We: I'm saying that facetiously. Yeah, I understand.

86
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll work with what we can. So I heard a yes it's got your attention and it's a

87
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.870
Cynthia We: Concern

88
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Tried to invite it to be addressed.

89
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's also you drawing the line with your own anger. So just notice how in your language that it's still the parenting technique of first choice he needs to understand we're going to get angry. No, he doesn't. Whoa.

90
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What else could he learn from because we're shaping these little minds to say, look for postponing immediate pleasure for long term.

91
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Gain. You know what I mean, we gotta do our homework. I know it's inconvenient.

92
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're right this is a little

93
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Space here and then they go out into

94
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Go out and not

95
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Their boss actually does. Wait, let's see. Well, wait, if I don't do my work, I got to understand my boss will yell at me.

96
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, that won't work. The whole course will probably have that environment. If this family stays the way it is. That'll be really comfortable for familiar for him to get mad when understand it now.

97
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now consequence right lose my job.

98
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't perform I lose my job. I don't get a promotion. I get written up

99
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't get to join this particular group of people. I don't get the opportunities that someone that performs better

100
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But he doesn't need to understand this boss is getting get mad at him.

101
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.790
Cynthia We: Right, that's not a good thing. I mean,

102
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.040
Cynthia We: Help him at all.

103
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:02.820
No.

104
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're waiting

105
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: For that to be enough, the threat of you being angry and a lot of people do that. They use the lecture. They do the anger as a threat like that should be enough, you should care to prevent me from being angry prevent me from being angry that should motivate you.

106
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.640
Cynthia We: Know,

107
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.610
Cynthia We: He really cares about the consequences and the consequences. Just have to happen, right.

108
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: They have to have one yeah we go here, often

109
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo what's up too much, but it is hard for you.

110
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To follow them.

111
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:46.560
Cynthia We: And it's so hard for Scott. Scott thinks he's being mean the same thing with me. I'm feel like we're being mean if we take things away because he cares so much about them.

112
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.780
Cynthia We: Well that makes them perfect

113
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.960
Cynthia We: To take away his phone for a little bit, or his headphones or

114
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But it makes sense to you. Just notice your logic. Right. But it makes sense.

115
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.670
To yell.

116
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.940
Cynthia We: Yelling is like the much to me. It's the milder form.

117
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.700
Cynthia We: It's not helpful.

118
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work in a lot of ways, but I will tell you, most people do it.

119
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.330
Cynthia We: Well, most yeah

120
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Most, most people know. So you're not alone.

121
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:32.010
Cynthia We: I like yeah i i don't like it. I don't like it because I don't think it's helpful.

122
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:39.690
Cynthia We: I think the real goal is to change behavior and teach for the future and

123
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.660
Cynthia We: That waiting until your boss gets mad or your

124
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.420
Cynthia We: Whoever gets mad, is that

125
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:59.940
Cynthia We: I don't know, it would have helped me maybe to not to have like realistic consequences and and

126
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You've written them down. We've literally

127
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.230
Cynthia We: Sentences right

128
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's fun. And there's this sort of hierarchy.

129
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:27.660
Cynthia We: Um, so one question I have for you is do we, I read a little bit about natural consequences natural consequences, being that he messes up at school, he goes to a very small school they care a lot, do we just let the teacher deal

130
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you mean the incomplete sense it's finished. Each one of those. Let me hear him.

131
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.640
Cynthia We: Oh, instead of us.

132
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:45.810
Cynthia We: He has these assignments do these two assignments do that are overdue. Yeah, we were backed off on homework, up until like he missed a little bit of school.

133
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:56.280
Cynthia We: And we would conference with the teachers and they told us the things that he was behind him. So Scott got really involved in homework again.

134
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:11.100
Cynthia We: And this is the last two assignments from the past that are due and they're both do for science and he made a promise to us that if he could go to young playwrights yesterday.

135
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:20.850
Cynthia We: From four o'clock until 630 that he would come home and he would do these these assignments. This is one assignment anyway.

136
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:31.050
Cynthia We: And then he came home and he said on the computer. And I asked him to do the homework and he didn't do the homework. Um, and then I came home and Scott had freaked out.

137
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:45.300
Cynthia We: So maybe that I'm wondering if the correct solution would just be to let the teacher and let his consequences at school happen.

138
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.910
Cynthia We: Rather than us exerting all this power and trying to control

139
00:13:53.430 --> 00:14:00.600
Cynthia We: Trying to control his outcome. Maybe the consequence is that he gets a bad grade for the first time in his life, and he has to like

140
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.760
Deal with a lot out

141
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:04.860
Well,

142
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I think he was getting get bad grades really get kicked out of the school that you guys are spending all this money on. No. Okay.

143
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you have choices which makes it hard, because you have to make a decision. But remember how we started. You haven't even tried

144
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.880
Cynthia We: Right to use progressive discipline. Right.

145
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.030
Cynthia We: Yeah.

146
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Before he gets to high school.

147
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:36.990
Right.

148
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When grades really go on the record.

149
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't it be nice to actually have some power in your authority.

150
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.120
Cynthia We: Now, yeah.

151
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're talking about the teacher. Yeah, natural consequence.

152
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure, but our job. I know is to be the external executive functioning, they don't have it right, we're taking it personally. Scott is taking it personally.

153
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.850
Cynthia We: It is personal. Yeah.

154
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just would prefer to do what you prefer to do that is a normal development in brain of a 13 year old right

155
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You represent that part of the brain and as inconvenient as it is for you. That's the deal right

156
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've already told me, hey, I'm not even that great at myself.

157
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So either throw your hands up and just use what you always did, which was anger or this is going to be inconvenient Sunday.

158
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.720
Cynthia We: I know

159
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Well, I know you know intellectually

160
00:15:52.050 --> 00:16:03.060
Cynthia We: I do know, but I must do it, I must do it, and I should have been practicing while Scott was here because I'm going to have to do it all when he's not here.

161
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be easier without him there. The truth of the matter is not one less dynamic to have to deal with.

162
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you want your more, as always, you're more than welcome to do family therapy and I'm happy to meet with you, you've had that open to you. Always. You already know how it goes.

163
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: In general, care about everybody in there.

164
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't want to be that teacher that were. You don't have to do this hard work you you can do this doesn't say to you. Yes, you can. It's literally just tolerating

165
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 seconds. I'm doing it. Okay, okay, has 60 seconds, always having a tantrum. Oh shit.

166
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Having a fit. Okay. We did say we knew this was going to happen. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. He's going to find out if I'm really going to follow through. Whoa, whoa, this is horrible or hate it. I'm going to go

167
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To go for a walk. I'm gonna I'm gonna text when. Oh, it's awful. Oh, I hate it. I hate it. What if he hates me. Oh, it's bringing back all these things, of how I let him down. Oh my gosh. All this stuff's coming up. Oh, it's I hate it. I hate it.

168
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you're going to have to sit with that.

169
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then he gets to find out.

170
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That time and then again he's going to do it and a third time he's going to do it.

171
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And at some point, he's gonna say

172
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

173
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.240
Cynthia We: Well as well. Do these damn sentences, because it's a lot easier than anything else.

174
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Giving me more.

175
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just getting harder.

176
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.990
Cynthia We: Now got homework on sentences.

177
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Homework on sentences, but he's going to have more times because he's gonna have no screen time pretty soon.

178
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, plenty of time to do that. So, and then it's also you'll have time because you won't be doing this thing on Saturday, you'll have time to do that. Or you'll sit right next to me while I'm

179
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Working and you can do it right next to me mean there's lots of different ways to be that negative reinforcer that irritating thing that kind of like a good grief, but you have to hold on to you.

180
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's let's see what you do with the punishment has to fit the crime.

181
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up in your when I say you know what Seguin

182
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to be yelling I'm working on not yelling, I don't like how I feel. I don't like the message that it sends to you so

183
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's how it's going to go. I'm going to remind you once cuz I'm your executive functioning and I get that this huge developmental age.

184
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'm not going to remind again. I'm just going to walk in with a piece of paper and it's going to have a sense that I want you to write 10 times and you have to get it done in the next 10 minutes or I will be adding another 10. Do you have any questions.

185
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: No. What the fuck are you talking about, he says, fucking crazy lady, I don't know what he says.

186
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say, well, I know it's weird. I usually would be yelling right about now.

187
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm seeing someone she's got some ideas. I'm going to see if this works where I can actually show you a consequence, and I'm not

188
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: emoting and yelling, I want to see if we both kind of feel better and you have a choice. You know, I have a choice about my yelling, I just come at you with the yelling

189
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have a choice right now and I'm putting it up in front of you. This is what its gonna look like. In fact, here's the sentence say it's going to look like this. I do my homework within three hours of arriving home.

190
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's a sense, you'll be writing 10 times you'll have 10 minutes. That's a lot of time to write that tiny little sentence, I love you, kid do the right thing. This is your choice. I'll come and check in your half hour and see how you doing your homework, you walk up

191
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

192
00:19:50.730 --> 00:20:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a law like I don't have to look up the law that I know killings NOT RIGHT. I KNOW. KNOW WHAT Federal offense and love misdemeanor. What, what, but I kind of know what they are, in general, and my community, my society. I can't steal

193
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know if I speed. Eventually I do get caught. Sometimes I'm terrible speaker.

194
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But I would deserve it. I like you should have copy the last few years, which really bad. I really deserve this ticket.

195
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And but if it's like I'm giving I'm giving him in advance notice of what the consequence would be he has choice.

196
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to have to follow through his sentences. I mean, try it yourself right one sentence. Let's see how painful this is let's let's do an experiment. I'm going to do it with you.

197
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I

198
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.210
Complete homework.

199
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Within

200
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't cheat. Don't do W slash I just did. But don't you do it.

201
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Within three write the word out hours of

202
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:02.820
Getting home.

203
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: From school is actually a long sentence so 10 it's gonna be a lot. Okay, so that took however many sentences. Did you feel like that was like waterboarding or

204
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.270
Cynthia We: No, no, no, it's easy.

205
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.190
Okay.

206
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So 10

207
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.520
Cynthia We: One would be easy. I mean, like, like just mildly.

208
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.040
Cynthia We: Annoying not painful.

209
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.800
Cynthia We: 50 of them would be painful.

210
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But he'll have a choice, getting there, and it comes out in increments of 10 at a time.

211
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:36.720
Cynthia We: Oh, okay.

212
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning so taken. I understand right now. This is really different. And you're used to me not following through. I'm actually going to this time it's going to be uncomfortable for me because I want you to like me.

213
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm going to do it anyway because

214
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't I just can't stand my yelling, I can't do it anymore. So here's what, here's how it's going to go, you're probably going to catch an attitude, you're probably going to say you're real idiot

215
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to call me some names and then I'm going to add 10 more and then you'll have I'll give you another five minutes to complete them and then you're going to catch an attitude again and you won't do it. You're going to try and test me

216
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to add another 10 and when we get to 50 I'm going to stop with that. And then I'm gonna take your phone and I'm going to take it for the rest of the night.

217
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll get it back when the 50 sentences are done.

218
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's gonna you're going to have some choices to, again, I did the sentence, it's actually really easy.

219
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do 10 of them right now with this first piece of limit testing. It's going to be super easy breezy. Or we could spend tonight, where you really get a feel for whether I have conviction.

220
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be what we do. Tonight I'm down with it I cleared my docket ain't got nothing going on. Just going to be you and me.

221
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, stick to it. That's my commitment to it is scary and hard for me, but I love you, you're worth it. I'm going to do it.

222
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a version where I don't have to be emotional.

223
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm consistent with what I believe.

224
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

225
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What is happening to you with this little role play

226
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.060
Cynthia We: This think you're so eloquent. I am not sure that I

227
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.000
I will be

228
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.250
Cynthia We: Able to to communicate what I'm doing.

229
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's easy. We're going to write it down right now.

230
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's it. That's what this is about. Okay, no problem. So you'll have notes so it'll be good. Get let's get a nice fresh piece of paper, you can already predict with some reasonable degree of what might go sideways.

231
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: When he you are not upset with him.

232
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.830
Cynthia We: Okay, we'll come to him and tell him what's about to happen how things are going to change.

233
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.170
Cynthia We: Okay.

234
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that's up like

235
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.480
Cynthia We: Yeah.

236
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know star like a sort of, you know, proactive not reactive. We say, so how do you want to address your son to again.

237
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.010
Cynthia We: Okay. To begin, I'm a I

238
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.090
Cynthia We: I can't stand my yelling

239
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:33.660
Cynthia We: Anymore. And so I've come up with a

240
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.830
Cynthia We: I'm working with somebody and we've come up with a different way to try and handle it.

241
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:42.690
Cynthia We: Handle

242
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. So you. So write down your truth, because that's what you started with.

243
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.380
Cynthia We: I can't stand my yelling and he can't stand it either, but more that I can't stand it.

244
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just saying your truth.

245
00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: For now.

246
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.140
Cynthia We: Okay.

247
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to

248
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what I don't know what do you actually want him to do around homework. See if you can

249
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.920
Cynthia We: Follow the deadline.

250
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:36.330
Cynthia We: I want him to do it. I don't want him to wait till like right before bed. So I want it done in the afternoon or or. Yeah, like when he gets home. Okay.

251
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're almost there actual time pick a time

252
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.310
Cynthia We: I like within three hours of getting home or

253
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.170
Cynthia We: Giving yeah

254
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you can mess around.

255
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:57.300
Cynthia We: I think to just, just to be safe, so that it because if he got home at six, it would be then nine so so two would be better.

256
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:58.170
Okay.

257
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So write that down.

258
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.140
Okay.

259
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Which leaves him time to budget if it's a two hour assignment, and we'll talk about extensions on this agreement later but he has to budget his time while I need some downtime to play got a half hour.

260
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is going to take about an hour and a half worth of work. So really only getting a half hour. Okay. Well, how about Mom, it's really kind of have two and a half hours I I am exhausted and you can use discretion in there. But that's not yelling and that is great.

261
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.750
Cynthia We: misquote so what

262
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: About that worry about that yet.

263
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.410
Cynthia We: They will say is he will wait until

264
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.590
Cynthia We: Two hours and then start it.

265
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.410
That's not your problem that's his problem.

266
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.570
Oh, OK.

267
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:53.310
OK.

268
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.750
Cynthia We: So we're going to include the design. Yes. Okay.

269
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about budgeting and we'll talk about time management right in here will tell them

270
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this I've kind of been watching you. You know, I live with ya know, and I can kind of predict how you think this is, you know, and you think is a reasonable excuse but when you said two hours, you think, and that's when you're going to start

271
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, yeah.

272
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I would suggest is that you do a a preview right before you go play

273
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can do that with me or I could do that reminder if you wanted to. We're going to do a preview of what the work is predicted to take

274
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you budget your time. Well, how, how, when when I need to start in order to get it done by seven o'clock.

275
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.500
So I

276
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know if you want to participate with him on that and let's do that together. Okay, so it's

277
00:27:48.030 --> 00:28:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You, that's a discussion. Hey, son. I've been watching you for a while you've been using this. I just got started as an excuse, but it's it's not an option anymore. So what I'm inviting is I'm going to teach you that. What we do is we flipped through it. We look at it.

278
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's teach this kind of flexible, I can kind of do a half ass. Gentlemen, say, Okay, I feel like I could do this in an hour, so I don't really need to get started, till it's six

279
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So you say it out loud and be telling him what budgeting time what that might look like model that for him and you say so, just so you know.

280
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no excuse. Just because you decided to wait to the last minute, but that's cute.

281
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was then and we're not doing that anymore.

282
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what

283
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.890
Cynthia We: Then I would like to explain to him what will happen if he doesn't do it.

284
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.420
Okay.

285
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.440
Cynthia We: Um, so I am going to

286
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.510

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to

288
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.270
Cynthia We: Remind you once

289
00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I walk in around

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Six o'clock, with a smile on my face and a, like a winky little. Mm hmm.

291
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

292
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.250
Cynthia We: Am I writing him to get started, or am I reminded him that is supposed to be.

293
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.000
Finished.

294
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to tell them what do you want to tell them

295
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.810
Cynthia We: They don't know

296
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We could remind them up for your agreement. So just let you know you're making some choices right now I see you're still

297
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:32.580
Cynthia We: OK.

298
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.690

302
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And sweetie. You told me you thought it was going to take you two hours you're giving yourself an hour and a half. Dude, I love you, sweet pea. But I'm going to follow through this, this time when you walk out the door.

303
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That was your one reminder. A little man and aka

304
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay with love. Cindy okay voice.

305

Nice, be nice and playful.

306
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:11.250
You're playing a new game and it's not leveraging anger and scaring the shit out of someone as punishment. Right. It's a different game.

307
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:15.210
To

308
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You reminding of the new agreement.

309
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so we're clear, I'm going to fall through this time. Dude, I've already started writing the sentence, just in case, because I'm getting nervous, not getting to do it.

310
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, do the right thing, man. And then you go to go do your own thing. But you popped in this is your one reminder. I said I would do it. I'm keeping my end of the deal. The next part is going to be. I'm going to follow through.

311
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.580
So,

312
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you say,

313
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So when we did a real time scenario but going back to the original discussion with him. It's like I'm going to give you one reminder

314
00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because this is all new and I'm going to remind you of our agreement. I'm not going to say it in anger, you're going to probably be

315
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Only giving me credibility when the anger is there, but it's, you know, I'm just going to be giving you one reminder. And then here's how it's going to go. You're going to have to write 10 sentences within 10 minutes

316
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, period.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:40.980
Cynthia We: slams doors. He just kicked the door open. The other one night when I was in the bathroom. Yeah.

Cynthia We: Whatever you want.

330
00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You can punch the bed, something that doesn't hurt your body or any property. You can punch the bed to discharge it you can jump up and down. You can do some exercise you can listen to some music to get centered. You can take care of yourself.

331
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:42.630

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Take away and you know you got to talk to me about what you what you think is fitting the crime because I could roll out with my approach, but I want to hear from you what you think is appropriate.

Before

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, they come on just the pan out, it comes right off.

427
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.770

428
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you just, it's so easy. You just, you just take

429
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A little screwdriver and a hammer, you go bam, bam, bam. This comes from straight up.

430
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.070

432
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:44.790
Cynthia We: So, um, I think what had happened was he locked himself in his bedroom and so I removed the door knob. So I could get in

433
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.490
Cynthia We: So I guess that was the only way

434
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.630
Cynthia We: So I will

435
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.800

437
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, Cindy. We all do, no matter how small we are, we do need privacy. So you can still say listen, you're going to be working something out emotionally as well. I the as we go through this transition

438
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're more than welcome. I won't be going in out of your room, but I don't want it locked because aren't going to need to be updating you on the next thing I need to check on the homework I need to see if you're damaging property.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay cuz he's a human. He's a little guy.

443
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:49.200
Cynthia We: I think Scott doesn't respect his privacy. He just walks and he doesn't knock and um but maybe we can get together on that. Yeah, the same page. Maybe I won't tell Scott what to do. He can

444
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk after if it gets really bad. What comes after the door.

450
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I really hope that you're ready because I don't want you to let him down.

451
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And letting him down.

452
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.680
Cynthia We: So hard but I

453
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.470
Cynthia We: But

454
00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what love looks like. Yeah, that's what love looks like because right now. You're not bothered by the fact that you're yelling at him. That doesn't seem to bother you, but a consequence is

455
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's our

456
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:04.710
Cynthia We: Quizzes were so outrageous and they didn't teach me anything like they were months at a time so

457
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But you better be writing stuff down that work.

458
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:08.580
Cynthia We: If

459
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That works for you. That doesn't feel really horrible. And remember, when we tell someone, you have a choice right now.

460
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to look like this. We're not slamming them with the unknown, sweetheart. YOU DECIDED. NO, I get that you're testing limits, but I'm going to follow through. It's just going to suck for you.

461
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But I gotta follow through, because otherwise, it means I'm loving it down and I'll end up yelling

462
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, will be our pattern.

463
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And the message that it sends you so not Park. What do you say to him a message does that send him.

464
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:53.310
Cynthia We: That love is is anger and love is is a screaming and yelling

465
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.410
Cynthia We: And I don't think it's a good message.

466
00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: we manipulate each other with our emotions.

467
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:25.830
Cynthia We: I just read something about that, about how we we manipulate our spouses everybody's manipulating everybody with with their emotions.

468
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, not the ones that say, I feel

469
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the ones that own it or not busy blaming saying words like this. You make me feel like crap.

470
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you know, I feel insecure. I feel scared. I feel small.

471
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's different.

473
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:14.040

474
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Motivated because I'm feeling strongly about it. I'm really scared the same pattern is going to happen. I want to talk about how important it is to me.
