241
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:08.910
Vanesa Garcia: Okay.

242
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.380
Chris Alliman MD: All right, good.

243
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:17.130
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so we need to work at getting medication sent in for you.

244
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:32.070
Chris Alliman MD: We have to talk a little bit about how to do this since there's been recent heroin use if we get started to quickly I can send you that the Suboxone will kick into major withdrawals and we don't want to do that to you.

245
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:39.300
Vanesa Garcia: Yeah, I understand. I figured they did a couple. I mean by tomorrow. I know how to take Suboxone

246
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.020
Chris Alliman MD: Me.

247
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.880
Chris Alliman MD: I know good

248
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:48.900
Vanesa Garcia: No, I'm not going to force just drift off the bat, I, I've done this plenty of times

249
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.450
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so I've got a pharmacy listed as a Walmart for you.

250
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:55.470
Vanesa Garcia: Yes, sir.

251
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.590
Chris Alliman MD: All right on where I drive

252
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:00.660
Vanesa Garcia: Yes.

253
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:15.120
Chris Alliman MD: Good. All right. So the way we do this, and I know you understand how you've done it in the past, but generally what I tell and I'm going to email these instructions to you and I've got your email addresses sleepy.

254
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.680
Chris Alliman MD: A n g at GMAIL. COM. Yes.

255
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.700
Okay.

256
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.350
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm going to send a prescription for Suboxone in for you.

257
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.420
Chris Alliman MD: To get going. Okay.

258
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:39.600
Chris Alliman MD: I'll email the instructions. But the way I generally tell people to do it is wait till you're in moderate withdrawals right you know about this and then you start by taking one film.

259
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:49.770
Chris Alliman MD: Two to four hours later, you can take a half a film and two to four hours later, you can take another half of film, if you need to. Okay, that's day one.

260
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:58.530
Chris Alliman MD: Day two, you take your total from day one. So if you took two films on day one, then you start with two films on day two.

261
00:19:59.250 --> 00:19:59.550
Okay.

262
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:10.620
Chris Alliman MD: And then again you can take another half of film two to four hours later and another half of film two to four hours after that.

263
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:19.470
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Day three, you take your total from day to but there's no extra half films. It's just that total from day to

264
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.020
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and then day for you get two films for the day.

265
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:31.320
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. At that point, then I send in a second prescription for two films a day.

266
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.380
Chris Alliman MD: And we check and we check in on whatever day you decide your group is going to be

267
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:57.540
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so there with our program where we require two meetings a week. One is a group meeting with me a therapist and other patients that are on Suboxone you medication refills as part of that. If you miss your appointment, it gets kind of hard to get the medication.

268
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.220
Chris Alliman MD: And then the second appointment is for the therapy session, the individual therapy session with a therapist.

269
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.490
Chris Alliman MD: And all of this happens on zoom

270
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.870
Vanesa Garcia: Just like it is today.

271
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:22.080
Chris Alliman MD: You need to call in to the virtual clinic at least half an hour before those appointments, because it takes a while to check in, just like go into the doctor's office. There's always a line and there's always paperwork.

272
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:34.770
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Okay, good. Um, are there days during the week when you are free, or what basically I'm asking what your schedule is so we can figure out what group would work for you.

273
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.780
Vanesa Garcia: Whenever I'm what time is a group that

274
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.810
Chris Alliman MD: So they're at different times. Usually there during the day, there are some evening ones also

275
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:55.890
Chris Alliman MD: Right now I've got some good openings on the Monday 9am and the Monday 12 noon group.

276
00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:02.190
Chris Alliman MD: I also have openings on Friday at 10am and Friday at 12 noon.

277
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.070
Vanesa Garcia: Is to Monday on

278
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:14.100
Chris Alliman MD: Monday at 12 noon. Yeah. All right. Very good. So the therapist that works with that group. Her name is Serena.

279
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:23.490
Chris Alliman MD: OK, so I'm going to send messages in to help get you connected with her so that we can make sure that that's happening for you. Okay.

280
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:33.780
Chris Alliman MD: All right, now Monday's an entire week away right so it can be very easy to forget that you're going to have a group that day. So I would recommend putting reminders in your phone.

281
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:42.630
Chris Alliman MD: Put it on the calendar for every week so that you remember it. Because if you don't make it, it's going to be really hard to get the medications. Okay.

282
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:57.480
Chris Alliman MD: All right, good. So I'm going to get some things taken care of some rules for group that we have. And you've been doing really well as just sitting quietly No hat good lighting paying close attention not wandering around.

283
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.400
Chris Alliman MD: All and of course no using of substances during group time. You don't want that.

284
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.810
Chris Alliman MD: To happen. Good. All right. Vanessa. What questions do you have for me.

285
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.200
Vanesa Garcia: I really don't happen at this point. Yeah.

286
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:16.080
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, sounds good. I'm going to get working on your stuff and I'm going to get the Suboxone sent in this evening for you. Okay.

287
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.080
Vanesa Garcia: Okay, and I'll be ready tomorrow.

288
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.630
Chris Alliman MD: Should be ready for you tomorrow. I would expect.

289
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.970
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. All right.

290
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.980
Vanesa Garcia: How many films. I'm going to get. I'll be good until Monday we have our next meeting.

291
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:44.190
Chris Alliman MD: Right, so the way it'll work is the script is going to go in for four days like we talked about getting started and then I've got a reminder in my phone to send in a second prescription for twice a day films to get you back through our Monday when we'll talk again at that point.

292
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.300
Vanesa Garcia: Okay.

293
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:56.850

294
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.140
Vanesa Garcia: Okay, thank you.

295
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:07.380
Chris Alliman MD: So much Monday at 12 check in by 1130 preferably even earlier, if you can, you can check in up to six hours before the group time if you need to.

296
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:14.070
Vanesa Garcia: Okay, and then do I put your idea and the one that I went directly to or do I put into one that I have

297
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:31.650
Chris Alliman MD: No. So you use. First of all, you use the one that you have that sent you over to the virtual clinic and they'll, they'll get all your second done and then when I give them the new round number for zoom room. I usually do that about half an hour ahead of time, they'll email it to you.

298
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.360
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

299
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:41.640
Chris Alliman MD: The zoom room changes the number changes every meeting because we need to make sure people get their paperwork done and check in through the virtual clinic.

300
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.220
Vanesa Garcia: Okay, yeah. All right, well then, I will see you on Monday.
