Jen: Right.

16
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: There, there are two problems with that costume, but

17
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.480
Jen: I won't go into detail. Yeah.

18
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.110
Jen: I, as a woman, I think I understand.

19
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm opening up a note here.

20
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So they'll be a little off.

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.690
Jen: No worries.

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.840
Jen: Or something, it looks like better. I don't know how the outline of myself. Yeah.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Yeah, they keep updating

24
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All feels like every week, a constant thing.

25
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.850
Jen: Now it's so funny that everyone knows

26
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just like a we want to zoom. I don't have to explain it. They already know. Like, yes.

27
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.060
Jen: Like, I get it.

28
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I had money to invest in that program.

29
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.300
Jen: When I didn't know

30
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, Oh, snap. I ain't got no money as well. But I mean if I did, I'd be like, that'd be it.

31
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:33.000
Jen: No. Totally. Did you know how all of those senators and congress people are now under fire because they dumped a bunch of stock.

32
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.260
Jen: After they received information about the coronavirus

33
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't

34
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.390
Jen: I don't January.

35
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.250
Jen: I don't watch

36
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.290
Jen: I do. I can't watch but I read a lot

37
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.360
Jen: And

38
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.010
Jen: But one of them actually bought a bunch of stock in room doxsey me and something else. Back in January. It was a real shady

39
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

40
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So bring me into your world a little bit

41
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.330
Jen: Into my world.

42
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.120
Jen: Has been really hard because of my

43
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.550
Jen: And having flare up that I haven't had like last time I have them as bad as maybe like three or four years ago.

44
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:41.730
Jen: Where it lasted like three months and I ended up having to go to an acupuncturist and I chiropractor before it finally went away, but like yesterday I had to get out my question. I'm cool. They just could not walk. It was so painful.

45
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.230
Jen: And it fluctuates, the way that Saturday done

46
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.130
Jen: And then looking up a lot of different stretches to do. So I just begin to each morning doing these structures that definitely seem to help

47
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.060
Jen: And then I looked at this very particular way of walking where you

48
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.590
Jen: Excuse me, are very like careful about

49
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:19.920
Jen: The way you hold your body like tucking your tummy and and and like just very, very as straight from head to toe. And then the way you walk is very like small step.

50
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:31.500
Jen: And you sort of aim to hit between this part in the heel and then go forward as you take these small. Yeah, you look i mean i did not look cool while I do this, but at least I could walk without

51
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, we've been doing that walking

52
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.400
Jen: I haven't, I haven't even I haven't been able to make it down past the driveway. I have gone to the end of the driveway.

53
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.480
Jen: But I can't. I haven't been able to walk away that I was. And so that's been really hard.

54
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.490
Jen: As I'm setting.

55
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.350
Jen: It just feels like a step back. I know that it is not

56
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.720
Jen: It just really painful and

57
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.000
So this

58
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just makes me think I'm

59
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just looking at what has changed, you know,

60
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your seat.

61
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're doing the tele health, the seat, how you were postured when you are sitting in therapy when you're talking with people, what you were doing when you were actually interacting with people face to face.

62
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you really analyzed it and looked and said I'm I want to rule this piece out

63
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.510
Jen: As far as the word sitting at home, contributing to the sciatica. Oh god, yes. Yeah.

64
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.250
Jen: Yeah.

65
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the deal with. If you were here with someone. So when you were seated when you were talking with people where your hands like on your legs because these were young. These are teenagers. I mean we leaning into a holiday.

66
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:31.230
Jen: Well, it depends. Because it's a whole array. Like I said, I see about exceed 70% adult and then 30% fee and and so I had a very nice chair, though it was like a chair and a half. So often the way I would sit with would I would sit back, it's like, like this.

67
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

68
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I could see that. Okay. And so you're supporting your back. By doing that, aren't you

69
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.350
Totally

70
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.630
Jen: Hungry, but it's fucking with sorry it's messy. It's like Thera band.

71
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:59.550
Jen: And that's the problem is good, like I was sitting with my feet out. That would be a much better position, but it's like since I was a kid I always thought like this.

72
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.280
Jen: And so it's kind of like almost like like comfy like comfort place.

73
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:13.170
Jen: And so, yeah, it's just been a change of trying to put forward.

74
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.450
Jen: Sit up

75
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.320
Jen: And then I also got OH this is FUN.

76
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.820
Jen: You got a new a new chair.

77
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.530
Who

78
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:34.020
Jen: And I really like this. You can't see me very well. Oh, there we go. Um, but it's nice because it can

79
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.130
Jen: Go up and down and it can tilt back a little.

80
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.450
Jen: Bit. It's really nice to be able to sit up straight.

81
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.900
Jen: And it also provides different

82
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.090
Jen: And I can sit here.

83
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.370
Jen: I can sit on my couch and then I can also

84
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.470
Jen: Go over here.

85
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.500
Jen: And I can stand

86
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so right now.

87
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on a laptop is that

88
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:07.950
Jen: Okay, yeah.

89
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's super convenient.

90
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.130
Jen: Oh, it's so great. And then I also have a yoga ball and, you know,

91
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.820
Jen: I'm so

92
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.120
Jen: And so I've been oh I love yoga mat.

93
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.640
Jen: So I have a few clients that I feel comfortable actually lay on my stomach.

94
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.760
Jen: While we do here. Be like that one before.

95
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if we, what if we explore this further, just to see what happens. Might be might be something like if we

96
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Go, nice and slow.

97
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And just attend

98
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Any kind of noticing things somatic

99
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: emotion memory.

100
00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll do, I'll do the work. You don't have to do analysis, you can lean on me for that you give yourself a break. You do that for everybody, all day. This time, you just get to be the taker.

101
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

102
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:06.990
Okay.

103
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So find your breath. Find your grounding the techniques that you have tried and true and I'm doing mine. I'm settling in with you.

104
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of feeling

105
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling that gravity pull

106
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull my shoulders down.

107
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: pulling through my spine.

108
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: My hips, my legs. I'm feeling it consistently. There's a steady gravitational pull, pulling through my heels pulling me to the center of the earth.

109
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And fastness.

110
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a part of it.

111
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Now rely on that.

112
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I forget it's there.

113
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's always there.

114
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It has never failed me

115
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Today I want to invite an exploration of of posture shifting and and as you do the motions do them in slow motion as if it were

116
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: On slow motion speed and see what happens when you go in to that crisscross applesauce elbows in front, hands on chain but go so excruciating Lee slow that now you get to a tune to what's going on and narrated if you catch anything

117
00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You can pay attention is nice and nice and slow, just even thinking about getting into the position. I'm actually going to do it to

118
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Your neurons don't care.

119
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.940
Jen: In my hand.

120
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.520
Jen: Is a push back.

121
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.700
Jen: my hands and my forum.

122
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.950
Jen: As a push.

123
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:54.330
Jen: In place on like walking. Boom. It's locked in.

124
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.400
Jen: To be vision.

125
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.780
Jen: Then

126
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:10.860
Jen: Funny, my, my legs like you would think that one wanted to go before the other. But it's one self.

127
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.220
Jen: Service just

128
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.020
Jen: Like that. Yeah. And I have to do it fast.

129
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.880
Jen: To doing it slow a card.

130
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

131
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:28.350
Jen: It's usually. It's usually a, like a momentum thing where, like, throw them up.

132
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:39.450
Jen: So yeah, she doing it slowly was difficult because I really use my muscles to pull them into place.

133
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.740
Jen: But it's like one stage, they're

134
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.190
Jen: Just feel so safe. Yeah.

135
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's feeling safe, even though we don't you haven't moved into the other posturing. I never go and over again at

136
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.500
Jen: The end. Yeah.

137
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You did that. Okay, so now what are you noticing also that I coming into this

138
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.870
Jen: And noticing a tightness in my, in my size.

139
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.680
Jen: rushing into my knees.

140
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. Let's see what those what what's going on with those knees and thighs. Let's give some language. Let's go into

141
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.530
Jen: Height

142
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.310
And

143
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.090
Jen: It's like

144
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.070
Jen: Okay, stretchy pain and then sort of like a

145
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.470
Jen: Direct a thing.

146
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.730
Jen: The knees feel

147
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.590
Jen: Like they're hanging on by a whim.

148
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And I, I like the the whole metaphor of that what what what might decide to be doing these are hanging on by

149
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.230
Jen: My thread or via via limb.

150
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.860
Jen: Hi, you're burning

151
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

152
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:44.760
Jen: And I can actually feel the sciatic that's a pain but like the goes to the pain I'm

153
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.910
Jen: On both sides.

154
00:14:50.430 --> 00:15:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Do you want to just fire burning five want to stay there. Does it want to explore another position that

155
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.560
Jen: Does it

156
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Move out of it. Let's make sure that the knees are curious about another position. Let's see if we can move out of it and pay attention, slow way down, pay attention to what the thighs and the knees do in messaging relief and change.

157
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.970
Jen: Interestingly enough, it's just starting by moving my right foot. I don't know if you can see that

158
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.750
Jen: But kind of like wiggling is out.

159
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:45.630
Jen: I can feel pain in my ankle, but it's like it's releasing from my knee and my thigh.

160
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:52.410
Jen: As I send it out in front of me. So I'm going to do the same with the left

161
00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.020
Jen: Not quite as intense. I think maybe because it was on top, but definitely feel relief.

162
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:15.930
Jen: Relief and knees and size major release and these guys just stretching them out, like right in front of me, even with like pointed toes. Rolling, rolling my feet feel something, a good step to do

163
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Any ghost pain.

164
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.800
Oh,

165
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, tune in.

166
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.080
Jen: Definitely, I can feel that sciatic

167
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.800
Jen: Pain from hip all the ways to

168
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.620
Jen: Heal on the right side.

169
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:47.310
Jen: Whereas, they don't have the left side. So now I want to let them run down

170
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.650
Jen: To Vegas guys have a good stretch and they're ready to relax.

171
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So the first service no goes pain.

172
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there is

173
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.020
Jen: Very good. And both of my ankle.

174
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Ankle

175
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:19.020
Jen: And those pain on my right side of that psychiatric nurse, but it doesn't hurt. It's just, it goes

176
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What does the ghost.

177
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to say about being called a ghost.

178
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay. See, see if it's trying to send you a message.

179
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.830
Jen: Oh, it's like, Man, I don't care. I'm still here.

180
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still here, honey.

181
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.200
Jen: Always like in a patronizing Southern kind of play.

182
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: A training. Okay.

183
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.090
Jen: Any

184
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: patronizing.

185
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.350
Yeah.

186
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your response to that patronizing sarcasm a bit

187
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.270
Jen: Just last year, like I can know

188
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.200
Jen: And

189
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you ask it why it's still there.

190
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.900
Jen: Why are you still there.

191
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.730
Jen: It's reminding me

192
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.490
Jen: It's reminding

193
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You to

194
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Move.

195
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.890
Jen: Letting me to move. Why are you making it so hard.

196
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, my makeup.

197
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it respond to that heartfelt question.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

199
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion, do you get when you saw that

200
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.570
Jen: Frustration sadness.

201
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Picked up on the sadness, your face. Sad, sad.

202
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.600
Jen: Yeah.

203
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

204
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.030
You know,

205
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with let's sit with sad for just a little bit, we'll get through frustration. Cuz, cuz that's got some juice in it.

206
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a tissue.

207
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Tissue. Is it not this time. No, we're going to use fabric. This time for

208
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.200
Jen: Word.

209
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice relief to giggle. That's a whole

210
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.620
Jen: Nice very

211
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice chuckle. Just to let that

212
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.860
Jen: Yeah.

213
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.350
Jen: I think

214
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:22.500
Jen: It's been such a hard couple of weeks because it's hard to do therapy when you're in pain.

215
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:37.410
Jen: And I've managed to, I don't know if you've ever used these a cap session so long balls but they use the actual lake of the, the very hot chilies.

216
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.970
Jen: Which is capsaicin and so it is the most intense heat

217
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.350
Jen: I have

218
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:46.920
Ever

219
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.140
Jen: Lived and it actually after about two hours. I have to take it off like it just so intense. I can't take it.

220
00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:03.960
Jen: But at first, it feels amazing. And it actually feels really cool and good when it gets so bad that I have to take it off because it's like this relief.

221
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:14.070
Jen: And I do this wonderful ice pack for 30 minutes and then I kind of go back and forth between the ice and the heat. Sorry, I went off on a tangent

222
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, um, well, well let's let's just kind of talk outside

223
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like to not not be in that conversation with a ghost anymore.

224
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

225
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.420
Jen: I'm

226
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Why wouldn't you want pissed off and frustrated. Well,

227
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.020
Jen: Um, yeah.

228
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.760
Jen: Because we can't control the ghost and that's what's frustrating. It's like the ghost doesn't care.

229
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.110
Jen: The ghost is just like I'm fucking here snake.

230
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:20.610
Jen: I don't

231
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.350
Jen: I have my own agenda and I don't really care about yours.

232
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We did some gossiping. Are you open to going back and having direct

233
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.270
Jen: Yeah.

234
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You're self centered

235
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And really grounded in and you check in, not because I'm pressing it out with my agenda you you find out if you are actually curious if you're a first assumption about that drug that's a cavalier dismissive gesture.

236
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're curious.

237
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Even a little to learn more about what's behind that shrug.

238
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: When you find it.

239
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you could share with it, how you feel when you see the shrug. When you're ready,

240
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:48.510
Jen: You're supposed to be mind, body, and we supposed to be on the same five. I mean, doesn't suck for you to sorry that wasn't very kind, I

241
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.640
Jen: I guess I just thought like your drugs out so dismissive like you didn't care like you care and

242
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.430
Jen: And I'm trying to have a conversation with you because you're making my life really weird.

243
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you got the juice of the anger in there right that's what energizes that so you know okay so you throw in a little

244
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A little buffer of an A. But let's do

245
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. You're supposed to. You're supposed to be on my side. It's our body.

246
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So just

247
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you don't care.

248
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.280
Right.

249
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.610
Jen: Just said something back

250
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What

251
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.360
Jen: People. You don't care either

252
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel when you hear that

253
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.850
Jen: Well, I know that I just went to my like places like them for it.

254
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Was beat up, didn't it

255
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You did a protection self sooth

256
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I

257
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.210
Jen: Feel guilty.

258
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.510
Jen: It's my fault.

259
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.580
Jen: Not walking as much as I should, being sedentary being trapped in the house thing.

260
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.990
Jen: Not eating well, all these things.

261
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold that stay there. Stay there.

262
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Run away.

263
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Calling that that is not the same as shame and you can name behaviors.

264
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: They are just in action or action. They are not you

265
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Just stay there. Hold onto yourself.

266
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And now that you know

267
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have on that.

268
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: When she imagine looking into this go size in some way sort of meeting it toe to toe.

269
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Honest direct encounter.

270
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And say in your own wager. How can I earned your respect again.

271
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.310
Jen: How can I

272
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:54.360
Jen: Do

273
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you need me to do.

274
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That was so tender. That sounded really honest.

275
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like it.

276
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.120
Jen: Like my

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.230
Jen: She has like my hair on the best day

279
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Ghost. And is she eating at you.

280
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.790
Jen: She is she's smiling. She's very good at and she's eating yogurt.

281
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does she respond to with that. What do you want me to do.

282
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.870
Jen: When you were doing.

283
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're doing

284
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.060
Jen: She said what you were doing.

285
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And it said that Southern patronizing or no no I didn't hear it. Yeah.

286
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.190
Jen: Very kind very authentic.

287
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.590
Jen: For you it's sort of created a picture, you know, as far as just

288
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.370
Jen: Walking or doing my dancing twice a week.

289
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Dancing

290
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.140
Jen: Eating bother preparing my nose.

291
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.330
Jen: I'm

292
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.870
Jen: Focusing more on my water intake does all of those things.

293
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about the self soothing of rubbing the size

294
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.470
Jen: So you mentioned

295
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You were

296
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How are they doing

297
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:45.780
Jen: They feel good.

298
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice.

299
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.010
Jen: Fragile, as always, but

300
00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.870
Jen: They feel really nice when you play circle rub.

301
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.390
Jen: They bring heat to them and warm them up in the morning.

302
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion, you're feeling

303
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Content.

304
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The absence of some other thing is the spaces.

305
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me, because there was a little question mark like strengthen myself.

306
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:15.210
Jen: Yeah, cuz I'm not sure just totally like what I'm feeling or where I'm going. But it's sort of like

307
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.700
Jen: I'm like,

308
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.290
Jen: Looking at it and facing it in a way that I hadn't yet.

309
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.480
Jen: It makes me feel

310
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.110
Jen: It makes it easier for me to choose to feel drawn

311
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounded just a bit like a like a psycho babble.

312
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:55.050
Jen: You're right. You're totally right. Is it just checking in on it only because it was so beautifully put

313
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because all

314
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right I choose my own feelings. I just want to make sure you're not

315
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Missing be a mess for a little longer.

316
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.380
Jen: Well, I think that because I am

317
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:17.730
Jen: Going to say goodbye I have that battle with me. I am so careful about choosing my words when it comes to things like

318
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.390
Yeah.

319
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.620
Jen: I can be more sloppy because they can them.

320
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.590
Jen: Yeah, it's nice to talk to my ghost pain.

321
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.520
Jen: Because a big I really realized that it was there and be

322
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.410
Jen: Big for

323
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.640
Jen: I wanted to talk to it. I don't think I felt like it would be helpful. I thought I was mad at it.

324
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:54.660
Jen: So I was like, fuck you. I'm going to ignore you. And just teaching my two cents. When I do people I don't like

325
00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:04.440
Jen: I don't know by humbling that part of myself. I feel like it really felt one um

326
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.910
Jen: Whether I cared or not. And I feel like it felt

327
00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.510
Jen: And heard

328
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You humbled yourself to it and

329
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.050
Jen: I'm sorry I

330
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:28.620
Jen: humbled myself to it. And then I felt like it will itself to me.

331
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:44.340
Jen: Which is kind of like one of those perfect things either you hope for, like, when you give a friend or family member that you had bad energy or dungeon with and you just want to go to be like

332
00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.790
Jen: Oh, he's fucked up. And I'm really sorry.

333
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.660
Yep.

334
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, when they come, honest, they come real and we don't have to have our defenses up anymore.

335
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you and I protect you and

336
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:02.970
Everything.

337
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay

338
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.190
Jen: If it's good to be true to yourself.

339
00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:35.730
Jen: And that's probably maybe the problem is that I keep saying it's just it's just all about the ISIS. Watch this really, really good show on HBO where the lead or no on something else called the center, but the lead.

340
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.390
Jen: He had this terrible Saturday for all the third season and he could barely walk

341
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:49.140
Jen: And he was

342
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.480
Jen: able bodied man.

343
00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.370
Jen: Oh,

344
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:07.920
Jen: No, no, I guess I find comfort in that. So now that it's not just because I have been

345
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:10.650
Hey,

346
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.930
Jen: Guys again.

347
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You do what you were doing, sweetie. You just do what you were doing. That's all. It's just to do

348
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're so loved

349
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What is this reminding you of this relationship.

350
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:19.680

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.040
Jen: Talk to you about

352
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So much we need to talk about

353
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

354
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

355
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.010
Jen: Good. Believe me, I would say that before.

356
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I mean here we are in this program, we don't really like it's all about that. Like understanding it. We don't turn away. We want to win. How much, how long you know

357
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:02.220
Jen: You

358
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you were going to somehow you had fucked up.

359
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.960
Jen: Repeating theme.

360
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.140
Jen: In my life.

361
00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.190
Jen: Have you ever been consistent. Oh.

362
00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:37.770
Jen: I don't want to say that

363
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.290
Jen: Because they know that it's

364
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:42.630
Okay.

365
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay.

366
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

367
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

368
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you go with the next thing I'm going to say, okay,

369
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need to be right.

370
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to know where you go with it. Okay.

371
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We have that

372
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go with whatever comes up and I say this

373
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if that pain that ghost.

374
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Keeps your mother dynamic alive.

375
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: To keep fighting out over and over and over and over. Keeps it there.

376
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever, but there it is, at least it's there.

377
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

378
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Something

379
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That relationship is

380
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Really important.

381
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:15.360
Oh,

382
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.320
Jen: I think, at the age that she was

383
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.870
Jen: With me really started realizing

384
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.010
Jen: Just get all

385
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.890
Jen: She could be and how she basically ran the house through

386
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.870
Jen: Editor for it.

387
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:10.500
Jen: She constantly needed everyone to do everything for her all the time, and it's like now like like I told you. It's so hard for me to walk and

388
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:20.970
Jen: I probably would have been says he has a baby, please let me get up to you, baby. Please let me do that for you. Like all the point of Acre like thank

389
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:34.530
Jen: God doing that, like, sit through your, your hobbling like you can't make your own crutches, you're carrying things in your bag like as a crutch back from the pitches like let me dancing.

390
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

391
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:45.870
Jen: And it's so hard for me to do that. I just I'd like, No, I want to do it myself. And I get to myself. I don't want to be questioned about what I'm getting I just couldn't get it like

392
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.930
Jen: And I feel like that is at one like two parts of her like the one part

393
00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:12.240
Jen: Is the part that I hated because it caused so much difficulty for everyone else below everything that she needed the other people had to acquiesce to get for her because she was just always be together. The other buyer.

394
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.520
Jen: Where I don't want to lose it. She

395
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.360
Jen: Used to convey, and she she does.

396
00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:42.930
Jen: Like

397
00:41:44.070 --> 00:42:01.620
Jen: Let me get this for you. That was it. That part of the line to do it on my own has to do with food has to do with what I'm getting is that I don't want her to have a be like well you go get me a Coke Ritz crackers cream cheese and a Debbie snack.

398
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

399
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.830
Jen: They that out. Wow.

400
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen last for it.

401
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:16.320
Jen: And then he'll know that I ever getting it nothing. He doesn't know or they sit there and eat is in front of him. But if I say it out loud.

402
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. Oh, what's the emotion, if he knows

403
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

404
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.310
Jen: That's the truth. I wasn't like he doesn't know.

405
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:38.700
Jen: What they eat it. It's not what it is. But if I say it out loud have him go get it for me then.

406
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not him, it's an old what

407
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.200
Jen: What you were doing.

408
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What would she do, if you said

409
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you help me.

410
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want I want a snack.

411
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Snack Snack

412
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:01.350
Jen: Go get it.

413
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But you need help.

414
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:17.850
Jen: Yeah, I can remember I had my mother ever leave me and I mean obviously she had to. There is a terrible place. You know, when I was unable to do fall

415
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:32.100
Jen: But I remember because soul independent with food for a very, very young age at work I do work once I knew how to get it under that have their prepare it. I made Natalie cookies, the age of eight.

416
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:39.780
Jen: By myself out of the Joy of Cooking like because we had no nothing. Sweet. Now, I wanted to be. I

417
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's so let's just go psychoanalytic. Let's just pull back and both Let's both be therapist for a second. Let's just look at just just how a developmental brain works that we, of course, when we're little were eight or nine or 10 we have an impulse

418
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to want sugar, salt rent want the yummy.

419
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know to balance it out. We actually do need the executive functioning external executive functioning of a parent to say we got to throw in healthy. We've got to have this, this, and this.

420
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that fair

421
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.870
Jen: It was good. It was it was presented as like

422
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.760
Jen: Like there is everything's fresh

423
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.450
Jen: Growing up, like we had

424
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.660
Jen: I'm sorry, my dad, he's like,

425
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.580
Jen: Oh,

426
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.530
Jen: My first introduction to vegetables with tiered approach.

427
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.920
Jen: And vegetables were never part of, like,

428
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.590
Jen: It was very much like

429
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:25.290
Jen: Like, you know, like those big Castile, you would get prepared it at the time, Sam's Club.

430
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.570
Jen: And we did chicken pot pie, a lot like that.

431
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.730
Jen: But it was like, I remember I do remember

432
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:43.320
Jen: sitting at the table until a very, very late hour, refusing to eat my vegetables.

433
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.350
Jen: Remember what they were.

434
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.150
Jen: And

435
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.870
Jen: The goal is this be methods, she would get a frozen being mentally that had lived with the internet that I cheated.

436
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:14.790
Jen: I want to say it was that, but I'm not sure. But I remember I sat there because I was not going to eat them, but it was a situation where it was like they were going to lay down the law that was kind of been growing up is that I was relatively strong willed child.

437
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.570
Jen: Rarely did what she

438
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:28.350
Jen: Does. And when I say that I need, like, you know, I wanted to have fun. I didn't want to do tourism stuff.

439
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:36.630
Jen: Why was it

440
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a veggie medley with the Lima beans.

441
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:51.660
Jen: And feel my parents would that be get away with a lot and then randomly. They'd be like, will be to mediate with her. We've got to lay down the law. This is one of those times.

442
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.750
Jen: That they were like, you're sitting here and you're eating your vegetables and I was like okay

443
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:05.100
Jen: And is there until everyone was in bed. And finally, my dad came out was just, like, go to bed.

444
00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it was all wait it out. This is so intermittent. This is so random. All you have to cover and you one.

445
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.970
Yep.

446
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.930
Jen: No wonder why

447
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.720
Jen: It was rare that I don't

448
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:26.940
Jen: Really know

449
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it isn't, it isn't a game that that actually isn't the game.

450
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

451
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.000
Jen: It's a different, as I said,

452
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.870
Jen: That. Yeah, sorry.

453
00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it it is, it's a

454
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Parent

455
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wins right by sort of losing they win by being disliked

456
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And when I not being friend.

457
00:47:54.900 --> 00:48:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They win the heavy they win by being consistent and a pain in the kids ass all the time. Every time predictively a pain in the ass.

458
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't for you to know that you you did your part. You were strong willed what was needed was parents to say, Let's channel that

459
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.110
Animal down like

460
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.110
Jen: Don't have kids.

461
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.800
Jen: And nearly 10 years later beef or

462
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.600
Jen: Oh, I got this amazing cookbook.

463
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.450
Jen: And it's all about how to sneak vegetables into kids food.

464
00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:03.450
Jen: And like you make like homemade ketchup and like you make like you put it in broad and and so I got really into it.

465
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.810
Jen: And it was really empowering. Oh, just because like I was working with kids.

466
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:22.620
Jen: As young as eight months, like my my my last sanity job with which I'm still in touch with them on. I took them from a year and a half, and four to

Jen: Like

469
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:45.480
Jen: It was really empowering to watch how would kids have consistent access to fresh foods and that is consistently offered at is like really young age like kids love it. Like my pastor lunches.

470
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:53.640
Jen: I would have, like, whoa, like minty fresh peppers and like many roma tomato and like no ranch dressing.

471
00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:04.440
Jen: And I remember they would go to school and they'd be like that, my friends, they have made stressing in your lunch box. It's so gross.

472
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:21.870
Jen: It was amazing. I was just like, good. If I have kids like I need reasonably say like I was making food and everyone I think before you know they actually become a mother, thanks to target.

473
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:26.670
Jen: And I'm sure there are books out there that are like that mind like I didn't know

474
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:31.350
Jen: I didn't have cloth diapers. I eat all of the whole thing.

475
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:38.040
Jen: So my best friend. She was the same though. And after I think it was a moment she was like

476
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:48.000
Jen: He has a bow and she was gonna have so many kids and after one. She was like,

477
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:49.410

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:11.580
Jen: And you're talking about preparing food.

481
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.420
Jen: And that's the thing you think about things.

482
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:17.760
Jen: You don't

483
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:32.160
Jen: Want in many ways that I get to have connections with children's go and like when I you know like I see ladies fairly often. She's my best friend's daughter, but I call her baby. Oh, um,

484
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:33.660
Jen: And

485
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:47.670
Jen: She always just be like she'd ever had to have the conversation of, like, Please don't do this, don't do this, don't do this because she knows that I'm going to keep that in the forefront of our relationship. Our

486
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:52.170
Jen: That sounds really good to know why through that is

487
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.880
Jen: I think because we're talking about kids in relationship to food. Yeah.

491
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:14.340
Jen: I think excitement. Okay. Got that did not nervous like. It definitely feels

492
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:22.500
Jen: Like I really needed to cry. Is that I need to like let that go a little bit and I needed to

493
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.680
Jen: Say completed be upset.

530
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving away from it, you were able to come out and have some giggles and chit chat.

531
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A little

532
00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:32.730
About it.

533
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:41.610
Jen: Like how you put that about gossipy

534
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you need from these last few minutes. What do you need from it. You want from it, or would you like to do

535
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:28.890
Jen: I'm

536
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:37.380
Jen: Excited.

537
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:42.750
Jen: Oh, I think I said at the beginning.

538
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.160
Jen: My friends that I got a grant from the city to make a movie.

539
00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.260
Jen: And all

540
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.060
Jen: So we're making a movie about a therapist.

541
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.130
Jen: Great idea, Brady.

542
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:02.280
Jen: Lot because of the bad debt. I just had to switch to all Tele health

543
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:11.370
Jen: And so I she also engages in a group therapy for herself. Which is funny because it's all of these actors.

544
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.560
Jen: A zoom call

545
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:18.420
Jen: And then she also featuring therapist, played by the directors mother.

546
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:25.560
Jen: So it's almost like a little like because they wanted to make it as true doesn't

547
00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:33.630
Jen: And so, but it without obviously like violating any of my clients information all fake

548
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:49.500
Jen: And that really doesn't have anything to do with it. It's mainly the in between the sessions. I'm working on a song that I can't finish and a toad appears at my back door that haunts me and will go away, but eventually helps me finish the song.

549
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've written. It's the play of the movies written all the way through the screenplays

550
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.670
Jen: It's an outline. And so we're improving

551
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Wow. Yeah.

552
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: keep hearing about it so

553
00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:14.850
Jen: Excited. It's funny because I just did all taping myself. At this point, I know I've never done that before. And it's actually really fun.

554
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment or you are you enjoying kind of the pattern, we've got going here. I think we're at

555
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.250

Gwenevere Abriel: You work hard in here.

566
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.130
