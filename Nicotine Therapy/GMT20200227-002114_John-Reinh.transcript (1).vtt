31
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:12.990
Shaynes phone: right from the get when I first started doing heroin. I first I used IV. So that's pretty bad. So right from the gate was that I was no

40
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.940
John Reinhart: Yeah, well it's it's but i think i think the main thing is it's kind of, we're looking at for the drugs. I know it's hard now.
