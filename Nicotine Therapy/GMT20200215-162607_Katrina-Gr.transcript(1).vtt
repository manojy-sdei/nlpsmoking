11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.190
Katrina Groves: I was reviewing

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.350
Some of the

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.920
Katrina Groves: Notes

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.530
visits last week.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:12.720
Katrina Groves: And I just wanted to ask you to not include you have systems that were full, because we really didn't do that. And I feel uncomfortable just typing in having a type of knowledge of your systems that we really do so.

16
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.640
Katrina Groves: Like, take the all adults negative out. I know it feels better. But if we don't talk about it. I don't want to be building it.

17
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.480
I'm thinking of the beginning and group, I might just say, does anyone have

18
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.480
Katrina Groves: These things and just kind of ask all at once, and then you can put those down. But today also take out the

19
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.220
role play that's weird up in the group session.

20
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.020
Katrina Groves: I fixed all these Bible and edit it and that the group sessions. Don't put role play in unless we actually do role play or those or change it to say,

21
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.740
That these are some techniques that possibly were employed or something. I'm

22
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.320
Also

23
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.680
Trying to do

24
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:24.660
Katrina Groves: Monthly drug screens. I see that a lot. That's when these people are going to be on every two or three months because they've been stable a long time anyway that does not apply to today, because this is a history and physical

25
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.140
So I'm going to be doing a complete review systems and I'm working on these guys today.

Galaxy A50: Like I said, I started off with alcohol and weed and

93
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.200
Galaxy A50: Then started doing on hallucinogen and

94
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.770
Galaxy A50: Yeah, it just spiraled

95
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.790
Galaxy A50: To where I was shooting up 15 times a day.

96
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.250

Galaxy A50: And

104
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.380
Galaxy A50: That was just like a 90 day thing.

105
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.740
Galaxy A50: That was really the only treatment.

106
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.020

Katrina Groves: And then mental health wise, the pressure and I know you have had that and the Zoloft helps. Where do you feel like you're at with your depression.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:37.800

383
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.560

386
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.790
Galaxy A50: Yeah, I want to get out of this apartment and get us a house.

387
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.920
Galaxy A50: keep us healthy and happy as I can.

388
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.680
Katrina Groves: And you're the primary

389
00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.370
Katrina Groves: Parent right you're remind me that you're

390
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.860
Galaxy A50: Not them. I have a most of the time.

391
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:52.770
Katrina Groves: And

392
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:59.490
Katrina Groves: Is, are you taking a mentor shots and you're doing all the bad stuff. Yeah.

393
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.910
Katrina Groves: So goals to get housing. Are you on are you on the HUD list.

394
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.310
Galaxy A50: We're on head.

395
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:15.450
Galaxy A50: Okay, just a matter of finding something and being able to save money.

396
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:22.770
Katrina Groves: Because you should get really high priority, since you're a single parent with the kid. Yeah.

397
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.070
Katrina Groves: Alrighty.

398
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:53.850
Katrina Groves: And so how do you the sub the Suboxone. Do you feel like it covers you 24 seven. Do you have any craving stole or is that something you don't even think about

399
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.860
Galaxy A50: No, I

400
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.540
Galaxy A50: I have it I don't miss it.

401
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.230
Katrina Groves: You have like a route regimented routine or

402
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.840
Katrina Groves: Do you take it out. What's your routine.

403
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.780
Galaxy A50: One in the morning, one in the afternoon and one later on the day. Okay.

404
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:25.410
Katrina Groves: It doesn't keep you from sleeping make you to wired or too tired. No, she used to it and have you, I think we talked before about maybe trying some blockade, the shot and

405
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.310
Katrina Groves: Yeah. What are your thoughts about that.

406
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.960
Galaxy A50: I don't know. I don't think I'm

407
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.730
Galaxy A50: Ready to do that right now.

408
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.100
Katrina Groves: What, what makes you worried about it. Oh.

409
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.220
Galaxy A50: No, I don't even know anything about it.

410
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.030
Yeah.

411
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.260
Katrina Groves: When you're stable and so it seems like

412
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.370
Katrina Groves: Why would you change what's working on one hand, but

413
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:12.900
Katrina Groves: As new technology comes out. I like to let people know because some people really like that they feel like a slave to their strip. Sometimes, and they're always having to do it. Other people find the strips kind of comforting.

414
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:35.550
Katrina Groves: The shot is basically it's a small shot under your skin like insulin sort of on your belly. But the thing is it last for a month. And so you basically it's Suboxone instead of doing this throughout the day. It's kind of like steady state and helps a lot of people

415
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:48.090
Katrina Groves: Just not even have to think about it. But then you would go into the clinic every month to get your shot. So are you still doing the group or you don't really do groups anymore, right, with Tony

416
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.240
Galaxy A50: Yeah, I've been doing at least one a month.

417
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.410
Katrina Groves: Oh, that's good.

418
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:59.160
Katrina Groves: Okay. And so, and I think that's really helpful for your peers to see how you're doing and

419
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.800
Katrina Groves: You've always been really good about

420
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.260
Katrina Groves: Supporting the people and

421
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.470
Katrina Groves: Give being a good example.

422
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:15.120
Katrina Groves: So I'm glad you're still in touch with them. So that is something that you could do to think about if you want freedom from

423
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.550
Katrina Groves: The constant mouth thing is some blockade and

424
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:28.590
Katrina Groves: I've been unable to prescribe that and do that there. If you want to find out more information.

425
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.860
Galaxy A50: I'll do some research.

426
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:43.140
Katrina Groves: If not, you can stick with what you're on. So I think with bright heart. This is all new to me too. So thanks for your patience.

427
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:58.590
Katrina Groves: I need to figure out a day when you can come in for group and that will be Monday nights at 545 with a check in at 530, do you have anything going on with your kiddo on Monday nights or is that a bad, bad night for you.

428
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.570
Galaxy A50: Know, I could probably do that.

429
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.040
Katrina Groves: Is that

430
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.360
Katrina Groves: The night you have kid.

431
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.730
Katrina Groves: Monday night, is that the night you have chaos.

432
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:09.840
Yeah.

433
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:17.280
Galaxy A50: Yeah, but no, no. We'll try. No, I don't think it should be too bad. Okay.

434
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:34.680
Katrina Groves: So it's it's group like Tonio you'll see like four or five people or however many we have. And then I have a different counselor. Her name is Rebecca, she's really nice. So she will help sort of lead the group on whatever topics we want to talk about and

435
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.610
Katrina Groves: I want to put you down for a day, though, that you will

436
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:51.030
Katrina Groves: What's a good day for you like the 24th of February, the ninth the 16th. I mean, I have a couple days. You want to get a calendar.

437
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.750
Galaxy A50: Looking at one actually

438
00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:02.640
Katrina Groves: Not want to do next. This next Monday is completely bombed with people. So either

439
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.040
Galaxy A50: Well, let's let's try the 24 seven

440
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.050
Galaxy A50: Okay.

441
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.150
Katrina Groves: If that's enough time for you to get

442
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:18.120
Katrina Groves: The other thing I actually that might be good because you wait you're used to getting your scripts on the six or seventh right

443
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.050
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

444
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:29.580
Katrina Groves: So when I do end up getting prescriptions through bright heart. You'll i'll see you. The week before your script and then send it in. So the 24th. Sounds good.

445
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:40.140
Katrina Groves: And is there anyone in group that you can't be with or don't want to be with or have issues with

446
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.110
Galaxy A50: No, that's a good thing.

447
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.130
Katrina Groves: Alright, so do you have any questions.

448
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.320
Katrina Groves: For me about how this works. I can answer them my way

449
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.020
Katrina Groves: Otherwise this one pretty quick.

450
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.030
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

451
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.350
Galaxy A50: No, I think.

452
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.780
Galaxy A50: I got a good idea of what can happen.

453
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:11.760
Galaxy A50: So,

454
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.270
Katrina Groves: Keep checking in with Tony, you know, they're your home group.

455
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.050
Galaxy A50: Yeah, I'm not going to check into anything as far as that goes. Good.

456
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:30.180
Katrina Groves: This is just a way to get you guys all signed up with right hurt in case you know they they still haven't found another doctor for the clinic so

457
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.420
Katrina Groves: Alrighty. I think I have everything I need. So you go enjoy your day. Thank you.

Saer Schultz: Is that better.

633
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:09.030
Katrina Groves: I can hear you fine. It was just kind of feedback that

634
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.620
Saer Schultz: Maybe this this other earpiece was probably rubbing on my shirt or something.

635

647
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.340
Saer Schultz: He's doing it because mom and dad on

648
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:09.510
Katrina Groves: Here is that a little more involved with his son, because I know that was you, and he had your kind of dad number

649
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:13.980
Saer Schultz: One. And yeah, I would say a bit more. Yeah, pretty good.

650
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:16.920
Katrina Groves: I know that was frustrating for you for a long time.

651
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.930
Saer Schultz: It was still kind of but

652
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:20.640
Saer Schultz: Not as bad.

653
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:33.240
Katrina Groves: All right. And so let me move on here to I'll probably I'm learning this stuff to from bright heart they want me to get all this stuff down. So if I zoom around that's my bad.

654
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:42.000
Katrina Groves: Oh, did your substance use land you in any trouble as far as with the legal problems or

655
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.080
Any oh

656
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:45.750
Katrina Groves: no jail time.

657
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.100
Saer Schultz: No.

658
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.420
Katrina Groves: Good. No.

659
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:55.260
Saer Schultz: I never got in trouble. Um, yeah, like that. I mean, back when I was

660
00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:05.190
Saer Schultz: 22 i mean i got it wet and reckless back then. That's the only thing that I've ever got on my record that was bad.

661
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:06.690
Good.

662
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:14.730
Katrina Groves: And did you what what made you want to get into recovery. How bad was it when you were using

663
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.360
Katrina Groves: You know pills. What, what made you decide to

664
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.850
Saer Schultz: Get i just i wanted to for my own well being had enough.

665
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:26.250
Saer Schultz: Mm hmm. Yeah.

666
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.010
Saer Schultz: I got tired of it.

667
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:32.460
Saer Schultz: And it's been that way since I was

668
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.180
Saer Schultz: 14

669
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:39.450
Saer Schultz: Yeah.

670
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.000
Katrina Groves: So how's your life now.

671
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.450
Saer Schultz: Okay, what's better. Yeah.

672
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:47.760
Saer Schultz: Much better.

673
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.370
Katrina Groves: You don't feel like you're dependent on this box and it doesn't feel like the drugs do you

674
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.460
Saer Schultz: Know it does it. And, uh,

675
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.710
Saer Schultz: Yeah, in a way, dependent

676
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:05.730
Saer Schultz: I guess.

677
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.880
Saer Schultz: more reliant. No way.

678
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:14.520
Katrina Groves: To ever see yourself at a time where you would be off of it. Or do you feel like you're going to be on at your whole life.

679
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.190
Saer Schultz: I don't know. I may have thought about it.

680
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:27.360
Saer Schultz: Yeah, I can't come to a decision that I put it that way but I definitely have thought about it strongly both ways.

681
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:44.820
Katrina Groves: So there's also an injection. I don't know if you've heard about that the sub lock hate all the new. It's a shot that you get once a month and then you don't have to mess with that. But I think with your brain like that OCD, you have. I don't know if that would be a good

682
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:51.150
Saer Schultz: We did talk about this before, while back, like last time we were talking and the I and I

683
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:56.370
Saer Schultz: Was saying the same thing. I don't know if that would be good for me because I'm still routine ish

684
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.090
Right.

685
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.310
Katrina Groves: And do you still have issues with depression.

686
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.590
Saer Schultz: Or have you go, boy. Yeah, you

687
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:10.230
Katrina Groves: So you're not on any oh gosh, I remember we tried a lot of different things with the right, we tried. We took

688
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.150
Saer Schultz: We try to think two or three different thing.

689
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:13.680
Saer Schultz: And you just

690
00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.520
Katrina Groves: You'd rather just be without chemicals right now.

691
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:24.330
Saer Schultz: Well they less than what we did try didn't really do anything. I didn't notice any difference right

692
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.900
Katrina Groves: Who's your current provider at the clinic now or do you have one

693
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:28.740
Saer Schultz: Oh, gosh.

694
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.020
Katrina Groves: I can look in here. I got I got your other chart.

695
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.150
Saer Schultz: He has a hard name to remember

696
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.960
Saer Schultz: Kevin Kibler or ocular

697
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.610
Katrina Groves: Michelle. Yeah.

698
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.140
Saer Schultz: That's, that's, yeah, that's

Katrina Groves: Oh, okay.

702
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:56.190
Katrina Groves: I don't want you to talk in front of people. You don't want to talk to

703
00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:58.710
Katrina Groves: Oh, so

Katrina Groves: Although your sister might be

708
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:11.880
Helped

709
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:15.780
Saer Schultz: Yeah, buddy.

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.760
Saer Schultz: Sister was born. Other smoke. Yeah, thanks.

711

Katrina Groves: If you do on that artwork and what do you

716
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:52.410
Saer Schultz: Yeah, yeah. You are a

717
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.460
Katrina Groves: talented guy.

718
00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.820
Katrina Groves: He sell your stuff.

719
00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.460
Saer Schultz: No. But I've been told I should

720
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.700
Saer Schultz: Have been told many times that I said

721
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:04.710
Saer Schultz: I don't know if

722
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.390
Saer Schultz: It's more of a hobby.

723
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:10.170
Saer Schultz: Because I like to do it, not because I'm trying to make anything off.

724
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.920
Katrina Groves: Exactly. And it's a really good coping skill. Right.

725
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:31.230
Saer Schultz: Correct, yeah. Yeah, it can just, I guess like draw and, you know, start making something and just get lost in doing that. And then I like don't think about anything else for a while, while I'm doing it.

726
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:38.820
Katrina Groves: So what other coping skills. Do you have the sides of the art like what else do you do in your brain or in your life.

727
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:41.340
Saer Schultz: Definitely other gaming.

728
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:44.880
Saer Schultz: Mm hmm. That's like one of my biggest coping.

729
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:46.530
Saer Schultz: Skills.

730
00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:53.730
Saer Schultz: Fiction was not a, not necessarily a skill, but what. Yeah. What am I mechanisms. I tried to do. Okay.

731
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.700
Saer Schultz: That and then I you know the meditation you know today.

732
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:00.840
Katrina Groves: Are you still doing

733
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:06.810
Saer Schultz: My eyes. And I just, yeah. Oh, yeah. I still do it a lot and close my eyes and I just shut things off and

734
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.920
Saer Schultz: Just be with my own thoughts in my own head.

735
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.610
Katrina Groves: That has been very successful for you.

736
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.730
Katrina Groves: Yes. So backing up to past medical history, do you have any other past illnesses or

737
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:29.460
Katrina Groves: Injuries or anything like high blood pressure. Sorry, I lost you there.

738
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.610
Saer Schultz: Hi blessed by heart just that's my heart.

739
01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:39.450
Saer Schultz: My heart. How many this always I've always have high heart rate.

740
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:43.590
Saer Schultz: Ideas.

741
01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.920
Saer Schultz: Yeah, I don't know what it was that the last time.

742
01:00:51.960 --> 01:01:03.090
Saer Schultz: We hadn't you put on that monitor for a month and then I don't exactly know after I turn that in to the people over there ever get without places.

743
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:15.060
Saer Schultz: I didn't stutter. No, it was right down by like down by the the stillness in your center right next to that a little office down there down the North press okay

744
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:23.070
Saer Schultz: But I don't remember. Whatever happened after that, after I turned in all that data.

745
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:27.930
Katrina Groves: You should probably get an appointment with your doctor Keeter. That's her name.

746
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:41.760
Katrina Groves: And find out what the status is of that. But I remember at some point, didn't I gave you, or someone gave you. Propranolol to take when you have really bad heart palpitations, do you still take that it was a blood pressure pill that

747
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:52.200
Saer Schultz: You. Oh, yeah. No, I don't think that I remember we were trying to whatever for when I had the issues when my heart rate was up too high, and I couldn't make it go down a Kraken. Calm down.

748
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:54.600
Saer Schultz: I do remember

749
01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:57.030
Saer Schultz: Annoyed

750
01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:01.530
Saer Schultz: With the help them up shoot that was like while ago.

751
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:07.110
Katrina Groves: Obviously, it's not really bothering you anymore. You're just able to meditate through it and everything.

752
01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:17.340
Saer Schultz: Is somewhat yes once in a while it gets pretty bad. And then I'll like to have all i don't panic. I get to like the point where I feel like I

753
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:31.710
Saer Schultz: Don't know how to describe that like the feeling like I'm in early going to like this freak out because they can't. Mm hmm. And I'll, I'll go into like all sweat so much. I'll go into like a cold sweat and I feel

754
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:42.120
Saer Schultz: Like my skin will feel like uncomfortable tingling and stuff. And my heart will be racing.

755
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.730
Katrina Groves: Are you hyperventilating, you know, no.

756
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:48.300
Saer Schultz: I'm breathing, fine. I just, it's really weird.

757
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:49.650
Saer Schultz: And

758
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.300
Katrina Groves: How long does it last.

759
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:56.010
Saer Schultz: It can last anywhere from what once I think about it and I try to like

760
01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:05.280
Saer Schultz: calm myself down something less than 10 minutes or so. Other times, you know, maybe a couple minutes if it's not too bad. Okay.

761
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.700
Katrina Groves: And how often do these happen to their

762
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.290
Saer Schultz: Average, I'd say about

763
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.660
Saer Schultz: Three times a week. Okay. That's significant.

764
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:31.440
Katrina Groves: So it could be anxiety and panic, but I just want to make sure it's not some kind of heart palpitations thing. It's probably benign. But if you don't have results of that test I would get it checked out.

765
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.440
Saer Schultz: Okay, well, I'll talk to you later.

766
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:45.090
Katrina Groves: Okay, and any other that you don't have high blood pressure, though, and you don't have diabetes, you don't have thyroid problems, you don't have any other medical problems at all.

767
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.720
Saer Schultz: Nice allergies. Let's see what I have on you know our job.

768
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.930
Saer Schultz: Okay, I don't need nothing

769
01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:00.480
Katrina Groves: And any surgeries that you've had their appendix console's

770
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:01.770
Nothing.

771
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:14.250
Katrina Groves: Family history. So I know that, who, who, in your family has medical issues as anybody have heart disease or stroke. So

772
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:32.040
Saer Schultz: Well, breast cancer know how much I have to worry about that but breast cancer has ran in every generation is by mom side family. Wow. And yeah, so my grandma had it. My mother's sister passed away from it and then grandma passed away from it.

773
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:36.630
Saer Schultz: And then on the other side.

774
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:45.990
Saer Schultz: Arthritis really bad rooms in there. So I don't know what my dangers are as far as that. Those are the only two bad things that I know have

818
01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:04.200
Saer Schultz: A little weight loss. What do you think, but I think that I fluctuate. Is that because I'm I know that I can do that before.

819
01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:08.220
Saer Schultz: A while back, how I was losing weight.

820
01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:14.670
Saer Schultz: I break my weight luxuries that I lost. I lost quite a bit away and then I came back. I remember

821
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.290
Saer Schultz: How

822
01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:23.970
Saer Schultz: I noticed that my cheekbones, where I see myself in the mirror and I can notice that I started to see my cheekbones. When I started to do a little scan.

823
01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:27.690
Katrina Groves: So, do you just not eat. Sometimes you just don't

824
01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:28.230

827
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.790
Katrina Groves: Have you had your thyroid checked.

828
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:48.570

829
01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:58.170
Katrina Groves: And that can be a cause of palpitations, too. So maybe Dr. Peter, it might be worthwhile saying just, you know, letting her know about that weight loss. Sometimes

830
01:08:58.830 --> 01:08:59.220
Okay.

831
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:10.530

838
01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:48.390
Saer Schultz: How it's weird, and my peripheral is always feel a little dizzy and in my peripherals on both sides. I'll see like, I don't know how to describe it. But it reminded me of like little like little glowing light worms.

839
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.500
Saer Schultz: And they're going all over the place. But it's only in my peripheral really weird.

840
01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:53.640
Is that

841
01:09:54.930 --> 01:10:01.590
Saer Schultz: And I'll feel a tiny bit dizzy for a minute while I'm singing those and then they'll, they'll go away. It doesn't last very long.

842
01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:06.000
Katrina Groves: It was that we're going into a migraine headache because I thought used to get migraines.

843
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:13.170
Saer Schultz: Yeah, it might be, I don't know. We did already discussed this before. But yeah, it could be

844
01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.660
Saer Schultz: Those are, those are getting better.

845
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:17.700

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:28.500
Saer Schultz: You know about once a week, I'll have a bad night. Again, or whatever. But I've been changing my sleep patterns to get

848
01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:34.740
Saer Schultz: A little bit better sleep well I'm taking naps, or when I get a chance to sleep, a bit more

849
01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:40.530
Katrina Groves: That was my next question. Because I remember you have had insomnia troubles and she'd been a kid right i still

Katrina Groves: As you know, caffeine can make your heart race fast it can also keep you from sleeping, even though you may not feel it so might be something to think about cutting back on.

Katrina Groves: Alright, so you don't take medication for sleep anymore though, because I know we tried melatonin you tried Benadryl yeah

939
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:50.250
Saer Schultz: But that doesn't hurt. Specifically, it's just normal, I don't know, normal aching my knees.

946
01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:21.660
Katrina Groves: Stop your headaches, too. So that's another thing to put on the list of for Dr. Peter

947
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:22.920
Saer Schultz: Oh, OK.

948

01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:38.280
Saer Schultz: I don't, I don't know how to describe that it almost feels normal to me.

951

957
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:17.340

958
01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:23.820
Saer Schultz: No, but I have like feelings. I don't know. Sometimes like

960
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:32.100
Saer Schultz: It's a weird depression. This

961
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.920
Saer Schultz: I feel like I don't care about anything.

962
01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.250
Katrina Groves: And then, how often do you get into that and just lay in bed all day and don't do anything.

963
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.150
Saer Schultz: Month, baby. Okay.

964
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.130
Katrina Groves: And then what gets you back up the next day or you just

965
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:51.870
Saer Schultz: Just, I have to

966
01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.410
Saer Schultz: So I don't know, I end up there because I have to.
