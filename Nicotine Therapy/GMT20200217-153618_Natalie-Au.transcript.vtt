Natalie Austin: Well just beginning.

28
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.170

Jen: Okay, um,

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.460
Jen: I mean, I've been. I've been an opioid opioid user on and off for years, um,

31
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:23.730
Jen: And it's just I was clean for a good, you know, for years, and then I don't even know. I think I stopped talking to my sponsor sub going to some meetings and working a lot. So that kind of, I think, you know, I was like, Oh, I'm good, I'm good. This time, and I was it. Um, but, um, the last time.

32
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:39.930
Jen: That I did it, I was like, Okay, I'm going to do this, this time and. But then, you know, like I said, my mom got cancer again and it was just, it was a hard time for me. So I don't know. Sometimes I just want to kind of forget it all, you know,

33
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.860
Natalie Austin: Like, well, years ago, how many years has been when he first started using opioids accident. It's

34
00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:02.940
Jen: Um, yeah, I was in a car accident. I think it was about 2223 maybe 24 ish. I don't know. I'm God. I was sitting at a red light. And this guy just wham me from behind.

35
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.170
Jen: So that's I think that's how it started.

36
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.360
Jen: Because I will. Yeah.

37
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.890

Jen: Um, I want to say about 24 ish

39
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.980
Jen: Okay, about a little over 10 years ago, but I've been clean like on and off for years. So

40
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:38.370
Jen: I don't know, it's just something that I have to deal with. But I'm just, I'm getting too old for this. Now it's the game is over, you know. So I just wanted to get back on this box and just to help me a little bit, so I don't have the reason to go out back out there.

41
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.910
Jen: You say, oh, you know, I mean, I don't even want to anymore.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:10.770
Jen: And I just, I don't you know how it is the first year, you're not supposed to overwhelm yourself. But, I mean, I know the routine just want to start off slow, I'm looking into programs now maybe start to do an online and then maybe like a class a week.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.910
Natalie Austin: Just to start off

69
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.930

76
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.780
Jen: But I want to get back. I want to get back on the Suboxone

77
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.510
Jen: Because I've gotten some recently the headaches really gone away this time around, and I don't want to

78
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.330
Jen: Have I want that blacker in there so it does

79
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.800

80
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.020
Jen: We get sick. Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.860
Natalie Austin: Is it the eight you down to the eight

82
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:08.370
Jen: Are you honey eight milligrams. Yeah, I take eight milligrams two to three times a day because I i've noticed two times a day that 12 hour period in between. I kind of get a little agitated and restless.

83
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:18.090
Jen: So my friend gate. She said, You know, because I've been to Suboxone doctors before like long time ago, this and that and it changes for me all the time.

84
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:27.330
Jen: Last time I was on the eight milligrams twice a day. The morning and the night. This time, I've noticed during, you know, around mid

85
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:43.170
Jen: Mid time, you know, six hours in I start to get a little funky. So I started taking another six or eight and I've noticed it helps. But I do want to, you know, taper down. I don't want to be on it for 10 years you know

86
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.740
Right.

87
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:54.150
Jen: With the help of tapering down. I think this time, you know that my mentally done last time I was on probation. So I kind of had to do it.

88
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.400
Jen: I mean, I wanted to. Don't get me wrong, but I don't think I was ready so

89
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.420
Jen: Like I said, this time I'm over it. It's not even worth it anymore. I want to live.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.990
Jen: Don't mind.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.620
Jen: Start running. I didn't take a shower anything yet.

94
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.910

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.580
Jen: I don't have anything

97
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:34.590
Jen: The only thing I have always hepatitis C. That's the only thing. But I want to go get blood work actually from my doctor because I've been feeling

98
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.400
Jen: Like I have no energy. Like, I don't want to like clean my house. I have no energy to clean my house I you know

99
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:52.380
Jen: I don't know if it's the hepatitis C acting up. I've never had this problem before like whatever I you know would quit before. I've never had an energy problem. And everybody's like, all you're getting old.

100
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.010
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

101
00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:06.180
Jen: I mean, that's not really it because you know i've i've been okay before. And so I want to, I don't know if you guys do that when I do go to the lab. But if you guys can do that too. Or if I'm

102
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.170
Natalie Austin: Able to do that.

103
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:07.890
Yeah.

104
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.920
Natalie Austin: We should

105
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.430
Natalie Austin: We get lots of labs, so

106
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.130
Natalie Austin: It should cover a lot, you know,

107
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.240
Natalie Austin: Okay, we got a comprehensive that covers like your whole body. Pretty much the company.

108
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:29.070
Jen: Yeah, like I said, I just, I don't have any energy like I might have the will to want to get up and clean my house, but my body's like and

109
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.270
Jen: Then I want to

110
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.930
Jen: Know, I don't know, like there's a thyroid problem. I don't

111
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.150
Natalie Austin: I don't know why. Right.

112
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.040
Jen: Yeah. And then I gained a little bit of weight to like I was finding that I just woke up.

113
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.210
Jen: One morning, and I had like a stomach a little bit. I was like, wow, this is

114
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.650
Natalie Austin: Weird. Yeah.

115
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.190
Jen: Okay, so I don't know what's going on.

116
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.010
Natalie Austin: So we're gonna add that in there. Okay.

117
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.720
Jen: Okay, it just scares me because I've never been like this before, you know,

118
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:11.640
Jen: And then I don't know my sleep's all messed up. I can't like I'm in this on this weird sleep schedule like I don't know it's just really beer, this time.

119
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.700
Natalie Austin: I'm

120
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.220
Jen: Pretty sure you give like

121
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.460
Natalie Austin: Oh, sure. What you shouldn't get stuck twice.

122
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:31.320
Jen: Right, that's I'm saying and I they it takes them a while to find vain, because I don't have a very small veins and

123
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.810
Jen: Every time I get blood work. It's like a good half hour 45 minutes before they can find anything.

124
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.100
Natalie Austin: Um, do you have anxiety, depression, do you have

125
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.770
Jen: Yeah, I have a lot of anxiety.

126
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:58.410
Jen: Depression, I was, I was actually depressed when I was just recently in addiction and you know I that time I didn't want to clean. I had the energy, but I just

127
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.830
Natalie Austin: Didn't

128
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:11.370
Jen: I was very depressed. Um, but now that I am not on the drugs anymore. I mean, I feel better. I mean, I might still be there but i just i have major anxiety. That's my problem.

129
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.800
Natalie Austin: Have you taken any medicine for that.

130
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.530
Jen: Well, the doctor put me on visceral. But that's really not helping. So

131
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:32.520
Jen: I mean, I don't know what else there is because it just feels like there's an elephant on me and you know sometimes I work myself up maybe and feel like I have an anxiety attack sometimes but

132
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.640
Jen: I don't know. She gave me something for the depression. I forgot the name of the pill.

133
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:54.450
Jen: I haven't taken it yet because I want she gave it to me when I was in addiction. So I was like, well, let me get clean and on the Suboxone. See how I feel. And I'm better. You know, I've been on the Suboxone for about 30 days it's, I mean,

134
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.820
Jen: I friend gives it to me. I was like, I can't be doing this. I don't have the money for this, it's illegal. I need go to doctor

135
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.750
Jen: And do it the right way. You know, because

136
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:14.010
Jen: You know, so, I mean, I feel better. I mean, I might start taking it just to see if it even helps me more, but I don't even wanna. I don't know.

137
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.320
Jen: I don't know.

138
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.070
Natalie Austin: What do you see her again.

139
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.170
Natalie Austin: Um, I have that

140
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:35.460
Jen: Yeah, I have to make an appointment I have. I was supposed to have one read the left but then I called the pharmacy, AND THEY SAID THAT SHE CANCELED IT, which is not true. She can't. I think she cancelled. One of those scripts that she gave me and gave me a different one.

141
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.480
Jen: So I just

142
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:47.850
Jen: I just have to get the number on the medication right and give the pharmacy, the number, but I want to make an appointment for this week sometime, because I want to get my flu shot. Anyways,

143
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.320
Natalie Austin: Okay, good.

144
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.650
Natalie Austin: Okay, yeah. So I would, I

216
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.470
Natalie Austin: That's going to have your meds. Yes. So the quantity and then the Gabba Gabba Penton yeah

217
00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:02.250

218
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.870
Jen: That's for nerve pain.

219
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.490
Natalie Austin: Correct. Right.

220
00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:13.950
Jen: Yeah, I mean, I take it, maybe once or twice a day. If I feel like really bad, but I don't think it helps. I don't know.

221
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.970
Natalie Austin: Yeah, yeah, it's up in the air.

224
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.870
Jen: Right. Like, I don't know what other non narcotic medications. She can give me but

225
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.840
Natalie Austin: I don't know. Muscle relaxer maybe

226
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.050
Jen: Yeah, I got that. And I got an approximation.

227
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.650
Jen: But I don't know it doesn't help a lot. But

228
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:55.050
Jen: That's okay. I gotta deal with it. I just want to start exercising again because I noticed when I'm active and you know I want to get a lose a little weight, but I've noticed when I'm a little bit thinner and more apt to but it doesn't hurt as much. So

298
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.920
Jen: Okay, yeah.

299
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.270
Natalie Austin: We don't get it from yourself.

300
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.870
Natalie Austin: You wouldn't get off. Yeah, you would have gotten from someone else.

301
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.830
Natalie Austin: It's okay. Someone gave me the gift to you. Yeah.

302
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.480
Jen: Lovely. I mean, thank God I get HIV, you know,

303
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.550
Jen: I didn't share my my stuff a lot, you know, so

304
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.330
Natalie Austin: Are you getting free going to get treatment for that.

305
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:15.150
Jen: Yeah, I started, I started to get treatment, but then I stopped because of all, you know, it was just a pain in the ass because of all the tests they wanted to do and I was on probation at the time. And you know how that is you got to do meetings, you got to go down there.

306
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.900
Natalie Austin: Oh, yeah.

307
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.890
Jen: But, um,

308
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:25.500
Jen: Yeah, I want to start it back up again because I know there's medication out there that you don't have to. I'm like, lose your hair and go through the chemo.

309
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:34.650
Jen: Or radiation. You know what number. So yeah, I want to get it taken care of. Because if it's, I don't know if it's my hep C that's acting up why I'm

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.410
Jen: So lucky I'm

00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:03.510
Jen: I think so, yeah, I think I'm not your but then like when I started with the doctor, you know, he gave me a bunch of tests and i think i think they cover it. I'm pretty sure

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.000
Natalie Austin: Yeah, good. It's like $12,000 for the treatment so

317
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.740
Natalie Austin: That's awesome. What they cover. Wow.

318
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.460

319
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.200
Natalie Austin: I hope so too.

320
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:25.020
Natalie Austin: Ya know, so there's programs out there that you can sign up for to get information on their brands and stuff. I've heard so.

321
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.150
Jen: Okay, okay.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.960

Jen: Okay, I was, I was at Target for a little while, but I want to go back to Walmart just, you know, till I finish school. I mean, Walmart isn't the best job in the world. But it's still good money, you know, like targets like $13 an hour so

Natalie Austin: And the medications will just keep the ones that are in here already. So you said I don't have the visceral in here, though. What's the visceral

343
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.040
Jen: Um,

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.780
Natalie Austin: Oh, good.

349
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.330
Jen: Okay, this was, yeah. This is the last one I got.

350
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.450
Natalie Austin: The three times a day or twice a day.

351
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.200
Natalie Austin: He

352
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:47.430
Jen: He I told her she was, it wasn't enough. And she was supposed to up it, but she says one time three times a day. Yeah, one capsule three times a day.

353
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.090
Jen: Okay, but I was taking two capsules still really wasn't helping me

354
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.270
Jen: So I don't

355
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.650
Natalie Austin: Know about your red list.

356
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:12.120
Natalie Austin: The Suboxone in here. It does say twice a day. Can we start there. Because if you if you start with like another provider and it's different. They get all freaked out about it. So it's a different dose and blah, blah, blah.

357
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.880
Jen: I mean, it's a different. I mean, I can remember, just like in the middle of the day, what should I do that.

358
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:26.490
Natalie Austin: Well, what I was thinking of this in the morning. You take your morning one layer you say you got it you take them to get up. Can you wait like an hour.

359
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:34.830
Jen: Yeah yeah I wait a little while and then I take it, but then like my mouth always fills up with water like my glands are just

360
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:45.750
Jen: So I just have this mouthful of spit saliva, you know, which I don't know I hopefully like I heard it's supposed to be under the tongue that that on the packages does on the cheek.

361
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.120
Jen: So,

362
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:53.430
Jen: I don't know if all the medicine like it's coming up from my tongue in my mouth just swishing around

363
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.600
Natalie Austin: Oh, you know,

364
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.700
Jen: So that's kind of gross but

365
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.690
It is gross.

366
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.830
Natalie Austin: whatever is comfortable for you. I would get it closer to the back of your

367
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.360
Natalie Austin: Your cheek with my better

368
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.910
Jen: Yeah, I do. In the back of my tongue usually

369
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.330
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

370
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.120
Jen: Then I sit with all that in my mouth for a good hour

371
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:17.490
Natalie Austin: You know yeah because I want it to work. You know, I'm thinking, okay, it's coming up from under my tongue into my mouth.

372
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.700
Jen: I don't know if it's gonna work. So that's why I keep it in there so long.

373
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:28.680
Natalie Austin: Well, it's because of your bloodstream faster. Those he he don't have to keep it in your mouth that long. It'll still get your bloodstream. If you swallow it.

374
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:39.510
Natalie Austin: Okay, so it tells made subletting writers to make it faster, but you don't don't torture yourself like keeping a mouthful that for an hour.

375
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.380
Jen: I know I'm thinking, okay, when I start working again.

376
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.570
Jen: You know, how am I going to get ready.

377
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.360
Jen: Though, you know what, I still have to eat breakfast. Yes.

378
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.690
Jen: Um, you know, to go with this stuff in my mouth.

379
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:59.160
Jen: Yeah, yeah. But, okay, so what should I do like mid day when I start feeling, you know, little sweaty and

380
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.050
Natalie Austin: Well, I don't

381
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:01.800
Natalie Austin: Know that

382
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.850
Natalie Austin: The morning one try to take them the morning. One is ladies, we can. I don't know.

383
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:12.150
Natalie Austin: Okay, I guess, and then the evening one ticket URL I should be like 10 and 10 if you can

384
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.100
Natalie Austin: Take the evening, a little bit earlier than

385
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.910
Natalie Austin: Maybe even a

386
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.270
Natalie Austin: So what you don't have that long gap.

387
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.250
Natalie Austin: Okay.

388
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.830
Jen: We can see how it is from

389
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:28.080
Jen: There, even if I look like four milligrams in the afternoon. I think that would help a little bit

390
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.090
Jen: But we'll see how that goes.

391
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.310
Natalie Austin: If we need to add that in. We can, but

392
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.410
Natalie Austin: Let's start just where you are.

393
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.990
Natalie Austin: There's no red flags, they won't be like

394
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.090
Jen: No, that's fine. And

395
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.650
Jen: That's fine. And are you going to put me

396
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.500
Jen: Back on the Suboxone instead of the sub you tax now.

397
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.720
Jen: Yeah, okay.

398
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.250
Jen: And are they just drips.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.800
Natalie Austin: Oh, yes. So you want

400
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.260
Jen: Okay, good job strips.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:13.920
Jen: I don't. Yeah. I mean, they do the pills, but I think they're generic or they do the strips, but I think they're just the generic

406
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.450
Natalie Austin: There. Okay, gotcha.

407
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.590
