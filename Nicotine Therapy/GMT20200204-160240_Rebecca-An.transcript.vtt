Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How'd that make you feel

18
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.900
Donna Jochimsen: Well, it makes me feel good and kind of bad because, you know, I, I'm the only parent now. And so I need to. I need to step up and be there more

19
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.400

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So true. Definitely.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the plans are you going to go up to Oregon and spend time with one of your daughters.

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:37.230
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm going to do that in the middle of middle of next month. I'm gonna let the web. Give it time for the weather to be a little bit better and

24
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:49.530
Donna Jochimsen: My granddaughter plays volleyball. And so I want to be there for one of our tournaments and the, the other one plays baseball and my daughter. Does the roller derby.

25
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh well.

26
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.530
Yeah.

Donna Jochimsen: My oldest daughter climbs mountains to the mountain climber wrote those the roller derby runs marathons.

28
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.550
I

29
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:19.860
Donna Jochimsen: asked her if she sleeps at all which she obviously doesn't have much time to do because she also works in a women's shelter at night, and I'm a little concerned about her but sounds a bit like overachieving to me.

30
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Staying busy. That's an active life. Yeah.

31
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.750
Donna Jochimsen: That is an active life. Yep.

32
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Living life to the fullest.

35
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.750
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah well alive. She definitely is full of life.

36
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I you know I think back to when my kids were little, and I couldn't imagine you know three kids playing sports.

37
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.040
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

38
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.930
Donna Jochimsen: I just how do you

39
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep up with kids.

40
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing that stuff and one was hard enough. I mean, it was practice every day and

41
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, like our busy, busy life.

42
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.870
Donna Jochimsen: Yep. She has a busy, busy life. But I think she's pretty happy with it. So,

43
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good. Yeah. Now we've just got to get you to the point

44
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:27.150
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, this is a hard week for me, this would be the second anniversary of my husband's death, and we were married for like 42 years so

45
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.480
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it's, it's hard.

46
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

47
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.650
Donna Jochimsen: What do you have my kids need me all the more right now.

48
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They do, yeah, they lost them to

49
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, and it would be good that you congregate with them because you need them to

50
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.190
Donna Jochimsen: I definitely need them to. That is right.

51
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what are you going to do to honor him.

52
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.650
Donna Jochimsen: Um, you know, I'm going to go spend some time with his mom day

53
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.530
Donna Jochimsen: She's still alive and she had a terrible year that year, her husband died in December and that our son died in February.

54
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.900
Donna Jochimsen: So, yeah.

55
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.230
Donna Jochimsen: I'm going to spend some time with her that day.

56
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

57
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.650
Donna Jochimsen: My kids are all working and busy. So I'm going to spend time with my mother in law.

58
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, I think that's awesome. What has been the outcome with your dad and your brother.

59
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.390
Donna Jochimsen: Well, we're trying to work it out. We're trying to get this so

60
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.830
Donna Jochimsen: Not all the responsibilities on me and he's doing better, but he does have a full time job. And you know, that's how I ended up doing it all.

61
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:51.330
Donna Jochimsen: I would love for my dad to go live with him right now. I guess it's not possible. There's not enough room for him, but they're working on that trying to see if they can figure out how to get bad to move in with them.

62
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good.

63
00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.930
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, the he has a big enough house to do that. It's just that right now. He's got his son and two granddaughters staying there.

64
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.760
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know. Anyway, we're trying to figure out how to do this.

65
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.900
Donna Jochimsen: So that not all the pressures on me. Yeah.

66
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, even if he had your dad you know halftime. You know what I mean.

67
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.570
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah yeah yeah I yeah I do know I

68
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:31.380
Donna Jochimsen: Just scraping out a couple hours here on air. Sometimes it's hard. Yeah, but, but he's doing better. He is doing better.

69
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:48.390
Donna Jochimsen: He didn't do very well i'll be me for a while, and I've been after him for months now. So I, I need some help. I can't do it all. And he's like, Yeah, yeah, I'm busy. And hey, help, you know, but he's doing, he's doing a little bit better.

70
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. And how did your dad receive being over there.

71
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.600
Donna Jochimsen: My brothers.

72
00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:09.000
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, was it's really odd because my brother bought the house that we grew up in from my dad when after everybody had left and my mom died. And so it's actually his old home and you would think that he would be more comfortable there but he's not

73
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.690
Donna Jochimsen: He doesn't get along with my brother, very well.

74
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.630
Donna Jochimsen: He just it just, I think it brings back old memories for him that make him not feel comfortable

75
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you asked him.

76
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:37.380
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. He just, he's like that. Joe, I don't even like Joe like well I know you don't like him, but you love him. I, you know, and it is your house, but they've remodeled it so it looks different.

77
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.520
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know, he's just not happy. He doesn't like going over there.

78
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:50.370
Donna Jochimsen: But he might not have a choice he really, he is really to a point where he cannot be on his own, you know,

79
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.980
Donna Jochimsen: He can't he doesn't know if he's taking his medicine or not, even though I have it all in the tray. He doesn't even know what day it is.

80
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:10.230
Donna Jochimsen: You don't know if it's six o'clock at night or six o'clock in the morning, you know, just his, his dementia has gotten really bad and gets worse by the day.

81
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's no way that you can get her time and help

82
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who

83
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:37.080
Donna Jochimsen: Medicare and be, you know, I should I should have been being paid for doing that all along. I should have because I used to do that job about it. I used to do that. But it just when I started helping him. It just started out he needed help with shopping and laundry, you know, things like

84
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:53.670
Donna Jochimsen: That that he couldn't get out to because he doesn't drive anymore and so that wasn't too bad, but then it just slowly accumulated to where it's now full time care he doesn't he can't do really anything for himself.

85
00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:10.950
Donna Jochimsen: And we're afraid to leave him alone. He's got now a wander down the street, before he called 9111 time just to tell him he thought he should be arrested, you never could say why but just he's definitely not thinking right

86
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.640
Yeah.

87
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe that would be something for you to be able to look into.

88
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.910
Donna Jochimsen: It. Yeah, we definitely need to start looking into that.

89
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:31.080
Donna Jochimsen: I should have done it a long time ago. Like I said, I could have been being paid for doing that because I used to do that is what a job that I used to have. So

90
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.250
Donna Jochimsen: We definitely need to look into that further.

91
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:55.140
Donna Jochimsen: Ideally, he needs to he really does need to be living with someone else, you know, you can go. You can go to the bathroom and shower up you remind them, you can take care of his personal needs. But he's just not always president

92
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.920
Yeah.

93
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.600
Donna Jochimsen: And even if

94
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:08.730
Donna Jochimsen: His emotions are really unregulated. He gets angry for the silliest things cries a lot, you know, just just having a hard time

95
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:15.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Must be frustrating to, you know, being not being able to take care of yourself, you know,

96
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.410
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

97
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.670
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, I know. I mean, I, I can't even imagine.

98
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:30.120
Donna Jochimsen: how that feels. Because he was always the dad, you know, the big strong man and the family and he no longer is that it makes me angry.

99
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah hurts him frustrates him, you know, definitely. Yeah. Be, you know, self sufficient human and then regressing to having to be taken care of. It's got to be

100
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.480
Donna Jochimsen: Yep.

101
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.350
Donna Jochimsen: I can't even imagine I have a lot of patience with them because I, I see that you know

102
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.450
Donna Jochimsen: I'm not

103
00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.140
Donna Jochimsen: A hard time with having but we just go on. What do you know what else you gonna do the hardest thing, I think, was that

104
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:13.170
Donna Jochimsen: When you started needing help my husband had only died about six months before the hat. So I basically went from caring for my husband to caring for my dad and just a matter of a few months.

105
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

106
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you haven't been able to take care of, Donna. For How about

107
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.200
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know, I'm not sure. It's been a long time.

108
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, what can I ask what your husband died.

109
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.480
Donna Jochimsen: He died of liver cancer.

110
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.950
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it was not a pleasant way to die. No.

111
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was in sick for a long time.

112
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.120
Donna Jochimsen: He was sick for a long time.

113
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:52.920
Donna Jochimsen: Well, he had he had a he had habitat. He had hepatitis B chronic hepatitis B and he didn't actually get sick until the last few years, a couple years of his life, but

114
00:10:53.790 --> 00:11:04.200
Donna Jochimsen: And I think he was diagnosed with cancer, like in April and died the following February, but he was. It was a very awful sickness.

115
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.940
Donna Jochimsen: You know, liver disease. It's been a pleasant thing anyway and then

116
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.100
Donna Jochimsen: Of course, cancer, and all the chemotherapy was just absolute hell.

117
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.940
Yeah.

118
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I had to have been

119
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You haven't

120
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You haven't had a reprieve in

121
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A long time

122
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.080
Donna Jochimsen: No, I haven't. I have had a lot

123
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I hope that you know these things work out with you and your brother so that he can at least have a hard

124
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:34.950
Donna Jochimsen: Time.

125
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:35.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

126
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.330
Donna Jochimsen: They have to because like I said, My dad is like he just

127
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.860
Donna Jochimsen: Fires care beyond what one person can do. He just does

128
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And for the meantime have

129
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you looked into him being able to get

130
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Caregivers so that you can get a day or so, you know,

131
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.530
Donna Jochimsen: I have, I have not. But

132
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.860
Donna Jochimsen: But my we need to do that. We definitely do.

133
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:19.980
Donna Jochimsen: His income was just a little too high for some things when we looked into it. A couple of years ago, but his situation has changed so much. Now, that it would be a lot cheaper for them to help or do they happen to have him in a convalescent hospital or something like that. So,

134
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.350
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it might be different now.

135
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:23.700
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

136
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely something to look into, you know, for you.

137
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:48.060
Donna Jochimsen: For sure. I honestly, I did not think that my dad would still be alive. He's, he's had so much so much physical issues also that I really didn't think that he was going to survive this long. So you know we did it. We didn't do very good long, long term planning on this.

138
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.870
Donna Jochimsen: Day by day.

139
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it'll get better.

140
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.000
Donna Jochimsen: You know, it will it will, and I'm just, I'm really happy to just have my dad, I am

141
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.680
Donna Jochimsen: And I don't really mind caring for him, but it is a lot. Yeah.

142
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And having a break. Once in a while. Doesn't hurt.

143
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:20.100
Donna Jochimsen: No, it's necessary. If I don't get one every once in a while, I start getting impatient and I just get too tired. I need more rest.

144
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

145
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.340
Donna Jochimsen: Myself. Yeah.

146
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How

147
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you go to a meeting.

148
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:43.050
Donna Jochimsen: I go to meetings. I've been going to a meeting here in town. And so I go to one once a week, but I'm looking into doing online meetings.

149
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.500
Okay.

150
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:50.010
Donna Jochimsen: And I've looked into women for sobriety, I think, is the one that I'm going to join.

151
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:59.460
Donna Jochimsen: By this last week, looking at a couple of different groups and looking at their literature. You know what they, their goals are, what they're trying to do.

152
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.610
Donna Jochimsen: And I think probably going to do the women for sobriety.

153
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. I'm going to check that out myself and explore it you know

154
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything that you do that's going to help you.

155
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With your recovery is important, you know,

156
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

157
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For sobriety.

158
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

159
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to get people engaged in in something, you know, outside of treatment is a little bit challenging at times, you know, because it's thinking outside that box, you know,

160
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.530
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah yeah

161
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.930
Donna Jochimsen: I know my lower

162
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.700
Donna Jochimsen: Diaper time

163
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Short term. It's not a long term thing, you're not going to be in treatment your whole life.

164
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.460
Right.

165
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

166
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.700
Donna Jochimsen: We're having internet problems here.

167
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Huh, or

168
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.860
Donna Jochimsen: Up or having internet problems here. Now I can hear you. There you are. Okay.

169
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.440
Donna Jochimsen: I got you back.

170
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.830
Donna Jochimsen: Well,

171
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.840
Donna Jochimsen: Now you're gone again.

172
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.660
Donna Jochimsen: Don't know if you can hear me. But if you can

173
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.150
Donna Jochimsen: I've lost you here.

174
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.490
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know who's issue. It is

175
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.860
Donna Jochimsen: I repress

176
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.780
Donna Jochimsen: Didn't know what to do.

177
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.340
Donna Jochimsen: Got myself that happen.

178
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.940
Donna Jochimsen: Oh I tap the screen too many times.

179
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There you are.

180
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.820
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, got it back. I had to leave the meeting and come back in.

181
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I don't know what

182
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is going on. I don't know my zoom it just seems to be going in and out, too. So I think it's your site in my side.

183
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.890
Donna Jochimsen: I'm not sure, but we've definitely had a problem.

184
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. So you're saying it's not your first rodeo.

185
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:53.760
Donna Jochimsen: No I it's not I've quit a few times but oddly enough, my real danger. The point is about one and a half years and

186
00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:10.350
Donna Jochimsen: I and I think that that's part of it that that I get the I'm clean part. Now I'm not using but with the groups. I've been doing and the help I was getting I sort of stayed stuck in that mode and beta forward.

187
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

188
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.050
Donna Jochimsen: You know into. Okay, now I've done this, what do I do now, you know,

189
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:26.430
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, and and i think that that's I thought, I thought about that a lot because when you have a pattern like that. This will be my third or fourth time of having a year and a half.

190
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:40.320
Donna Jochimsen: And then falling back into it for a short period of time and i and i think that that is what I came up with is, it's because I'm staying and just just die recovery mode and not moving forward.

191
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.010
Yeah.

192
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a piece of it too is putting one foot in front of the other, doing things differently. Stepping outside of your box you know trying new things and

193
00:17:52.170 --> 00:18:03.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Building, you know, as a support network so that you have people to go out to coffee with or you know what I mean to that are doing the same thing you're doing, you know,

194
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.570
Donna Jochimsen: Or not. I would love to just know people that have never used in her life. You know, sometimes I get sick of that.

195
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

196
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, is there not something else we can talk about

197
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.800
Donna Jochimsen: Let's

198
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.480
Donna Jochimsen: Fight. Let's just move on.

199
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get

200
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:39.810
Donna Jochimsen: Real about it a little bit, you know, although I need you know i i needed the self reflection I needed to learn those things about myself. I did that and i and i think i feel much more positively about you guys about Brad heart. I feel like it is an opportunity to move forward.

201
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:41.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

202
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:48.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, good, good. It's definitely you're able to move, that's for sure. You're not my

203
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely can can go places and travel and, you know, and still have that support system in your pocket.

204
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.400
Donna Jochimsen: You know that has just been a lifesaver because

205
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:11.160
Donna Jochimsen: With my dad. It's just not always just not always easy for me to get out this way I can just get him comfortable go in the other room and you know and so far it's worked out great.

206
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. So what are we going to work on this week.

207
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:15.960

217
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:13.410
Donna Jochimsen: You know, don't from one thing to the next. I kind of want to stay consistent with the things I did. I've done yeah I'm doing and

226
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.650

227
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.490
