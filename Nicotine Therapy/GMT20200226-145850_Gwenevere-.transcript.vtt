00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.190
Yeah.

97
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.770
Victoria reed: Basically

98
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. All right. And what about your concern over that. Does it seem like it's the same escalated.

100
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

101
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.780
Victoria reed: Yeah, it's like I'm not scared. Oh, I was scared. Yeah.

102
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And just to review again in the hub. Yeah, the room that you're staying in do you share it with anyone else. No. Okay. But you're not comfortable talking in there. Is it because people can hear.

103
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:41.130
Victoria reed: Yes, and the my cousin's kids will open the door. Yeah, cuz they don't really have a lot

104
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.640
Victoria reed: Of what I'm working on getting yeah

105
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I would love for you to do that because it would give us access to

106
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To therapeutic activities. Yeah.

107
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit more emotion and they can have a pretty profound impact. So we'd love to have have that available for you. So even a sliding bolt lock, you know,

108
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.110
Victoria reed: Yeah.

109
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Even getting that done, I might be

110
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.730
Victoria reed: I'm gonna have my Dad, come and

111
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.300
Victoria reed: Help me this weekend. Okay. And he's supposed to put a lock for me.

112
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.070
Victoria reed: Because I yeah too cold to be out here sometimes

113
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes what we can do is if you have a secondary

114
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Device or the, I don't know if they make them inexpensive anywhere but keep your eye out for a white noise little sound. What you can do is put that right outside the door.

115
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's say the chords on the inside. And it's just right outside. No one can sort of mess with it, you'll have it on

116
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Then there'll be this sort of white noise and they won't really be able to hear what you're saying.

117
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, so it's just a thought. I know us therapists use them. We use them outside our door.

118
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So if people are walking by, you know, you can't hear.

119
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah so

120
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.680
Victoria reed: All you really look into that. Because my son.

121
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.230
Victoria reed: My youngest he

122
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.490
Victoria reed: He's into the white noise stuff.

123
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.580
Victoria reed: You know, he told me that

124
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, so there's a little app on a phone. But of course, you'll be on your phone. That's why I was wondering if he has his phone.

125
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You could hear people want to hold their phone. So anyway, you work it out. I'm just throwing it out there. A lot of people like you have this app. It's called white noise brown noise, you know, purple, pink, I mean, it's got different names, but it's basically a simple

126
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.890
Victoria reed: Yeah. Matter of fact, he uses the so he can fall asleep, you

127
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, me.

128
00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This way here different sounds. You just hear the one and then you your mind just you stop.

129
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.260
Victoria reed: Here and you go right to sleep. So yeah, that's a great one.

130
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.530
Victoria reed: Yep, yep, I think, Oh, good.

131
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:17.850
Victoria reed: Haven't helped me update that computer and I'll get on on that and then

132
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:25.380
Victoria reed: Oh yeah, this phone for that thing. The white noise. Uh huh.

133
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, you tell me, do you want to kind of stay sort of light today.

134
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, let's see.

135
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We've done a lot of the preparation work I'm, I'm, I'm happy to go any direction that you want to

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you, you certainly presented today with a lack of motivation. The and you can see that greatly impacted by the sleep and

139
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I hear you say I know I'm not as worried. Right. Well, I haven't heard you say it, you answer my questions.

140
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me try a different direction. Okay.

141
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about most days my preoccupies your mind.

143
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.380

Victoria reed: Yeah, but

158
00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't help.

159
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.390
No.

160
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.370
Victoria reed: But God it over with.

161
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, you have an amazing tolerance for pain. I gotta tell you that's

162
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.940
Victoria reed: Like it at the time.

163
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but you didn't pass out.

164
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.860
No.

165
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.280
Okay.

166
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your concerns with your health. So

167
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.530
I'm

168
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.650
Victoria reed: I try my hardest, you know, to

169
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.500
Victoria reed: Eat better

170
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.270
Victoria reed: And

171
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.250
Victoria reed: Sometimes I just like wake up with a custom

172
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.720
Victoria reed: Feels like maybe my health and doing that. Great.

173
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.900
Victoria reed: Still, yeah.

174
00:13:54.150 --> 00:14:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you learn so far about things that have helped with sort of the diabetes piece.

175
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But also in general gut health. What have you learned

176
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.110
Huh.

177
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:18.660
Victoria reed: I think the problem I'm having one my spell make, you know, because I have a user as it

178
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.730
Victoria reed: Is because lately my sleep thing is that

179
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.470
Victoria reed: Yeah. Feels like I don't have a lot of time in the day.

180
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.360
Victoria reed: And I know that's just my

181
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.320
Victoria reed: No sleep thing or

182
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.530
Victoria reed: I guess sleep but not enough.

183
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.840
Victoria reed: And I could really use, you know, the

184
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.840
Victoria reed: The normal amount of sleep.

185
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So walk me through last night.

186
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.280
What were you doing

187
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.200
Victoria reed: I'm

188
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.110
Victoria reed: Store.

189
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.710
Victoria reed: Go back, close the gate.

190
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.040
Victoria reed: And put the dogs out

191
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.570
Victoria reed: Played with them for a little while. When we got back in

192
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.730
Victoria reed: Then I made sure they had the their water and a little snack.

193
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:35.400
Victoria reed: Yeah, give them a little snack before bed time cuz I noticed, though.

194
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.690
Victoria reed: The little dogs her stomach seemed like it was kind of empty it was growing

195
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.290
Victoria reed: Okay, and then I

196
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.840
Victoria reed: Got them situated and off to sleep.

197
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.600
Victoria reed: And I

198
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.340
Victoria reed: I sat down to watch TV, and I saw

199
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: On TVs in your bedroom, you're laying in bed and he goes off or somewhere else in

200
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.960
Victoria reed: The living room.

201
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.280
Okay.

202
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.490
Victoria reed: And then

203
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.230
Victoria reed: I woke up and I went, it was like

204
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.690
Victoria reed: sleepy at all.

205
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.750
Victoria reed: After that,

206
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How long do you think you don't stop.

207
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.540
Victoria reed: Oh good CATnap about

208
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.910
Victoria reed: I'd say about 10 minutes. Okay. Yeah.

209
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.900
Victoria reed: I don't know, for some reason, I just couldn't help it. I just

210
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.910
Victoria reed: Yeah.

211
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What time was

212
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.690
Victoria reed: Though

213
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.910
Victoria reed: Well,

214
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.340
Victoria reed: 3434 something like that and

215
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.060
Victoria reed: And I ended up after that I woke up.

216
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.290
Victoria reed: And I couldn't sleep those like

217
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:24.810
Victoria reed: There was one there was two to 30 yeah yeah

218
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

219
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that we need to incorporate maybe some muscle relaxation never done that, when you're trying to sleep.

220
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.800
Victoria reed: Oh,

221
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

222
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.220
Victoria reed: That would be something to try, though.

223
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we'll just add that to the

224
00:17:48.780 --> 00:18:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears really give me a hard time this morning we'll get that to the list of things to do. So there are just an endless number of ways to do it.

225
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.770
Victoria reed: Yeah.

226
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little bit together.

227
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we and and what's neat about something like this is

228
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.590
Victoria reed: Actually

229
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I use it for a specific distress. So why don't you think of something that is a little concerning maybe it's something that's going on. It's the current trigger in your life. Or maybe it's some fear about how something in the future will turn out.

230
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's a negative pin and about someone or yourself or

231
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just allow your body not at 100 which is still a little bit, maybe a 30% right to be a little activated. If that imagery

232
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll start this relaxation by

233
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: First

234
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Having this breath that comes in, always going to

235
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.260
The

236
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: As a place to start imagining that as you have this inhale breath that it's like a balloon that's expanding into your belly is that balloon or that that bottom of your long is

237
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The balloon that is expanding on your inhale.

238
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing to practice that very important

239
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Parasympathetic down regulation activity. We really want to keep keep honing that skill of re breathing into our belly.

240
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just focus there.

241
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And then picture in your mind a carefree image.

242
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined.

243
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in yourself there.

244
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Are your carefree not caring for others honoring to take care of anyone not worry about anyone just unburdened

245
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get to play.

246
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'd like you to imagine just the perfect temperature

247
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Not too hot, not too cold.

248
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And have it move

249
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of almost saturating more washing over you somehow this temperature moving

250
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: From your feet.

251
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Through your body

252
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, for some people it's this

253
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of wash of

254
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Having each part of the body is you scan through it experience this perfect temperature

255
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll do that together and then we'll do another progressive muscle relaxation and then you'll kind of can have a choice of at least two that you can kind of move through to see which one

256
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Works for you at different times.

257
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start with this temperature. I want you to really focus on those shows and it gotten a fair amount of attention recently.

258
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget that.

259
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But our mind is going to focus it will tune out 90% of everything else. And we'll just be at those toes and they are at that temperature

260
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right

261
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let them feel it as it moves to the balls of the feet and the arches and

262
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To the heels.

263
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To the Achilles tendon calves to your shins.

264
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To the nice

265
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving to the thighs.

266
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The front, the back

267
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Chest just the right temperature. Maybe you'll notice

268
00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Tingling or other shifts or changes and just be a compassionate witness of what's going on.

269
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Just witnessing

270
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: As it moves to the hips.

271
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To the seat bones and tush that meet the seat.

272
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect temperature moving up that lower back.

273
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that temperature also go into the viscera got all the guts down there.

274
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And the belly.

275
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Up the back and of course now diaphragm.

276
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And the lungs.

277
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's not forget the hands

278
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let them be the perfect temperature just try

279
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Fingers and palms of your hands and moving up

280
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Risks and arms and it meets that sort of middle ground.

281
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right where your lungs are your, your biceps and lungs and how now it's moving all the way up.

282
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To the shoulders.

283
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: To the throat.

284
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the temperature is it connects with voice and

285
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you breathe.

286
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you swallow.

287
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The back of the neck.

288
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To the chin and

289
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Job.

290
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: At temperature washing through and over

291
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Just straight and then to the lips and tongue and into the mouth.

292
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the nose into the years

293
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To the orbit of the eyes.

294
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: nasal passage and

295
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.440
For

296
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving up

297
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The forehead to the skull to her hair.

298
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Covers the skull and then

299
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: See

300
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: anything's left charged in the body.

301
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Charge it could be

302
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Like twitching.

303
00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: An energy

304
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention.

305
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A sinking feeling

306
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Many, many messages that go on the body.

307
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So in this

308
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of state will go into the alternative, although you could certainly combine them as we are now.

309
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like you to this time, the same way you did this sort of temperature wash

310
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to tense. The muscles.

311
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Of each body part.

312
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving up your body and then all the way back down.

313
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: For at least let's say we'll do it for five seconds. Let's start with those toes as much as you can just sort of scrunch them up.

314
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: 54321 and let's scrunch up those feet either arch them up or maybe scrunch them as a pointy toe, whatever works in those shoes.

315
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's

316
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.550

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, I kind of opened my palms flat. I can get them tight by Archie my my wrist back

352
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And have that awareness come down the spine. However, maybe you want to just lift straight stretching out, that's fine, but you're activating it you're aware of it.

353
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Progressively moving down the body.

354
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can sort of arch that lower back to just say hey we're flexing you guys back there.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And those thighs.

359
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Calves

360
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This time let's flex that he'll bring sort of that 90 degree angle. Let's flex that he'll

361
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's end with crunching the toes.

362
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then a nice exhale

363
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And just notice if your mind wandered or if you're able to focus

364
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: On the muscle relaxation

365
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that progressive one right

366
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: With the tension that's a pretty

367
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: damn fun for people is that as you tighten it and relax.

368
00:32:53.700 --> 00:33:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Used to work your way all the way up the body because it takes time may take about 10 minutes or five depends on helmet. How long you do it.

369
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're doing so might mean that you may feel sleepy and go to sleep. And so it would be great if that would work.

370
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You might do that one first and then do the temperature, one for some people they have this sort of, you know, they haven't had any trauma history with water. They picture this warm water kind of coming over them if they have an waters, a really bad idea.

371
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I never know what people's history is

372
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:29.550
Victoria reed: Like I've been here.

373
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A list temperature, we can say, Okay, what's the perfect temperature and kind of have that awareness, kind of like, Oh, I can feel it coming over to spreading over the skull coming down.

374
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this perfect temperature moving all the way through. And that might be a nice way to end it would be moving with a muscle relaxation and muscle tension relax all the way up and down the body and then and then this this temperature one

375
00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be interested in giving that a try. Maybe when you're trying to go to sleep. Right, it's time for bed.

376
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.490
And

377
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're ready to go to bed, maybe done some reading

378
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe TV might not be

379
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.740
Victoria reed: Yeah, I

380
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.690
Victoria reed: Think I had to

381
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.000
Victoria reed: Cut that out. Yeah.

382
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.860
Victoria reed: TV before I go to bed. Yeah.

383
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Might not be ideal that screen time can kind of activate us instead of make us tired. I think reading might be, what do you, what do you have this like what do you have nearby.

384
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.360
Victoria reed: I have

385
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.850
Victoria reed: A Bible, my son gave me

386
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.190
Victoria reed: Um,

387
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.070
That's

388
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.050
Victoria reed: About it.

389
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like reading

390
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:51.960
Victoria reed: Yes, I do.

391
00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Could it be something you would enjoy

392
00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To go to a library to pick one up.

393
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That could be a task you could set from

394
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.950
Victoria reed: Here.

395
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, okay, I need to do this. It's some maybe there's something if you don't want to do fiction. I rather none nonfiction. Maybe there's something you want to learn about

396
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Was anything with learning right it, it helps the brain from shrinking that happens about age 30

397
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.610
Starts

398
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything. And so if you have something you're interested in learning about that can be kind of cool.

399
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And right it'll really work focused on now and not something else. And it'll exhaust because that's a huge piece of

400
00:35:51.660 --> 00:36:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Our energy glucose use our brain. I believe it or not huge part of energy consumption and caloric use is our brain, so you get that working

401
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To get tired, which would be good. So getting those couple things are trying

402
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.440
Victoria reed: To share. Well, yeah.

403
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.140
Victoria reed: All right, not down

405
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.890
Victoria reed: That's good ideas.

406
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.510
Victoria reed: I am definitely going to try that. Okay.

407
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And

408
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: On the topic of cravings and interpersonal dynamics how things are going with your on

409
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom and things like that, you know, kind of, how are those things. How are those relationships.

410
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.680
Victoria reed: Was my mom, um,

411
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.240
Victoria reed: She

412
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.530
Victoria reed: Pretty much will you know, start

413
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:30.390
Victoria reed: texting me, she'll text me from Facebook app to text me from her phone. And then if you know I'm busy. I'm won't really answer her, you know, I'll tell her all text or back when I'm done.

414
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:35.700
Victoria reed: And then she'll start shall wait a few and start

415
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:42.000
Victoria reed: Calling me every like every few minutes and

416
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.520
Victoria reed: I just all turn my phone on silent.

417
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.010
Victoria reed: Or

418
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.400
Victoria reed: I'll just turn it off for a little while.

419
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.180
Victoria reed: After I figure after I tell her you know that I'm

420
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.290
Victoria reed: Busy I'm driving or something. Yeah, that's like

421
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.260
Victoria reed: Oh no, about

422
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.870
Victoria reed: What to think about that.

423
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do what do you when she does disregards your request.

424
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

425
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.550
Your emotion.

426
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:29.640
Victoria reed: I'm

427
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.160
Victoria reed: Frustration.

428
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.200
Victoria reed: Yeah. Yeah, because I'll be doing something

429
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.990
Victoria reed: And I was thinking, would this you have like a jacking device.

430
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:55.050
Victoria reed: You know, like know when I'm driving or something. So start blowing up my phone as my son says, you know, start blowing up my phone and

431
00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.650
Victoria reed: But I don't answer one on driving. Yeah, that's something I won't do.

432
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You mean a lot of progress and saying that boundary with her.

433
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:07.920
Victoria reed: Yes.

434
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And as I warn everyone just because you set the boundary doesn't mean people see it. So they're going to exactly they'll continue to behave the same way. You just have to keep setting it and setting it and setting and setting it and setting and

435
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.330
Setting it and say,

436
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're worth it protecting that emotional space for yourself.

437
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have an impact on you and you know you can sort of

438
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: share a little bit about what the system like to have her continue to do this. I don't, I don't know how that affects you to tell me how, how does that affect you, that she continues to call him, and I've asked her not to

439
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.850
Victoria reed: Frustration, it does, it gives me frustrated, then

440
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:05.940
Victoria reed: I remember you know the techniques to breathing that helps me, it really does that help me a great deal.

441
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You know one of your emotions that you're you don't express much as anger.

442
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is frustration.

443
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of close

444
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.460
Victoria reed: Yes.

445
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.470
Victoria reed: It really is. Yeah.

446
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.620
Victoria reed: I see frustration more, you know,

447
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.050
Victoria reed: I take anger.

448
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.520
Victoria reed: More like frustration. Yeah.

449
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, it's, it's probably going to show up as the word frustration.

450
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.880
Yes.

451
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you tell me what would happen if you expressed

452
00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your anger or frustration with your mom, what, what would happen.

453
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.840
Victoria reed: To that wounded.

454
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what would happen. What would she do, what would you do

455
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:17.610
Victoria reed: I'm to start telling everybody calling my aunts and everyone

456
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.130
Victoria reed: Wounded her

457
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.970
Victoria reed: Yeah, pretty much. That's what she does.

458
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.990
Victoria reed: They're mad at me for no reason. So I just

459
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.680
Victoria reed: I ignore that. Yeah, I tell them you don't know the whole story well

460
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:40.680
Victoria reed: Don't assume stuff.

461
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm. Am I correct. Are you I'm isolating just a little bit over the last week. You've been pulling back from contact with people. Are you making plans.

462
00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:02.130
Victoria reed: When I find it, and I'm like the ones to, you know,

482
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.960
Victoria reed: Sometimes

483
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:52.500
Victoria reed: I get that little thing there where I don't really want to bug him too much. Well, he tells me you know he doesn't mean anytime. He's always available to talk or he always lets me know that. And on that note, as well.

484
00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:54.510
Victoria reed: What

485
00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.810

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.420
Victoria reed: I don't want to bug him you know like

487
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:09.210
Victoria reed: impose on him if he's busy, but I know

488
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:24.660
Victoria reed: In reality, if he's busy. He will let me know. This is a good time. I'll get back to you. Whenever I'm free. Soon he tell he's told me that before so

489
00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:35.880

490
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.520
Victoria reed: He's a great big hill. He gives me pointers and stuff.

491
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that

492
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This week, maybe or soon. You might feel comfortable reaching out because it's for you, for you to feel

493
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:54.420
Victoria reed: Yeah.

494
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the stuff that's going on with your mom.

495
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't be the only communication this sort of twisted stuff she's

496
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing. You know, I want you to feel connected, much like you did with Cindy, to make sure you're you're getting you're staying in connection with people. It gets risky when we start to isolate

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That this week, reaching out to your uncle and then

498

502
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.150
Victoria reed: I help

503
00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about um

Victoria reed: A little Shaka plugging something in

615
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:18.930
Victoria reed: Yeah. And ever since.

616
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:33.240
Victoria reed: That is like sometimes I have problems plugging things in because I yet, you know, but I still force myself to do it. Yeah. Gotcha.

617
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.210
Victoria reed: Be bed.

618
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, I get it. I wrote it down, we would definitely need a room to do it though. Yes. You need this, you know, having that right there. And we could do it would be this particular intervention is called somatic experiencing or Snapchats formation.

619
00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Where there would be a discharge of that and there's probably the mechanism of change has to do with there might have been

620
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: An action that you wanted to do the body wanted to do that is incomplete. So the idea behind it is you just complete it.

621
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously there's more to it than that. But let's see if you can put together a lock a system of being able to feel comfortable to talk openly in that space. And then from there, okay.

622
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I got it down for

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Must. There's a lot to do muscle relaxation doing the temperature relaxation, the lock the room and a visit to see it out lots to do,

627
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.110

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:31.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: A little bit or no.

640
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:35.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: Maybe I should turn the other way. I don't know.

641
00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Putting on my chair.

642
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.710

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:27.090
And whenever they choose.

653
00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:29.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: Maybe

654
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's another one in here and they needed to like differentiate them.

655
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:36.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay. Oh, yeah.

656
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:39.330

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me see where we're at here.

658
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You checked in virtual clinic already. I'm assuming

659
00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:03.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yes, I always like checking the half hour before we know it takes a while to get in there sometimes.

660
00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.490
Smart

661
00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't need to do a treatment plan review. So we can do whatever we want to. All right, so you're you're staying steady at 6.5 correct

662
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. All right. And you're feeling okay

663
00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you recognize. Yeah, okay.

664
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:43.440
Mm hmm.

665
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

666
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: Still adjusting

667
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:57.840
Elizabeth Sandoval: Oh, I guess it's getting a little better. I still wake up kind of sweaty and make that is what I noticed in my nose has been running a lot

668
00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:09.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: And then I've been kind of like hot and cold, the same time so it's it's it's an awful feeling like hot, but then you can get cold so fast, you know,

669
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Awful.

670
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:22.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's awful. I don't like the feeling of it, but I know nobody's pulling it so

671
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm just wondering if maybe awful and horrible that term is doing you a disservice. It might be a big word. You see what I'm trying to

672
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:35.760
Elizabeth Sandoval: Say,

673
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:36.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: You might be. Yeah.

674
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if it's like is that

675
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.760
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's bearable.

676
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:46.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's bearable it's uncomfortable, but it's bearable. Okay, maybe

677
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right horrible might be a broken ankle.

678
01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.

679
01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: You're just discreet the

680
01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:04.230
Elizabeth Sandoval: The word for it. It's a little dramatic, but yeah, I guess it's bearable that it's still uncomfortable, but I mean, the quality and helps

681
01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. And thank goodness for that. The doctors have figured out a way to kind of help people through

682
01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, but either way it really sounds like you need to stick with this for another week or two. It sounds like so.

683
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:21.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: Here you're feeling better.

684
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:22.920
Um,

685
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So talk to me a little bit about let's go in down here to

686
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already have something that you kind of wanted to talk about you already have something mine.

687
01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:39.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Oh no, I mean, I liked our was our manipulative

688
01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.210
Elizabeth Sandoval: Live behavior inventory

689
01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you like

690
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:59.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um, well, I mean it was cool, because, like, you know, it made me think of maybe how I used to fill and you know more of them were yeses at a time, but that current day. You know, I only had a few yeses.

691
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so looking at it here. I've got it up.

692
01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:15.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: Right. Okay, let's see. Yeah, number, number one, um, I put no

693
01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, no. And I put yes was on six

694
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting you said no to number one.

695
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I will. I'm curious. Did you put enough yes to

696
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: See if I can find it.

697
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you ever do this one.

698
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:51.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: Number 2222 I put yes for that one cry, what

699
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example of a story.

700
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:10.140
Elizabeth Sandoval: Before I guess when I was with my husband, like, um, I would be like us, maybe like the kids like they're sick they they need something so he would come, you know,

701
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:18.300
Elizabeth Sandoval: Or I'd be like, we're having a problem here at the house just like it see him, but I know that was wrong.

702
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:22.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: Let me see you think of something else.

703
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:33.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: Or just before, you know, long time ago. I felt really bad. So I would feel like, you know, I didn't want to be heard. Omar

704
01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:47.100
Elizabeth Sandoval: So I would, you know, tell them I would kill on was going to kill myself sometimes that's not nothing on on a proud of. But it's something I could admit to that I've done in the past.

705
01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:47.880
Well, look.

706
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you got to see this on the page and maybe make did you kind of get a sense. Oh, other people do that too.

707
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:00.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um,

708
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:10.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: Maybe I mean I'm sure people do things like that, just for the you know the mind trick.

709
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: But yeah, people do it.

710
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All Elizabeth, it's on this piece of paper. Why do you think I put it on the piece of paper.

711
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, because it's a normal thing.

712
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Because a lot of people do this and do you know

713
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How you try with your husband. Everything else to get his attention.

714
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:43.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: At that point, yeah. I mean, you know, I gave them the ultimatum. Like if you don't change these on leave you

715
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:52.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know you won't be around the kids and your condition. You know, I would give him those type of

716
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:58.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: Ultimatum. But it didn't like even seem like it Kurt. Kurt at the time, you know,

717
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And he was in active addiction at that point.

718
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:02.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

719
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because your husband wasn't around

720
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:07.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

721
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.490
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, it doesn't

722
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: More for me. You go die on care more for me that

723
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Added care husband wasn't making the decision sciatic was

724
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

725
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I was really risky.

726
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.840
Elizabeth Sandoval: Risky and what i mean i mean

727
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.690
Elizabeth Sandoval: Thank God I you know

728
01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: Changing my mind. But you know what keeps me always going is my kids, you know,

729
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: Cuz I'm thinking, what's going to happen to them, you know,

730
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:41.730
Elizabeth Sandoval: So never want to do

731
01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You, um, you're talking about suicide. You're talking about

732
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, for it attempts to try to get it has been has since passed away, right.

733
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.710
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, when

734
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That time he was in active addiction. There was all of this intensity going on. And today, right the way your, your aspects that means how you're expressing it on your face is pretty neutral.

735
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How is that

736
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Accurate to how your internal experiences or inaccurate is your face, reflecting what it's like to be you. Or is your face a mask but inside there's turmoil.

737
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:42.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean, I might have a mask of times I've learned to become more strong like inside

738
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:46.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: I pray a lot

739
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:57.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: So that gives me a lot of strength. But yeah, I probably have a mass, most of the time I'm getting better at it. I mean, as far as like

740
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:00.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Showing how I really feel

741
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Who can

742
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:09.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: You guess it's been so long already. I maybe that's why it's it's not so hard anymore. Uh huh.

743
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Time is fast and we're talking about the grief right now.

744
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.010
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah. Okay. And then I was also angry with him, you know,

745
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.630
Elizabeth Sandoval: So i mean it's it's it's gotten better. I mean,

746
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:29.700
Elizabeth Sandoval: But yeah, it bothers me at times when like say with my oldest son, you know,

747
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, he misses his dad so

748
01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:51.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know I get angry because you know what he's not there for them or, you know, for my kids, that's the only time I get like angry or sad is like when something comes up with the kids where they're having something going on and they might need their dad, you know, but

749
01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:57.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: That's okay.

750
01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And who gets to see the real you. Nowadays,

751
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: You

752
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:13.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know I'm i mean you know my family. I mean, I've been pretty honest with everybody you know about like what I'm doing.

753
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:25.710
Elizabeth Sandoval: As far as like my program, you know, everybody's like, well, happy. So before I would hide it. You know, I was so embarrassed. Like, I don't want my parents to know what I'm doing. But now, everybody knows

754
01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: When she saw

755
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:32.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: I would say like a few weeks after I started the program.

756
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:44.130
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it's been a while. Like, everybody knows, like I have my meetings every, you know, Mondays and Wednesdays, Thursdays, you know, so like I kind of plan my day around that.

757
01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:57.210
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it's, it's nice. It's I feel free because before I would be like, you know, trying to sweep it under the rug and not be honest but it's I feel better now just being honest with what it is.

758
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: And then plus being, I can't. Sorry.

759
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:12.930

786
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:42.120

787
01:11:45.480 --> 01:12:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So, did you know that after the age of 30 your brain, aside from one part of it. The hippocampus, the one that was the long term memory that your brain just starts shrinking.

788
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:02.880
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

789
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And knowing, knowing that and I've got, I can never remember this word, but sometimes hearing the fancy word can help maybe by the end of the day, I'll have it stored in my head.

790
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When you exercise.

791
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You are creating the growth protein.

792
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

793
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.940
You're going to find it.

794
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: neurotrophic factor.

795
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.220
Narrow

796
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.010
Elizabeth Sandoval: Soldier.

798
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to say no, don't bother.

799
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Just picture. I don't want my brain to shrink.

800
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we need that brain working to log into our hundreds. Right.

801
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So just think about it, it's more than just right losing weight. And that's why when people say, oh, I want to lose a few pounds. I'm like, there's a lot more going on and fitting in your favorite jeans. There's your brain shrinking. I mean this is just like we've got to keep in motion.

802
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, okay. So, really important.

803
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm love that you're exercising. That's great. And this is from a video right

804
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:41.130
Elizabeth Sandoval: Mm hmm. Yeah. I got, I have Xfinity and they have like free like things that you could do on their programs. So yeah, it's pretty cool.

805
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:47.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like you have different ones too. So if you're not always stuck doing the same one, which is good.

806
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And how's that positive you did get rid of the papers in in

807
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:53.730
Center.

808
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe shoes out of there. What, what is what's needed in there.

809
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:07.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: Hasn't been trained ones. I'm sorry. That's the only thing that happened, really, I'm gonna be honest, I haven't messed with

810
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: YOUR CLOSET you're stuck with

811
01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:30.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I mean I hang up my clothes and it's just something. This is my, this is my clothes that I've put aside like to get rid of to donate and stuff. I just don't have them in there, but you're gonna get rid of them send them to donation. So let me ask you something, Elizabeth.

812
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: On a your husband's. Is that why there's since mixed feelings.

813
01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know what do you know

814
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:38.910
Holding you back.

815
01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:41.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um,

816
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:47.070
Elizabeth Sandoval: I guess going out and doing it. I mean, there's nothing really I just get sidetracked.

817
01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:58.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, it's like to be like yeah I'm or my kids or Any Store or my mom calls me where I got to see my brother. Something I mean

818
01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:03.690
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just, I guess I haven't felt it as being very important right now.

819
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on here as a goal. I wonder why it got on here.

820
01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: I yeah I mean that I guess it was a goal at the time, but it's not really important know

821
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What moved up unimportant. What moved up that one went down what's moving up

822
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:33.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, just stuff that I've been spending more time with my brother as much time as I can so

823
01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: That's I spent a lot of time over there so

824
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: I guess that's one of the reasons why I don't want to go through with

825
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.290
Elizabeth Sandoval: My brother, he's he's doing good, he's he's losing more weight seems like

826
01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: Slowing down

827
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:15.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: He doesn't like to he hasn't been wanting it like because we before we go eat breakfast and you'd want to go to the casino once in a while, you know, but you don't want to do anything which I understand and

828
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:21.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: So I know he's really not doing well. My brother is always like on the move. He's always been on the move.

829
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:34.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: And then like with the hardware you know he's always on. He hasn't been on top of that I'm I helped him make his we start the day and you know this. I know it's

830
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.840
Elizabeth Sandoval: Almost like

831
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: How the dynamics between your mom and your brother.

832
01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:48.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: They've gotten better. They've actually been talking. So, which is good.

833
01:16:49.800 --> 01:17:00.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: And she's been spending more time with him, you know, vice versa. So it's good, it's time. No, they still get like into these little arguments, you know,

834
01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.000
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

835
01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:10.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I mean, at least they're talking and trying to make things and make time, you know,

836
01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:15.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: I hope they correct it. I mean, my mom sees more happier. You know, like

837
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:23.130
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, because I know it was really hurting or there. He wasn't rightfully many too much or paying attention to her.

838
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: Oh, it's just been rough

839
01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: And word

840
01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just said it's getting closer.

841
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:44.820
You can see some science.

842
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:47.160
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's really scary.

843
01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So make sure you let your mind just just share whatever's on your mind maybe

844
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brother. Why don't you just let it all out with me just

845
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:19.950
Elizabeth Sandoval: One.

846
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:22.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just

847
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: Gonna be hard.

848
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys grew up together did this and that all these stories all this

849
01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:49.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: Is that what you're thinking.

850
01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.130
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, no. Just us being together and

851
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.220
Elizabeth Sandoval: I feel bad for like

852
01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.460
Elizabeth Sandoval: His grandson. He has one grandson for your gold.

853
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: therapies for you gotta let it out with somebody, don't ship.

854
01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:33.510
Yeah.

855
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Just as you were saying that I i had a thought.

856
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:40.290
You know, I was thinking about

857
01:19:42.150 --> 01:20:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I was picturing you sort of going, you know, to this favorite place in the him as or somewhere you know and and video archiving things and having him. Maybe tell some stories on video or or not, but maybe his voice only or

858
01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever works for you, but

859
01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Box was going in my mind I was thinking, you know, his grandson could get to know

860
01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

861
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:24.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, we've been working on that they they offer. It was called the legacy thing, you know, if they can do for him. Okay, so I know he, I think he's gonna do that so

862
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:37.920
I know you're going to miss him.

863
01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.170
I know

864
01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have learned from with your husband that they don't really leave us that quality stays there that love never ends those memories of yours.

865
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And he

866
01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Think he's hurting

867
01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell. I don't know if he is but

868
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she want

869
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: She wanna keep going at it. Keep trying.

870
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:24.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think he still wants to keep going because I know like I didn't worry about you. I worry about my kids, you know, I think he's more worried about everybody can sell, you know,

871
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: He doesn't want to like leave us

872
01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:35.400
Elizabeth Sandoval: But you know i thought i mean i don't want him to suffer either is costs a lot worse.

873
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:41.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, it's like an AS LONG AS I SAID IT'S IN HIS BONES liberty, so

874
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're saying because he doesn't want you guys to be sad.

875
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.950
I think that's what's going on.

876
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:51.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Maybe

877
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:53.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

878
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.070
something were to happen with him.

879
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a way to turn

880
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: toward your children toward your mother towards people in your life, you sound how this family is going to be. Are you guys going to come together, or is there going to be a scattering. Some families, it ends up happening like that.

881
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.260
Like what do you think's gonna

882
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: I hope we come together. I mean,

883
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:39.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I don't know you might scatter

884
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:45.300
Elizabeth Sandoval: I hope we stay together. That's my flag like

885
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:47.700
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I don't know for sure.

886
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:50.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's pretty worried about that too.

887
01:22:50.220 --> 01:23:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about. I'm thinking, this can either be an opportunity for deeper connection or everyone can recoil get scared and no one talk but

888
01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What makes you concern. Let's, let's look at Mom, what makes you concern that might happen around with her that she might stop talking to you even pulling something off even further.

889
01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:22.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: How do I feel about her.

890
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What she. What do you think might happen with her.

891
01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.630
Elizabeth Sandoval: She might like.

892
01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:36.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know. She might probably she might like meet her own time to, you know,

893
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I don't know. I mean, I can't

894
01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

895
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:45.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: What do you know what's gonna happen.

896
01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:46.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know

897
01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want

898
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:52.470
Elizabeth Sandoval: I want her to become stronger and

899
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:57.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Be be around like for

900
01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:10.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: The grandkids and stuff like that. They may my mom, she can get mad and she holds graduation. She will talk to no one like if you hurt your feelings but you know it's not like that.

901
01:24:13.530 --> 01:24:20.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: So I really don't know. Gordon, what, what will happen. I, I hope it will make our family stronger and come together.

902
01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:23.760
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I

903
01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:24.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: Really don't know

904
01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you seen instance for that happens for where you guys have come gotten closer. Is there a history, we have been able to use the family as a refuge as a place

905
01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:55.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah yeah yeah actually when when when my when my husband passed away. I had a lot of support from everyone, so okay there, they really either for me or my my oldest cousin. She's nine years older than me. But she's more like my sister.

906
01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:04.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: And I wish, like we were close early like when we used to be when we were younger, but she's married and have like a family and, you know,

907
01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:17.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's hard to see each other, you know, most every because everybody has their lives, but she gave me a lot of support when my husband white and stuff to my brother was there.

908
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:23.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because it happened in Colorado, so I have to like believe here and they took me there.

909
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.240
Elizabeth Sandoval: And my cousin, Deb, the one that drove me there that day, my brother, pick me up from there.

910
01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:34.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: So let's take some time for like funeral and all that so

911
01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there.

912
01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:37.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: really hoping

913
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any way that you could connect sooner to your cousin.

914
01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: Rather than later.

915
01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Reach out to her. Just see her. She's doing nothing, no big agenda, just to kind of reach out. Hey, what's up.

916
01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:57.240
Yeah.

917
01:25:58.410 --> 01:26:12.120
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, we've actually been talking because before like I mean she goes to see my brother quite a bit too. So I've run into a few times. So I've been talking to her more often. Yeah, but I should spend more time with her so

918
01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it may be, it's about

919
01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Purposely

920
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Planning time

921
01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if I were. Let's go back to mom for just a second. She says she's a big player in your life. She's an important person.

922
01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you didn't have to worry if I'm hurt. You don't have to worry about my anger. I'm not going to hold a grudge. I'm not going to misinterpret you

923
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When if I'm her and you were to have a conversation

924
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking to the future, right, because if he's, he's very ill and worst case this he passes away.

925
01:26:58.980 --> 01:26:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And

926
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm your mom and you don't have to worry about me emotionally

927
01:27:05.730 --> 01:27:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can identify what you want from me.

928
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:18.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: I want some support and understanding

929
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not to be so hard on me.

930
01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, not so hard on you.

931
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

932
01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how can

933
01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I show you I'm not being hard on you.

934
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.340
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just by listening to me.

935
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:42.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just let me see what I got to see

936
01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:45.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: You're making it about yourself.

937
01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I keep doing that. I know.

938
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I could just listen.

939
01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that space that pain. I can just hold the space and not

940
01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.130
Elizabeth Sandoval: Work to Logan.

941
01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't it be nice, right.

942
01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: I try to close it is like I or believe in my in

943
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: My water to hear me.

944
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's probably more like this.

945
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hear all that the only thing I can do.

946
01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is get distance from your pain, my pain is almost overwhelming for me.

947
01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing the best I can. What's your pain.

948
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like mine is just swallowing me up.

949
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hold yours. I'm so sorry.

950
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:15.810
I mean,

951
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I would get help. I wish I could lean on on someone else but

952
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what I learned. This is how I learned to cope. I'm doing the best I can. I know I'm not great at it.

953
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be all there is. I don't know. I don't know what she's capable of

954
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just wonder if there's a pattern of making a moment about herself. She

955
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: May not be able to sit with you.

956
01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:00.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know,

957
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean I don't love you. It doesn't mean that

958
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just not skilled at handling my own distress.

959
01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good at it.

960
01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

961
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah yeah

962
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're lucky, you're learning early at a young age as a young woman.

963
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're learning new skills on how to rely on yourself, reach out to people and take in support and connection and you're connecting again to your spirituality. You're really lucky, you're doing that.

964
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You've taken some kind of ugly right this addiction stuff and you're turning it around and you're making it about growth.

965
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

966
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the same. I'm sorry.

967
01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:20.100
Elizabeth Sandoval: Tissue

968
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So the space that's left. If you accept what is radically accept my limitation.

969
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And come towards me anyway.

970
01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You come towards me, even though I'm prickly and snarky and I hold grudges.

971
01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: coming towards me, you know, this family. You've been in it for a long time you know the way to get the little morsel of resource love, affection and nurturing, so I have to offer.

972
01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What is still available to you. What can you do to still feel connected to me but not let me take over.

973
01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you still do and be around me where you don't disappear. For me my life.

974
01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That you really see my limitations.

975
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what that is.

976
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.010
Elizabeth Sandoval: You felt

977
01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.330
Elizabeth Sandoval: I felt I felt that was weird.

978
01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty confident concept.

979
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

980
01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: To answer it right away.

981
01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:14.070
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to

982
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:16.590
Elizabeth Sandoval: Marry, like, Meredith, we

983
01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't yet.

984
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's think about it like this.

985
01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe get a little drawing on on a clean sheet of paper right just sort of draw a picture of a symbol, you know, of your mother. Maybe it's a a heart or maybe it's a cactus.

986
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:37.050
I don't know.

987
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a heart can

988
01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, whatever.

989
01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You draw the image of her

990
01:33:49.020 --> 01:34:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And really seeing her not asking her to change. Now, right now, right, this is this is a tough time. This is about acceptance. This isn't we're going to go in with all these big behavior request, this is, this is

991
01:34:05.490 --> 01:34:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is her son.

992
01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:10.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay.

993
01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And for all of her fellows.

994
01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:17.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: To be

995
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah,

996
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't even sit with it.

997
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I don't know.

998
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So big, you know, to think that our child.

999
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that bill.

1000
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1001
01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can meet her there in that compassion. Right.

1002
01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:42.360
Yeah.

1003
01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:48.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: We do want to be there for the whole for, you know,

1004
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What you need help, too.

1005
01:34:55.470 --> 01:35:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you look at this image on the page. Maybe off on the left. I want you to picture what you may be drawing a little image of you, you can get from her even from her whatever that images.

1006
01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you can give to her to put don't try and change her. She is

1007
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's the radical acceptance.

1008
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe someday, whatever, but not on the stage today we accept

1009
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what she's capable of. I can get that from her no judgment. This isn't enough. Nope. Not today. It's just

1010
01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:30.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: What I

1011
01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Get from her.

1012
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be little things I can get little emojis or I can get little texts from her. I can get quick little conversations about the weather.

1013
01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. That goes for example. And what I can give to her. I can give to her little messages I can check in once a day, or every week and say,

1014
01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:52.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: Hey, just see how you're

1015
01:35:52.890 --> 01:36:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing um let's let's make some some chilies this weekend or you know whatever it is just kind of labeling it I can continue to give and receive love. If I accept her for what she is.

1016
01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still there. It doesn't have to be right, this big separation.

1017
01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't get it dry.

1018
01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Up with something right

1019
01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:28.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I put like a remove

1020
01:36:29.490 --> 01:36:34.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just like I just needed to be open, you know, open minded and

1021
01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been here before. Really listen to the words I'm using this has been this way for months, listen to what you say listen closely this

1022
01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I listen this is

1023
01:36:50.610 --> 01:37:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the opposite of what I've just asked. This is you, you months ago and just now. Mom, I need you to be open, so I can go back to school, you recognize that

1024
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When I go get help. I need

1025
01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You to

1026
01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Be different. What I asked for today is radical acceptance.

1027
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: don't draw rainbow if she's not a rainbow new page accept her for what she is. You have a right

1028
01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Not waiting for her to change.

1029
01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:34.590
Elizabeth Sandoval: Can we

1030
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.240
Can't wait.

1031
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:39.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Up the chain.

1032
01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to see her honey for who she is. That's why I said a little cactus and your

1033
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: Broker

1034
01:37:53.190 --> 01:38:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She was this is what you have been saying you didn't an anchor room. You did it in there. I need her to be open so that I can

1035
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I can. I need her to do this thing. Then I can well

1036
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life is on hold. What about your life.

1037
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what radical acceptance is we say

1038
01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I accept you.

1039
01:38:20.730 --> 01:38:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For who you are because guess what it feels so good to be given that to be given Radek I'm acceptable just the way I am.

1040
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how good that feels too. I, I was addicted. I did some messed up things. Maybe I did I was focused on myself. Not my kids. So my family. I did go on a blah and I'm still lovable, that is radical acceptance.

1041
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Put her on that page. Draw what is not this image of a mom you want, but what she is.

1042
01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: Can I do this for homework because it's going to need

1043
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: Time to really like

1044
01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:04.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: It and put it down.

1045
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, this is big.

1046
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But

1047
01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:09.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: Here.

1048
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What you had done that pattern that popped up.

1049
01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And wishful thinking. Notice that

1050
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:16.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yes, this is

1051
01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I need her to be open. She's not

1052
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Lover anyway.

1053
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:28.050
Elizabeth Sandoval: Do I do

1054
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to, you can just set those boundaries.

1055
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But we get to also accept her for who she is and for today. She might just not be capable of throwing her arms around you and reassuring, you and I am sorry I wish that was the case but wishing it is holding you back.

1056
01:39:58.170 --> 01:39:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, homework.

1057
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And art assignment so

1058
01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Over on the right is who she is. That's don't try and lie to yourself, none of that. I wish she was just drawing her over on the left, you can either draw a picture or write out the things that you can

1059
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Get from her that will be taken in as love, a love language. What is the agreed language. I will take this in from my mom. She always makes a big fuss about my birthday. She always makes a nice fuss about a particular meal. I'll take that in love. I will go in that way you see it.

1060
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you will do to show her

1061
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't look like a Hallmark card. Who cares. Nobody really has those anyway, so don't worry about it. Okay.

1062
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Live in reality.

1063
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you got your homework.

1064
01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:58.200
Yes.

1065
01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's schedule another time to meet

1066
01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.630

Gwenevere Abriel: I use a pencil for a reason. So I'm going to scribble in 9am on March 11 see if you've already got something going on.

1069
01:41:18.930 --> 01:41:21.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: Oh yeah no I don't want my name.

1070
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: On March 11 it's a Wednesday.

1071
01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:35.220

1073
01:41:46.050 --> 01:42:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all interesting to me one thing. It's all relevant. Oh, I never thought about it. Again, it's also relevant now. Then there's this I don't look at that kind of experience or whatever your truth is it's all acceptable. There's no wrong way to do any of this. Okay.

1074
01:42:02.490 --> 01:42:02.850
Okay.

1075
01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.180
Elizabeth Sandoval: Thank you. Today was a hard work.

Elizabeth Sandoval: It. I feel better. I need to work that out.
