00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.570
Shawn Phalen: Tommy. Tommy, what

9
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.230
Daniel De La Mora: I'm you know

10
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:09.900
Daniel De La Mora: I didn't know you're going to ask you that way. But I mean, I'm not gonna live. I've seen better weeks then what I've been dealing with. But, I mean, it's been good. As far as like me realizing, like where I am.

11
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.160
Daniel De La Mora: I don't know, like just

12
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.370
Daniel De La Mora: What's good right now. I guess family.

13
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.150
Daniel De La Mora: Just talking to talking to them.

14
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.140
Daniel De La Mora: Friends, talking to friends and then this week, I might be going to a concert with friends. So we'll see what's up that should be fun.

15
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.940
Shawn Phalen: So,

16
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.370
Shawn Phalen: I think last time we spoke, you were going actually driving in a dry the Santa Barbara.

17
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.450
Yeah.

18
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.650
I'm

19
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.580
Sorry.

20
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.730
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so after did you end up going up to Santa Barbara. Is that kind of in your ritual on Monday.

21
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:07.560
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah. Monday is what I'll do, I'll usually just hit up there for because I participate in this like kind of home study that my father does

22
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:18.180
Daniel De La Mora: As far as like just, you know, have a meeting with people and we just talked about things like, I don't know, it's, it's pretty cool. It's, it's like a Bible study, but not really. I don't know.

23
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.320
Daniel De La Mora: How to explain it. But yeah, I go up there for that. So, most of the time.

24
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.640
Daniel De La Mora: Which I'll actually probably do after the meeting.

25
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:40.740
Daniel De La Mora: But yeah, every Monday. That's kind of the ritualistic thing just to go up there. Just kind of the routine. And then what I'll do is I'll stay the night and then come back down to LA like the next day or the day after

26
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.910
Daniel De La Mora: Man, just kind of rotate. Yeah, and

27
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.410
You feel like that.

28
00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:02.040
Shawn Phalen: I mean, I know that you love the Bible study. Like, I know you like spending time with you like spending time if your dad and bonding over that. Do you feel like that has kind of kept you a little bit more grounded and your sobriety.

29
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.240
Daniel De La Mora: Keeping up with something that

30
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.000
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, I would say like it's something that definitely keeps me more grounded in aware of the situation I'm in, because

31
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.610
Daniel De La Mora: What I've realized like, I mean, I'm not gonna lie. And like I said, like the past. I mean, I've seen better weeks I guess in the past couple weeks but

32
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:34.380
Daniel De La Mora: Like what I've noticed about myself is like if I don't consistently remind myself about the situation I'm in, like in the reality of it, then I start to like

33
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.440
Daniel De La Mora: Not really recognize the severity

34
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:49.650
Daniel De La Mora: Of like what I'm doing to myself I'd say so. Like going up there and being around them really does put that into perspective and ground means what actually is happening.

35
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.170
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, okay. So does that mean that you relapse.

36
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.000
Daniel De La Mora: I mean, yeah, in the last couple weeks I messed up and just

37
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:09.900
Daniel De La Mora: It's just me falling victim to the whole, like I said, the whole mindset about, you know, everything is okay. You're like, Oh, you're doing good, or you don't need anything or

38
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.270
Daniel De La Mora: And that's what's making me mad as the fact that, like, I haven't gotten past that yet. Like at all like at all, and it's

39
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.100
Daniel De La Mora: It's just like it's it's really bothers me because of the fact that, like,

40
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.990
Daniel De La Mora: Like, I don't know, I'll go back up to my parents.

41
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.800
Daniel De La Mora: And like, I'll be good in the sense that, like, I don't really like showing that, like, I don't like going through withdrawals or anything in front of them.

42
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:52.980
Daniel De La Mora: Because it really like just ruins the whole vibe of the house and like me being in my bed and just like dealing with it all days trash. So like, usually when I go up there like I'm pretty good. As far as like, you know, I'll be all have a couple days are all I'll have been on the Suboxone

43
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.070
Daniel De La Mora: So like it'll be fine.

44
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.750
Daniel De La Mora: And

45
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.320
Daniel De La Mora: That's what like really

46
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.380
Daniel De La Mora: Gets me back to being like, dude, you got an issue as far as like you thinking everything's okay and like

47
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:22.440
Daniel De La Mora: Just when you start to feel normal again. And then, you know, I'm like, Oh, I'm not gonna take you know sidewalks in a day or I'm not going to do this. And then one day eventually leads into, like, Oh, I'm not going to do it today as well. And then like you start feeling like crap.

48
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:39.180
Daniel De La Mora: Because, like, I'm not past that point yet. And then you just go into that cycle. And it's like, I haven't been able to just say, you know, it's not okay. Like, even when it feels okay like I just haven't accepted, like, dude, you still got to like put work in

49
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:49.500
Daniel De La Mora: And this is an ongoing thing. You can't just like go a couple weeks, you know, on the medication and then be like oh you feeling way better and stop taking

50
00:06:50.640 --> 00:07:05.400
Daniel De La Mora: Because that's like that's like the cycle. I'm just tired of doing that, like, but it's like like no one could like forced me to like not do that though that's the thing that like I have to want to like not do that.

51
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.170
Daniel De La Mora: So,

52
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.760
Shawn Phalen: When you say okay so let's kind of walk through this whole

53
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.770
Shawn Phalen: Like a scenario. So you say the last you've had better weeks. So I think I saw you about a month ago so

54
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.230
That was like you think that you use maybe

55
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.660
For the last three weeks.

56
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.880
Daniel De La Mora: No probably like

57
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:45.840
Daniel De La Mora: I mean, I just, like, really, I kind of like just use like last week and then it was like a really low point as far as like me like realizing again like dude Like here we go again like you. It's just a restart to the cycle.

58
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.670
Daniel De La Mora: And it's like,

59
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.230
Shawn Phalen: What did you use

60
00:07:50.670 --> 00:08:10.290
Daniel De La Mora: Well, I just like took like oxy code on okay here's opiates opiates. It's just what it like it would what I'm what's been the struggle for me. Yeah. As far as everything. So when you took the opiates, or when you took the oxy will you with anybody, or were you by yourself.

61
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:20.790
Daniel De La Mora: I was primarily by myself as far as like decision making goes and yeah like now. There was no one around me like

62
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.940
Daniel De La Mora: Telling me like, yo, like, no, don't, don't go pick up or don't hit that person up or don't.

63
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:37.140
Daniel De La Mora: You know, I wasn't putting myself in those situations because like I said I was just not caring I was like in this non caring mood again where I was like, oh, everything's good like

64
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:52.560
Daniel De La Mora: You don't got to worry about it. And it's like, like I said, I can't. I gotta keep reminding myself, like, dude, you're an addict. Like, you can't just like it's not just something you flick off like a switch and it's like, you know, it's just accepting that but

65
00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:12.300
Daniel De La Mora: I mean I've accepted the part that I have like a problem and like an addiction, but it's just like really wanting to do something about it. I just feel like my brain. Like, even though I tell you that I want to, I feel like my brain fully doesn't accept that. Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

66
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.710
Shawn Phalen: What you're saying because you've said that to me. We've had so many conversations and

67
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:23.700
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, it's certainly not judgment on my part or criticism on my part, you know i just i think that

68
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.940
Shawn Phalen: You know, this is so more things going really well when you decided to take it.

69
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.520
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, like I was, I mean as far as really well being, you know, yeah, I was having good business. I was

70
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.600
Daniel De La Mora: Like I was around people that were

71
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:53.430
Daniel De La Mora: I want to, I don't want to say like I was around people that was separate susceptible to being influenced by, like, because that's not true.

72
00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:02.970
Daniel De La Mora: But I did like I was just in, you know, in studio sessions with clients that participate and stuff like, you know,

73
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:10.950
Daniel De La Mora: Not in the studio environment because they're being watched by someone professionally but there are people that like, you know, on their own time.

74
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:20.640
Daniel De La Mora: I know that they indulge and stuff. It's the but they're not going to like do that in the studio environment. So that's why I'm saying, like, I didn't have to worry about that there but but it was like

75
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.520
Daniel De La Mora: I don't know, just going to

76
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:33.780
Daniel De La Mora: Like going to parties or going to a couple like kickbacks. And then, you know, just feeling good feeling like you know you you haven't been using, you have been doing this, you know,

77
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:42.990
Daniel De La Mora: All like, what's one day gonna hurt like see thoughts like that. I don't expect to like pop into my head, but they do like yeah, and it just

78
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.020
Do you think it's like a wave rewarding yourself.

79
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.060
Daniel De La Mora: I mean,

80
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.060
Daniel De La Mora: I never really looked at it that way but like

81
00:10:52.770 --> 00:11:03.060
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, I mean, it looks that way. It looks that way is that when I talk about it that way. It looks like I'm in a way, thinking that I could reward myself for not using

82
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.830
Daniel De La Mora: Like you know for going like a couple

83
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:21.150
Daniel De La Mora: Weeks, so not using for like having work going really well. Hang out with friends, you know, those are all really does are positive things in your life and

84
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:36.030
Daniel De La Mora: It's not uncommon to use when you're really happy things are going really well because you're feeling better and you're feeling like you can just, just do it this one time I want to be a part of what's going on.

85
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.800
I want to reward myself for all the hard work I've done the past month.

86
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:52.080
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, you know, you don't it using doesn't necessarily mean that you're like a depressed mess, you know, using is

87
00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:02.400
Daniel De La Mora: You know, especially when people have had some amount of sobriety. You know, it's not uncommon for them to kind of do this dance that you're doing.

88
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:12.960
Daniel De La Mora: And and you're right you know this is like you just have to be so sick of doing it that you just don't do it anymore. And that's really what it comes down to.

89
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.390
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah.

90
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.650
Daniel De La Mora: Well, I'm pretty I'm pretty sick of it. I'm not gonna lie like

91
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.160
Daniel De La Mora: I'm just pretty sick of feeling like crap like that stuff. I just hate it as hate the fact that, like,

92
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:39.900
Daniel De La Mora: You can't just stop taking something and feel normal. Like you stop taking something and you endure physical like symptoms that just are unpleasant like that just the biggest thing that irks me and like

93
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.810
Daniel De La Mora: I don't know. It sucks, but it is what it is.

94
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.810
Shawn Phalen: How many do you take when you take some

95
00:12:48.240 --> 00:13:00.960
Daniel De La Mora: I'm not like I'll do like like one or two like and they're not really like I don't be like when I did do it. It was over the course of like the whole day. I do like to

96
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.810
Daniel De La Mora: And in the sense that like

97
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:12.420
Daniel De La Mora: Okay, like I was doing was feeling really good in the afternoon. All right, well, you know, I hit somebody up

98
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:22.980
Daniel De La Mora: They helped me out. And then I had, you know, took it was feeling good for a bit and then I took the rest of it later. But see, that's when I started, I was thinking it's like, dude,

99
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:33.030
Daniel De La Mora: You still have a high tolerance, like, and then I start remembering everything. And I'm like, What are you doing, like, then I started to feel bad about the whole situation and then it's like

100
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:49.260
Daniel De La Mora: It just goes into like feeling not like depressed or anything. Just down, like, Damn, you just let yourself down or like, and I don't want to keep. I'm not going to tell my parents every single freaking time like I'm doing that because I don't want them to feel that every time.

101
00:13:50.310 --> 00:14:05.100
Daniel De La Mora: Like to be honest with you, like, I'm going to deal with that and not show them that every time. Because then it's just going to kill the the vibe in the household. Like it doesn't bring joy to the household. So like mess. The number one thing that I like. Like, you know, focusing on

102
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:19.740
Daniel De La Mora: Is like when I come to the house. Like, I don't want there to be feelings of despair anything or like oh like Daniels doing bad or we see him laid up in his bed or because then that just really puts my parents on edge and like everyone the House on edge.

103
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:21.630
Daniel De La Mora: So it's like

104
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:32.520
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah sorts of really like I started to think about the reality of the situation again and then like, it's like I said, it's that cycle where it's like, you feel guilty.

105
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:41.460
Daniel De La Mora: Like yeah, straight up, I feel guilty about it and then like you, you do something about it for a while and then, you know, I'm just so sick of going through it but

106
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:49.680
Daniel De La Mora: I have to literally be so sick of it that it just yeah like I just don't want to do it no more well

107
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:59.850
Shawn Phalen: And it's also you have to be really aware of your thoughts, you know, and so you have to be the person that stops you find that person that you know you can get some fun, you know,

108
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.410
Daniel De La Mora: It's like

109
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:11.730
You know, you have to be the person that talks yourself out of it, you know. And here's herself a really rational pep talk

110
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.150
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, I feel that

111
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:34.470
Daniel De La Mora: Honestly, it's like it's just like if you have to really be aware of those thoughts of using start to creep back in where you know you you've got it, you've got to really pay attention to the signs are there there you know those signs of

112
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.510
Oh,

113
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.170
Hearing really good things are going really well.

114
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:52.140
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just take one and you know you have to really, it takes discipline.

115
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:53.550
And

116
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.140
Shawn Phalen: It takes a lot of self awareness is what it is to, like, cuz

117
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.360
Because you're you're aware of your feelings after you take them.

118
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.240
Daniel De La Mora: And I'm very aware, like in the moment when I need to be more aware, they're

119
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.560
Not for focus don't want you to focus like

120
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.730
Not even in the moment, but before them, and I want you

121
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.670
To your box and start paying attention to.

122
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.360
Shawn Phalen: What you're thinking and and how you're feeling

123
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:50.130
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, because it's just as important on the front end as it is on the back end, because on the back end, you already know that you're going to feel really guilty and obese and you're gonna want to hide it from your parents and you're gonna say, I don't want to do it again.

124
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.160
Shawn Phalen: And in the moment you mean it. I'm not saying that you down.

125
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.120
With you, well, where those thoughts and feelings.

126
00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.910
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, you got to be aware. Yeah.

127
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.890
Daniel De La Mora: Yes, true like is I'm not very were on the front end like

128
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:14.400
Daniel De La Mora: Like even before the thought pops like I should like I just gotta keep the same attitude as if like

129
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.510
Daniel De La Mora: Players if I just relaxed. You know, like I just have to keep that same attitude because

130
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:31.560
Daniel De La Mora: I just hate feeling good. Like, if I take them and then like, yeah, you feel good. As far as like, you know, you feel I'm gonna be real. Like you feel normal. A little bit.

131
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:42.060
Daniel De La Mora: And then like, you know, it starts to wear off really after a couple days the normality. And then you start really feeling like dang like

132
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:54.000
Daniel De La Mora: Like now you're not like good and like you can't take the Suboxone until you start feeling bad almost because if you do take it when you're not feeling bad, then it throws you into feeling bad.

133
00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:03.510
Daniel De La Mora: And then it's like you. Now you've screwed. Now you can't like, do anything. You just got to feel bad there for a little bit or something, I don't know.

134
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.610
Daniel De La Mora: So that's just been like it's a cycle. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

135
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.930
And have you got to break the cycle.

136
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.920
And sometimes it takes a little bit time like look, nobody really gets it on the first go

137
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.650
And do very rare.

138
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:44.670
Daniel De La Mora: Feel that I mean I'm just, I'm just glad that like I Can I address the issue though the first place because like I'm around some people like not not necessarily like they're my friends or anything, but I see some people who they just don't even address the issue at all.

139
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:58.410
Daniel De La Mora: They just keep going. They just keep going and going and going and then when they feel bad. They don't even like think they have an issue or anything. They just are like, Oh, I just feel bad. I have to have to handle it. I just had to go get high or something. And I'm like, dude,

140
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.830
Daniel De La Mora: Like, like, and I'm just glad I'm not at that point where I'm just not even realizing an issue.

141
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.750
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I know you know you have an issue. I mean, we wouldn't be talking

142
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.560
You know,

143
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:21.720
Daniel De La Mora: You wouldn't be a bright heart even had an issue. Yeah. And sometimes it's having an issue that's the issue. Like people are like, I don't want to have an issue.

144
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.490
Shawn Phalen: Like, I don't want to

145
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:42.810
Shawn Phalen: Do like I don't want to say that I have an issue with anything, alcohol, drugs, whatever, you know, people want to think that they're just now recreational users. And so it's like actually saying, you know, to people and saying it out loud, like, um, yeah.

146
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.520
I can take that stuff. I get addicted to that stuff.

147
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.440
Shawn Phalen: So what I want you to start to do then is

148
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:17.190
I want you to start to be really aware of your thoughts and this is this can be a daily routine like kind of a thing that you do, you know, like, just check in with yourself.

149
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:31.140
And I'm not saying all day every day. But, you know, checking account like my have okay. Am I happy. Yeah, I'm happy. How am I feeling physically, that kind of stuff. Like my angry.

150
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:43.800
And then start identifying why like if you're not happy. Why are you not happy if you're happy. Why are you happy, you know, like, I want you to start labeling your feelings. Now, and your thoughts.

151
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:54.570
Daniel De La Mora: I can do that because this, I can do that. This is a way to kind of break this down, because otherwise, like we want to get you off this hamster wheel.

152
00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:08.220
Daniel De La Mora: We want to get you off this every two to three week thing where you use for a day or two and then you get back on Suboxone and then you start the whole thing all over again. Yeah, no.

153
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.080
No, that's that's exhausting.

154
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:27.270
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, like just stand up and just hate went through it sucks. It is what it is, though, right. I've been sick, not being asleep, not being able to eat.

155
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.560
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, I mean, sometimes, but

156
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.940
Daniel De La Mora: What actually what actually happened was,

157
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:48.300
Daniel De La Mora: Because what I noticed before was the person that I was getting things off of last year, they were actually giving me. I'm pretty sure they're depressed fake pills, because

158
00:21:49.470 --> 00:22:10.500
Daniel De La Mora: I had gotten off those. But what happened what I started to realize like this last time. I've been going through this this last time hasn't really been is like intense of a like of a withdrawal, because I think like all the this time, like I was actually taking, you know, real pills, I guess.

159
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.910
Daniel De La Mora: As far as before, when I get the feeling like it was way stronger.

160
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:33.360
Daniel De La Mora: So I'm just like, that's just one thing I can say like, I'm just glad about that at least because when it is a stronger substance like it sucks, way more like it sucks, way more when you're going through it with the stronger substance, cuz

161
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.250
Daniel De La Mora: I don't know.

162
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.600
Shawn Phalen: That's also something that needs to be really aware that

163
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.080
Daniel De La Mora: ARE CUTTING OUT WITH FENTANYL

164
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.860
That's going on in LA, but it's big here and there's fentanyl pills.

165
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.720
And

166
00:22:52.980 --> 00:23:00.390
Daniel De La Mora: You got it. I want and I want to be really honest and serious with you about this. There are people that are dying left and right here.

167
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:13.650
Daniel De La Mora: They think that they are being sold something they are not. And it's fentanyl and that shit is hitting the streets hard in every major city.

168
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:24.510
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, I can't imagine that it is not in our know it definitely isn't LA. It definitely is another

169
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:35.610
Daniel De La Mora: That's why I have like I really realized that I started to realize like, Man, these, these aren't the same as like what are used to be getting and they're the same, you know, pills.

170
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.130
Daniel De La Mora: Or I thought

171
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.870
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, and that's when I started to really like get setting to that thoughts that where you're like, dude, you could have

172
00:23:46.920 --> 00:24:01.170
Daniel De La Mora: I could have just been one of those cases, who went too far with it on those. And I'm just glad that that's not the case right now because yeah that's like that's that was a scary situation. I just is a scary situation to deal with that.

173
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:10.710
Daniel De La Mora: Like so. I want you to be aware that, you know, I'm not, you know, I'm not. I mean I guess I am kind of saying it to scare you.

174
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.920
Daniel De La Mora: Know i know i'm glad like it has to be sad, you know,

175
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.420
There's just so much crap out there now.

176
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:31.500
Daniel De La Mora: As people wanting to make a buck. Honestly, they don't care about, you know, I'm going to make back and hope you know dies that you come back and buy more.

177
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.720
Daniel De La Mora: True hard, cold reality of it.

178
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:51.120
Drug dealers don't care dealers know that there's always gonna be somebody else can take place.

179
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:05.370
Daniel De La Mora: Yes. You like because like when you get to the realization like you see even like you telling me that brings back memories me like

180
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:14.850
Daniel De La Mora: Not necessarily trying to be friends with people who I was getting shut off but like when you go see someone consistently.

181
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.750
Daniel De La Mora: You develop that like you know familiarity and then you start to like

182
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.740
Daniel De La Mora: You don't think your homies or anything, but then you think, like, you're more than just like Oh, I'm just, it's more than just me hitting this dude up like

183
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:39.390
Daniel De La Mora: And it's because sometimes like I've had a couple situations where like people get shut off like the one like actually like like they'll just want to like hang out for a bit, or something or like you just start talking. And then you just start getting to know them a bit

184
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:49.350
Daniel De La Mora: And then it's like, that's where it really gets messed up where it's like that. You got to realize what you like what you just told me like I had to realize that the hard way. Like, people don't care about you.

185
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:55.140
Daniel De La Mora: Like they're just want. They're just talking you up and wants you to keep coming back. That's all it is.

186
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.700
Okay.

187
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.260
Daniel De La Mora: And it just sucks.

188
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.390
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah.

189
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:04.920
Yeah.

190
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.960
So food for thought.

191
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:18.570
And then I want you, like I said I wanted to just start to kind of focus on what I want you to really focus on your thoughts. Okay.

192
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:25.290
Daniel De La Mora: Like when you do that you feel like you want to use. And you have to like like hit the brakes.

193
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.960
Daniel De La Mora: I can do that. Right. It's like

194
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.580
Shawn Phalen: And like you said, you know, it's kind of like putting the work in, you just gotta go.

195
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.090
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah.

196
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.570
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, cuz I'm getting like

197
00:26:44.310 --> 00:27:00.150
Daniel De La Mora: Like I've been in Brighton hard since June. And I was like, doing good, and everything, but it's like what I like it. Just need to step is like it's a process like the Suboxone is a process like you're not just going to get on it and then get off like

198
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:09.840
Daniel De La Mora: At all, like it's gonna be like, you're going to be on it for a minute, and then you're going to start to naturally like, you know, we ended down

199
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:28.980
And it's a process because and it should be because you have to start changing your, your life, you have to start changing and, you know, changing the way you think and all these things that we talked about that stuff doesn't happen overnight.

200
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:46.860
So it's a good thing that it's a process. And if you can just kind of let go of it and just let it be. And just ride through this whole thing and focus on just staying clean and working on yourself.

201
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:54.240
Like don't don't get don't sweat the fact that you're on Suboxone and that you've been on it since June.

202
00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:10.890
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, see, I don't even want to sweat that like I kind of am now you don't like that's that's not that isn't where you want to put your picture your focus because I know last time we spoke you'd asked me about, like, you know, should I start to

203
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:27.600
Daniel De La Mora: To try and get off of it. And I said, no, because you still have it. You how to relapse. Yeah. And I don't like look at it as it's just it's helping you right now. You need that that that safety net.

204
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:47.040
Daniel De La Mora: It's a safety net, you still need to develop some skills here some relapse prevention skills and just some healthy coping skills around relaxing. Yeah, and that takes time. Okay, this is not a race.

205
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:59.910
Daniel De La Mora: Like this is to get that's true and and this to get you to a place where you feel really confident in your sobriety and once you feel confident like that and you can start you know

206
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:14.400
Daniel De La Mora: Tie trading down and talk to the doctor about it but now's not the time to speak. Right. Yeah. Just be grateful that you're here in this program and that you're going to put in the work.

207
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:16.980
Daniel De La Mora: Yeah.

208
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:24.270
Daniel De La Mora: No, I'm very grateful for the fact that I'm in this program because I guess just the thing that really keeps me like

209
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:34.500
Daniel De La Mora: It keeps feeling that like just the track of, like, you still gotta deal with this, like, so I feel like if I didn't really do anything about it and I wasn't in this program.

210
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:45.930
Daniel De La Mora: I would just probably keep using I'm not gonna lie, because I wouldn't want to feel sick. Right. And that's what happened like with opiates and that's why Opiates are so

211
00:29:46.950 --> 00:30:01.080
Are so addicting addicting. Because, you know, nobody wants to feel sick like that detox off of them is just absolute sheer utter hell and that's why so many people can't get clean or they get clean and I can't stay clean

212
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.230
It's a powerful drama.

213
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.230
Daniel De La Mora: You know, it keeps calling ya.

214
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:08.910
Know,

215
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.270
It takes it takes

216
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:20.220
Changing changing like everything like your friends, where you hang out.

217
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.910
Like what you do.

218
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:39.180
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's like incorporating really healthy like eating healthy drinking water working out staying away from toxic people you know staying away from people for just a big drag

219
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:55.860
Daniel De La Mora: Filled up staying close to your family staying close to friends that that are a positive influence know all this all this

220
00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.460
Pain away from people that use

221
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.180
Deleting from number of people.

222
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:10.410
Daniel De La Mora: All at any moment. That's another big one is deleting that stuff.

223
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:30.120
Daniel De La Mora: You know, have it. See like that. The like even you saying that that's actually helped because like I said, the personnel is like see like relapse hasn't really been like, oh, my mind is much that's why I'm glad. Like, I mean, even though I did.

224
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.370
Daniel De La Mora: Like the other week.

225
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.840
Daniel De La Mora: It's not is like a constant.

226
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:45.720
Daniel De La Mora: Like, it's not as constant of a thought because the person I used to get stuff from actually like I think something happened and then we're like,

227
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:56.400
Daniel De La Mora: Either they're under investigation or something or where I can't even communicate with them anymore. Like, they're not responding to me they're telling me they can't talk like

228
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.900
Daniel De La Mora: And when that happened, in a way, was a relief because

229
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.810
Daniel De La Mora: Like i knew that i mean if if I realized like sooner that

230
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:19.170
Daniel De La Mora: They were stronger substances that I was being given them what you should be denied already like tried to back off that. But the fact that this person was telling me, like, Don't hit me up or like

231
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:34.050
Daniel De La Mora: Something was happening to them like made me stop talking to them and that made me actually deal with like going through that tougher period of time like this past time wasn't as tough at all like as far as what I felt before.

232
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:50.010
Daniel De La Mora: Like, like, so that's what I'm actually really like I'm glad that I didn't like getting involved with any like crazy press stuff, but even taking anything itself is bad, but I'm just glad that I wasn't doing anything like fake

233
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:58.620
Daniel De La Mora: Because the person before me was acting like they're you know i friend everything and they're giving me fake substances like they don't care about you.

234
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.480
Daniel De La Mora: At all.

235
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:10.380
Daniel De La Mora: So let's, um, can we set another time. Yeah.

236
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:11.850

237
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.510

Daniel De La Mora: Yeah, I'm done.

239
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.590
Daniel De La Mora: I should be good.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.810

Danny Couser: Okay, there you go.

259
00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:06.360
Danny Couser: Oh, just, I don't know. So this is just sums up about how spiteful this woman I've encountered in my life is

260
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.300
Danny Couser: A year ago directly

261
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:17.070
Danny Couser: Today was the day I met her, and she decided to finally drop off all my shit at my mom's house.

262
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.040
Danny Couser: If you can see

263
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:31.650
Danny Couser: Yeah, so that, yeah, that's my crap and inside the car there. It's like she just left it sitting on the front of my hood of my car and everything. Well, I came home from work and all this. My shits.

264
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.760
Danny Couser: spilling over so another it's some tweaks around your property went through and just took whatever the hell they want it as they please.

265
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:50.700
Danny Couser: And I was blowing her up non stop because she told me to come get it over the weekend and I was ready to go out. I was getting close to your house to texter to have a brother in law, meet me to get it.

266
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:57.660
Danny Couser: And she just stopped answering and all together and of course called me as soon as I got back into town. My mother's house.

267
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:08.190
Danny Couser: And just like I just wow, like what the hell, like, you know, it's like it's been a month of phone tag and

268
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:18.720
Danny Couser: For whatever reason, and be able to get my stuff for my reasons or her reasons and she can literally like weights to the day to give it her full effort for me to get my shit like

269
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:26.640
Danny Couser: You mean like a year to the day when we met. Like, I mean that's not just by coincidence that I know how she works in it's just

270
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:32.790
Danny Couser: You know, one last book you like stuck on that pretty much

271
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:50.850
Shawn Phalen: And this might sound really weird. No, no, I'm going to put it out there. What if you looked at this and what if he put this on the top of your gratitude list that it didn't work out.

272
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.530
Danny Couser: Yeah.

273
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.000
Shawn Phalen: That might sound just so crazy and outrageous here right now.

274
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:01.680
Danny Couser: Good.

275
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:07.590
Shawn Phalen: I want to put that out to you that she probably did you the biggest favor of your life.

276
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.570
It might sound.

277
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.980
Danny Couser: Right, but

278
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.140
You know,

279
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:27.600
Shawn Phalen: It is what it is right now you got your stuff back. You should be grateful that you guys stuff.

280
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:40.500
Danny Couser: Yeah, I was looking for to cut my hair and shavings. And usually, nice and clean cut and whatnot. But I really haven't even touched my hair nothing for the past month and a half or so and shaved like once since I've been

281
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:50.490
Danny Couser: Away from her house, which is pretty just gross as hell to me. But yeah, that was one of the, you know, I don't know how many things, whatever random tweeter

282
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:59.280
Danny Couser: Gotten walked away with before I got to my stuff when I got home from work. So that's what I'm really just irritated a shit about it. I mean, because

283
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.880
Danny Couser: It's just like, why would you know I mean because I asked my neighbors like if they don't speak English. I will. So I'm kind of like

284
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:14.550
Danny Couser: Trying to get it translate. Like how long like was this stuff here like this. You know, like, did you see like a girl blonde hair that you know

285
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:23.760
Danny Couser: Or maybe one hour, maybe, you know, so it's like another she made sure to get here. Right, right. Be like, you know, before I got here from work, you know, and

286
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:33.360
Danny Couser: It's just like she knew the last one time whenever many makeup breakage shit I came here to my mom's house brought my stuff, blah, blah, blah.

287
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:44.550
Danny Couser: And I left some of my stuff here at my mom's my mom's boyfriend took some of my stuff out to make room for some other crap in the car and he forgot a duffel bag of mine out here like outside. But then the carport area.

288
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:54.120
Danny Couser: And once again, some random tweeters just went through took my cologne and all kinds of random stupid little shit. But, you know, stupid shit. I'd rather not replace you know

289
00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:07.650
Danny Couser: And she knew that and she knows it's not like a good spot to just be any kind of bag of anything. You know, like yet straight people go tweak your treasure hunting anytime any day around here and

290
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:18.570
Danny Couser: You know, and she's like, I don't. And not to mention. She didn't even give me all my shit, that's what pisses me off more than any time like after all that, and you didn't even give me all of my things like really

291
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:27.630
Danny Couser: You know, it's like she's got my expensive bike at her house. Still, which is another thing I was kind of hoping to get because I don't

292
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:36.030
Danny Couser: Need a bike, I finally got a car and I was going to just get rid of it sell it, make some extra cash towards getting a room to rent or whatever, you know, and

293
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.090
Danny Couser: It's just a it's, I mean the other shit I could care less about, but I'm not

294
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:52.950
Danny Couser: I don't know. I'm about this close to just saying shirt bucket. When you write the bike have to, but at the same time, I don't know if it's just an ego deal but like it's just kind of like

295
00:39:53.850 --> 00:40:03.420
Danny Couser: Lucky that you know you're not kind of fuck me over in every way, shape, or form that you just feel as you please, you know, to mean like Danny, let's

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.170
De escalate a little bit because what can happen. The more you talk about it, the more

300
00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:33.330
Danny Couser: I feel like my heart's like a fucking rabbit right now. Like it's
