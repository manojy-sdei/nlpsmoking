00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:48.540
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, we had about four inches seven days ago, but it's all melted off now and we've had about three inches of rain since then.

25
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:59.520
Bethany Oxyer: And I live in an era we live on the river and the creeks and things will back up and flash flood, but now the

26
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.380
Bethany Oxyer: Rivers lemon up to. So everything's

27
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:09.150
Magalie Marcellus: On all around us. That's not good. Now I you did you find a new place that are using the word with the friend.

28
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.320
Bethany Oxyer: Is no friend, but we've pretty much about not everything moved over and and probably 75% on

Bethany Oxyer: I'm doing pretty well.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:44.400
Bethany Oxyer: Still trying to battle the diabetes and stuff and get it under control, but he's down into two hundreds. Now, which is a lot better than the 400

34
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.700
Magalie Marcellus: You know, we're making progress.

35
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:48.900

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.960
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, yeah. He said they're trying on that new tree, J. O that they bought out

38
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.580
Magalie Marcellus: So the jobs. So tell me about the job.

39
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:20.940
Bethany Oxyer: And everything cleared through and they I planned on starting the second or the third for training, but they moved it back until

40
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:30.600
Bethany Oxyer: The end of March or beginning of April. So then kind of put on hold. But I guess it's nothing to do with me. It's just their scheduling, they move everything back

41
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.280
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

42
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.150
Magalie Marcellus: So you haven't done that, if they had enough.

43
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:49.860
Bethany Oxyer: No, no. But everything's cleared Bruce, it all looks good. It's just a matter of getting started and they're hiring another round of people. And once they get that group through then they're supposed to start the training.

44
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.230
Magalie Marcellus: I'll take that on.

45
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.590
Magalie Marcellus: Sunday. I want you to bend down with yourself.

46
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:09.030
Bethany Oxyer: Just cleaning houses babysitting making little extra money doing that kind of like I was before. It's for the same gentleman that we were working forward before just not

47
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.090
Bethany Oxyer: As much with the weather and stuff, the way it's been we haven't had a lot of work.

48
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.290
Magalie Marcellus: Transportation

49
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.340
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, they, they take us anywhere. Pretty much. We need to go.

50
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.490
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, so because you have access

51
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.860
Magalie Marcellus: To transportation

52
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.760
Magalie Marcellus: How's your daughter doing what

53
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:44.730
Bethany Oxyer: She's doing great. I don't know if I told you last time or not. I know I told him in group that I found out she found out she's pregnant so

54
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.500
Have another grandbaby

55
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.290
Magalie Marcellus: She doin overall with the pregnancy.

56
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:04.680
Bethany Oxyer: So far, so good. Last time she had kind of a rough pregnancy, she about six, seven months, and she started having a lot of

57
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.850
Magalie Marcellus: Problems and

58
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:18.030
Bethany Oxyer: Just passing out when she would stand up, things like that. And they found out they said that her heart wasn't pumping enough blood for her and the baby and it was causing some problems, but

59
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:29.400
Bethany Oxyer: They've got her on some different medications and she's being checked for how they can't find out they said something to do with like the electrical rhythm. It's something more neurologic than actually with the muscle itself, its, its

60
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.870
Magalie Marcellus: Heart Rhythm itself as messed up. So you're treating her for that too.

61
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.450
Magalie Marcellus: If she's still working.

62
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.250
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, still work in said she was going to work up until the doctor took her off.

63
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.570
Okay.

64
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.270
Magalie Marcellus: You know she's still active. So that's a good sign.

65
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.470
Magalie Marcellus: And how's your grandson.

92
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:20.280
Bethany Oxyer: Know we know nothing to do with that. We just have to go about 10 more miles out of the way to get around to get into the

Bethany Oxyer: They're calling for some more rain again tomorrow, which is unbelievable. I mean, this is

99
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.750

103
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:10.860
Bethany Oxyer: So I'm sure there are people and I know they've had a lot of water rescues signed to drive through the flash floods and get stranded. I've seen that on the news, where there's been about that too. So

104
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.650
Magalie Marcellus: Wow. So what city are you in LA.

105
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:28.950

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.280

Bethany Oxyer: Know it's pretty much where we're used to a lot of the flash floods, it's just

113
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:08.310
Bethany Oxyer: Usually doesn't go on this long, but when it does now the rivers want to start. So even the main roads like or state routes are going to be starting from underwater now.

114
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.280

Bethany Oxyer: Shops and everything they have to sandbag the shops and the parking lot and move all the like the core lots out used car lot all those after like you ate it. It gets pretty bad when the river gets up.

Magalie Marcellus: So,

134
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.890
Bethany Oxyer: I'm growing up here. It doesn't seem like it's

135
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:41.730
Bethany Oxyer: Used to it. But once you live in town and get used to not traveling like that. It doesn't take a lot longer.

136
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:50.190
Magalie Marcellus: Right. Because you guys have. Is it like a major roads or are you just have smaller boat. That's true.

137
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.900
Magalie Marcellus: So get around the roads because it's

138
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.520
Bethany Oxyer: A small community.

139
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.020
Magalie Marcellus: In the country where it's grabbing

140
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.270
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, yeah.

141
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.950
Magalie Marcellus: It is, yeah. Just

142
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.000

143
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.680
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

144
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:20.430
Magalie Marcellus: So, um, so what you've been doing to keep yourself occupied and to stay on top of your recovery.

145
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:32.340
Bethany Oxyer: Just working and I found I started writing letters I enjoy writing letters. Now I found like

146
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:40.770
Bethany Oxyer: I don't know if I can't express something, you know, face to face, and talking. I've got to where I wrote letters to my son and my daughter.

147
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:52.890
Bethany Oxyer: Not that maybe even they would get them but you know I figure if I put it in words. And I want to give it to them a couple days down the road, then I can I have it. You know, it's kind of, I guess, a form of journaling, but just

148
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.830
Magalie Marcellus: A little different, I'll call it hell.

149
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.340
Out of you.

150
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.740
Magalie Marcellus: So you have to express our emotions.

151
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:13.200
Bethany Oxyer: Right.

152
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.540
Bethany Oxyer: something's bothering me. And that's where now I just sit down and kind of write it all out.

153
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.640
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh. Can you hear me. Yes, I can you hear me.

154
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.210
Bethany Oxyer: Okay. Yeah. Yes.

155
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.800
Magalie Marcellus: Yep, yep.

156
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.590
Magalie Marcellus: So as the journaling.

157
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.820
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, it just

158
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.370
Bethany Oxyer: Seems like it's stress.

159
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.050
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

160
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.280
Yeah.

161
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.740
Magalie Marcellus: So have you provided any of those letters to your children at all.

162
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:59.340
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, I gave one to my son and my daughter. I've got here just to kind of express

163
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.650
Uh huh.

164
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.700
Magalie Marcellus: Hello.

165
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.960
Magalie Marcellus: Hello.

166
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:54.720
Bethany Oxyer: Hello.

167
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.730
Magalie Marcellus: It.

168
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.160
Bethany Oxyer: Was like, that's when it fades out but then it comes right back when the wind.

169
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.030
Magalie Marcellus: Is Wendy in your area.

170
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.970
Yeah yeah

171
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:21.390
Magalie Marcellus: You know those those signals they have, they, they decided when they want to work on it. Unfortunately,

172
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:34.440
Magalie Marcellus: See, so any slip up any triggers. Anything that bothered us since the last time we I met with you that could have jeopardize your recovery.

173
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:47.220
Bethany Oxyer: No, I just my, my main thing is I just I know if I go backwards. How much worse, it can be. And that's what I

174
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.820
Bethany Oxyer: Keep telling them in group when they say you know what keeps you on top of things that I mean

175
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.050
Bethany Oxyer: Other than you.

176
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:09.150
Bethany Oxyer: can't really say that can be worse. The boys or anything that that it is right now. It could be so much works in

177
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:20.100
Bethany Oxyer: Your backwards. And I just, there's, there's no desire. None whatsoever. None whatsoever. I'm just bound and determined that there's no going backwards.

178
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.690
Okay.

179
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:23.880
Magalie Marcellus: And

180
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.510
Magalie Marcellus: So if you had to face any situation that may jeopardize. So what would you to

181
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:44.820
Bethany Oxyer: Just get away from the situation. I mean, I try not to put myself in in any situation that that would cause

182
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.730
Bethany Oxyer: You know, I don't go around the

183
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.010
Bethany Oxyer: Pretty much that that

184
00:22:51.210 --> 00:23:03.810
Bethany Oxyer: influenced me and you know in to do and things that I should know. You know, I don't go around those kind of evil. I am when I start getting stressed out. That's when I get on top of it before it gets too much.

185
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:14.070
Bethany Oxyer: But you know, I, I just, I never really for recreation. Anyway, or for fun. It was just kind of something that happened and I didn't mean for it to

186
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:33.600
Bethany Oxyer: You know, I was on a lot of the doctor had me on a lot of pain medic. I lost my insurance and it was offered to me one day when I was just so sick. And that's just how it happened. And I just was never, I've never even drank. I never smoked. I never did any of that stuff before.

187
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:47.370
Bethany Oxyer: So something that I did recommend for fun or for party in or, you know, so I guess maybe it's a little easier for me to stay away from it than it is for some people just for that reason.

188
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.530
Magalie Marcellus: Because it wasn't a lifestyle for me.

189
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:52.470
Magalie Marcellus: So even

190
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.850
Magalie Marcellus: At the time when you were seeking. So keep your arm.

191
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:11.640
Magalie Marcellus: We put up pain so we'll leave your pain. Were you in any environment where that could you know trigger you to go back for, you know, to get whatever feeling that you are seeking at a time.

192
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:26.220
Magalie Marcellus: Because sometimes, some places that you know you may be driving or happened to be in certain areas and that may trigger some memories and that can also lead to, you know, you're having cravings, so

193
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.460
Magalie Marcellus: Reaching out for certain satisfaction because what you used to have with the drug.

194
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.570
Magalie Marcellus: So you don't that doesn't apply to what I'm hearing

195
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:43.980
Magalie Marcellus: Hi.

196
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.370
Magalie Marcellus: Yes, so thank you.

197
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.130
Magalie Marcellus: Does that happen a lot in your group session to

198
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:10.170
Bethany Oxyer: That yeah you know as far as that lifestyle. I was I was never ever in that lifestyle. I never understood addiction. I never understood why people just couldn't

199
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.460
Magalie Marcellus: lock yourself in a room.

200
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.050
Bethany Oxyer: And get over it.

201
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.550
Bethany Oxyer: Like it and I learned, real quick, not to judge people but

202
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:17.880
I

203
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:33.030
Bethany Oxyer: You know, I, to this day, I just, I don't, I don't have anything to do with that I used to live around neighbors that were into it and they're the ones that kind of got me into it. I don't live around them anymore. So that's not a trigger. It's not even

204
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.620
Magalie Marcellus: Anything that's too.

205
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.270
Magalie Marcellus: So I just

206
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.220
Bethany Oxyer: Have no desire to go out looking for it.

207
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:46.830
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so you're not around the environment, the people you know those circumstances that us to lead to us.

208
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.570
Bethany Oxyer: Right.

209
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.550
Okay, yeah.

210
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.910
Magalie Marcellus: I know that last time we talked

211
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:54.840
Magalie Marcellus: You were in

212
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.890
Bethany Oxyer: Class, people think they're helping you by introducing you but they're not

213
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:08.280
Magalie Marcellus: Right, right, cuz I guess they felt that that was gonna well sometimes people look for other people to be

214
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:21.690
Magalie Marcellus: To participate in certain activities with them, even though it could be negative. So any fee if it's something that you are seeking there'll be like the perfect opportunity for you to go along, whatever door. Yeah.

215
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.590
Bethany Oxyer: Now if I, they said that if I go out with my husband with my daughter, my grandson.

216
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.850
Magalie Marcellus: And things that

217
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.940
Bethany Oxyer: Make me realize that there's there's more to life.

218
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.670
Magalie Marcellus: What's important to you right now.

219
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:47.160
Magalie Marcellus: Right. I know. Last time we talked, we talked about the eventually for you to go back to your doctor. Have you made any contact here though. Where are you with that.

220
00:27:49.110 --> 00:28:02.940
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah yeah I'm going back to the doctor and they're getting me on some antidepressants. They've tried me on some Wellbutrin which I was on it before and didn't have a whole lot of luck. But that's what they wanted to try. So, you know,

221
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.830
Bethany Oxyer: I'm not the doctor. So we'll try it and see what they what they think.

222
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.480
Magalie Marcellus: Is your primary doctor prescribing

223
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.930
Bethany Oxyer: Is that your primary that's

224
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.550
Bethany Oxyer: What was it I didn't, I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.

225
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:33.660
Magalie Marcellus: Though what the future is that from your primary doctor, which is prescribing them. Yes.

226
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.030
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, the primary

227
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.650
Magalie Marcellus: And they put me

228
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.630
Bethany Oxyer: Yep, they put me back on this Synthroid and I think I am feeling a little bit better from that.

229
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.270
Bethany Oxyer: And see if the house I just seem like I'm sleeping a little

230
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.740
Bethany Oxyer: Better my energy levels are starting to come back up. They said it takes some time.

231
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.510

232
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.090

Bethany Oxyer: The Synthroid for my thyroid

236
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.970
Magalie Marcellus: The thyroid. OK. OK.

237
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:14.880
Magalie Marcellus: I know you needed to follow up on that. Okay, good. And do you have anything else scheduled or any follow up schedule.

238
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:17.670
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah.

Bethany Oxyer: Explain that to them explain the reason was honest and you know I was afraid they wouldn't treat me but you know they said no, that was fine. At least I'm getting help.

244
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.270
Magalie Marcellus: You know, they couldn't do a

245
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.590
Bethany Oxyer: narcotic. Of course, which

246
00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:05.460
Bethany Oxyer: Is fine. I don't need anything. But as long as I can get. You know, I think the depression. The thyroid and blood pressure, that kind of thing under control.

247
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.380
Bethany Oxyer: I think I'll feel better. I think it'll

248
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:18.300
Magalie Marcellus: Definitely, and pretty soon. When do you plan to move when what was the time frame that you guys are looking out for your place.

249
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.360
Bethany Oxyer: Well with a whether it's kind of put us behind moving the rest of our stuff that

250
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.030
Bethany Oxyer: Next couple weeks to be totally

251
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:28.710

Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, he's got

254
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.510
Bethany Oxyer: The same guy.

255
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.520
Bethany Oxyer: Is it back at work, working with the same guy doing some remodeling. Yeah.

256
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.600
Bethany Oxyer: Just remind you

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.490
Bethany Oxyer: That back in the truck or anything. Yeah.

258
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.770
Magalie Marcellus: Right. But he's doing something because I know before I couldn't do much activity so

259
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:51.510
Magalie Marcellus: Oh,

260
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.850
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, he's not working like

Bethany Oxyer: 10 or 12 hours a day.

262
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.610
Bethany Oxyer: Seven hours a day, pretty much. It kind of wears you down.

263
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:08.130
Magalie Marcellus: Six and seven. Yeah, that's like a full day of work answer is, you know, if you're doing physical work. So that's it.

264
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.990
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, have a toll on the body.

265
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.520
Magalie Marcellus: You say he's following is

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:19.380
Magalie Marcellus: The treatment for the diabetes. It sounds like his children a lot better than the way was

267
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.090
Magalie Marcellus: That's good.

268
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.390
Bethany Oxyer: Oh no. And so what we've cut it in half so

274
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:56.040
Magalie Marcellus: By at least you know you you have a big give you an offer and everything cleared to just waiting for to get gone

275
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.450
Magalie Marcellus: And in the meantime, you still don't do the clean the house.

276
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.350
Magalie Marcellus: Do you go with somebody else or

277
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.830
Right.

278
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.290
Bethany Oxyer: Now,

Bethany Oxyer: Working for the same guy. Okay, he's got this guy. He's just hired us to to work for him doing some rental properties and things redoing them.

280
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:26.640
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh. Okay. All right. Well, that's good. That's like this is something to keep us occupied as well.

281
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:32.790
Magalie Marcellus: So hopefully the weather even better for you guys. Uh huh. Yeah.

282
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.200

Magalie Marcellus: Over with your daughter along because it sounds like you guys making good progress. So I things over.

285
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:54.570
And

286
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.480
Bethany Oxyer: Oh, I would say 90% better than what it was.

287
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:01.980
Magalie Marcellus: Several months ago.

288
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.140
Magalie Marcellus: I mean, I'm sure she

289
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:11.550
Bethany Oxyer: You know she knows what happened and and it was alone to where she just never expected it for me. But, you know,

290
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.120
Bethany Oxyer: She I think she trusts me and everything now wholeheartedly.

291
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:25.050
Bethany Oxyer: She knows that I'm bound and determined. There's no going back. And she knows why it happened. She knows I was out partying and running bars or doing anything crazy

292
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:36.090
Bethany Oxyer: I don't want to say it was my fault. I know it was my fault, but you know it was for different reasons than a lot of people I think end up you know trapped in the cycle.

293
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:37.560
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

294
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:51.720
Magalie Marcellus: Right. And I, you know, the fact that she's she knows that you're working on yourself and making sure that you stay on track and that's all that a family member can ask for and you gotta be honest with

295
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.320
Bethany Oxyer: Them and

296
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.550
Magalie Marcellus: Keep working on yourself.

297
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:04.920
Magalie Marcellus: Any other thing that you thought that we needed to address or that bothered you since the last time we met.

298
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.530
Bethany Oxyer: Nope, just if I can get this dorm whether to clear

299
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.160
Magalie Marcellus: And I want you to get flooded.

300
00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:21.540
Magalie Marcellus: Get connected with the rest of the state and all that water going on I'm

301
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.260
Bethany Oxyer: Missing the Florida weather in a way

302
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.900
Magalie Marcellus: Where you're in Florida at some point.

303
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:34.260
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah yeah we live there, about a year and a half ago we live there for a little over a year.

304
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.890
Magalie Marcellus: We really had more to do flat in

305
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.520
Bethany Oxyer: My husband had a job offer down there for a while.

306
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.380
Magalie Marcellus: He was driving for Amazon.

307
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:47.640
Magalie Marcellus: Oh,

308
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.570
Bethany Oxyer: We moved down there, he run down there for a little while. Okay.

309
00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:53.280
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, I'm sure you missed in that

310
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.310
Magalie Marcellus: That that CO and even though

311
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:57.810
Magalie Marcellus: But it's

312
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.850
Magalie Marcellus: It's manageable. So

313
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.640
Magalie Marcellus: Wow.

314
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.600
Magalie Marcellus: Hopefully, things get a lot better soon.

315
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.390
Magalie Marcellus: Are you guys with the weather and everything else.

316
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:12.930
Bethany Oxyer: You know, break

317
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.440
Magalie Marcellus: Yes, they can. We can only get better than the way it is right now.

318
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.010
Magalie Marcellus: And you doing Groupon and still once a week.

319
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.160
Bethany Oxyer: Yep. On Tuesdays.

320
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.650
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so you on once a week. So I guess I made sure

321
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.180
Bethany Oxyer: She said she said every two weeks, but I still sign on every week.

322
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:46.860
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, good for you. Okay. But, you know, you know, at least this Sala

323
00:35:48.030 --> 00:36:03.000
Magalie Marcellus: A support. So I know a lot of people still crying, even though they don't need the medication, but it's still, you know, just to keep up with them. Get that support and reinforcement with other peers that are going through the same thing, but that's good that you're able to do that.

324
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.510
Magalie Marcellus: I guess this is all for tonight I'm

325
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:22.140
Magalie Marcellus: Just gonna leave it open. If you want me to schedule you something you can let me know. Otherwise, we're probably gonna do like once a week, just to check in. Once a month.

326
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:36.870
Magalie Marcellus: Just to check in and see where you are and if there's anything prior to our next meeting. We can always, you can always reach out to me. Let me see. Do you want to schedule it now or do you want

327
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.310
Magalie Marcellus: So,

328
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:43.560
Bethany Oxyer: I'll tell you what, with work and everything coming up. Let me wait because I'm not sure.

329
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.880
Magalie Marcellus: They were saying in the morning I

330
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.550
Bethany Oxyer: Do, and I don't want to do something just to have right

331
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:48.570
Magalie Marcellus: Because we prefer you know

332
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:50.910
Bethany Oxyer: If I

333
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.800
Magalie Marcellus: Can agree with me.

334
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.470
Bethany Oxyer: Yeah, I'll just, if I can, within the next week, I should know something, and

335
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:09.450
Bethany Oxyer: I love to have your scheduling. You know, I can let them know what days I'm available and they can let you know. And you can forward me an email or however. Oh.

336
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:20.520
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, you know, that's that sounds good. So just wants to have a better idea of your schedule. You can email me and I can see how to fit you for my schedule. Okay.

337
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:22.830
Magalie Marcellus: But in the meantime.

338
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:33.240
Magalie Marcellus: If anything come up that you need to talk just reach out to myself or virtual clinic so they can schedule you info session. Okay. All right. Well,
