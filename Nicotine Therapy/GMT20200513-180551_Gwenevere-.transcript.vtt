00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We can hear each other now.

2
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, excellent. Cool. Alright, is need to open up a note here I got

3
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Um, any nasza recently.

4
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.520
Ramon: Yeah.

5
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How recent

6
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.850
Ramon: Nah I'm, um, four days ago.

7
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I was really hoping it was my big idea really thought she'd be great if you just had an allergic reaction to them a walk zone. But, guess not. I really wanted, I wanted it to be that simple for you, you know,

8
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.070
Yeah.

9
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.790
Ramon: I wish the doctors Kenya, find out what's wrong with me. Like I said they've done blood test, all kinds of stuff. Yeah.

10
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.330
Ramon: They don't be

11
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why I brought it up is because

12
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like this was happening with someone in that program. And I don't know if you notice the last time we met. I was kind of like asking about the knowledge asking, but I didn't say, Well, here's my idea.

13
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But I hadn't in the back of my mind. I was like, I wanted to see this other clients response because only a day in the past and I wanted to watch

14
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm not, I'm not a medical doctor right. I just want to. I'm witnessing from self report from clients. I wanted to see if it was going to work for this client if the symptoms of vomiting were going to disappear and they did.

15
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was so excited. I was like, well, maybe it's that simple for Ramon to and we looked up on the internet and you know the first side effect of Suboxone is nausea.

16
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: For side effect it's listed. So to me, I was like, I wonder if that's it. I wonder if that's it. But like you said, and the doc to. It's not every day.

17
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like

18
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's something else. And you think that it really has something to do with the. Is it the amount. Is that what the doctor say it's the amount of marijuana that you're smoking or

19
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.710
Ramon: Does certain type

20
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.740
Ramon: Oh, it's a certain type

21
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.030
Ramon: That makes me like that is what they said. So they advised me just to quit altogether.

22
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've actually been talking about this for quite a few months, what's, what's your plan with that.

23
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:43.170
Ramon: Or is there one well as of right now I don't buy any more cigarettes. I don't buy any more weed doesn't mean that I don't still get supplied

24
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.710
Ramon: By a more like I used to.

25
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That actually that's a big step.

26
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's not going to be quite as as as it as accessible.

27
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

28
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit of time that might happen where you're not as soon as you have the thought. It's not right here next to you, you have a little bit of even seconds or minutes to say, well, wait.

29
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.210
Ramon: I gotta wait till tomorrow.

30
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.750
Ramon: So coming out to

31
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.350
Ramon: Like what am I gotta wait till tomorrow because I can't go by in

32
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay wait till tomorrow. And do you do any delay when tomorrow comes. Do you wait even

33
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: 90 seconds.

34
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.660
Ramon: Oh, cuz if I wait and I miss out on my smoking session.

35
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.870
Ramon: Then I don't smoke. For the rest of the day. So is that one or none.

36
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever remember the nasza

37
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're only preoccupied with Oh boy, I'm going to smoke soon. Was there ever any in the middle of dude. Maybe I shouldn't. I'm going to feel sick. Does it isn't ever remembered once that next day is coming

38
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:08.250
Ramon: From like the last week is been like art. I'm not gonna smoke. I get in the car number like I'm not gonna smoke. I'm not gonna smart keep telling myself but then I end up smoking anyway.

39
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, it's not. It doesn't actually happen like that. Right. There's actually things going on your in your brain doesn't come out of the blue. There's a lot of actual they're habituated you're not thinking about them anymore consciously, but you have to

40
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Open something reach for something light something. Look at how many actions. It doesn't just happen. It's just that you're probably going a little like unaware of the habit.

41
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.590
Ramon: That makes sense.

42
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. We don't just do things.

43
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What know you were there. Okay, so let me go finish on talking. I can't do two things at once here. So today's five 513

44
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at your goals and see if we were doing fairly recently.

45
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.470
Ramon: 13th already when you text me. I said, look,

46
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's completely freaky.

47
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's insane weeks go by so fast.

48
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.500
Ramon: Yeah, that is crazy.

49
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.920
Ramon: Week.

50
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you meant by tomorrow.

51
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

52
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, and then I had to check myself. I'm like, yeah, tomorrow, but I realized I had put the data in there. So, so, yeah, that's that that that happen, um,

53
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So how is Pauline house for pregnancy. How's your pregnancy.

Ramon: Yeah, she's four months.

57
00:05:47.100 --> 00:06:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And any. Was she the type because sometimes people do this, they they wait. They wait. They wait. They wait until a certain number of months and then they tell people it was she wanted those moms that she's gonna wait wait wait, or she's telling everybody

58
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.250
Ramon: Oh yeah, we told everybody right away as

59
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.830
Ramon: You found out his word spread

60
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:25.860
Ramon: She's doing really good to on smoking, like she smoked any way now uh she she's still kind of addicted to cigarettes, but she's doing a lot better. She's almost she cut down a lot on the Suboxone

61
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.840
Ramon: She's doing really good

62
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And that helps you feel better.

63
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.880
Yeah.

64
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.170
Ramon: It kind of motivates me to stupid.

65
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And what kind of support. Does she have from from her family.

66
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.230
Ramon: Oh, they all they all love her.

67
00:06:52.950 --> 00:07:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So her family dynamic and years, there's no parallels. There's no similarities really different, different histories

68
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:10.860
Ramon: Not really are all our histories to save my family. Her family. I think maybe that's why me and her bonded. But, uh,

69
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:22.440
Ramon: They're i mean they're doing really good like her sisters were bad at one point, and most of her sisters are doing out of five sisters four of them are doing really good now.

70
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:36.540
Ramon: There's only one messing up and I mean she goes and hangs out with them now. Like before, I never used to wonder to go hang out with them. No. And now I don't mind because I know they're not doing a dope.

71
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So today is the day when we do look at some progress. So let's make a couple even one little statement for each of these goals. I want to work on my anger. What do you want to say about it today.

72
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.240
Ramon: Is in work on

73
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so where is it still showing up, not quite how you like it.

74
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.490
Ramon: Yeah, no, it's still not quite there. But I'm like I said I'm doing

75
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, doing better.

76
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll come back to that one a little later or less just put that down and then we change the target date here, June 16 to June 13 okay I want help with addiction to heroin.

77
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The

78
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.590
Ramon: Conquered

79
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Conquered

80
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to be mentally stronger. What do we want to say about that today.

81
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.160
Ramon: Doing better

82
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.410
Ramon: Doing a lot better.

83
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's keep going here.

84
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is about spirituality and I know you guys, you're not the one that comes up with it. It's part of this car for accreditation. The last time we touch base, um, let me see what I wrote.

85
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Most long time ago.

86
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because I'm looking at, I think, but I do because they've asked me to is because it isn't always part of the conversation with with everyone. Sometimes it's just not part of how people kind of think about the recovery process.

87
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You put on your bands. Not at all. Not at all. Right. How much does religion and spirituality support your recovery process or help your, your recovery process. Would you say more times than not you, Mark. Not at all.

88
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. And is that how it feels today.

89
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, think about spirituality having

90
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:06.510
Ramon: To do to you before the coronavirus hit me and my girlfriend and daughter started going to church every Sunday.

91
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:24.840
Ramon: Almost pretty much every Sunday, we've missed a couple maybe because I was sick. She wasn't feeling well or something. But for like two months we're going every Sunday. And then the coronavirus hated. We're just getting into the rhythm of going and we had to stop going like it was crazy.

92
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:37.620
Ramon: We started, we started going back during Halloween. So last October. We started going to church and then yeah, to coronavirus hit like two months ago and Eric can just stopped.

93
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.500
Ramon: What they really didn't

94
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.920
Ramon: Pay a big, big part. Like, I don't think, oh, I have to stop for god or gods this god I just

95
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.580
Ramon: I don't know, there's not really a big role in my

96
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.740
Ramon: Recovery.

97
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you like about going every Sunday with your daughter.

98
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:15.360
Ramon: Oh, it was a pattern. I mean, knows like routine because I like that she like going to Sunday school remind me of when I was kid used to go to church all the time, sing in the choir, all kinds of stuff. But, uh, I liked it. It was cool.

99
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you like the routine.

100
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:27.900
Ramon: Yeah.

101
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So could it be routine elsewhere, or is there anything specifically about it being at church that you like.

102
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.970
Ramon: I'm the

103
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Ramon: I guess the main part of us going to that church was just the same church. My girlfriend used to go to as a child.

104
00:11:53.130 --> 00:12:09.390
Ramon: So, it pretty much went like this one day I said, Baby, we should start going to church. I've been taking about my mom, yada, yada, yada. Let's go to church. She goes, well, let's go to my church that I used to go to my grandma all the time. So we went there and desktop. I went

105
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you share a little bit about what you what you mean by I've been thinking about my mom.

106
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.370
Ramon: Oh, that's how we used to go to church and stuff.

107
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you like about. Yeah.

108
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:35.400
Ramon: I'm really asked me like pretty much my whole life I've been with her. She always asked me to go to church, go to church and I never really did ever

109
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:37.740
So,

110
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.120
Ramon: So maybe we should start

111
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.290
Ramon: So can we go

112
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you know now as an adult why she wanted you to go

113
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.000
Yeah.

114
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.160
Ramon: Why do you think mentally led me to a different life as for sure.

115
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.040
Ramon: Okay, I was stuck with it as a child, I would have came out different

116
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:19.080
Ramon: But I was very messed up and ahead by time. She got me to me when I was like 11 and I've been all kinds of traumatized by that age, and I was messed up in the head really bad. So I church was the last thing.

117
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.780
Ramon: On my mind. You know what I mean.

118
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know.

119
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I do

120
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't hear much about those pieces about how

121
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You were traumatized. I don't get to hear much of those are you open to sharing maybe one with me today.

122
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.340
Ramon: I got taken away from my mom when I was five.

123
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And you remember that.

124
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:58.170
Ramon: You kind of remember clearly like I remember two, three days leading up to it, and Mary like I remember that's a day that I'll never forget. And I was only five at that time.

125
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember the days leading up to it.

126
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.240
Yeah.

127
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Adrian about that, too, is it still in that kind of still

128
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.910
Ramon: I don't really dream about

129
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:22.410
Ramon: Them situations anymore. I used to a lot, but most of that I've been able to bury it.

130
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.940
Ramon: Literally

131
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, when they say that, then the next thing they'll say is, but then I have these re experiences, if it really is where it's in the past.

132
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We would know because we would do some inquiry around, for example.

133
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about that. You just did what she just thought of when you were five. What was the emotion you felt when that was going on.

134
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.470
Ramon: I don't know, something that I don't want to feel

135
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.920
Ramon: That I don't like talking about or anything.

136
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:20.070
Ramon: That's really been in me for about 30 years 25 years, actually. And it's just there.

137
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And yet we're not talking about the emotion, I think, I think you're talking about the memory.

138
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.330
Ramon: All of it just all of it.

139
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's here's where you and I. If you can hang on for without us getting into a dispute around words. This is where you and I might not see eye to eye. This is where psychological theory comes in.

140
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you said it's buried

141
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.240
Yeah.

142
00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I said, Well, I'm wondering if it's processed and you say well you know it's not in my dreams and true.

143
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I wanted to check in on it and see if that's really true. And I wanted to know. And I say, well, what's the emotion and you know I want to feel it. I want to tell you

144
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So as a therapist, we noticed that. And that's a little marker in our heads for Hmm is it really is it really been processed or are the emotions attached to age five being relived anytime. Anything that even looks like. And I'm not saying conscious. This is unconscious stuff.

145
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If it resembles

146
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Love being taken away.

147
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that same feeling being relived is the intensity of it be

148
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:57.600
Ramon: Oh,

149
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.250
Ramon: My girlfriend's nephew is five years old. Okay.

150
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:14.640
Ramon: It is a his dad beat his baby sister. She's like four or five months he punched in the face broke her nose fractured her cheekbones broker jaw everything right.

151
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:30.120
Ramon: We had him. The night before, when he did all that well. I went to the house to go ask, Hey, can I keep him another night and there was cops everywhere. We found out, he'd be the baby. So I told my girlfriend right away, like I didn't

152
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.780
Ramon: It reminded me of me at that age, you know, being a little boy and everything. And I'm taking me away.

153
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:45.960
Ramon: But that was social workers that took me away. I told my girlfriend center is anti if the mom can get them back, see if we could take them out. I'll help take care of

154
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:52.590
Ramon: But the emotions when they're the only Tony emotions come is when I talk about what happened to me.

155
00:17:53.490 --> 00:18:04.560
Ramon: How Ansel that's when the emotions start rising when I start getting there. And I started, but when I see things all that puts in the past. I don't get said, I just like, Oh, well that's happened to me. Let me go.

156
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.400
Ramon: And that's, that's how I deal with that.

157
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

158
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me say that back.

159
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can see similar and find you. I can see events that kind of resemble it but I those feelings which you haven't named yet.

160
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not activated. I'm not reliving it as if I was five. Again, I can see it from a deck and say logically. Oh.

161
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, let's be helpful. I can be in problem solving mode, right. I'm not completely emotionally hijacked by that memory of my past. I can use logic and reason and problem solve and I'm using all my brain.

162
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not in my feelings I caught that phrase. Recently I was like, Oh, I'm gonna use it. I like that.

163
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.710
Ramon: Yeah.

164
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: In my feelings. Um, but, and that might be why you cut me off with the thing is, if you were to tell me the story, which I'm not asking done with that.

165
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean you feel the feelings associated with those memories. Is that right,

166
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:27.810
Ramon: Oh, I know I will. Like I know because I know how I am anything I've ever held inside of me if I started talking about it. I started breaking down get crazy like

167
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:39.990
Ramon: That and I hate doing that. I don't like breaking down crying and talking about shit that's in the past already. It's in the past. Oh, well I can't change it, but I could do better in the press.

168
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.000
Ramon: And that's just how I've been since they took me away so

169
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.020
Again,

170
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This next part is usually where you and I start to get a little friction

171
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can do it a little differently this time.

172
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay that I see.

173
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That maybe what you're doing, where you cut yourself off all these years in order to survive in order to be tough and survive really difficult like prison and whatever else, right, in order to survive that life that you have had to completely compartmentalize that history, lock it up.

174
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, is it okay that I might view that it might be a doing you a disservice. The Hundred percent lock up. Is it okay that I see it, psychologically, it may have a negative impact on you, that you may not be aware of is it okay that I see it that way.

175
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.780
Ramon: I can't say what's okay what you see here to therapists, you know what you're looking for, you know what to look for.

176
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:11.160
Ramon: So what you see is what you see, whether it's okay with me. Doesn't even matter, as you know, as a therapist what the problem really is.

177
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:25.260
Ramon: Like you said, you can throw it out there mentioning I can agree, disagree but you know by how I talk how I act my hand movement I way I look. Whatever. What's really going on. No matter what I say.

178
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm not sure.

179
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.360
Ramon: I guess. Yeah, it's okay.

180
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I have some best

181
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Guesses

182
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been spending over two years with people with stories, much like what you didn't tell. But you told me a little smidge and read quite a few books.

183
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um,

184
00:21:46.860 --> 00:22:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the piece about if I tell the story. I will. You didn't say it this way, but my word would be on unravel all all cry and I'll be emotionally all break down. That was it. I'll break down and I don't want to. That's the one.

185
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that piece right there that I say hmm

186
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if it's still making decisions for Ramon, and he doesn't know it.

187
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:34.140
Ramon: I think that's why I want to help like my I guess he's my nephew now so I wanted an open, maybe because that was still part of you still there and just to deal with it me doing some about not letting another kid get taken away.

188
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:42.270
Ramon: You know what I mean. So yeah, maybe, but a lot of my bad decision making. I don't think it has anything to do with it.

189
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.890
Ramon: I bad decision making came from drug abuse period point blank everything I did.

190
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so hold that right before drug abuse.

191
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, there's all these other decisions that are made.

192
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A five year old and we're not. I'm not. You don't have to tell another story.

193
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to philosophize write a five year old, and had to cope with that.

194
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Solve problems. Did it instinctual.

195
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This little boy had to cope with a highly distressed moment he did the best he could

196
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But oftentimes, when the five year old and that tends to be how far back our memory will go it's right at four and five and then they kind of prune at three and two and one. We don't really remember typically that far back. So you've got this five year old self, and this five year old.

197
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So solve a problem.

198
00:23:47.640 --> 00:24:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: With five year old development. Imagine I mean, look how much development happen after age five, my gosh. You're a man now right you have had all this learning experience and your brew finished growing between 27 to 30 finished growing

199
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine how underdeveloped. It was at age five it finished growing at 28 let's say imagine how much development.

200
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It hadn't had at age five, but it solved the problem. This boy solve the problem. A big stressor.

201
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The coping skill that you used to survive that.

202
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes what happens is that solution keeps being used at age 678 910

203
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: On an

204
00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:45.660
Ramon: Online course.

205
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: At 25 that's right because when we look back and we say, well, what was the coping skill I used it five.

206
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And now look, see if he used it at 10

207
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you use it at 11

208
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: See if he used it. Right. What do you think that coping skill you used as a little boy was

209
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.910
Ramon: I'm

210
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.450
Ramon: See

211
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's the answer to the coping skill that's that's the motivation, you had to do something so

212
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Basic things that people do to feel safe psychologically

213
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We can use blaming, we can say bad guys social worker.

214
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Moms good guy, we can blame. They're all psychology offers all these fancy terms for it.

215
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm trying to see if you know where yours was we can act out we can fall apart, we can associate we can rage. We can break things we can cry, we can

216
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh it's endless the different things that we can do. But at age five.

217
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you got mad, did you run away and escape or did you kind of disappear from yourself a little bit. In other words, dissociate from the pain.

218
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.380
Ramon: What

219
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:33.030
Ramon: The only thing I can really think about how I ever handle anything was just don't think

220
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: compartmentalize okay

221
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.520
Ramon: Just try to forget. Don't think about it and just go about your day like this is your family.

222
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.180
Ramon: And that's how I went to every single foster home. I went to. And then my daughter.

223
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.410
Ramon: You know what I mean. So like, yeah.

224
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't think about the past, you just said, This is what is this is what I got. I'm going to work with this.

225
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: One, I got this is my resource, the

226
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.870
Ramon: Moment, I guess.

227
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

228
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:14.850
Ramon: And that's how I still handle things to this day is well let's see how today goes

229
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.010
Ramon: Just go with the flow.

230
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:18.990
Yeah, that's all.

231
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So my question is for me as your therapist, trying to see the relationship between that history that particular style of coping and this intense anger.

232
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It continues to persist.

233
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious about it.

234
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:55.380
Ramon: You know, it's crazy. Nada. We're talking about it. I remember when I was locked up. Somebody always asked me, it was like, bro. How come you're always out here playing around, smiling and having fun.

235
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:08.280
Ramon: When you're locked up in prison, and he wasn't the only one to ask me that. I've had a couple people asked me that was luck and I told every single one of them. You just got to make the best situation on nothing.

236
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

237
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.160
Ramon: So smart. I'm just

238
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.760
Ramon: This is how I cope with it. I'm having fun.

239
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.560
Ramon: I know I'm in

240
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:24.360
Ramon: Prison. I know I can't. But don't think about that. Just go have fun and that's hot. That's, I guess that's how I handled everything my whole life. Now that you're

241
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.640
Ramon: mentioning it just kind of kind of been like that my whole life.

242
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.820
Ramon: So even if, like, Yeah, I've been doing it my whole life.

243
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a powerful approach and it's probably gotten you a lot of good stuff. It's got you survived prison. Right. You didn't let it didn't wipe you out.

244
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact it's it's a skill that

245
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious when you learned to do that. Do you have any idea who taught it to how you picked up on that. I just need to be here now appreciate the moment

246
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.580
Ramon: I think

247
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.070
Ramon: What had happened was,

248
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:24.300
Ramon: Me and my brother both hacker took him away. And I always wanted to be with him. And whenever we push families and foster care for different houses.

249
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:32.970
Ramon: I always try to follow him, so I would act out to follow him to where he was and social there's would put me there. But when I turned about 10

250
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:48.300
Ramon: They split us up. And I think at that time is when they go, it might have been even earlier might have been like eight, nine they split us up and that's when I decided I will now make the best situation either what you got.

251
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.110
Ramon: But I was dependent on my brother for a while. From, like, five to eight.

252
00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:03.780
Ramon: But then they separated us because he was a hard head and I would act out. So they said, Yeah.

253
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.710
Ramon: And I think that's where to start.

254
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

255
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: A little confused. So help me understand you knew to act out so that they would take you for when you guys were separated if you act it out. You knew they would put you in the home with your brother.

256
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That was

257
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Your trip but one time it like it didn't work. Like they pulled your heart and no amount of acting out could bring you guys back together.

258
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.590
Ramon: No, I ended up getting a different type of punishment. When I acted out with that family.

259
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.660
Ramon: Like so when I would act out with the other families. What they do is called a social worker, like, hey, you need to come get this kid.

260
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:54.060
Ramon: The last family after all the other families. I went to the last family was like, we're not calling your social worker will kick your ass.

261
00:30:54.630 --> 00:31:00.840
Ramon: Okay, and so they never called the social worker. So I never went nowhere. I stayed in that house.

262
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So from

263
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: About age eight 910 right in there, you ended up having to stay there for four years.

264
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.050
Ramon: Yeah, for like four years.

265
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.260
Ramon: It was the most of abusive time of my life. Like it was even worse than

266
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:26.370
Ramon: Getting taken away. It was bad that family was crazy, but uh yeah i think it started when they separated. Me and my brother, this one to start

267
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The same time that this massive abuse was happening, the same time you separated from your brother, you were left alone to have to survive without him and he was hard headed. He wasn't there. Was he protecting you. Before somehow at this hardheadedness prior to eight 910 see

268
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: How was I think it was more like I just wanted to be around him.

269
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.540
Ramon: Because he was the only person I knew

270
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, older younger just remind me.

271
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:01.770
Ramon: Older

272
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How many years older.

273
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.590
Ramon: I don't know, I can't remember. I know he was the

274
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.240
Ramon: The second oldest out of four.

275
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.400
Ramon: I'm the baby, my sister him and then my older brother.

276
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So eight 910. Why don't we pick 10

277
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tell me. No, I like eight or nine better but just so that I don't have to keep saying eight 910 whichever age right in that moment where you had to stay at that that home for four years and you survived abuse.

278
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Worse than anything before any experience before

279
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you

280
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you call. Like, were you acting out then.

281
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.940
Ramon: I tried, but it didn't work, they just work my ass. And then I quit. I know.

282
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.250
Ramon: I was just scared after that.

283
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you

284
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right around 10. Did you do something else.

285
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Like start to drink start to smoke.

286
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.010
Ramon: Know it's funny. I used to masturbate.

287
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:30.720
Ramon: Okay 678 because of something that happened to me before I went to foster care.

288
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:37.800
Ramon: And I was my biological mother, but I used to do that. And I think that was another skill for me.

289
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.790
Yes.

290
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

291
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was almost like

292
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It increased right around that in that foster home that one. It increased a way to come

293
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:52.680
Ramon: Yeah a lot

294
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Like 10 times a day, kind of thing.

295
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.650
Ramon: Know, like maybe twice.

296
00:33:59.580 --> 00:33:59.850
Okay.

297
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:09.990
Ramon: But then there was other people in our house that had me doing other things. So it wasn't just like it was just, it was crazy. It's just fucked up house.

298
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they sexually

299
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.670
Ramon: I think that was the

300
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.190
Ramon: The point, though, another coping mechanism for me.

301
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So there's the sexualization, and then there's also this piece of. Now how did I know to do that this earlier context of early childhood, even before like it's the reason why your mom was removed. I think right

302
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.940
Ramon: My mom was a drug addict. Yeah.

303
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you were around. Was it like one of these

304
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Folks that were using drugs they touched you and appropriately.

305
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.810
Ramon: Oh, you're good. You know that

306
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.600
Ramon: I just caught you.

307
00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What making you tell the story.

308
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.220
Ramon: Yeah, you're good.

309
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're you but you have your own limit y'all don't push back. Um, I know you will. You've shown me that you'll let me know. You're done. And you just did you just said, Wait, that's enough.

310
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

311
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.180
Ramon: That's okay.

312
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I really am trying to get the story though, too. So it's not just that it's, it's, um, I want to analyze. I want to understand. Where's the target to try and say, Okay, this could be a target.

313
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory and then I can look at current day belief systems and then later on, you know, however, we're still sort of heading towards maybe we'll be able to

314
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To meet on a weekend or someplace where we can actually do some some more psychoanalytic psycho therapeutic approaches.

315
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have already in my head. Some targets always get your permission, of course, but then we might be able to do some em, Dr. We might be able to do some empty chair techniques. Okay, so it isn't just to manipulate you, I promise.

316
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.130
I promise you.

317
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I genuinely, genuinely came from a place of curiosity I had forgotten about the little baby history. I had forgotten.

318
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're back. We're back up here. I'm Rebecca up here, light, light and easy.

319
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, I want you to share with me what today was like, though, because it's a little different than what we've been doing in the past. What was today like for you.

320
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:56.070
Ramon: Oh, it's crazy. The last week has been like really rough for me. I don't know what it is, but I don't have

321
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.100
Ramon: The energy or motivation that

322
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:18.330
Ramon: I did like last week, I guess, I don't know, like every time I every since Sunday. Every day of the waking up. I don't want to do anything. I just want to later. Like, I don't get up. I don't. And then, but I fought I do the Council five thing and just start to move, so I

323
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:29.370
Ramon: Do that I do that a lot. And, but once I get moving. I still don't want to be moving like it sucks. I don't know what it is. I want to leave work early

324
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.880
Ramon: Sometimes like I don't know what it is.

325
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.470
Ramon: It sounds

326
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.850
Ramon: To me last week.

327
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what Sunday was

328
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.330
Ramon: Mother's Day.

329
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:48.060
Ramon: I did all kinds of stuff that day. But I didn't want to do anything. I got my girlfriend and some flowers made her breakfast.

330
00:37:48.870 --> 00:38:05.610
Ramon: We cleaned the house went to my grandma's like grilled for like four hours, there's like five mothers there and I saw growth for all of them and made food for all of them. We are aid and everything, but I didn't want to do any of that. It was all my idea.

331
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.500
Ramon: Because they're the women in my life, but

332
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But I was detached from it, like we're doing it like a robot like there was no feeling

333
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:21.540
Ramon: Yeah, it's like I had to do it is, what it was like I have to come to work.

334
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.880
Ramon: You know what I mean.

335
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:31.920
Ramon: And I really wanted to enjoy that day, but I just was not feeling it. I don't know why. And I've been like that every day since

336
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, remember

337
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm out here. I know in your feeling so it's a little easier for me to analyze because I'm out here. And I'm just wondering if it's the same thing I talked about before, which is

338
00:38:50.610 --> 00:39:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If a person is detached from one part of themself accidentally we can be detached, which means not in connection with

339
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:11.310
Ramon: Another part is crazy that you say that because the part of me. Does the test is the, I guess, crazy go to prison part

340
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.880
Ramon: Okay, and then the part of me that's here now is the

341
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.990
Ramon: I don't know how would you put it the robotic part

342
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:29.160
Ramon: Like, I want to be a father. I do want to family. I go on a sober life. But at the end of the day, deep down in me. I know, I still want to get high.

343
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:37.050
Ramon: Like I don't even think about it, no more. But I do want to go fuck off. Sometimes I do know what I mean. But I know I can.

344
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:46.830
Ramon: So it's crazy that you say that because I do feel like there's a part of me missing that people can't see. I mean, I don't want them to see it, you know, but

345
00:39:47.790 --> 00:40:07.170
Ramon: It's just I can be that guide, no more and going to prison was part of me. I'm not good for less eight, nine years. I enjoy going to prison. Like it was cool. I did it for since 2008 I was in and out of prison and county jail, all the way till last year when I or this year, January.

346
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: helped me to understand what you liked about it if you could even a few things.

347
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:14.850
Ramon: It was simple.

348
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:21.420
Ramon: It was really simple, like the only thing I had to worry about it in there was getting up to eat.

349
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:35.730
Ramon: Because my family didn't take care of me to put money on my book, so I couldn't buy food. So I had to get up to go to the child to eat, but that's the only thing I had to worry about the rest of the day. I played games like a high like I was on street.

350
00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:43.530
Ramon: Women drinking like it was easy. It was easy.

351
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.960
Ramon: And I came out here, and I have so many responsibilities.

352
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.850
Ramon: Yeah, that's where that goal came in, where I want to be mentally stronger.

353
00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:01.380
Ramon: As be able to handle all these responsibilities and not just give up like I used to. I used to be a giver upper

354
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:16.260
Ramon: On some stuff like when things really got rough and I wouldn't try to work through it. I just give up pluck it but now I gotta fight through it and it's gonna, I don't know, tiring.

355
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.260
Ramon: Does that make sense.

356
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, everything you're saying makes sense and

357
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to

358
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to see a connection to

359
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To this routine.

360
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.040
Ramon: The routine that I have, because I'm used to like routine and prison, I

361
00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:52.230
Ramon: Get up. Eat, drink my coffee brush my teeth get ready to go play handball goal, you know,

362
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.530
Ramon: And I do the same thing here, I get up, I take a shower.

363
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:10.410
Ramon: brush my teeth, take my medicine. I got my own routine down here, just like I was in prison. The only thing is, I still have other responsibilities I have to take care of. Now, it's not just a morning routine.

364
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:22.560
Ramon: Or my daily routine that I have to worry about. Okay, let me not. I'm going to play handball from two, three and four to five and going to the gym to play basketball.

365
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:32.580
Ramon: I can do that. I gotta come to work eight to five and then when I get home. I got do whatever the girl wants me to do I have to take care of whatever my grandma needs me to take care of.

366
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:43.410
Ramon: You know, my mother. She knew my real mother, but I call her. My mother because I used to date her daughter and their family became really close to me. So now I'm like family today.

367
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:56.940
Ramon: So I call her. My mother I help her out to. So it's just a lot. They all. It's just a lot for me and i i do it. I've been doing it. I work Saturdays and Sundays like

368
00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:06.570
Ramon: Helping out other people doing stuff that I don't need to be doing instead of being at home, resting, you know, but I do that also to keep myself busy so I don't get

369
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.710
Ramon: It all adds up, it's up in the prison. I don't have to worry about all that at all.

370
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.730
Ramon: But like I said, I'm doing a lot better now.

371
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there any downside to that life.

372
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:36.150
Ramon: Yeah, definitely. I didn't get kicked off my family. I didn't get to see my loved ones didn't get to eat what I wanted didn't get to do what I wanted. I had to do my morning routine around with the guards wanted me to do.

373
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:40.230
Ramon: Like it. There's a lot of down I'm around all men.

374
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.790
Ramon: all fucking day

375
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

376
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.540
Ramon: You know what I mean, smelling, they're forced or pissed or

377
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.070
Ramon: Order like there's a lot of downside to it. Absolutely.

378
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.860
Ramon: That's just not cool. DON'T WISH IT UPON nobody

379
00:43:53.550 --> 00:44:12.210
Ramon: But it was just, I was just able to cope with the situation that it's okay to me in my head. You know what I mean. I made. Like I said, I made them. I was always smiling jumping around playing with people like just acted like I was in college, pretty much just like a big college door.

380
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

381
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like play is a big piece. And it sounds like that's missing.

382
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.720
Ramon: Definitely, I guess.

383
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's missing.

384
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm worried I'm glad this is coming up because I agree. I think this this thing you did where I'm you're able to be moment and find the beauty.

385
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The sarcasm. The joke. The fun in any given moment is a next level like high order coping mechanism that's not the same thing as sticking your head in the sand pretending like something's not happening, the kind of thing you're talking about

386
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what gets people like Viktor Frankl through the concentration camp.

387
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.600
Ramon: He had no like I

388
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:13.110
Ramon: I honestly do like I told my girlfriend one time because we're talking about a off switch concentration camp.

389
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.540
Ramon: And I was like, babe. I felt like I could have

390
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.870
Ramon: Did that guy could cope with it. Like, I think I

391
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:24.930
Ramon: Might have been hungry as skinny as shit but I think I did it. I still have this smiling when they found me.

392
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.890
Ramon: Like it's crazy because I was just talking to her about this.

393
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and it is an amazing skill.

394
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's at a cost. We humans can't do just one, we may think that this one skill is awesome. It's a tool. We've got to have access to other ones.

395
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it make sense to cope make the most out of something when all around you are all these mothers.

396
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, why I should be feeling connected

397
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.690
Ramon: To myself. Lot of time.

398
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:20.550
Ramon: And I said I was around so many goddamn men. I'm around all these women and I feel stressed out, for some reason, I don't, I should be happy. This is what I wanted. I tell myself like I talked to myself like that all the time. I swear to you. I will talk to myself, which

399
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.560
Ramon: Is what you're asking.

400
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:23.700
Yeah.

401
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you got in the habit.

402
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Of coping and and reframing and saying,

403
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't make contact with what's actually going on. If you've been doing that, year after year after year after year after year, over and over and over. When the thing out here is actually good.

404
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already in the habit of not making contact with it.

405
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

406
00:46:55.230 --> 00:47:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a matter of maybe overdoing a good skill, but just overdoing it.

407
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The other skill is the one that you and I were kind of playing with earlier, the one you kind of called me out on the one we feel

408
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And that one.

409
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're not compensating but you actually make contact with what is no twisting know pretzel know reframing it's

410
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a. What about my mom that that might be a sad day for you but you went like a robot, and you did what you were supposed to do, and you did.

411
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:41.040
Ramon: You say that because maybe that is what it was for me. Honestly, because, yeah, maybe not as you say that

412
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.880
Ramon: Because I was definitely feeling like the first day.

413
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like detached.

414
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.780
Ramon: Oh, you know what it is.

415
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

416
00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we got we got a frozen screen here. You might come back. Let's see if you come back and hear me.

417
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

418
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if this Wi Fi connects back

419
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test test. Oh, I got you back. Okay, so it is what, what, what was your insight.

420
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:27.660
Ramon: I was gonna say the same feeling I had on Sunday was the same feeling I had all those years when I was locked up during the holidays Thanksgiving.

421
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:41.370
Ramon: Halloween Christmas New Year's all came around and that same feeling like it wasn't around my family was around all these weirdos. Like I had that same feeling on Sunday.

422
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:50.790
Ramon: That same exact fan. I didn't even think about that. So just now, now's the same feeling where I was just like, god damn it away.

423
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That

424
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.650
Ramon: Same feeling

425
00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but you don't quite have a name for it yet. Do you

426
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:01.290
Ramon: Know,

427
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.960
Ramon: I don't know what it is.

428
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.680
Ramon: I bet some love I have for my loved ones are some I don't

429
00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.120
Ramon: I don't know what that feeling is, it's a real deep feeling, though.

430
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And I think those are the ones that are work together. If we can get to naming it

431
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And seeing what that is and seeing how you experience it then. Okay, you're making contact with that old history. What's your relationship with it, old history. How is it playing out in current day

432
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it okay that it plays out is, are you okay with saying, You know what, I know I'm supposed to be happy and grateful and Mother's Day, but I want to cry.

433
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now over here.

434
00:49:51.120 --> 00:50:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's perfectly fine. But you may have layer upon layer upon layer of disapproval for that. But if it turns out it's something like that. Like you're detached and left out.

435
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm

436
00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Empty

437
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't be surprised if it ends up being words like that because you're giving me little stories you're giving me a little bread. Bread Crumbs to understand

438
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Why things that everybody should be like, I'm so blessed. I'm so blessed. Look at all these women. This is what I wanted. How you are

439
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Numb.

440
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And not feeling it. I won't be surprised.

441
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to go with you and try and find words to describe it and it'll take as long or as little time as it takes. But I'm very interested in it.

442
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: because knowledge is power. Once you name it. It's like, ooh yeah I can do something with it.

443
00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:58.080
Ramon: That makes sense.

444
00:50:58.920 --> 00:50:59.130
Yeah.

445
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, Ramon you kicked ass today.

446
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:05.730
Ramon: Thanks.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

Gwenevere Abriel: Do

451
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.020
Ramon: Oh yeah, you don't need to say stuff I was supposed to say

452
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's someone called me this week they said

453
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you've got all those fancy words and you twist them around. You get me do things. And I'm like, I'm telling you, I don't, I'm not twisting, I am truly curious. I truly am I'm but I'm wondering if you're having the same experience like what she up to she tricking me

454
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm looking at okay I'm gonna go to urban Urban Dictionary. I'm with that up.
