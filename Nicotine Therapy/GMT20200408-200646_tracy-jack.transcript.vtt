tracy jackson: And

201
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.960
tracy jackson: So do you have any doctor or therapist that you see regularly.

202
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.400
JAMES EAKIN: Okay.

203
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.170
tracy jackson: And

204
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.740
tracy jackson: Is it, are we are you on

205
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:16.230
tracy jackson: I guess the connection is getting a little better. I'm just going to repeat what I hear you say so I make sure I hear it correctly, but

206
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:23.430
tracy jackson: You, it's, it's easy. You have a lot of triggers to for relapse. It's

207
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.770
JAMES EAKIN: Yeah.

208
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:37.800
tracy jackson: Okay. And this time, however, you're moving to a house with your girlfriend's she doesn't use, you have a stable relationship. You want to stay with her because you guys are having a baby.

209
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:51.780
tracy jackson: You've got some disability money coming in and you've got some insurance. I guess if you're seeing bright heart. Yeah, Medicaid or something. Okay, so what are your reasons for wanting to

210
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.310
tracy jackson: Get clean now. Any other motivations.

211
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.810
JAMES EAKIN: Just

212
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.080
tracy jackson: A baby and your girlfriend. OK, so

213
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.650
tracy jackson: The way we go about this at bright heart, we would need you to have a pharmacy that you can work with. Right.

214
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:21.810
tracy jackson: And then

215
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.700
tracy jackson: Okay. And so what we would do is call you in a prescription for some Suboxone because that's what we can do over the phone.

216
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.000
JAMES EAKIN: Yeah.

217
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.050
tracy jackson: So about people.

218
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.660
tracy jackson: When what happened last time that you were on Suboxone

219
00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.570
tracy jackson: Yeah, so the deal with the Suboxone and we'll talk about that. Do you remember how much you were taking

220
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.040
JAMES EAKIN: Was taking this trip this trip to

221
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:07.770
tracy jackson: One or two strips.

222
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:08.760
Yeah.

223
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:32.400
tracy jackson: I'm not sure exactly, you know what they were talking about, you know, just maybe, we were taken at the same time to strips on both sides to so there's more room for the strip to be absorbed. But the deal with Suboxone is you have to be well and truly into withdrawal like

224
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.930
tracy jackson: If you

225
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.650
tracy jackson: Yeah, you got to be like really feeling bad for a while. For like 24 hours.

226
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:47.910
tracy jackson: Because if you take the Suboxone too soon it'll put you in even worse withdrawal.

227
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:49.680
JAMES EAKIN: Yeah.

228
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.560
tracy jackson: Yeah, exactly. So you just gotta hold out as long as you can. And then, and we'll give you some

229
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:07.620
tracy jackson: Some instructions about how to do that. But bottom line is you once you're really in withdrawal, then you'll take you'll take one of the Suboxone okay and then we'll follow up on you.

230
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:14.070
tracy jackson: You know, pretty daily, you know, to make sure that we get you to the right dose, you know, be like you kind of

231
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:28.080
tracy jackson: There'll be instructions for how you did this, basically, but take one and then two hours later, if you're not at a withdrawal. You can take a second one sort of thing. But we'll have a call team to make sure that you

232
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:41.910
tracy jackson: You know, know how to do it. And then we won't increase the dose really quickly. But we give you a big enough dose up front that it should take you out of withdrawal and reduce your craving. Okay. And then once you're in that situation, you would need to call in

233
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.770
tracy jackson: Once a week.

234
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:55.230
tracy jackson: You know we just give you kind of a week supply at the time. At first, and you'd meet with me or another provider in a therapist and that kind of thing. And we try to get you on a stable dose.

235
00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:03.780
tracy jackson: There'll be some blood work and some lab testing and things that you need to get done. But all that the care coordination team will walk you through. Okay.

236
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:11.070
tracy jackson: Now, do you think that's going to be a problem for you to come weekly to the meetings.

237
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.090
JAMES EAKIN: Mm hmm.

238
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:19.560
tracy jackson: Okay. And here at the beginning, we might see you a little more frequently, just to check in with you and make sure that you're doing okay with the induction.

239
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:30.720
tracy jackson: But it sounds like you've got at least another day or two before you really get into withdrawal. Did you give the information to the care coordinators about the pharmacy that you want to use.

240
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.020
tracy jackson: Okay, and you're in California, is that correct

241
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.490
tracy jackson: Okay.

242
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.140
tracy jackson: And what is your partner's name.

243
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:41.880
JAMES EAKIN: Dana.

244
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.560
tracy jackson: Dana. Okay.

245
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:50.280
tracy jackson: And did you end this and this number that we're calling you on. Now this is a good number to be able to reach you.

246
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:53.340
tracy jackson: Okay.

247
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:54.630
All right.

248
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.440
tracy jackson: Now last sort of bit of questions. Do you suffer with any pain physical pain in your body.

249
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:05.910
Yeah.

250
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.760
tracy jackson: And is that one of the drivers that makes you want to use the heroin is pain.

251
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:19.980
tracy jackson: And tell me on a daily basis how you would write your pain on a scale of zero to 10

252
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.280

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.010
tracy jackson: Yeah.

254
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:34.770
tracy jackson: Okay, so, and tell me when was the last time you can remember never having any pain anywhere.

255
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:36.780
JAMES EAKIN: Oh,

256
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:43.290
tracy jackson: 14 and what happened in

257
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.770
tracy jackson: And when did you

258
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.020
tracy jackson: When were you first using any any substances, how old

259
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:20.760
tracy jackson: 20 years old. Okay. And then how about any alcohol or or weed.

260
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.490
tracy jackson: That right, the time when you started having pain.

261
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.360
tracy jackson: And how about cigarettes you smoke.

262
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:35.070
JAMES EAKIN: Yes.

263
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:37.410
JAMES EAKIN: Do

264
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.530
tracy jackson: You smoke cigarettes, since you're young.

265
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.870
JAMES EAKIN: Yeah yeah

266
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.200
Okay.

267
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:54.270
tracy jackson: Okay. And then in terms of the pain, other than the heroin or the pain pills. Have you ever seen a pain doctor or had any

268
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.060
tracy jackson: Any treatments for pain that have been helpful.

269
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.480
Okay.

270
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.270
tracy jackson: And where is the majority of your pain located

271
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.760
JAMES EAKIN: My bad.

272
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:19.950
JAMES EAKIN: Right.

273
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:21.720
JAMES EAKIN: Okay.

274
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:28.200
tracy jackson: So I'm just trying to figure it out because there are two different tracks that we can go to and bright heart health.

275
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:35.130
tracy jackson: One is, you know, for addiction and the other is for pain and there are some people that we put in a combined program.

276
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:48.450
tracy jackson: Where they can sort of manage get their addiction under control. And then if you find that you're still having pain and that's driving your cravings, then you can come once you get a little bit more stable than we can get you in a pain management program as well.

277
00:35:50.790 --> 00:36:05.070
tracy jackson: That sounds good. Alright, the first. I guess the, you know, the issue is, is this something that you're willing to try that you want to give a guy once you start withdrawing go back on the Suboxone

278
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.960
tracy jackson: Meet meet frequently

279
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.700
tracy jackson: For the first week.

280
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:17.610
tracy jackson: And then we'll kind of do it every week week. Once all the drug screens and everything start that they look okay then we'll then we can increase the

281
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.660
tracy jackson: You know, change it around so you don't have to meet so frequently. Okay, but we want to make sure you stay safe and all that.

282
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.470
tracy jackson: In between, okay.

283
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.220
