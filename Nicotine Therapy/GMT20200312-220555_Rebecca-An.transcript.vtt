Michelle: And she was able to go home and ever since she's been home. She's just been kind of like really showing like symptoms of like Alzheimer's really really badly. So

18
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.860
Michelle: They put her in her home.

19
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.580

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:44.910
Michelle: Unreal unruly mean and and aggressive and I guess she's been like just destroying the room that she's in like breaking stuff and just being downright mean and nasty and she wants to go home.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.090
Michelle: Well, she was home.

22
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.230

Michelle: She was in, I can't

24
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.580
Michelle: I didn't exactly hear what he had said to me, but somehow or other, she got out of wherever she was, and I think she was in a different facility.

25
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:15.900
Michelle: And she got out. She goes, she's in a wheelchair, which is not normal for my great grandmother she's usually like just walk around with her walker, but

26
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:34.890
Michelle: Anyways, apparently she got out and she ran away. And she was going down a hill and smacked her face into a car lost control the wheelchair yes matter face master I sock it all up and they won't do surgery on it because they don't think she'll make it through. She's like 9394 years old.

27
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.950
Michelle: And

28
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.570
Michelle: They just put her in a home they I guess everybody got sick of taking care of her and and and whatnot. And they put her in a home and

29
00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:03.240
Michelle: They've been dealing with that and it's been crazy and constant phone calls. My grandmother, you know, getting phone calls from her and just kind of like repetitive, the same thing over and over again. I want to go home. I want to see the doctor. I want to go home.

30
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.110
You know, yeah.

31
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.480
Michelle: So they're dealing with that.

32
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.810
Michelle: It's like this. It's been really, really rough, but

33
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a lot.

34
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.440
Michelle: Yeah, yeah. It is a lot and a part of me is just kind of really like upset and kind of like pissed off about it because

35
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:31.920
Michelle: I mean, I am a caregiver. That's what I've done. That's what I've always done for work, like I have like over 10 years experience as in home caregiving with with Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

36
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:45.510
Michelle: And when my grandmother flew off the loony bin, what, two years ago, year and a half ago when she won her doctor took her off her lithium cold turkey. She

37
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:57.810
Michelle: She went nuts like literally went nuts like like she shouldn't be like like mentally not there. Like, I mean, she was doing some bizarre stuff like putting toilet paper under our armpits and

38
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.370
Michelle: The earthquake has come in and the the water planet people and I mean she was just off the wall.

39
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:25.500
Michelle: And when that happened, I was taking care of her, you know, I was making sure she was being fed and slept and babies and, you know, because nobody else in the family wanted to do it or could do it and she got better, she got back on the lithium and she got she pulled out of it, thank God.

40
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:35.370
Michelle: You know, like she's found more, more, but I just feel like yours, where they know where we're about to be homeless.

41
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.390
Michelle: You know my

42
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.800
Michelle: my great grandmother has a home with

43
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.540
Michelle: Plenty of room and whatnot, you know, and

44
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.130
Michelle: It's

45
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:57.660
Michelle: We I you know we we could, I could take care of her, you know, we could at least stay there till we get on our feet and get into our own place but they just

46
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.780
Michelle: I don't know.

47
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.940
Michelle: I don't, I don't really know. I don't know why because it's not like

48
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:22.350
Michelle: It can't be done, you know, and it's not like I would be there by myself, either her son uncle Bobby lives with his wife on the property and, you know, and so it's not like it would just be me and you know my, my, you know, my daughter and my guy.

49
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.850
Michelle: And

50
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.010
Michelle: I guess I'm just a little upset about that, you know, I feel like

51
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:42.060
Michelle: You know Uncle Bobby, they made they made a comment you know Bobby made a promise to, you know, my grandparents, my great grandfather before he passed that he would make sure you know great grandma never

52
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:52.710
Michelle: Never went to a home late, you know, and I've always always told everybody that you know all my family, everybody you know like I don't recommend putting people at home.

53
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.850
Michelle: At work yeah facilities. I've been there. I, you know, like I

54
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:06.840
Michelle: They look all great and grand when you walk in the end the door, you know, and they're all super nice scrutiny and everything, but behind closed doors. What it's just us in the patients like

55
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.970
Michelle: I've seen some fucked up shit working in, you know, facilities.

56
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

57
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:30.300
Michelle: And I never, I never recommend anybody, anybody but their family member in a home, you know, like most insurances will pay a family member to provide care. And it's not like home health still won't come in like home health will still be coming in, you know,

58
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.220
Michelle: Just

59
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you brought it up to them. I'll be

60
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Back on the table.

61
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:53.340
Michelle: Cup a few times now, a few times and they kind of just, you should be talking to this person, you should be talking to that person. And I think, who I really need to talk to you is, is

62
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:05.700
Michelle: My aunt sherry like my dad's aunt I we all call her answer, but she's part of the executive of the will and Uncle Bobby

63
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:21.180
Michelle: But I'm not sure if it's been relate to her that I've offered you know and I'm not sure if it's been really to her about our position or whatnot, but she was involved when when my grandmother went up the linchpin to was kind of like me and at cherry take care of her, you know,

64
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.800
Michelle: So,

65
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.660
Michelle: I don't know. I thought about reaching out to her, but

66
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.170
Michelle: The way that might my dad just makes certain comments here and there. That is just, you know, kind of like

67
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.810
Michelle: Maybe has alternate like meaning if you

68
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.140
Know,

69
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.940
Michelle: There's, there's certain comments that he's made to me that just

70
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:54.720
Michelle: Make me like, like, like, just leave it be kind of thing like she's in the home. She's probably better off there. She's, she's gotten really really mean.

71
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:04.530
Michelle: Well, when you're in a facility and you know you're around people you don't know and you want to go home because that's all that it is. She wants to go home.

72
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:15.840
Michelle: Yeah, that's why she's being aggressive and she's destroying the place that's everything all the thing. I mean, she's not all far gone, you know, where she can't feed herself, and she can't

73
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:25.680
Michelle: Go to the bat like she's still there. A little bit. She's just like having trouble remembering things and being very repetitive, you know, like

74
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:37.230
Michelle: But I guess the week before they put her in the home. She was like, constantly on the phone with my grandmother, we need. I need, I need to go to the doctor, you know, and she had already gone and seeing the doctor.

75
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.190
Michelle: Mm hmm. And, and then once they

76
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.690
Michelle: She got hurt. That's, that's when they just they put her home for good and I used to work in this home.

77
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.290
Michelle: Yeah yeah I know all about this place. I worked there like

78
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.250
Michelle: And that wasn't, it wasn't a good. See, I don't know if I told you I thought, I thought I told you about it.

79
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:13.020
Michelle: How I was when I was working there. I, I quit. And I didn't fulfill my two week notice and the executive director of the building called

80
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:27.030
Michelle: me and asked me, why didn't fulfill my two weeks and I told her I just told her everything about what it was going on with my experiences and just everything you know because my supervisor was not acting like a supervisor, she was acting like

81
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.440
Michelle: Kind of like good old boys, you know this this part of the staff is the friends and we party on the weekends and

82
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:49.740
Michelle: The stuff you know the the other part of the South, you know, you're, you're the outcast. You know, you're not right. Yeah, you know, and when I confronted my supervisor about my co workers and what they have done and what I've seen, she just

83
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.110
Michelle: In one ear and out the other like it never the conversation never happened.

84
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:16.680
Michelle: Yeah, so, so I quit and you know I was, I was working a lot. I was working double shifts and I was had met aid on graveyard shift. So it wasn't like I was just some and I had been there for a year already so it wasn't like I was just somebody they they hired off the street and

85
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

86
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.640
Michelle: You know, like, I'd been there for a while but

87
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:28.530
Michelle: Yeah, I get because I moved back to Arizona after that and I state came in. It was all over, because it's a small town.

88
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:36.330
Michelle: He was all over the front page that local newspaper about how bunch of people got fired and the state came in and and

89
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.830
Michelle: Supposedly cleared up you know and cleaned up stuff and

90
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.930
Michelle: You know, after state leaves. I'm sure it goes right back to its old ladies.

91
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:52.890
Michelle: But yeah, I don't know, I haven't been in there. I don't talk to anybody that works there. I just completely cut that

92
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.270
Michelle: Off.

93
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.320
Yeah.

94
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You sound like a place that I used to work at in Seaside, Oregon. There was just like that to like

95
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah dysfunction all over the place. I know.

96
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:08.940
Michelle: Um,

97
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:18.510
Michelle: Yeah, it was really not like in. And after that I never worked in a facility ever again. I, I'd rather do at home. And that's what I like, stuck to because

98
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:29.910
Michelle: I after working in home and working in the facility, like I just tell everybody. Don't put your family member at home.

99
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.590
Michelle: I just

100
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, if

101
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:51.660
Michelle: You can take care of your family member, why not, because otherwise they're just sitting alone with people they don't know people that don't love them and they just sit there and just sit around and and are medicated to die.

102
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

103
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.580
Michelle: Really, I mean, I've seen it. You know, I

104
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:06.360
Michelle: Really, really, really, really sad and it breaks my heart and I couldn't do it. I mean, I would come home falling every night from work.

105
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.990
Michelle: I mean, it was a lot. It was a lot for me.

106
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely a rough place.

107
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

108
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.600
rough time

109
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll tell you what, though at the place that I worked at

110
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I drove the van. So I got to take him on to the doctors and I got to take him.

111
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On outings and you know do fun things with them and

112
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

113
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: enjoyed my interaction with the patients.

114
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, very much.

115
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:48.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, with their, their right mind. It's like their stories that they can tell are amazing, you know,

116
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:58.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About your life and you know i just i. That was the part that I love the most, you know. Yeah. My biggest fear is getting attached

117
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to them because you know break your heart. Yeah.

118
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just break your heart.

119
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.160
And

120
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:15.390
Michelle: I've been some really cool people. And I've watched some really cool people does live and you're right it is

121
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.750
Michelle: It's hard, just getting attached, you know, even just small, you know,

122
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Checking on them every day, you know, making sure they're okay, you know, and it's just, it's tough when all of a sudden you go check on one and they're gone.

123
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because they passed away over the night and you know what I mean, it's like it's just heart wrenching. For me it'd be the same. It's the same as like working at it at a neonatal center, you know, for premature babies. I couldn't do that either.

124
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.660
Michelle: No, no way.

125
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Much, you know, definitely.

126
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.980
Michelle: Yeah, I wouldn't be able to handle that.

127
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is tough. So I thought about you know that there are people that can go

128
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can go volunteer in certain hospitals in certain cities and

129
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Love and comfort the babies that are born addicted.

130
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:10.890
Michelle: Right.

131
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:19.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I thought about engaging in that, but I don't even think I could do. I could do that because my heart is happy. I couldn't do.

132
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A whole

133
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:26.610
Michelle: You know, yeah, that would be really hard. I don't know if I could do that either you just feel so badly for them they can't like

134
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.990
Michelle: Communicate, and they're just so tiny and helpless and

135
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.900
Michelle: I couldn't do that.

136
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, some tough stuff that's

137
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.040
Michelle: That's tough.

138
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:40.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Crazy.

139
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So any new issues coming up with your landlord or she pretty much

140
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:54.060
Michelle: No, I haven't. I've never responded to that text and she never texted back or whatnot, never wrote back and never

141
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.420
Michelle: I haven't seen or heard anything so

142
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.410
Michelle: I just, I mean, I've been avoiding going down to the office.

143
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.180
So,

144
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:05.820
Michelle: Yeah.

145
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what have you been doing

146
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.780
Michelle: Well, I've been packing, you know,

147
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's just and

148
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:18.930
Michelle: I mean, I haven't checked my mail in a while. I haven't gone down there, you know, just because I've been avoiding, you know, but

149
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.360
Michelle: Hey, it's been quiet, it's been it's been peaceful

150
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good.

151
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how's everything with your, with your daughter.

152
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.560
Michelle: She's good. She's

153
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.230
Michelle: We got her a toddler bed.

154
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.840
Michelle: We got her toddler bed, they can you know cuz she fell out of the twin bed.

155
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:54.480
Michelle: And we've just been kind of stalking her bigger kind of stuffed animals in a blanket and pillows along

156
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:01.710
Michelle: Where she can't roll off but she's a square armor. I mean, she's just literally all over the place in her bed.

157
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:10.860
Michelle: But so we got to tell her bed. And that was just not happen. She was not having it. It was

158
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:12.600
Michelle: I mean,

159
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:23.400
Michelle: I understand, like, you know, the whole like plastic kind of matches cover thing. You know, like that they put on these mattresses for toddlers and in cribs for babies and stuff.

160
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

161
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.560
Michelle: It's so crinkly

162
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.870
Michelle: You know what I mean, like,

163
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.210
Michelle: I mean, I hear and they're just

164
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.990
Michelle: Trying to get comfortable flopping around in the biz just

165
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The whole way up.

166
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.440
Michelle: Yeah. Like, no wonder she can't get comfortable and fall asleep and

167
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.360
So,

168
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.900
Michelle: That and that and she's just

169
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:56.130
Michelle: She's, she's literally like she just sprawls out in her bed like so and and the toddler bed as much smaller of a mattress.

170
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.730
Using

171
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:07.680
Michelle: So she when we were trying to put her to sleep because she won't go to sleep without us holding her or laying in her bed with her.

172
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.840
Michelle: We couldn't

173
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:20.100
Michelle: We could she just wouldn't fall asleep. So we split it back in the twin bed. And so I feel really, really stupid and really kind of like, I mean,

174
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:27.270
Michelle: Thankfully I didn't pay anything for it, it was free and it's a really nice toddler bed but

175
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.520
Michelle: Now I have a toddler bed that my toddler doesn't want to use

176
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:35.370
Michelle: You know I

177
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's funny, because I think that a lot of toddlers, do not like the toddler bed and I don't know why.

178
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.230
Right.

179
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have no idea why. But

180
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:54.750
Michelle: I mean she liked it. She was all stoked. You know, we made it like rice new bed and

181
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.060
Michelle: Whatnot but she just she didn't like it. As far as like trying to fall asleep.

182
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.990
Michelle: I just

183
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:21.510
Michelle: Don't want to make her. I mean, like, I, I, myself, Wouldn't be comfortable. I know I wouldn't be comfortable because I'm kind of a swimmer to and and just the crinkly Ness alone, you know, I mean, we tried putting like a couple blankets over it to, to try to mask the wrinkle noise but

184
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.500
Michelle: It's it's critically and

185
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.500
Michelle: Or girl.

186
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Too much for right

187
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And everything else is going okay you've been feeling okay

188
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:42.780
Michelle: Yeah, yeah. I've been feeling okay I just, I mean, I've got anxiety, really, really bad. I'm super stressed out and

189
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:59.100
Michelle: It's it's a lot. It's a lot at you know and and just we're down to the wire. And I don't know what's map and I'm just trying to get my driver's license, but I have to pay that 270 whatever DOLLARS TO ARIZONA.

190
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.740
Michelle: And I come up with that.

191
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:10.290
Michelle: And I don't know if it's true or not, but I read on there that it may take up to 14 days for the process.

192
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:11.970
Michelle: And

193
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.530
Michelle: You know, I, I'm hoping. Like that's up case don't have working days.

194
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

195
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.770
Michelle: When I am I'm able to pay

196
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:30.780
Michelle: The to the to to Arizona to get my license suspended or whatever reinstated.

197
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:42.570
Michelle: I don't you know i don't i don't have that 14 days I need it. Yeah, I need to be able to just walk right back in to the DMV in Oregon and be like, I'm here to get a driver's license like

198
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

199
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.710
Michelle: You know, and thankfully that's super cheap.

200
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

201
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.500
Michelle: Five or nine bucks for the test and nine bucks for the drive test. It's like

202
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.730
Michelle: Yeah, so

203
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's definitely different than trying to get something accomplished in California, that's for sure.

204
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.910
Michelle: You know, I just

205
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.380
Michelle: California i don't i don't know how helpful. It works really

206
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:24.420
Michelle: But I feel like, since we're going to be an Oregon. I should have my organs license. My organizes because the car is already been previously registered in Oregon to and my dad doesn't seem to think it'll pass smog in California.

207
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:31.200
Michelle: And that was like the one like thinking like, oh shit I totally forgot about smog.

208
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.670
You know, like, yeah.

209
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.780
Michelle: Yeah, come on.

210
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have to get smoked in Oregon.

211
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I don't think I've ever had to get a car smog in Oregon.

212
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:55.290
Michelle: I don't think so. Maybe in like the metro areas Portland or whatever. But I don't think like as far as like Brookings and Coos Bay. I've never heard of anybody having a fog. They're beautiful.

213
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.820
Michelle: But small fog.

214
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.990
Fog

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:04.620
Michelle: Sorry.

216
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mom, Mom.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.290
Mom.

218
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've just been charging along trying to take care of stuff at home disengaging from your landlord. Thank you very much. I'm glad you're doing that.

219
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

220
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:36.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that you know you can be definitely a little bit happier with that disengagement because you're not sucked up into the crazy, you know what I mean.

221
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:50.100
Michelle: Yeah, no, no. I'm glad I didn't, I didn't respond because I just, you know, after after like the next day after thinking about it, you know, I'm so glad I didn't respond. Is it

222
00:21:52.110 --> 00:22:09.510
Michelle: Is all worth it. And I just, you know, like I just feel like I should just keep my mouth shut, and just not respond and not say anything or do anything and then you know if anything happens or said or done, then that's on them and that makes them look like the ass.

223
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:26.790
Michelle: You know by the time we were out of here. You know, I have this place will be clean and I'm going to do a video walkthrough with it to show that the place is not trash and yeah there's a few holes here and there, but

224
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.810
Michelle: We didn't charge this way.

225
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:31.770
Yeah.

226
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah and you know it's just about really keeping your side of the street clean and being the adult in the situation. You know what I mean.

227
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.990
Michelle: Yeah.

228
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:52.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you got enough on your plate. YOU DON'T HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THE DRAMA you know that these other people want to bring to the table, you know,

229
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not worth it.

230
00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:03.180
Michelle: It's really not. I've got, I've got enough stress in my head. I've got enough anxiety in my head. I don't know. I don't need any anymore, you know, and

231
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.470
Michelle: To just know that, you know, like my conscience is clear.

232
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.770
Michelle: You know, I know.

233
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:19.740
Michelle: My conscience is clear. And I know I haven't done anything wrong. And I know that

234
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:30.120
Michelle: Hopefully the man upstairs is going to do me a solid and help me out and and whatever his plan is is is

235
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.480
Michelle: Just going to try to

236
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:52.560
Michelle: Keep a positive mindset and hopefully just I don't know my dad keeps Tommy like try to have faith, try to have more faith and I'm just like, I struggle with my feet because I i'm I'm angry at God, man, like

237
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.030
Michelle: I I'm angry. I feel like

238
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.480
Michelle: If you're, if you're

239
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:16.290
Michelle: It's just really hard for me because I feel like why would somebody who has the power to, you know, stop things and keep things from happening. Like why would you let innocent like babies, you know, innocent people be hurt and and

240
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:26.040
Michelle: You know, I struggle with that really, really hardly, you know, like after what happened with my son and whatnot, like that. Yes.

241
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.850
Michelle: My son did nothing wrong and

242
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.630
Michelle: You know, for it for the man upstairs to just sit there and be like, oh, it's gonna make you stronger in life and

243
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.800
Michelle: I got a really, really, really like I have a hard time with that.

244
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:52.950
Michelle: So in my state. It's hard for me to have faith. You know, because nothing in life is ever guaranteed and that's what's fun about it.

245
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.380
Michelle: Nothing.

246
00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

247
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.870

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.510
Michelle: I don't know man too much TV. I mean, I don't even know.

251
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.350
Michelle: But compared to like

252
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:29.460
Michelle: Previous generations and past year, you know, like decades. Like, I mean, the world is pretty pretty scary disease. Yeah.

253
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:30.960
Michelle: And

254
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.500
Michelle: I just don't see like how someone can just

255
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.690
Michelle: Allow it to just happen allow it.

256
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.040
Michelle: It's not right. I don't think that's right.

257
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:57.240
Michelle: I don't think that's right at all, anything stupid like if you have the power to come here right now let's do this man, cuz like she didn't write down here and

258
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.210

Michelle: It really makes me mad cuz

261
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:25.530
Michelle: That's not right. And this isn't like i mean i just don't envision my brain to constantly be stressed and worry and doubt and fear my family's gonna die.

262
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.010

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay, don't worry. It's all right.

266
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.430
Michelle: Sometimes

267
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.860
Michelle: A certain way.

268
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.320
Michelle: Don't touch it.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it, it's totally okay. Oh, back to your faith.

287
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just remember that.

288
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your faith is what you make it

289
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.670
Michelle: Yeah.

290
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.160
Michelle: I mean, I do believe that you know there's there's

291
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:15.750
Michelle: There's a higher being, and I do believe like we you know we were created, you know, for for greater things I do believe you know that this can't be it, you know, and I do believe like

292
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:29.070
Michelle: You know, just having the faith of a mustard seed is is you know more than enough.

293
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.180
Right.

294
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.680
Michelle: You know,

295
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:45.780
Michelle: And I just, you know, it's only human and natural to have fear, you know, and not to be able to 100% fully give 100% faith. You know, like, it'll be all right.

296
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.150
Michelle: You know, like that. I mean, I

297
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.640
Michelle: Feel like that's ignorant. Anyways, you know, like

298
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.540
Michelle: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

299
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.100
Michelle: But

300
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:57.900
Michelle: Yeah.

301
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's all in our perception to, you know what I mean, like,

302
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think the number one thing that we need to have faith in as herself.

303
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

304
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:17.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our ability to walk through the stuff that this world throws at us, because it can throw some pretty

305
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: crappy stuff at us.

306
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:19.980
Michelle: Right.

307
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

308
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.950
Michelle: Yeah, yeah. Right. It's pretty scary and

309
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.170
Michelle: pretty rough, man. You know, like

310
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.350
Michelle: I

311
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:52.440
Michelle: Yeah, I've seen. I mean, I know everyone has their, you know, unique story in life you know story, but I, as far as my life is concerned, I've definitely seen some some mess, Scott. Yeah.

312
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely some messed up stuff, but you're getting ready to go on this adventure and to change.

313
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So much in your life right now. You know what I mean. And

314
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.800
There's a lie.

315
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:17.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you know there's this underlying fear there, but in the same sense

316
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:23.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, being running towards that change instead of being afraid of it and saying, you know,

317
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can do this.

318
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not going to be easy because nothing in life is worth having is going to be easy.

319
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

320
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's certainly doable and

321
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, keeping your mind open to the changes that are happening and noticing the good that's going to come out of it. The Freedom from being away from your land or number one.

322
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.660
Yeah, no.

323
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, Oregon is definitely an easier state to navigate than California

324
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:04.230
Michelle: I'm hoping I'm just, I'm solely relying on my driver's license.

325
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.790
Michelle: You know having that driver's license is the most important thing

326
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

327
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:12.960
Michelle: We don't know. We don't have to be

328
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.810
Michelle: Dead. Something just hit me over.

329
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.170
Michelle: I know you're driving without a license.

330
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.490
Yeah.

331
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about dinner party and have a license.

332
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, no.

333
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.610
Michelle: No his driver's license in the state of Arizona.

334
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.240
Michelle: They won't let you serve like jail time to pay off or at least in Mojave County.

335
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

336
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:45.210
Michelle: Don't allow you to like surf jail time to pay fines and he's got finds from back when he was like

337
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:55.110
Michelle: 18 when he was caught with a flake of marijuana in a baggie because they're the zona is a no tolerance state.

338
00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:04.680
Michelle: So, you know, he's still like paying finds from, like, way back then and other finds that he's accumulated over the years and whatnot but

339
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.430
Michelle: Um,

340
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.560
Michelle: They suspended his driver's license for unpaid fine. Yeah.

341
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once he pays it they'll suspend it but it's gonna take time. Yeah.

342
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:18.390
Yeah.

343
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:25.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing that's great about Arizona is when you do finally get a driver's license. The driver's licenses for life.

344
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:38.520
Michelle: Yeah, yeah. No, I do have a, you know, I have my life and I've used it as ID and for forever. And it doesn't expire till 24

345
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:39.510
Yeah.

346
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:49.740
Michelle: Thankfully for that, you know, because I mean I've used it for ID. I mean it is valid, I either my driver's license is suspended, but

347
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.780
Michelle: I mean, I didn't know that up until

348
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:02.130
Michelle: A little while ago because I have driven. I am probably since it's been suspended.

349
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:03.750
Michelle: But

350
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

351
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That was the hardest thing for me to give up when I moved from Arizona, Oregon. And so that was the hardest thing for me to give up was my driver's license that was valid until I was 50 some odd years old you know it's like 20 year driver's license. Where the heck is that about

352
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.630
Michelle: Every time I get carted around here. They're like, is this real

353
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.740
Michelle: It's real. You want to look at

354
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me.

355
00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:48.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good, it's good. And you know what you're in a good place right now. Michelle, you know, you're even despite all of the stuff that's going on in this move that you're getting ready to embark on

356
00:34:49.290 --> 00:35:01.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're in a good headspace right now. Yeah, you're gonna have anxiety sure anybody that's in your position right now is going to have anxiety. You know, it's a lot, but you're handling it with grace.

357
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.760
Michelle: So I just

358
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:15.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You could have very well engaged in this whole back and forth in this with your landlord made things 10 times worse on you and you chose about

359
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean there's no benefit in in engaging in that stuff for you and you realize that, and you bout out of it. And so you have to give yourself credit for that.

360
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:35.130
Michelle: Yeah, now that I've looked back on it, though, too. I just feel like I just, I probably shouldn't have even said anything at all.

361
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.500
Michelle: You know, because it really didn't

362
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.820
Michelle: didn't change anything wasn't going to change anything isn't going to change anything or affect anything

363
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.640
Michelle: I should have just not have said anything at all.

364
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, we, you know, when we feel attacked the first thing that we do is, you know, react to that.

365
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I mean,

366
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In so that's a piece of it too.

367
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you didn't do, just give yourself with the credit that you deserve because you didn't continually engage in it. You backed up.

368
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And said, this is not worth my time and you know it could have gotten 10 times worse. So, you know, I just wanted to throw that out there and and you know get you to recognize that piece. You know what I mean.

369
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:22.500
Michelle: Yeah.

370
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:32.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thank you for them, you know that you do because I, I have a feeling that you're kind of like me. And when you know the minute they the door gets open, it's

371
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean you can engage in a minute and the hardest thing is stepping back and not defending your side.

372
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.530
Michelle: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. I struggle with that a lot

373
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:57.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So knowing that you're, you know, you're making these changes to respond in a manner that's appropriate and with no response.

374
00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's appropriate.

375
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.200
You know,

376
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially in a situation, even though it feels like even though it feels wrong.

377
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.580
Michelle: Right. No, I'm glad I did.

378
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.430
Hey,

379
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.700
Michelle: Yeah.

380
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:26.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now worth it. You're better than that. You know what I mean, you just gotta remember that your side of the street is clean. You didn't do anything wrong. The places and tore up

381
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

382
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.560
Michelle: Really wrong.

383
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just hold on to that.

384
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:43.080
Michelle: No, I did my consciousness clear like I'm good on that part, like, Hey, I know my dad knows, like my dad you know and and having my dad you know there to, you know,

385
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.150
Michelle: It's really

386
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.140
Michelle: That helps a lot too because

387
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.460
Sure, yeah.

388
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:58.020
Michelle: My dad's pissed off. And I feel like that's part of a huge reason why he's probably helped us out to

389
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.610
Michelle: You know, ya know, we haven't done anything wrong.

390
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh good, it's good that you have that support, you know,

391
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.380
Yeah.

392
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

393
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So embrace it a little bit.

394
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:22.410
Michelle: You're right I should. It's just hard to get out of my head. And just because everything else just piling on and

395
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know all you know all changed. Everything's going to change and another two weeks when you

396
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get away from there. There's going to be a freedom. There's also going to

397
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:45.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be a little bit of a feeling of a loss. There's also going to be a woulda shoulda coulda you know dialogue in your head, but you've got to just kind of say it is what it is.

398
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm here now.

399
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:49.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is what I'm doing.

400
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.430
Michelle: I'm worried I'm worried about what what how it how it's going to be man.

401
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.630
Michelle: A little while to be pretty run

402
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you told your dad, the predicament that you're in at this moment about paying Arizona to get your license clear

403
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:28.350
Michelle: So that you can you knows he knows and and I'm just gonna wait a little while I'm going to ask my grandma for help. Last month, when we were up there, she offered to give me $100 there. And I told her to hold on to it.

404
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:44.580
Michelle: You know, like, Hold it, hold on to it and you know because we were going to be needing it here. You know, so I'm hoping she'll still help me out with that hundred dollars and I'm hoping I can sell some stuff and come up with money on my own in

405
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.940
Michelle: But yeah

406
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.600
Michelle: That's the hope is, but

407
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:58.650
Michelle: I have to ask her for the whole amount I will this it's that's the most important thing, right, you know,

408
00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.460
Yeah.

409
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And whatever you're gonna sell get it out there on on offer up and on

410
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:05.880
Michelle: Right.

411
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, and I mean, get it out.

412
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There you

413
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:15.960
Michelle: Know I have, I have been selling stuff over the last couple months, you know, I got rid of my couch I got rid of them arise crib.

414
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:22.020
Michelle: I've gotten rid of all kinds of stuff. But I just, I kind of slowed down for a little bit there because

415
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:23.790
Michelle: You

416
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.450
Michelle: Don't want to sell it. I mean, I don't know, like for me especially like right now like I need to come up money, you know,

417
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.430
Michelle: Money so

418
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:35.700
Michelle: No need to get

419
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Jobs.

420
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is there any side jobs around there that

421
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:53.520
Michelle: I haven't seen any. I mean, I've seen people post on like the local Facebook groups, you know, like, because it's such a small town you know and and when people do post you know handyman, you know, do some looking for side job side work, you know,

422
00:40:53.910 --> 00:41:09.990
Michelle: mow your lawn, pick up your shrub whatever and and nobody ever comments on it. I've never seen anybody like yeah, you can come to my yard or, you know, I mean he is trying to get a job like at Burger King or whatever, you know, just even if it is just a week or two paychecks.

423
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:10.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

424
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:11.700
Michelle: It's a paycheck.

425
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.190
Michelle: Yeah, is trying to get a job.

426
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was just thinking like, you know, housekeeping or, you know, something that brings instant

427
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Money, you know,

428

Yeah.

429
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.370
Michelle: Yeah.

430
