00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.680
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

2
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.390
Bonnie Burset: How are you

3
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.580
Shawn Phalen: Good, how are you

4
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.420
Bonnie Burset: I'm okay hanging in there. It's funny, funny, funny, not funny, but every week. It's like seems to present

5
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:19.980
Bonnie Burset: A new level of, you know, it just was kind of like ironic that last week I guess when I guess when I talked to you before I started seeing clients for the week. So I had, I had my supervision on Fridays and in supervision, you know,

6
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:31.080
Bonnie Burset: Kind of the group was talking about you know how people are really struggling and everything, you know, with the virus everything going on. And I said, like, I don't know if it's because mostly my clients are kids like they've been doing okay.

7
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.700
Bonnie Burset: You know it. The virus hasn't kind of overtaken the other work we were doing.

8
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:50.940
Bonnie Burset: And then last week ended up being like right after I talked to you. We had that whole talk about, like, you know, the frame and keeping the frame and then the very next call I had was, like, you know, out of nowhere, kind of like suicide assessment.

9
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.410
Bonnie Burset: And then the call after that was

10
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:08.670
Bonnie Burset: A young high school to high school student I have that, you know, was telling me about, like, all of a sudden her drug use went way up like experimenting with like mixing alcohol and Xanax and I'm like, oh my god.

11
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.900
Bonnie Burset: It just was we had just talked about holding the frame and I had a really hard time like with the first client.

12
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.030
Bonnie Burset: You know, because I, I, that was a question I had for you. So it was just interesting. It was like all of a sudden

13
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.620
Bonnie Burset: I feel like with this virus, like everything that happened, it seems like with clients is like in the very beginning. It kind of felt like vacation for, like, a lot of people, they were able to be home and

14
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.450
Bonnie Burset: It was kind of a new feeling and then all of a sudden, things just started falling apart as financial worries came into the, into play and like

15
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.050
Bonnie Burset: P or people's like loneliness like triggering them just things kind of devolved and so like

16
00:02:46.770 --> 00:03:01.620
Bonnie Burset: It was like last week was just kind of working with people with kind of just like disintegration and a lot of ways. It was really challenging. And yeah, so I wanted to ask, like, because I've, I've noticed this happens before. Sometimes I've had this come up with other clients, where

17
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.790
Bonnie Burset: You know you're realizing in the session there. They're pretty depressed, you want to ask further about it. You want to do some assessment and it just kind of feels like sometimes you you know

18
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:24.570
Bonnie Burset: I wouldn't say it's a door knob comment but, like, a lot of times it kind of feels like it comes toward the very end of the session where you're kind of realizing, like how sad, someone is or kind of what is

19
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:35.730
Bonnie Burset: You know so. And in this particular case she's not particularly high risk, and so I you know wasn't overly concerned, but I was concerned enough to ask about it and

20
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.550
Bonnie Burset: You know, but then, of course, I went over time because I was I wanted to make sure I want to give her crisis information. I wanted to do some kind of safety planning.

21
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:59.070
Bonnie Burset: Which is appropriate. Like I always go over in those cases, but, you know, it just makes me aware that I just noticed my own response and I'm still working with that because I had a different client earlier this year.

22
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.380
Bonnie Burset: Where there was ideation and it went on for a while. So it was something we were frequently checking in on and I just noticed how

23
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.970
Bonnie Burset: Much that affected me like in terms of my own.

24
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.560
Bonnie Burset: You know, I'm really realizing that I have work to do in this area of like boundaries and

25
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.000
Bonnie Burset: You know, the things that kind of pull on me to

26
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:34.980
Bonnie Burset: You know, like I noticed in this conversation with this particular client. I almost felt like she was pulling for me to like fix her feelings or take them away like is, can people resolve this, and I was explaining like

27
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.060
Bonnie Burset: You know what I think about depression in terms of this combination of

28
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:51.240
Bonnie Burset: You know, because she does have her mother has depression, anxiety, so she you know I was saying, you know, I think there's a genetic component, but I, a lot of times, but there's also, you know, I believe these thoughts and feelings, these kind of

29
00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:00.870
Bonnie Burset: constructs that we have from childhood that kind of perpetuate negative thought patterns and the way we feel about ourselves and all these things and so

30
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.610
Bonnie Burset: Like, I guess my point is, I noticed there's, there's, I was hearing. There was a

31
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.890
Bonnie Burset: And I've noticed it with this particular client like I'm noticing the clients, where I tend to go over both in time and kind of my emotional energy

32
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.030
Bonnie Burset: And I'm really thinking I thought a lot about what you said about burnout and I can really see it and it's the part of me.

33
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:34.110
Bonnie Burset: I realized that because, you know, I think I've mentioned, I have two jobs like I worked for a financial firm part time. And one thing I really like about that work is it's totally emotionless

34
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.350
Bonnie Burset: And it's nice to go into that world where my dealings with clients are not evocative in any way, shape, or form.

35
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.760
Bonnie Burset: And I noticed what does kind of dream me a little bit about this work is, you know, negotiating some of these things and it's hard because I do. It's such a fine line like I I'm really, I'm seeing the parts of myself that

36
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.670
Bonnie Burset: Enjoy it. You know, I care about my clients. It's hard from an attachment perspective I do feel attached in some way.

37
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:18.930
Bonnie Burset: not overly so I don't think, but I do notice where, like, for example, with clients like her. That kind of pull on my more caretaking tendency, you know,

38
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:28.890
Bonnie Burset: They make me want to caretaker, and I'm noticing that they're the ones I'm going over time with you know crisis stuff comes up and I'm kind of really anxious and on top of it.

39
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.480
Bonnie Burset: And it's that fine line between you know her, you know, letting people you know i know it's really important to

40
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.870
Bonnie Burset: show people that they can because there's this part of them. I think that feels like they can't cope with their own feelings and

41
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:54.750
Bonnie Burset: It's really important to put it back on them in terms of, I'm not gonna, you know, I'm here to help guide you in some ways, but I'm not here to rescue you. That's okay. It's your work. It's your work. Right. And so like

42
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.490
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, like I just really thought a lot about our conversation and how

43
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:12.150
Bonnie Burset: I'm noticing. It's really hard for me, like in terms of time. Like, I'm still having a hard time with it. And I think having I was so pumped up after our talk. And like thinking of the format. And then I had her and she totally

44
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:33.660
Bonnie Burset: Totally got blown out of the water because like it ended up taking a turn. I didn't quite anticipate and yeah so I guess one question is, how do you maintain like the frame when there's that kind of crisis stuff that is hard to

45
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:41.160
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so with clients like that. So sometimes it's just a teenage girl.

46
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:51.870
Bonnie Burset: Is a someone know this is a middle age. I mean, she's like 30 ish not really middle aged which she's like 3635 or 3635

47
00:07:54.150 --> 00:08:00.000
Shawn Phalen: So sometimes the clients like that when they are

48
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.390
Struggling when they have depression when they have anxiety.

49
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:16.020
Shawn Phalen: Sometimes what happens is that, you know, you start talking and they're not really sure if

50
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.900
Shawn Phalen: I think there's a hesitancy to really talk about what's been going on.

51
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.770
Bonnie Burset: Yeah.

52
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:34.950
Shawn Phalen: So there's this warming up stage that happens and it's like you're getting door knob because they're starting

53
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:45.000
Bonnie Burset: You know it's warm up stage and then they feel comfortable to say, okay, I think. Okay, let's, there's a little bit more hair and I'm gonna I'm gonna share with you.

54
00:08:46.860 --> 00:09:01.260
Bonnie Burset: More of what's going on. And in those cases, you know, you have to assess you have yeah you know you have to. So sometimes those sessions are going to go over. Now, if there's a pattern.

55
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:10.500
Bonnie Burset: You know, if you notice a pattern that she's doing that or I starting to door knobs you at the end of every session.

56
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.320
Shawn Phalen: Then you create a session out of that.

57
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.550
Bonnie Burset: Right, I'm noticing that I eat.

58
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.810
Shawn Phalen: And towards the end of our sessions, you're sharing things that we have to discuss in depth.

59
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:33.510
Bonnie Burset: I have to as a counselor, I need to make sure the true. Okay, I need to make sure that you're not having ideations. Mm hmm. And

60
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:48.060
Bonnie Burset: And then you talk about why is she doing that she not wanting to get off the phone with you or is she want she not wanting to end the session with you. What's that about why is that happening.

61
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.380
Shawn Phalen: And then you talk about that.

62
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.430
Further with her and in the next session.

63
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:04.860
Bonnie Burset: Sometimes you're just going to have clients that are, you know, this is an unprecedented time, I think, yeah, for sure.

64
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.450
Shawn Phalen: people I think are really starting to

65
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:28.410
Bonnie Burset: They're feeling the effects of this right yeah for sure, financial, the emotional isolation. Yes, the routine is incredibly boring. When is this going to end. They don't see the life with tunnel, right, all of that creates a ton of anxiety.

66
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:45.390
Bonnie Burset: You know, and having this trapped feeling like, Am I going to have my life back again are things going to go back to normal. It's like a it's on a much bigger scale. Yeah, and how they're feeling about themselves and turn so I wouldn't be surprised.

67
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.290
As

68
00:10:47.970 --> 00:11:04.260
Bonnie Burset: As you continue to meet with clients that there's going to be more of this because, yeah, there's a lot of unanswered questions. You know, I know that you guys are you guys are really have a stay home order. Yeah, where other states.

69
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.890
Don't have it as

70
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.650
Bonnie Burset: The way you guys, the way we New York Catholic, you know, there's, it's just different across the country so

71
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.450
I mean,

72
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.670
Shawn Phalen: kids are in school.

73
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.540
Bonnie Burset: Right. Kids are home a really shitty situations. Right, right. They're not with their friends all this stuff so

74
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.370
Shawn Phalen: You know,

75
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:44.220
Shawn Phalen: Those are the kind of sessions. You just got to go. Okay, well I'm going to go over, you know, over here, I have to go over because you go over because you're assessing me and you want to make sure

76
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.260
So what we talked about last time.

77
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.620
This isn't going to happen like

78
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.310
Bonnie Burset: This might these changes aren't gonna happen for you overnight. Yeah, it's totally okay.

79
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:16.440
Bonnie Burset: This isn't just about like bringing up the awareness and bringing you know, bringing the conversation. Yeah, you know, and talking through this and, you know, looking at your the areas in your life where you're having those feelings of

80
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.470
You know,

81
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.670
Shawn Phalen: Why I'm, you know, exploring this feelings.

82
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.440
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, you know,

83
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.350
Shawn Phalen: Really looking at that.

84
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:38.280
Bonnie Burset: within yourself. Yeah, because I'm realizing you know it's a really big blind spot for me or like an issue in my work that I don't

85
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:50.100
Bonnie Burset: You know, I know how important the frame is and and and I'm getting it on such a bigger level like anxiety and containment and why it's so important and why modeling is so important and

86
00:12:50.550 --> 00:13:01.320
Bonnie Burset: It's also, you know, and also for myself for burnout as well because I can feel it. I can feel it started like I can feel you know where I'm sometimes having a hard time

87
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.700
Bonnie Burset: You know, I don't like feeling like it's I can't maintain

88
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:15.960
Bonnie Burset: You know, and especially to like with some of the sessions being video or phone like I can catch these areas where they get more casual than I'm comfortable with, or like you know where I feel I you know I

89
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:27.120
Bonnie Burset: Not, not in a way that's inappropriate but in a way that makes me aware that you know my, I don't want to reenact what's going on in people's lives with

90
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:34.260
Bonnie Burset: You know their own family relationships that may be a meshed or like whatever, like I really want to be conscious around that.

91
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:44.850
Bonnie Burset: And I keep thinking of my own, you know, I see myself kind of falling into it, or having a harder time with certain people who are kind of I feel like pulling for it a little bit.

92
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:59.610
Bonnie Burset: And I really have to check in with my like figure out like I want to work through what it you know what it is. And I think of some things, you know, I think my mom was definitely her social she was very meshing my mother.

93
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:07.980
Bonnie Burset: And and i think but I think there's also, I think I mentioned on 99.9% that my dad is like Asperger's. Right.

94
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.840
Bonnie Burset: So I didn't have a lot of attunement from him. That was a major issue. I had to work through and therapy that

95
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:23.190
Bonnie Burset: You know, he just was completely tone deaf and like emotion blind to my experiences. And that was really hard for me, like, really, really hard for me. I think as a kid.

96
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:39.960
Bonnie Burset: So I think my mom's style seemed preferable in terms of like the way you treat people are like she was a social worker actually at one point in time for a little while before she had me and then she was at home but

97
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.490
Bonnie Burset: You know, she had a very like her personality. She was definitely very, I would say codependent in terms of

98
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:55.680
Bonnie Burset: You know, that was her, you know, and I had a lot of things to work through from that, too. But I think in terms of like inner personal style.

99
00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:08.580
Bonnie Burset: I think it's set me up to kind of be so careful that I'm not sounding mean or somehow like we talked about. I got that message that like sounding giving boundaries. I don't, I don't know what

100
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.530
Shawn Phalen: Well, it's almost like over compensating for what you didn't get it.

101
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.820
Bonnie Burset: Yeah. So when you have when you have a parent that's coming just Tom def emotionally

102
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.030
Shawn Phalen: I'm not there.

103
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.590
You know this.

104
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.970
And especially as a female and a mother, you know, it's just that maternal instinct.

105
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:39.420
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, it got worse. I think that's what made it worse is returning to this work as a mother.

106
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:49.350
Bonnie Burset: You know, I took a break, a little bit of a break. I did work through one of my pregnancies was the last time I worked. And then I took are actually both pregnancies.

107
00:15:49.770 --> 00:16:02.160
Bonnie Burset: I did I was in this, but I took some time off after, you know, and now I'm like solidly in motherhood and yeah, coming back to the work after kind of being a mom, a second time. It really did.

108
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.880
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, it may it definitely

109
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.190
Bonnie Burset: Amplified it

110
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.770
Shawn Phalen: Sometimes there's clients that have learned helplessness.

111
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:25.200
Bonnie Burset: Yes, right. And so when I work with people that have learned helplessness like they'll sit there and they'll look at me like I'm supposed to fix the problem.

112
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:32.970
Bonnie Burset: Right, that's what I felt with this one particular client that kept asking me like it you know sometimes I just wonder if these feelings are

113
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:44.490
Bonnie Burset: You know, I'm never gonna they're just irresolvable they're part of me and I get it, I totally get that, but I felt almost like and she would kind of pause like as if I was gonna say

114
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:58.380
Bonnie Burset: You know, I did say yes. I think it can be worked through. But like it's work. I didn't say that quite that way. But you know, I felt like she was looking for me to fix it or take it away. That's what I felt.

115
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.900
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. And so when I have clients like that. I will spend time

116
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.350
When it's appropriate. I will. I'll spend time exploring

117
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:18.000
Shawn Phalen: What their marriage was like what their life was like, What was your relationship like with your mother.

118
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.150
For men, especially when I get that learned helplessness thing.

119
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:32.280
Bonnie Burset: relationship like with your mom. And then if they're married. Like, what's it like with your wife for women, you know,

120
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.830
Shawn Phalen: Can be either their dad or mom.

121
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:35.580
Bonnie Burset: Mm hmm.

122
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.980
Shawn Phalen: And so what I do.

123
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:47.160
Bonnie Burset: And I, and I explore that with them. And I'm like, well, who, who's the breadwinner Uh huh.

124
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.420
Shawn Phalen: You know, for instance, there's the client I work with now and I was experiencing that and

125
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:06.480
Shawn Phalen: Especially in the beginning when he first came to see me. And so I had to explore. Like, what was your relationship like with your, with your wife.

126
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:16.350
Bonnie Burset: You the breadwinner did she do everything rolling to keep everything pay the bills like

127
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.360
Bonnie Burset: And so

128
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:37.230
Shawn Phalen: And then you know when that's appropriate. I'll say, you know, as, as I've met with you as we we meet and we build our therapeutic relationship. I'm noticing that and I'm wondering if you are

129
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.230
Looking at me to fix this for you.

130
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.900
Bonnie Burset: So obviously you have to read the room. Yeah.

131
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:57.210
Shawn Phalen: No one, it's the right time to say that I really don't say that with somebody that I've just been working with a month.

132
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:19.620
Bonnie Burset: Right, we're two months. But what happens is that, you know, you're making them aware of how they're playing out their life room, which is a huge teaching experience for them. Yeah. So then, the goal is to have them start thinking about it. Mm hmm.

133
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.280
Bonnie Burset: It's like even if they get annoyed or angry, that's okay because I mean that there's probably something there. That's true.

134
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:46.560
Bonnie Burset: So why do I do that I do that because I need to point out to them that what they're doing right now is not working for them. Why as a therapist. I'm here to guide you and I'm here to make suggestions right and

135
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.190
Shawn Phalen: It's up to you if you take those suggestions.

136
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.200
Bonnie Burset: Mm hmm. And so

137
00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:02.430
Bonnie Burset: And then sometimes people like something happens on light bulb goes on. Sometimes you just kind of keep talking about it, you know.

138
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:13.110
Bonnie Burset: And you don't have to bring it up every single time you know everybody's really different. Yeah, because I feel like that's the challenge I've had with her like I've tried. I've been seeing her since.

139
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:27.990
Bonnie Burset: What month maybe like Toba of last year, maybe September, October and we felt, I think, a very good relationship in terms of, you know, being able to go places but

140
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:35.070
Bonnie Burset: I feel like she's challenged kind of insight wise or I'm not really sure if it's defensiveness around her parents or into like

141
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:46.140
Bonnie Burset: So sometimes I feel like I've hammered at the, you know, parental relationships and every once in a while. She'll kind of come up with something. It's been hard. I think for her to

142
00:20:48.810 --> 00:21:03.120
Bonnie Burset: Come up with or think or talk about areas where there's discord or anything negative, which I've noticed has been like a chat. So it's like a combination of maybe insight and low insight and

143
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:16.230
Bonnie Burset: Kind of protectiveness or something that it's been really hard to mine. Like, I know the family stuff is there and it's been really hard to get her to make those connections and to, you know, like

144
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:28.530
Bonnie Burset: To realize how they're impacting her like what, you know, even to get her to kind of connect to that, you know, even though I've tried to reflect back the things that she has brought up.

145
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:35.760
Bonnie Burset: And, you know, she originally came in to talk about a boyfriend breakup, that, you know, was really hard for her.

146
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:43.770
Bonnie Burset: And we talked about how some dynamics in his family, what parts were familiar and like you know what things about him more familiar, but it's like

147
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:52.740
Bonnie Burset: And maybe it's just slow slow work. I think with her. Is that like she'll you know make a.in the moment you'll connect the dots and then it kind of

148
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.910
Bonnie Burset: It doesn't have a lasting doesn't have that light bulb moment. So it's kind of like, you know,

149
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:09.420
Bonnie Burset: And sometimes plants can't make the connection to their parents because they're very defended around it. It's like I feel like that.

150
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:17.160
Bonnie Burset: And it's like if if this if this my idea of my parents crumbles, where am I, yeah.

151
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.140
Bonnie Burset: Where does that put me. You know, it's quite literally like she

152
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:33.540
Bonnie Burset: Works for her dad, she works in her dad's company, she is still very like I would say for a woman, her age. Very Ashton in just practical terms with her family and

153
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:39.690
Bonnie Burset: She's just now trying. I mean, she does live on our own, but she's just now trying to kind of set more boundaries with them and

154
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:50.010
Bonnie Burset: You know, just because she feels like it's appropriate, you know, and she doesn't want them to be her own, but she's really struggled in like in her personal relationships to

155
00:22:50.430 --> 00:23:03.900
Bonnie Burset: Like one issue we've dealt a lot with. And this is where this whole crisis has really impacted her is just her sense of loneliness. She has just a really I think what she realized and is that

156
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:14.730
Bonnie Burset: This depression that what I'm saying is, depression, the symptoms, she was talking about, you know, preceded her breakup proceeded this crisis have always been there.

157
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:21.900
Bonnie Burset: And like I think she's getting to that deeper level of, like, you know what I've noticed is she doesn't like herself very much and

158
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:32.010
Bonnie Burset: She's definitely like, you know, had really a lot of trouble and interpersonal relationships and therefore has felt. That's why the one relationship. She had was so significant.

159
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:41.430
Bonnie Burset: And, you know, we're getting to these kind of deeper layers. I feel like of loneliness and you know how, but yet how

160
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:56.520
Bonnie Burset: All her relationships are kind of lonely, because there's like a distance. They're not genuine there's we've talked about her. Her need or her what's lacking. And so many of these situations is genuineness, you know, like it's

161
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:07.710
Bonnie Burset: Distant it's there but not there, you know. So what's probably happening for her is that she feels a connection with you and she feels you're genuine

162
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.260
Bonnie Burset: You're probably the only person in her life that

163
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:15.780
Is like that.

164
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.140
So she's

165
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.210
You know the

166
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.560
Shawn Phalen: The work is to

167
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:34.620
Bonnie Burset: Maintain those boundaries about her. Yeah, totally. Because she's going to want to become in mashed with you because that's

168
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.370
Bonnie Burset: That's what I'm feeling and she's always tested that to you know like when I think back

169
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:49.350
Bonnie Burset: You know she's always someone I struggle with going over time because she'll kind of be talking and then. She'll. She'll I noticed. She'll ask more

170
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:56.130
Bonnie Burset: personal questions about me than most people do. And I don't I'm pretty good at never like I never

171
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:06.900
Bonnie Burset: Um, there's certain things. I think you come naturally to me in terms of like I'm a very private person in general. I'm very open, but I'm very private at the same time. So like it's not hard for me to

172
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.240
Bonnie Burset: Win the context isn't right, like with my clients. I never disclosed very much about my life at all.

173
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:19.140
Bonnie Burset: But I noticed. She'll. She'll ask me, she'll try like she'll try to engage me on a friendship level.

174
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:34.800
Bonnie Burset: Which is interesting to me, like, I've always noticed that as kind of what I've identified this kind of like in a matching style, a little bit or just boundary confusion about what my role is and who you know what our relationship is her

175
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.610
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's, it's a lot of boundary confusion for her, you know,

176
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.350
Bonnie Burset: Yeah boundaries, she's working on those boundaries. Right.

177
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.740
Shawn Phalen: So it's like constantly setting those boundaries for her.

178
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.810
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and

179
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.160
Bonnie Burset: You know, sometimes self disclosure can be very

180
00:25:54.210 --> 00:26:03.420
Bonnie Burset: Helpful. You know sometimes people have therapists have their own different styles. Some yes therapists obviously don't disclose much at all.

181
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.820
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think as you gain more experience like yeah

182
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.470
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

183
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:20.670
Bonnie Burset: So yeah, right. You can naturally kind of find where the what in the moment might be actually therapeutically useful.

184
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:28.170
Bonnie Burset: And what is not, you know, like, I'll kind of talk around things like if I have experienced with certain things I'll kind of

185
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:35.820
Bonnie Burset: Make it reference to having experienced, but I don't kind of get into what or why it is or, you know, I feel like

186
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:47.790
Bonnie Burset: Ironically, it would seem like that part would be hard for me or but it's not that part is like, okay, I feel like kind of gauging. You know what's appropriate or what's you know what could be therapeutically

187
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.160
Bonnie Burset: useful or not.

188
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.290
Shawn Phalen: And I mean I'm be kind of curious as to, like, why, you know,

189
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:03.900
Shawn Phalen: Why she feel like what's the importance of asking you, personal questions like why

190
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:16.140
What's that about you know what's. Is it just if it relates to the conversation if it's

191
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.830
Applicable

192
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.950
Bonnie Burset: It's kind of out of left field. Mm hmm. You know, and

193
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.560
Shawn Phalen: Like what does she asked

194
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:37.980
Bonnie Burset: Oh yeah, I mean, nothing, nothing inappropriate but I feel I it's not so much personal questions, but I feel like she's tried to

195
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:52.230
Bonnie Burset: And I, you know, and all it's it's hard because I don't know how much is her and it is a normal human tendency, I think, like, especially people who have not, although she has been in therapy for many years, but like

196
00:27:52.650 --> 00:28:04.530
Bonnie Burset: People who are have not been in therapy for example are new to the type of relationship that it is. So sometimes, you know, I just feel like at the beginning or ending of sessions. She'll be very casual with me as if we're good friends.

197
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:15.990
Bonnie Burset: And to to give you some sense like she actually knows my supervisor. They went to college together and she was able to give me insight, kind of on her that, you know, when

198
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.810
Bonnie Burset: In her talking to me about my supervisor. She kind of indicates like a really close friends.

199
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:33.720
Bonnie Burset: And then I talked to my supervisor. She's like I barely know or we went to college together but like I see her social media or whatever. But we're not, we don't we don't spend time together. We don't talk on the phone. We don't

200
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:44.550
Bonnie Burset: And that's a confusion. She has in general with she's very into social media and there's like this distance, kind of, she's very confused about intimacy, I think, and like what

201
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.370
Shawn Phalen: Just what a genuine relationship is like a

202
00:28:47.370 --> 00:29:03.510
Bonnie Burset: Correct way a genuine friendship is and I think right. I think that's why she's, she's you know asking those questions and you know making statements like a really good friends and you know there's yeah

203
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:15.450
Bonnie Burset: So she's somebody want to keep boundaries. Right. Just a heads up yeah you know she's somebody that I'm

204
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:28.890
Bonnie Burset: Because when you're doing that, you're obviously modeling. Yes. Right. Right. And I think it's interesting, like I just have to say like, because I was in therapy for a long

205
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:35.580
Bonnie Burset: I was in therapy for like at least 10 years when I was in you know how to college and

206
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:44.670
Bonnie Burset: I, you know, looking back on my therapist. I think one thing that I remember feeling was that I felt like

207
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:56.010
Bonnie Burset: She was kind of not always very attuned to me. But now I look back and I don't think it was that she had boundaries and it was very unfamiliar to me.

208
00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:13.830
Bonnie Burset: To have someone care about me, obviously, and have some level of attachment to care about like my life and me and be engaged, you know, to a certain degree, but also be so distant and not distant, but to be so neutral in a certain way or like

209
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:21.570
Bonnie Burset: So boundary. This is the only way because she was very good. And she taught me a lot about that. I'm not using it the way I should be but like

210
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:30.810
Bonnie Burset: I think she did model for me a lot of ethically what i i think she was very solid in terms of the way that she conducted therapy and it taught me a lot.

211
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:40.890
Bonnie Burset: Yeah. Later, when I understood it, but at the time it felt kind of cold to me or not totally cold, but just

212
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:48.960
Bonnie Burset: Not warm and fuzzy, you know, but that's because I was unfamiliar with it, you know, and I think I can picture.

213
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.680
Bonnie Burset: You know now as I kind of I struggle with that from the other side of it is realizing, like, you know,

214
00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:04.530
Bonnie Burset: And I, and I think there can be an in between, like, it's kind of interesting because in my supervision, there's one other intern that works for my supervisor and her style is very like

215
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.400
Bonnie Burset: She's very direct. She doesn't struggle so much with boundaries.

216
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:23.280
Bonnie Burset: And like, you know, the other intern is very like attachment based very warm and fuzzy like she's very nurturing kind of as a person and like you know it's just. And so what's interesting to me is I learned from like

217
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:33.030
Bonnie Burset: I feel like I'm in the middle or where I want to be as in the middle that you can both be direct and boundaries and and not, you know, not

218
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.730
Bonnie Burset: You know,

219
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:43.980
Bonnie Burset: Because I see that the the pros and cons of each like it was interesting and supervision. They were both talking about kind of their struggles with

220
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.120
Bonnie Burset: You know my supervisor. We're saying for her sometimes like

221
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:57.510
Bonnie Burset: Because she kind of encourages us to be bold and put, you know, be direct people you know if it doesn't stick. It doesn't stick. You know, there's no harm in kind of

222
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:14.010
Bonnie Burset: Confronting things as they are. It can be very, you know, we were in particular, talking about my colleagues borderline patient, she was saying talking a lot about you know how being direct and is really important. You know, and

223
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:25.080
Bonnie Burset: Then she was saying, you know, the downside to her style is that, you know, sometimes the timing and the landing is off because you know she will sometimes be maybe

224
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:31.230
Bonnie Burset: Direct and it you know maybe she needs the softer touch at certain times with certain clients and

225
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:42.390
Bonnie Burset: You know, whereas the other colleague was saying, you know, like she realizes that maybe she's been reenacting something with the borderline client by kind of also walking on eggshells around some of the issues.

226
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.430
Bonnie Burset: That she's having like other people in her life are doing because they it's so hard to be direct with her.

227
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:59.370
Bonnie Burset: And so it's really interesting because it makes me think kind of where do I want to be. And I feel like I'm somewhere in the middle. Probably closer to the other intern, but I'd like to be i'd like to be in the middle, I think.

228
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.960
Bonnie Burset: There's a way to both hold

229
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:13.080
Bonnie Burset: Like honesty and confrontation and the usefulness of that and and directness and boundaries, of course, along with

230
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:32.430
Bonnie Burset: You know in in a warm way. I think it can be. I agree. A nerd. There can be a nurturing way to be direct. You know, I don't think it has to be kind of. That's my goal. But I realized, you know, sometimes I get pulled in and certainly certain clients are more especially when I noticed my

231
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:43.410
Bonnie Burset: Anxiety is activated, like so. After this client, then I did have the teenage girl who I think all the anxiety everything going on. And she's having a lot of conflict with her mom.

232
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:51.870
Bonnie Burset: You know, was acting out a lot experiment experimentation wise and like whenever i know i and then I noticed myself, kind of, and I

233
00:33:52.140 --> 00:34:01.140
Bonnie Burset: Feel like in the past I've done a really good job with her not being her mom being very like, you know, doing the motivational interviewing not kind of

234
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.480
Bonnie Burset: You know, taking a very different role about like these are your choices. You know, and

235
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:20.160
Bonnie Burset: But I felt myself, you know, having a harder time. Like, I don't think I did too badly. I don't think I went way until like mom mode, like I get. It's hard. It's really hard when you're like, and the same with suicide.

236
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:27.540
Bonnie Burset: Or ideation. You know when that part of me gets activated, it's hard for like me not to go into mom mode and

237
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:41.400
Bonnie Burset: But, and yet I know that's not helpful. And so it's like, like you said, the changes don't happen overnight. Like, I know where I want to go. I'm seeing where I have some challenges that I

238
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:47.430
Bonnie Burset: Want to work through like Ken and I think maybe a lot of it has to do with how I see myself and

239
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:56.340
Bonnie Burset: It's hard, like for example I did give that client extra time and I did do a check in with her after the other, because I had to get off to go to the other clients. So we were finishing up the assessment.

240
00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:03.810
Bonnie Burset: And so I said, you know, I'll just give you a call back, you know, to check in, if that's that's a. Would you like me to call you back to check and she said yes and

241
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:16.500
Bonnie Burset: We did only stay on for short of a few minutes, and she was really grateful and maybe so maybe that's an example of their times to be flexible when it's appropriate. You know, there's, you know, it's not cut and dry.

242
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.260
Shawn Phalen: It's not cut and dry, you know,

243
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:29.700
Shawn Phalen: Because every client is really different their needs are different why they're coming to therapy is different, you know, sometimes teenagers do need you to be that mother figure

244
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.990
Bonnie Burset: Other figure with healthy boundary is

245
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.930
Bonnie Burset: You know,

246
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:50.580
Bonnie Burset: Looking to be in MASH where I think you need, you know, especially teenagers that don't have parents that are available emotionally parents. They even right

247
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.820
Bonnie Burset: Now they know they need. They're trying to they're seeking normalcy.

248
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:10.110
Bonnie Burset: Sometimes it takes being like asking those questions, like right well because I did have, I felt like I have some obligation to say, you know, like or or

249
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:26.100
Bonnie Burset: You know I'm concerned, you know, I trust that she only took one Xanax fine but i mean you know I'm concerned with mixing the two because it's really hard to know, you know, that is a fatal combination and I was honest about it. I said that can be fatal.

250
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:39.780
Bonnie Burset: And I, and I would have said you know that your behavior is concerning I am yeah I did say that what you're doing, let's think about this. Yeah, a

251
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:49.500
Bonnie Burset: Lot of psycho education yeah know that mixing that stuff right but they don't know now is that

252
00:36:51.300 --> 00:37:07.710
Bonnie Burset: They're buying pills these pills are are are mixed with Fenton on. Right, right, that are really, really not good. You don't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Totally. So, you know,

253
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:15.060
Bonnie Burset: And that kind of conversation is very appropriate. Yeah. I am really

254
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:25.170
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, yeah. Because I feel like you know there's a point at which you know it's not about being a mom, you know, there's an obligation to provide psycho education when

255
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:45.780
Bonnie Burset: You know, like it. Is it risky. It is high risk behavior, you know, very any kind of pills. Today I treat that as a very high risk behavior, very, very high like this is not something to mess around with. Yeah, I've had the conversation to let some of my clients that

256
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:52.080
Bonnie Burset: I said your drug dealers, not your friend right your customer, right.

257
00:37:52.710 --> 00:38:00.720
Bonnie Burset: And for every customer that's standing behind you. There's 20 more standing on right but you get it. Yeah, there's a long right

258
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.440
Bonnie Burset: Right, so they're not they're not your friends. Right, right.

259
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.350
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, I'm super, super direct with them about that one. Yeah.

260
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:22.920
Bonnie Burset: Let's be really let's have a really honest conversation here. Yeah, yeah. So

261
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:39.930
Bonnie Burset: It's not cookie cutter. Yeah. Yeah. Because I felt like, you know, after all that, I mean, I gave myself a break. But I felt like, well, we like we just had that talk. I was so amped to do things different. And then it did it just

262
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:42.780
Bonnie Burset: It's one of those nights.

263
00:38:44.160 --> 00:39:02.670
Bonnie Burset: Thing. It takes time and what you have is awareness which yeah and so those two things you there on your side yeah you awareness to what's happening. You know where you are. You know how you're feeling, you know, you're activated.

264
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.700
Bonnie Burset: There are really, really good signs.

265
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.000
Bonnie Burset: It just takes time to develop your it takes time to develop your style.

266
00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.470
Bonnie Burset: Learn how to be direct

267
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:33.960
Bonnie Burset: It takes time to learn how to set those boundaries. Sometimes that needs to be set. You know I've said this before, you know, this is all like very learning. We're learning. We're constantly learning. Yeah, stop learning in this field.

268
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:41.580
Bonnie Burset: Just you just don't see it as long as you have that awareness. It's okay.

269
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.890
Bonnie Burset: Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Yeah.

270
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:59.730
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, because I feel like there's some part of me that you know now that I know kind of so much about why it's so important. Because I think when I was just starting out, like, is this an I am still just starting out in a lot of ways, but

271
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:08.610
Bonnie Burset: You know, when I was still a student and like just, you know, became an intern, you know, and even as a trainee like I kind of felt like

272
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:16.560
Bonnie Burset: You know, I didn't pay as much attention to these finer points of of it. And as I'm going along. And I'm like, I'm seeing, you know,

273
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:26.700
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, I know it's it's not good. You know, in terms of both for myself and for my clients. And so I think the more I'm aware of it, the more I'm like, Well, I don't want to be a bad

274
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:34.800
Shawn Phalen: You know when we're in school and we're starting hours to get through the session.

275
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:51.120
Bonnie Burset: Oh yeah, that's true. I didn't think I would ever continue my first session. I was so overcome with anxiety, just like performance anxiety that and I had a case that was, she was taught like she was, she

276
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:03.180
Bonnie Burset: I, I, I, yeah, I think she was bipolar. But she was on the sheet. The diagnosis was not completely anyway. It doesn't matter.

277
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:17.670
Bonnie Burset: But like I was so nervous with her and like you know it just, it's so interesting to think about my very first client because you know you have all these like plans or tools like I'm going to do it. We're going to do a timeline to get all these things and like

278
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.840
Bonnie Burset: You have to be so flexible in this work because, you know, anything you think you're going to do. And then it becomes about well, is this

279
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.220
Bonnie Burset: What are they bringing to the, you know, because really therapeutically i mean

280
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:39.990
Bonnie Burset: It's not an issue if it's not an issue and, you know, we kind of it is client driven. So it's like, I can't have my agenda of like, well, I like to do this tool or this technique, but it doesn't

281
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:51.150
Bonnie Burset: So yeah, I think I feel like, you know, when I look back to, then I know I've learned a lot, but I feel like I'm still yeah I'm definitely still learning. Sometimes I feel like

282
00:41:52.140 --> 00:42:03.420
Bonnie Burset: I, you know, I'm still a baby in this, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, only been six years. But, you know, and intermittent, you know, I took time off my kid. So probably more like for

283
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:11.070
Bonnie Burset: You know, but yeah, it takes a lifetime. It's a lot of learning and just yeah I think learning my style and I really have to work out.

284
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.190
Bonnie Burset: I have to work through

285
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:28.590
Bonnie Burset: Letting go of the feelings. I have when I set a boundary like like worrying that a mean or weren't, you know, like I have to put myself first and the healthy way and

286
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.620
Bonnie Burset: Sometimes I get out of practice with that. And then I'm like, I like all see the time

287
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:47.430
Bonnie Burset: I i know i want to stop a client. I know we, you know, I know I can say, you know, we're out of time or no let's pick this up next time. And then I'll it'll kind of like end up being like

288
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:58.350
Bonnie Burset: Well, they're almost done. I'll wait till they they're just about it. But then it's like, you know, and it's like I'm not, you know, I have to get rid of that are like work through that feeling of

289
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:06.960
Bonnie Burset: There's this fear that I'm abandoning them and it's so wacky

290
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.440
Right, so

291
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:23.190
Shawn Phalen: Well, okay. So you've identified you've identified it. So there's some kind of possibly some kind of abandonment within you.

292
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.710
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, that, you know,

293
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.130
That's

294
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:35.550
Shawn Phalen: Activating you that's, you know, coming up for you in the room.

295
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.950
Um,

296
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.720
But here's the thing is like

297
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.710
Shawn Phalen: You can't overcompensate

298
00:43:46.800 --> 00:44:04.860
Bonnie Burset: Right, because they know it. Right, right, right. And that's the other thing like as we're talking I'm remembering or thinking about is, like, you have to assume that anybody who walks into your office is probably going to have issues with boundaries, one way or another. Either you know

299
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:23.370
Bonnie Burset: Very rarely too rigid and my experience. But, you know, sometimes, and sometimes too so you know that's something that you have to assume people are going to be testing you all the time like not intentionally not you know it's part of their why they're there, you know, but

300
00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:33.000
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think I have to kind of go in kind of being ready for that a little bit that you know like

301
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:45.300
Bonnie Burset: The door knob comments are going to happen continuously. It's going to happen a lot with a lot of people, there's going to be people maybe trying to get more time or more. Whatever, I don't know what

302
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.120
Bonnie Burset: Questions. Do you feel

303
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.980
Shawn Phalen: Like you're in control of the session

304
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.000
Um,

305
00:44:52.620 --> 00:45:00.480
Bonnie Burset: Well, part of it, like we talked about and which is why I was so bombed. I didn't really have a chance to implement as well. It's easier with the kids because it's a different

306
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:09.900
Bonnie Burset: You know I am. I do feel more in control with them because they're, they did there is like a more structured, but I think part of it and you pointed it out very, I mean,

307
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:18.510
Bonnie Burset: You telling me your example helped me to identify I'm missing structure like it was very helpful for me to hear kind of how you structure.

308
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:32.340
Bonnie Burset: Because I'm kind of free flowing. So, like, I don't have a set plan when we sit down, we kind of pick up on themes from the week before and I kind of go with what's been going on. So, yeah, no, it's fluid. So, at the end, they're still talking and like you know

309
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:43.320
Bonnie Burset: We don't have that kind of winding down. I'm kind of interspersed like throughout the conversation I'm putting in my you know observations or insight, you know,

310
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:56.820
Bonnie Burset: Thing reflection or you know whatever and suggestions, maybe ideas of work that they can do throughout the throughout the session, but then it leaves it kind of nebulous vague.

311
00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:06.870
Bonnie Burset: No beginning there's no end. This is what I do for clients that that are like that, and they just kind of, they just kind of their

312
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:25.170
Shawn Phalen: Little bit rambling and they're all over the place. And they're just sort of not very organized in their thought process and they just have a lot, say, you know, it's like, Can I interject. And I'll say, okay, well, what are you doing, like, how are you, what are your coping skills around that.

313
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.520
Bonnie Burset: That's very good. I'm gonna write that down.

314
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:42.600
Bonnie Burset: Is it it is number one, it slows them down. Right. And then, what it does is it it's putting it on them. I'm asking them. Well, what are you doing

315
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:59.550
For that what is the coping skill that you are using. And then they have to think so, it slows them down. It gets them thinking and then they answer you, and typically they're going to go only give you maybe one thing

316
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:08.010
Bonnie Burset: And then you can talk about. Okay. That's, yeah, that's a great way to do it. And have you have you

317
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.440
Anything else that you've tried

318
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:19.890
Let's think of one other thing that you can try. It's going to help you when you start feeling like this.

319
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:36.660
Bonnie Burset: Huh, that's really good. I'd like how that I really like how that moves it from kind of inaction and vagueness to like a sense of personal responsibility and also like an action item associated

320
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:43.380
Shawn Phalen: With it, because it takes away that kind of like everything is just kind of, you know, like

321
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:55.980
Out there, you know, like, okay, it's I kind of how I talked about last time where they come in, they tell you what's going on, you let them talk and then you just say okay so now

322
00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:08.640
Bonnie Burset: What are you doing, what are some cooking skills that you're using. And then, what, what happens is then the third like the remainder of the session like so what you've done is you've gained control.

323
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:11.760
And control the session.

324
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.660
Shawn Phalen: You've asked them a question.

325
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:18.480
You put it back on them.

326
00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:31.380
Bonnie Burset: Ask them to respond like what are you doing, they tell you something, and then you as therapists can expand on that. Let's try. Let's think of one more thing you can do

327
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:48.180
Bonnie Burset: And and then it just you know if there's more conversation that needs to be had around it. Like if they say, Well, you know, I've tried this and this doesn't work. And I said, then don't do that. If it doesn't work, don't do it. Let's

328
00:48:49.650 --> 00:49:08.670
Bonnie Burset: Do because really what it is is like, you know, we are not only listening to what's going on for them, but it's it's also we're giving them suggestions around coping skills and we're helping them explore things that will help them to make help them feel better. Right, right.

329
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:15.690
Shawn Phalen: That's always when I'm at the end of the session that is always my goal is to say, okay,

330
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.540
What are you going to do, let's talk about what you're going to do.

331
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:45.060
Bonnie Burset: And sometimes you'll have clients that won't do anything right. Nothing where I maybe have a session around why that is. Mm hmm. And then you have the clients that will kind of do it off and on. And then you have clients that will do it. And those are the ones that actually progress.

332
00:49:46.260 --> 00:50:01.890
Bonnie Burset: Like you're always having to change to talk about, like, Okay, how's that working for you, why are you doing it. What's the barrier that kind of thing. So I think you don't get stuck in this like you don't want them get stuck insane, nothing works. Right, right.

333
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:11.070
Bonnie Burset: Right. Right. And I do like the action piece because I feel like where I kind of like feel at home is, you know,

334
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:28.260
Bonnie Burset: I really like kind of identifying patterns and themes and kind of like, you know, the roots of things and attachment and kind of looking at all that. But then sometimes you realize like, you know, so I've been thinking a lot lately, my little meditation. My mindfulness walks with my stroller.

335
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:43.260
Bonnie Burset: You know about like different angles we take in therapy in terms of what we choose to focus on, you know, like, and I thought of it in terms of like the what the why though, you know, the how and sometimes like it's really easy.

336
00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:50.820
Bonnie Burset: I think is therapist to get caught up in like the roots of things and the why, you know, and there's a place for that.

337
00:50:51.300 --> 00:51:01.110
Bonnie Burset: But there's also a place for the how and the what, you know, like, like I could see with this particular client, especially because the insight is slow and it's going to be a

338
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:10.680
Bonnie Burset: breadcrumb thing with her that I kind of left aside from assessment. I mean of course that was appropriate in this situation, but

339
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:19.110
Bonnie Burset: You know, we kind of left her with all these crappy feelings and we didn't really have. I mean other than I did encourage her to re evaluate her meds situation.

340
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:32.670
Bonnie Burset: But there it kind of wasn't a what and and i think that action piece is really important for all the reasons you said, and part of it too is getting clients to buy in, especially clients like her.

341
00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:48.930
Bonnie Burset: That or maybe have a secret wish that someone else will fix it or take it away from her, that there's a piece that kind of reading nights their end of the deal and their ownership of the situation and and

342
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:58.830
Bonnie Burset: That they're not kind of the victim of their feelings, you know, they're in control of their feelings and especially you know the rest will take time.

343
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:04.230
Shawn Phalen: And, you know, especially for her because she said, will I always feel

344
00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.010
Bonnie Burset: Right.

345
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:07.380
Shawn Phalen: My always going to feel like this, right.

346
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:07.800
Bonnie Burset: Right.

347
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:11.820
Shawn Phalen: There was somebody like her. You're gonna want to say

348
00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:14.100
Bonnie Burset: Oh, maybe

349
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:16.230
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

350
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.830
Shawn Phalen: Like with her, you're gonna want to end the sessions with

351
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:34.440
Shawn Phalen: Mm hmm. Okay. Because what you're wanting to do is you're wanting to let her know that she's in full control of her life.

352
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:34.950
Bonnie Burset: Right.

353
00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:39.900
Shawn Phalen: And that hurt her choices she has she has choices.

354
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.300
Bonnie Burset: That her choices can can make her happy create that happy.

355
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:57.900
Bonnie Burset: We work for we we have to sometimes work for happiness. Yeah, what you're doing is the goal is to get her self worth, and self esteem up to where she is.

356
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.430
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you know what I can to this suggestion.

357
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.360
Bonnie Burset: This is run

358
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:10.920
Bonnie Burset: Be five hours, you know, it's something right, the very right breathing taking a walk.

359
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:17.100
Shawn Phalen: Like you start out very simple like it's it's not everyone thinks that has to be complicated.

360
00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.610
Bonnie Burset: Right, it's not doesn't have to be so.

361
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.550
Shawn Phalen: Somebody like her. That's her you're gonna wanna

362
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:33.960
Bonnie Burset: Like in those just really connects with me because one thing I didn't realize that kind of frustrated me because I mean it doesn't frustrate me huge you know

363
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:43.230
Bonnie Burset: Hugely but now I'm kind of piecing together what it is that she will often come into session every session kind of has the same flavor of

364
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:57.570
Bonnie Burset: Oh yeah, you know, nothing's really changing same week same feelings about my ex, you know, and it's kind of, you know, you do notice your counter transference like God. That's annoying.

365
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:07.860
Bonnie Burset: The major way. I mean, I like her, you know, it's not. I understand where she is. But, you know, but at the same time that that's a big part of it that it allows

366
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.040
Bonnie Burset: There's a piece of this because I kept thinking

367
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:19.560
Bonnie Burset: And I tried talking to my supervisor about it, I think, is like what because I always think about with with people's behaviors. What is the payoff here.

368
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:26.850
Bonnie Burset: What are they getting out of staying stuck. What is the starkness about like she's very stuck feeling all you know that's been the theme.

369
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:38.640
Bonnie Burset: Is and I'm like what is that about, but now I think I'm getting it, that it is. I think there's a huge part about staying stuck, which is about not taking responsibility for

370
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.630
Bonnie Burset: Where

371
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:42.360
Shawn Phalen: We're live. There's her right

372
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:52.320
Bonnie Burset: Yes, right through with her. Her parents that learned helplessness and you don't want it to start serving having that that be

373
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.600
Shawn Phalen: Your relationship with her.

374
00:54:54.630 --> 00:55:02.970
Bonnie Burset: Right and how she doesn't have to work in therapy there because the client that's just, it's the same thing.

375
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:12.000
Shawn Phalen: Over every time we meet with her. It's the same thing. And so she's if she is interested in sometimes going to clients that

376
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.700
Bonnie Burset: Don't want to make those changes. Yeah. You know, so

377
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:26.070
Shawn Phalen: But at least this way you'll be able to kind of, it gives you, you can explore it on a different level.

378
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:38.520
Bonnie Burset: Right you explore it by putting the responsibility on her right because that's, I think that's the feeling that kind of annoyed me now that I think about it is that she was always putting it out there and

379
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.710
Bonnie Burset: Kind of the implied message or question. I took from it is like

380
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:51.060
Bonnie Burset: Because I found myself questioning why am I not effective as therapy not working, you know, because she would kind of keep putting it out there like

381
00:55:51.420 --> 00:56:02.010
Bonnie Burset: About how things never change how stuck. She is kind of like, and I would find myself wondering maybe she's not going to come back because she's gonna feel like this isn't working, you know, like

382
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:07.560
Shawn Phalen: And then, you know, and then it can become a conversation. What are you doing,

383
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:25.620
Bonnie Burset: When right but have you done that, you know, to elicit this changes that you want you to write about how you wanted to feel we've talked about how you're not happy with relationships that you had, you know, whatever. You know what I'm saying.

384
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.350
So,

385
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:33.180
You just putting it back on her in a really nice gentle way.

386
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:40.860
Bonnie Burset: And I think that'll help me. Overall, because I think about even small things like at the end of our conversation the check in.

387
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:50.520
Bonnie Burset: I said, Oh, like, yeah, I'm sure there's groups out there online right now with everything going on like support groups for people who are feeling really isolated. I'm sure there's a lot out there.

388
00:56:50.970 --> 00:57:05.100
Bonnie Burset: And then immediately, and this is something I typically do that. I don't want to do is all kind of say, Oh, I can look into that and get back to you and I don't have time for that. And I'm like, why would I do that. Why do I say that, you know, and it's like

389
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.870
Bonnie Burset: So you have an example.

390
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.220
Bonnie Burset: You're putting your work on yourself and you're taking work away from her, which is right.

391
00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:24.990
Bonnie Burset: Right, you're wanting to be helpful, you're wanting to help her, but I don't ever do that.

392
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.310
Shawn Phalen: Unless they're in my office and they say, hey, can we can we look at this, I am

393
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.940
Bonnie Burset: Gather why we're doing it together.

394
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:35.610
Bonnie Burset: And then it's like, okay, but then

395
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:46.380
Bonnie Burset: And then you might have to keep saying, look at this meetings. Look at those meetings and she doesn't do it. What's the barrier, right. What's a lot of stuff like

396
00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.480
Shawn Phalen: You might have a lot of session.

397
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:49.860
Shawn Phalen: What's

398
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.500
Shawn Phalen: The barrier. What's the barrier. Right.

399
00:57:52.920 --> 00:58:07.890
Shawn Phalen: Burial she she her barriers are kind of cemented into her right now. And so it's going to take. It's going to, and it's going to be uncomfortable for her to start doing these things for herself.

400
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:10.200
Bonnie Burset: Yes. Right. Right.

401
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.230
Bonnie Burset: Never she's never had to do that ever bright, she just happened.

402
00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:28.320
Shawn Phalen: And that's why her relationships with men don't work out either because after point in time she's probably looking at them to do you know like pick up that slack for her make her

403
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:34.410
Bonnie Burset: By, you know, like, yeah, so it all happens that way. You know, so yeah.

404
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.590
Shawn Phalen: Alright, so let's reschedule for now.

405
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:37.890
