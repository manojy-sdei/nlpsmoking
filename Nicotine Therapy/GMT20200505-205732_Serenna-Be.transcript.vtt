00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.450
Serenna Beers: Hi there.

2
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:07.350
Hi, sir.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.269
Serenna Beers: How are you

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.219
Carol Hampton: I'm okay, how are you

5
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.179
Yeah.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.950
Serenna Beers: Pretty good. You, you look like you might feel a little better today inside your face. You don't look you look a little better than I saw you at the last meeting.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.260
Carol Hampton: Yeah, I put on makeup.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.690
Carol Hampton: But I am feeling better, my paint kind of taking a break right now.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.090
Serenna Beers: Oh, that's wonderful.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.770
Carol Hampton: Yeah, it's really nice.

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.460
Carol Hampton: Yeah.

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:53.310
Serenna Beers: Well, why don't you just check check in with me and tell me what's just been going on and what I really want to hear about is maybe maybe what's working for you. And then I'd like to hear about what isn't. And then what types of things that I can, I can be of help with you on

13
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.040
Carol Hampton: Well, what's working is is that I stay on top of my medicine better

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.320
Carol Hampton: Okay, and

15
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:15.090
Carol Hampton: I don't overdo it. Because sometimes when my pain level drops. I like, Oh, I can do this and this and this.

16
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.520
Carol Hampton: And I can't. I really can't.

17
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.900
Carol Hampton: So I finally accepted it and I'm not doing as much physical stuff anymore.

18
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.820
Carol Hampton: And

19
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.070
Carol Hampton: What doesn't work is stress, of course.

20
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.120
Serenna Beers: Tell me the kinds of things that you stress about I can probably guess one of them but sides, the whole

21
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.410
Serenna Beers: I guess order that our world is in. But what what types of things do you struggle with.

22
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.680
Carol Hampton: I server with my husband. Okay. And my daughter and her baby live here.

23
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.150
Serenna Beers: That's right. Okay.

24
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.560
Carol Hampton: And then the baby, she's two years old and she barely speak so I've been really worried about it.

25
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.460
Mm hmm.

26
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.820
Carol Hampton: But they said that if we got a therapist, they would just sit and talk to her.

27
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.600
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm. And so we do that.

28
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:35.940
Carol Hampton: But I'm concerned about that a lot where she could start talking. But I know she knows she formed a sentence, you know. So I think sometimes it's just in her blood. Her dad's quiet her grandma's quiet so

29
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.640
Carol Hampton: It may be just that.

30
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.440
Carol Hampton: Yeah. Yeah, the thing is, is I tend to

31
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.880
Carol Hampton: Let the past get to me a little too much.

32
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.850
Serenna Beers: say a little more about that, like, specifically what what what parts of what parts of the past.

33
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.980
Carol Hampton: Well, I have three sisters blood sisters, I call them and they like to attack me

34
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.960
Carol Hampton: And

35
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.770
Carol Hampton: One of them right now.

36
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.590
Carol Hampton: Is trying to do anything she can to get around what you know i've blocked everything and

37
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:43.440
Carol Hampton: I get a invitation from her side, who I don't even know. And I so psycho. This is from her. This is for Linda, so I just ignored it. Of course, and they're pretty cruel.

38
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.290
Carol Hampton: When my mother passed away issues on life support.

39
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.450
Carol Hampton: And

40
00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:03.570
Carol Hampton: I had told my youngest sister story about I used to go down and take my mom out once a month.

41
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:15.090
Carol Hampton: And the last time I went when I was on going there. I get this like message this you know that small still voice.

42
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.720
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

43
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.920
Carol Hampton: And it says, Have you worked everything out with your mother.

44
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:42.360
Carol Hampton: And it's just like, not really. So I talked to her about a few things. Well, I told that to my youngest sister is somehow she turned that into the reason I didn't go and help take my mom off life support is because I had issues with my mom.

45
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.420
Carol Hampton: And I'm I

46
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.890
Carol Hampton: Was on Facebook. In this, you know, the message thing popped up and I said all that, in a slight

47
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.390
Carol Hampton: We have it completely wrong.

48
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.730
Carol Hampton: I told her she doesn't have a soul.

49
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.260
And

50
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.920
Carol Hampton: We went back and forth a little but

51
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:27.930
Carol Hampton: I just get attacked at a nowhere by these people and I've been ignoring and I actually broke off a relationship with my sister who's just two years older than I, because I realized she was part of all that trouble.

52
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:43.020
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm. And so I got the battle my life but they've doing anything they can to get back in and it's just like, now you know I know them and but it still brings up some of the

53
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.090
Carol Hampton: Stuff.

54
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.950
Carol Hampton: And

55
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.210
Carol Hampton: But I not for the most part.

56
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.230
Carol Hampton: So,

57
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.050
Serenna Beers: Wow, okay.

58
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.740
Serenna Beers: What else, what else doesn't work.

59
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.330
Carol Hampton: Well,

60
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.630
Carol Hampton: What else doesn't work.

61
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.220
Carol Hampton: I'm just, I'm inside a lot. I mean, even before the Korean chain.

62
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:32.370
Carol Hampton: I stayed home a lot because my pain. I never knew when it was going to go off and for the most part it was constantly there.

63
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.960
Carol Hampton: So I just never one to go out because I didn't know what I'd be dealing with

64
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.210
Carol Hampton: And

65
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.480
Carol Hampton: I'm

66
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.670
Carol Hampton: Medicine doesn't work is my husband.

67
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.380
Carol Hampton: Is kind of a pathological liar.

68
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.350
Carol Hampton: He'll take my things like he's so my medicine when time

69
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.460
Carol Hampton: And just denied said it's just like the. Somebody saw him taking it.

70
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.360
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

71
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.270
Carol Hampton: And it's just like can't deny or somebody actually saw happen.

72
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.800
Carol Hampton: But he just be eminently does deny it, and

73
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:31.770
Carol Hampton: It's frustrating because then you I mean he almost convinces you that that didn't happen at all.

74
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.440
Carol Hampton: And

75
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.570
Carol Hampton: I don't know. Yes, a way of putting

76
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.250
Carol Hampton: People down. It's kind of sneaky, you know,

77
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:54.240
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm. And it's just I don't know. Nobody needs that I don't leave that for my spouse and

78
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.090
Carol Hampton: Know,

79
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:05.820
Serenna Beers: How would you describe yours in his relationship at this. At this point, I mean like when when I say

80
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.430
Serenna Beers: What is your marriage like

81
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.010
Serenna Beers: What is your thought

82
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:12.840
Carol Hampton: Word.

83
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.430
Serenna Beers: Boring.

84
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.210
Serenna Beers: Well, so what do you, what do you do about that.

85
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.220
Serenna Beers: How come well for. First of all, how long have you been married for

86
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:34.560
Carol Hampton: 16 years. Well, it's 15 years just this last February.

87
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.450
Carol Hampton: Okay, and

88
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.840
Carol Hampton: I don't know, we've kind of become kind of

89
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.500
Carol Hampton: broke apart because of

90
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.040
Distant

91
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.560
Carol Hampton: He's turned into him taking being the caregiver.

92
00:08:53.610 --> 00:09:10.410
Carol Hampton: And me just, I try to go out to him and hug and pissing in prison, try to preserve some of that and so does he. But there's something missing. You know,

93
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.620
Carol Hampton: In our relationship and

94
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.950
Carol Hampton: He

95
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.740
Carol Hampton: He wanted me oh I don't sleep in the same room as him.

96
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:34.590
Carol Hampton: And I, he said to me, we have a chase and they're in our bedroom and he goes to sleep in the chase.

97
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:41.190
Carol Hampton: And he's old, you could just like sit there and and falsely

98
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.830
Carol Hampton: And it's just like, I can't sit, you know,

99
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.190
Carol Hampton: I can't sit to do that. And I said to him,

100
00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:04.320
Carol Hampton: I can't do that. I can't sit. If I fell asleep that chairs sitting, I would be in pain for a couple of weeks after

101
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.690
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm. No, it's just, he knows this and I don't

102
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:21.270
Carol Hampton: On one hand, I don't expect him to remember everything, but when it comes to sitting or standing for too long.

103
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.300
Carol Hampton: Those are things I just cannot do.

104
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.460
Carol Hampton: And I get kind of mad at him, but not openly.

105
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.800
Carol Hampton: You know, discuss it. I just

106
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.100
Carol Hampton: You know, rolled my eyes and

107
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.460
Carol Hampton: Little off.

108
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.120
Carol Hampton: Basically, hey, this is like

109
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:51.000
Carol Hampton: How long have you been here. Like I said, I'm always like finding ways I can lean

110
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.290
Carol Hampton: You know,

111
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.850
Carol Hampton: On the couch. So I can watch TV with them.

112
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:57.840
Carol Hampton: And stuff.

113
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:06.030
Serenna Beers: Is it a struggle in your relationship that it's kind of it almost sounds like it's very strange at this point.

114
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.800
Carol Hampton: I was too. That's true, yeah.

115
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.180
Serenna Beers: That you guys kind of just coexist, for the sake of the married name.

116
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:22.830
Serenna Beers: But really, there's not really a very healthy relationship or healthy dynamic there that's, you know, I mean, I don't know if you know this, but I would imagine that if you don't

117
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:36.450
Serenna Beers: When dealing with chronic pain if you have things in your life from a mental health standpoint that are out of whack. Meaning if you're struggling with how you feel inside if you know

118
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:44.580
Serenna Beers: Have stress around the relationship stress around other things that can exacerbate all your pain symptoms. So

119
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:57.450
Serenna Beers: Really obviously the doc is his job is to help you with that chronic pain, per se, with the medication that's his that's his or her role. Her role actually right it's Dr. Ella DAG.

120
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.270
Serenna Beers: Or is it yeah yeah yeah

121
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:09.690
Serenna Beers: And so, and then my role is to come in as the therapist pissed and I'm the I'm the other piece of that right so

122
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:17.940
Serenna Beers: You have to have some sort of a connection. I've always believed mind, body and soul you you might get the physical pain part right where you're finally

123
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:25.770
Serenna Beers: And it sounds like you're starting to kind of really get regimented on on a medication that seems to serve its purpose for what you need.

124
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.860
Serenna Beers: To help you want to put on your makeup or to help you feel better or feel good enough to even smile throughout the day.

125
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:38.880
Serenna Beers: But if you don't have that other piece down and you have other things in your life that are weighing you down that are causing you stress.

126
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:51.300
Serenna Beers: That's the kind of stuff. And that's why I asked you what is working for you and what isn't, because that's where I get to be of support for you to figure out how can we work on those things because

127
00:12:51.870 --> 00:13:01.740
Serenna Beers: Obviously, Carol. I mean, it's great that we're getting the medicine part down but it's going to be a moot point if we can't get the rest of it to kind of

128
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:13.980
Serenna Beers: Coexist and mingle and be together, good to to bring together all three three parts. Mind, Body, and Spirit. Right. So with that being said,

129
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:23.220
Serenna Beers: What are some of the things that you think would be beneficial for our time together some, some of the things that maybe you want to work on.

130
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:36.420
Serenna Beers: Specifically, like it like if you had to name the top three things, the top three things that you felt were important for you in order to start beginning to work on getting some balance and some

131
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.000
Serenna Beers: What's, what's the word I am looking for some

132
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:54.390
Serenna Beers: Positive healthy coping skills around mental health. Like, what are the three things that you feel would be your, your, your things that you need to work on.

133
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.320
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm.

134
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.280
Carol Hampton: I need to work on.

135
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.460
Carol Hampton: How to live with this chronic pain.

136
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.250
Carol Hampton: And make it so it's livable.

137
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.690
Carol Hampton: In my, you know, in my life.

138
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.150
Carol Hampton: And

139
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.530
Carol Hampton: I need to quit.

140
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:30.660
Carol Hampton: I fear it. So I'd like to learn how to not fear it.

141
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.470
Carol Hampton: You know, because it is so huge. It just takes me out.

142
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:57.240
Carol Hampton: And I would also like to. I'm a person. I'm very active and I'd like to return to some of my favorite things to do like doing yoga and meditating and

143
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.060
Carol Hampton: You know, walking, and a few these kind of things.

144
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:11.370
Carol Hampton: And without fearing that if I do do them. I might throw myself into a flare up

145
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.110
Carol Hampton: Because the flare ups are so vicious

146
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.000
Serenna Beers: Okay.

147
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.710
So,

148
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.950
Serenna Beers: Mean to find some some

149
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:37.050
Serenna Beers: Sounds like motivation to do those things because I would assume that you know that yoga is probably one of the best things that you could do for yourself.

150
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.640
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. Some

151
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:46.410
Serenna Beers: motivation to do things that, you know, work for your chronic pain or at least help it a little bit.

152
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.810
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. Okay.

153
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.200
Carol Hampton: Yeah.

154
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.130
Carol Hampton: Wow, so like to do like silk in board Dre.

155
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.970
Serenna Beers: Oh that's neat.

156
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.380
Serenna Beers: Sounds hard though.

157
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.370
Carol Hampton: It's hard.

158
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:18.720
Carol Hampton: Yeah so thing though, you have to sit to be able to do it. And I said it all up. One night with my chair pad.

159
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:26.880
Carol Hampton: And I did get a little bit done and it turned out pretty nice and

160
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.600
Carol Hampton: It's, I guess I won't be able to sit for as long

161
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.200
Carol Hampton: To work on it so

162
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.290
Carol Hampton: It's just I

163
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.910
Carol Hampton: Just have to make it work with what I have the

164
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.990
Carol Hampton: Time amount

165
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.780
Carol Hampton: So,

166
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.380
Serenna Beers: Um, OK.

167
00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:01.980
Serenna Beers: So maybe let's just start with. Well, one of the things that you really won't go any further until this and I'm going to

168
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:12.990
Serenna Beers: Circle. The second one, I think that's the first one that you and I can start to really hone in on an address, and that's learning how to not fear my chronic pain.

169
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:22.890
Serenna Beers: Because I'm, you know, and this is just speaking from experience. I've lived with my condition, since I was 24 years old, after I gave birth to my second

170
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.680
Serenna Beers: Second child I was diagnosed with lupus and it's the systemic kind so it can affect

171
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:41.940
Serenna Beers: Any place inside my body, but at the time. The reason why I knew that I was ill, because I had dropped a lot of weight. I had sores all over my face the butterfly rash.

172
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:53.160
Serenna Beers: And my joints hurt my joints hurt so bad. I couldn't get up. I couldn't walk. I brought in my and I had a brand new little baby a long story short,

173
00:17:53.940 --> 00:18:00.660
Serenna Beers: I had so much fear around my chronic pain because I never knew what to expect when I would get up.

174
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:08.910
Serenna Beers: Every, every day was different. And if I had a good day. I had to embrace it and not self sabotage with, you know,

175
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:27.030
Serenna Beers: But I don't know when it's going to leave or, like you said, knowing my limitations. So if I feel this good. It's probably not wise for me to run outside and do every piece of yard work or start lifting a bunch of heavy crap where I'm just, you know, I jack my my my myself up but

176
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.540
You

177
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:43.770
Serenna Beers: Bring it back around to what you're talking about is that fear that fear can literally stop you in your tracks from doing anything to continue to push you and give you more momentum. So that's what we really need to work on.

178
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:52.320
Serenna Beers: And then what as far as what is your, what is your dose, as far as what you take

179
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.210
Carol Hampton: Well, I take

180
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.030
Carol Hampton: Suboxone

181
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.690
Serenna Beers: Right. Do you remember the milligram. No.

182
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:07.590
Carol Hampton: I think it's 3200 or 32 milligrams

183
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.340
Carol Hampton: Okay, I don't think it's 30 3200 drugs, no.

184
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.630
Serenna Beers: That would be rough.

185
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.320
Yeah.

186
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.710
Carol Hampton: I take for 8,000,008.8 milligrams

187
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.490
Okay.

188
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:28.080
Carol Hampton: And then I take 600 Gabba pension three times a day.

189
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.750
Carol Hampton: I take amitriptyline thing.

190
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.240
Carol Hampton: before bed.

191
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.500
Carol Hampton: Three before bed and then

192
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.810
Carol Hampton: I take a muscle relaxers is sanity.

193
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.020
Carol Hampton: Okay, and that's like eight milligrams a day.

194
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:58.710
Carol Hampton: Okay, and then just my regular ones I call them.

195
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.640
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

196
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.360
Carol Hampton: I take prepared at all. Let Cipro

197
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:12.570
Serenna Beers: Okay, are you medication compliant. I mean, are you taking them all as you as your PO post to

198
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.010
Carol Hampton: Yes, I am.

199
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.300
Carol Hampton: Okay, yeah.

200
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.990
Serenna Beers: Yeah, and and I'm obviously not going to get into your medications, because I'm not

201
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:25.470
Serenna Beers: A doctor, I just want to know, like, so that I'm aware of what you're on. So if I see like because I

202
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:35.430
Serenna Beers: Noticed that you're very sleepy and I've noticed you doing this and if I if I have an idea of what you're on, it'll give me an idea of, okay, this is probably why she feels like this.

203
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:51.330
Serenna Beers: And I don't know what times that you take your medicine. So obviously, when you take them would make a difference. You know, you probably have that like that period when it, when it first hit. So you're really tired. You know what I mean.

204
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.580
Serenna Beers: Yes. So yeah, so I appreciate you sharing that with with me.

205
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.020
Serenna Beers: And so do you feel like you're at a really good place as far as

206
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.860
Serenna Beers: Your medication goes so maybe. Now you and I can maybe start to do some therapy work now.

207
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.840
Serenna Beers: Yeah. Okay. Cool.

208
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.730
Carol Hampton: Yeah, okay.

209
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.690
Serenna Beers: So I think for our next session. And do you know let me go ahead and take a look at

210
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.690
Serenna Beers: Let's take a look.

211
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:36.510
Serenna Beers: Specifically at if I can minimize this, okay. So because you were had that kind of that little, I guess, if you will, blip where you weren't compliant with the therapy.

212
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.440
Serenna Beers: And you were kind of trying to figure out where where where you were at

213
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:57.930
Serenna Beers: For a while, I believe, at least for a few sessions. I'd like to check in with you once once a week. You know, I, it doesn't even have to be for the full hour, especially, you know,

214
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:10.050
Serenna Beers: It's just more so so that I can make make, make sure that you are buzzing along at the rate that you should be from a mental health standpoint. You know what I mean.

215
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:24.840
Serenna Beers: And before we could go up to like twice a month. So my thought is, um, let's see, what is the date today. Today is the fifth Cinco de Mayo. Oh, this is

216
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.390
Serenna Beers: Taco Tuesday.

217
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.730
Serenna Beers: Um,

218
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:37.470
Serenna Beers: Let's go to next Tuesday and see what we got. Is this a a pretty good day for you at all.

219
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.910
Carol Hampton: Yes. Great.

220
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.270
Serenna Beers: So you and I met last week at. Hang on.

221
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:53.250
Serenna Beers: Are we, we met this week at two, but the problem is

222
00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:03.300
Serenna Beers: 1pm is air. Okay, no. So you and I could meet at three, do you have an issue with meeting at three

223
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:20.040
Serenna Beers: No. Okay. Three Pam Carol H and this would be for be 12 Wait, is that right, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Okay, so I'm going to ask them follow up and we're going to work on.

224
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.400
Serenna Beers: Fear around

225
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.020
Serenna Beers: Chronic pain that will jog my memory.

226
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:37.890
Serenna Beers: Because I wish I had like the best memory and I could like remember everything everybody says, but I need little, little keywords. You know what I mean.

227
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.720
Let's go to

228
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:44.940
Serenna Beers: Okay.

229
00:23:47.580 --> 00:24:04.950
Serenna Beers: Is it car a car. Oh, l, ah, to my schedule. We said four 512 right that's what I said 512 yep four or 512 at 2pm or individual follow up. Okay.

230
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.950
Serenna Beers: 2pm at 3pm.

231
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.020
Carol Hampton: Sorry. Thank you. Okay, see.

232
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:31.950
Serenna Beers: That's what I always write it down because while I have the patient on the phone, because I cannot tell you what you and I just did is what I do. So if I'm saying saying it out loud and you hear it. I can, I can fix it. Yes, I have you down for 343 for 3pm on the 12th.

233
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.620
Serenna Beers: And also I'm I'm also going to give you one mini little assignment.

234
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.110
Serenna Beers: Okay, one mini little assignment.

235
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.210
Carol Hampton: Okay.

236
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.200
Serenna Beers: I want you to write down every day.

237
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.980
Serenna Beers: Something that you love about your husband.

238
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.190
Serenna Beers: That

239
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.080
Serenna Beers: Makes you feel good, even if it's like nothing that he's doing now.

240
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.220
Serenna Beers: We're trying to figure out, because honestly if

241
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:15.630
Serenna Beers: This is your mate and this is your partner and this is your support system being a strange does not healthy or conducive to your ongoing recovery. Correct.

242
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:26.730
Serenna Beers: Right, so I'm going to work with you all the while on the side to we're just going to add a little bit to kind of boost it up because there's, um,

243
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:36.720
Serenna Beers: I don't feel all is lost all is lost when you have things like you know if you were to say I don't love him.

244
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:47.970
Serenna Beers: Then I would say, Well, okay then that would be a horse of a different color. But that's not the vibe I get from you the vibe I get from you is something just kind of you feel a disconnect

245
00:25:48.840 --> 00:26:00.630
Serenna Beers: And oftentimes with the disconnect. We just need to give it a spark to remind you of what it is or what it, what it was back when it felt very different for you.

246
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:15.960
Serenna Beers: Right. So I'm looking for one thing, a day just one one thing, even if he walks by the hall and says some smartass thing and you remember. Oh, I remember when we used to have that playful banter, you know, a couple years ago.

247
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:24.450
Serenna Beers: Whatever it is all I'm asking for is one thing and don't write down seven things when you see me for next week. I want one thing down.

248
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:36.600
Serenna Beers: Each day because the reason is, is because we're trying to build a pattern. I don't want you to forget it. And then think about it. On that day, then it defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to do.

249
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:52.920
Serenna Beers: And there's a second part, but that's what you and I are going to do to gather. So it's really important. Carol that you follow it in the way that I'm asking you to. And that's writing down one thing every day that you remember that you like about your husband you

250
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.810
Serenna Beers: Don't have to love it. But if you love it.

251
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.370
Serenna Beers: You can write that down to

252
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.170
Serenna Beers: Okay, okay.

253
00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.820
Carol Hampton: Alright, sounds good.

254
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:07.110
Serenna Beers: Well then I will see you in group, unless it was there anything else that that you wanted to talk about

255
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.480
Carol Hampton: No, really.

256
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:16.950
Carol Hampton: Okay, yeah, I was the turn this thing that you see is because I don't sleep well at night.

257
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.880
Serenna Beers: Well, I don't think it's anything funky or weird. I want you to know that I'm familiar with what it looks like when

258
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:39.510
Serenna Beers: A person is sleep de de sleep deep sleep deprived and that's what I see. But I also know that you put medication in the midst of it and it gives you this, this thing. Are you ready for it. Watch me.

259
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:50.550
Serenna Beers: It gives you that thing nods and when somebody's body is so physically tired, but the medication also helps to relax you because that's some of the reasons why you take it right

260
00:27:50.910 --> 00:28:06.600
Serenna Beers: Pain Medicine muscle relaxers. Those are all things that will only exacerbate you already feeling so tired, so it would make sense to me why you're doing this. So I want you to know that it's not coming from a place of why are you. Why are you. Why are you doing this.

261
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.170
Serenna Beers: I know why you are. And I just wanted to confirm to make sure that there's

262
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.950
Serenna Beers: Nothing else going on because that's just part of my job right.

263
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:28.620
Serenna Beers: Right, yeah. So, but it sounds like you got a few finally got a really good combination for your medicine and because I remember the, the, the, the first couple of weeks were really rough. I remember you being a little bit edgy.

264
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:36.150
Serenna Beers: I remember you just looking like. I mean, you literally looked like you didn't feel good, you, you. I mean, you

265
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:49.470
Serenna Beers: You had that look. And so it was very nice to come into this room and see your face and you not look that that way. And even though you know you're tired from not getting much sleep you still look

266
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.510
Serenna Beers: Like, like you feel better from a pain standpoint.

267
00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:03.210
Serenna Beers: That's positive I, you know, that, that, that, that gives me a lot of hope for you. So that was really, really cool to see, you know,

268
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:12.960
Serenna Beers: Yeah, so, so feel too good. Well then, I look forward to seeing you in group, um, which day are you are you Thursday or Friday.

269
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:21.990
Serenna Beers: Friday. OK, I will see you, Carol on Friday at four. And I also will see you next Tuesday at three

270
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:35.970
Serenna Beers: For our individual and until then, remember one thing a day that you remember that you love about your husband or like if if if love is too difficult. Whichever one, but I want you to remember something positive that you love or like

271
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.530
Serenna Beers: That you remember was what drew you to him in the first place. One thing today.

272
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:42.450
Serenna Beers: Okay.

273
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.390
Serenna Beers: Alrighty. Okay, I'll see you on Friday.

274
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.920
Serenna Beers: Okay, okay.
