Richelle Direny: Yeah, you're gonna have to do it every week. If you want to get your script. You don't have to do it every week. I'm not gonna sit here and be hard about individual therapy. But I mean, at the end of the day, you know, how bad do you want to be stable.

54
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.620

59
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.900
Richelle Direny: Your obligation.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.480
Richelle Direny: And they could call in your script.

64
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.890
Richelle Direny: You know, we're going to work on our reception. Because I know a lot of the times.

65
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.600
Richelle Direny: You'll be on stilt mode.

66
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.400
Richelle Direny: Just be

67
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.960
Richelle Direny: completely frozen like you are right now, unless you're real good at keeping still

68
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.230
Pretty bad

69
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.640
Richelle Direny: All right. Okay. So today is just like I said, it's your bio. It is

70
00:07:51.780 --> 00:08:02.820
Richelle Direny: What is just really just being get information gathering and after that then, like I said, the thing is, when you explain how this program. I don't know if you've ever done.

71
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:17.910
Richelle Direny: Tell a medicine program or men in rehab and we'll get into that specifically when I start the whole process or the the bio but bright hearts process is that arm.

72
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.130
Richelle Direny: You have to meet

73
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.060
Daron B: Weekly.

74
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:32.520
Richelle Direny: In order for you to get your scripts filled, you have to meet weekly after you know there's not necessarily a time frame. But if we noticed that there is consistency.

75
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:41.070
Richelle Direny: In you attending your meetings. You're compliant you're doing everything that you need to do then they move it over whether it's every other week or once a month.

76
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:54.540
Richelle Direny: But in order to get there. You just gotta do what you just got to work the program up until you get to that point where all you have to do is come in the group once a month, check in with me either once a month or once every other month from an individual

77
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.560
Richelle Direny: Perspective. But, you know, right now.

78
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:09.240
Richelle Direny: You just have to let me know when I send you a message to tell you, Hey there, you have an appointment, just say, Hey, I can't make it, or yes I'm gonna make it or whatever the situation is. Okay.

79
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.260
Richelle Direny: All right, so

80
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:27.690
Richelle Direny: You pretty much already know how the program works in terms of, you know, making that time available for 45 minutes to an hour, having and right now. Like I clearly I see you. Chillin in your bed is it dumb.

81
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:40.620
Richelle Direny: And you don't have in a headset. So typically when we're doing individual groups. We ask that you when you come to group, you always have a headset, especially when you have an audience.

82
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:54.300
Richelle Direny: Well, right now. Y'all got no audience, but in group you you got some shirts with you. I mean, I know that they'll understand what's going on. But then I see you always have a sock conversations to I see you

83
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:04.380
Richelle Direny: I'm just saying. Just keep something in your ear so that in groups. Everybody doesn't hear your everybody else's conversation so

84
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.100
Richelle Direny: Like they

85
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:17.700
Richelle Direny: They're pretty big on confidentiality, because people oftentimes are not very, you know, trusting of people and they you know you're in a group setting. If they're sharing and then everybody else here in their business. That's not cool. Okay. Yeah.

86
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.530
Richelle Direny: But OK, so in getting started, how did you hear about bright heart.

87
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:31.140
Daron B: While doing my friends. Now we're going through detox program and your winter break or

88
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.350

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.280

Daron B: What do you mean

112
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:12.000
Richelle Direny: Impatience is different from outpatient outpatient you go everyday impatient. It's like you're in a facility you sleep.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.370
Daron B: Like vectors word

257
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.380
Richelle Direny: That you said because you said like you

258
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.390
Richelle Direny: It was so much that was going on.

259
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.160
Richelle Direny: after you got out.

260
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:17.970
Daron B: That's when

261
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:38.310
Daron B: I got I got two kids. I'll never know. I thought I was having a kid with somebody to tear her in her kitchen five years, you know, and I mean they're bright told me wasn't good news and all this other stuff byard editor for me to just get you know embarrassing.

262
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.160
Richelle Direny: So a lot of it. You know, I mean, like, oh,

263
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.190
Daron B: It was super emotional. Right. You know what I mean, like, I wish I never did it because I

264
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:53.700
Daron B: Am not feeling like you're not going to depend on something. I just got rid of, you know what I mean. I had to talk with my dad. He was like,

265
00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.770
Daron B: No like he's like, I don't understand why you decided to do that. We went through hell that plays. I know second time you go through it, it's going to be worse.

266
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.800
Daron B: You know what I mean in or I wish I'd known I just hurts.

267
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:21.600
Daron B: That hurts bad bro, especially, especially when you're sitting there taking care of somebody and kids or even years like you know other kids are taken care of. Okay, I'm in dorm own thing.

268
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:37.380
Daron B: You know they don't deal with somebody, so like when my family, you know, I mean, and then had the audacity to take a baby. The jury Linda wasn't even worried that ticket to my mother, you know, and I mean I'm in touch with asthma really killed like

269
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:47.430
Daron B: I get out. I'm just looking like the laughingstock you know I mean like, bro. We told you told you don't trust. I mean, like, that's not

270
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:57.540
Richelle Direny: My documentation. Imagine I can't imagine you get attached to a child that you think that is yours, and then to find out. It's almost like losing a child.

271
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.990
Richelle Direny: That so verse. Yeah.

272
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:08.340
Richelle Direny: So, um, now that that is a lot. That is a lot to to process emotionally

273
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.060
Daron B: Mentally

274
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.140
Daron B: And then, and

275
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:10.650
Then

276
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.170
Richelle Direny: I had another

277
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.740
Daron B: Your demo top of that I have another

278
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.550
Daron B: Get ready to kids. I'll never seen.

279
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:29.190
Richelle Direny: But if you gave if they weren't given up for adoption, wouldn't you have to have signed off your parent all rights.

280
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:37.320
Daron B: And that's what I thought, too, but whatever she did was so illegal and I just don't have the money to fight.

281
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:39.930
Daron B: You know what I mean, like,

282
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.290
Richelle Direny: They're kind of way that she could do that.

283
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.340
Richelle Direny: You have to pay for for a child to be given up for adoption, you have to sign off your parents all rights, you have to

284
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.240
Daron B: Well, unless

285
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.400

286
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:05.370
Richelle Direny: I don't think that well in Ohio. I don't know. It's how it is in Ohio in terms of the laws, when it comes down to that. Like I don't hear you.

287
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.290
Daron B: You have to

It's just

452
00:40:50.760 --> 00:41:00.330
Richelle Direny: As a there's some degree of violence, there is alcohol. Some degree of addiction that you grew up when you're home.

453
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.580
Richelle Direny: Right, that's kind of what you went there. Yes.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:14.550
Richelle Direny: Now, in terms of support system do you say, would you say that you had any support system when you were growing up.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.890
Daron B: Yeah. Oh, not just that some other things happen.

460
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.240
Richelle Direny: So,

461
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.760
Richelle Direny: Your, your arm.

462
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.240
Richelle Direny: Your reverends a little deep, it sounds like Darren.

463
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.680
Daron B: Yeah, put myself in a pretty big hole.

464
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:06.780
Richelle Direny: And

465
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.400
Richelle Direny: No history of real therapy.

466
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.790
Richelle Direny: Were you born and raised in Ohio.

467
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:23.730
Yep.

468
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:38.820
Richelle Direny: What would you say, from your perspective, when you decided to join bright heart.

469
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.050
Richelle Direny: What was your goal. Like, what is it that you

470
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:53.910
Daron B: Would like to get some loving so dependent on the open for what I'm feeling right now because my meds.

471
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:55.560
Daron B: But

472
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.450
Daron B: I'm just, I want to be able to

473
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.250
Daron B: God

474
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.120
Daron B: Oh I but again I just, you know, I don't want to be dependent. When I go to work and not be like, Man, oh boy.

475
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:14.160
Daron B: Or I don't feel like I can't move right now because I'm sick.

476
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.430
Daron B: I'm going to do nothing, so I can't finish my day. What the hell is going on my phone.

477
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.970
Richelle Direny: I mean, you're fine. Your fingers right in front of the camera.

478
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.510
Daron B: Shut off for me fix it. Okay.

479
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:36.270
Richelle Direny: All right, so you would like so. So one goal is that you want to eventually taper off.

480
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.990
Of it.

481
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.040
Daron B: Yeah, I don't want to depend on does. Okay.

482
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.020
Richelle Direny: And that's going to take a little bit of time.

483
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:53.730
Richelle Direny: In so I don't think you. What were you in that group. No, no, I don't think I did it with your group, but there is in one day. Maybe I'll show the video in the group.

484
00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:08.970
Richelle Direny: You have to think of it that you know if you've been addicted to opiates. Let's say, for the last 10 years is going to take some time for your body to readjust to be able to function without

485
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:18.060
Richelle Direny: Any type of opiates. So it's going to take a little bit of time. But if it is your goal to eventually taper off of the Suboxone

486
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.770
Daron B: You know, the question is,

487
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.310
Richelle Direny: Are you willing to put in the work in the time to be able to do that.

488
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.840
Daron B: Yeah, I mean,

489
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:32.160
Richelle Direny: Like I

490
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.710
Daron B: Remember when I went through.

491
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:36.390
Daron B: Went through

492
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.760
Daron B: Each each moment.

493
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.150
Daron B: And following up and doing all the stuff that went through. I don't want to go through

494
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:47.700
Daron B: But

495
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.230
Richelle Direny: What are you willing to question

496
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.440
Daron B: Is, are you willing to do it. I really to do

497
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.910
Richelle Direny: What you're willing to do Darren.

498
00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:01.230
Daron B: What are you willing to do. I'm willing to do it. I'm saying I gotta like it myself up for that. What do you

499
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.910
Richelle Direny: What do you have to empty yourself up for what do you think you have to empty yourself up for

500
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:14.700
Daron B: I'm saying, like, I have to make sure everything's good. Because I know I'm not gonna be able to do nothing for like during that time period.

501
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:15.600
Richelle Direny: Like the way

502
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:26.130
Daron B: Things are paid for K on say like, I can't just go like that. I went three weeks of being in a room, I can even get out of my bed, you know,

503
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.360
Richelle Direny: What I'm asking

504
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:35.730
Richelle Direny: But you're on a maintenance program. And if one of your if your primary goal of being a part of this program bright heart which

505
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:42.720
Richelle Direny: Provides you with the convenience of locking on online. Are you willing to go through the program to be

506
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.710
Daron B: Able to eventually get here. Yeah.

507
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.300
Richelle Direny: No, that's for sure.

508
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:50.790
Richelle Direny: But yeah

509
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.430
No, no.

510
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.220
Daron B: Know,

511
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:56.790
Daron B: Just say like

512
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.340
Daron B: Don't know about that right now.

513
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.640
Richelle Direny: No, no, this is not like a rehab program where

514
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:08.700
Richelle Direny: You do the program and then after six months of your insurance paying for it. Then they kick you out into you. I don't use your own. No, that's not

515
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.200
Daron B: That's not what this program is about

516
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:20.970
Richelle Direny: Are going to get your weekly but a part of that your requirement is logging on for an hour once a week to do your, your groups.

517
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:27.690
Richelle Direny: And then meet you. I meet individually to address your inability to cope

518
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.980
I mean, listen.

519
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:35.310
Richelle Direny: You have a lot going on. Like I said, the metaphor that I use your river runs really deep, which means that

520
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:51.750
Richelle Direny: There is a lot that underlining Lee is going on. And in order for you to be able to taper off of this medication, you have to, you have to address the core issues of the reason why you're on this arm. Why, Your Honor. This man you understand

521
00:46:52.380 --> 00:47:03.030
Richelle Direny: You wouldn't road, being able to come off of Suboxone honestly I'm gonna be real. You're never going to ever come off of it. If you never address your core issues, you will never be able to get off of it.

522
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.040
Richelle Direny: Has to go together.

523
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.690
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like, oh, Doc.

524
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:15.480
Richelle Direny: I'm sick, it will. Can you give me something. What you're going to the doctor for if you ain't gonna take the pills that he tells you if you're not going to do. You said

525
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:31.260
Richelle Direny: The same way I can give you your script. Well, not me, per se, but you know the the doctor or Natalie could give you your script, but you have to comply with the rest of it and the rest of it is come on here and talk to me. I'm not that hard to talk to

526
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:34.740
Richelle Direny: Not for 45 minutes or so I'm trying to say.

527
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:42.240
Richelle Direny: You gonna be hopeful about a good month. I'm just saying. Talk to me. Alright, alright, alright. Alright, maybe two weeks, maybe two weeks.

528
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.540
Daron B: You have some hope for me.

529
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.960
Richelle Direny: Well yeah you got six kids. So maybe two weeks.

530
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:58.650
Richelle Direny: But I mean that's that's literally all you have to do just comply with the program in that aspect. And like I said, I am not.

531
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:09.210
Richelle Direny: I am not going to be ridiculous. Like that one time that we were supposed to meet and I sent you the message and you you replied back and says, Hey, you know, there's a bad snowstorm. I can't meet. I'm still stuck out on the

532
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:09.510
Daron B: Road.

533
00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:15.870
Richelle Direny: You understand I'm that forgiving. I'm not going to be hard to understand that life happens. But if y'all, hit me up. Darren.

534
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.460
Richelle Direny: I'ma tell Natalie, you know what

535
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:17.670
Daron B: Is

536
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.140
Richelle Direny: A second show

537
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.980
Richelle Direny: Do not give

538
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:28.680
Daron B: Us all it's funny. I did forget I forgot that we said that that day is just so much going on between everything that

539
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.080
Daron B: Could Nord convert virus thing and you know really

540
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.870
Daron B: What's going on all this stuff going on that.

541
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.690
Daron B: Controller buyers. Whatever you call out every same

542
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.550
Richelle Direny: Thing. Oh, yeah.

543
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:54.030
Daron B: You know, I mean, my all this stuff like people trying to stop keep things clean up keywords and I just, I really don't. I look at my phone honest.

544
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.820
Richelle Direny: Okay, well I'm gonna need a week.

545
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.860
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna need you to look at it just once a week. That's

546
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.500
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm gonna need you to look at it.

547
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:02.580
Daron B: But then

548
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.210
Richelle Direny: It is

549
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:16.470
Richelle Direny: This in it. It is it is a lot. I am not going to sugarcoat it. It's a lot for everyone. It really legitimately, it's a lot. And the whole idea of number one you being laid off.

550
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.040
Richelle Direny: Trying to figure out how you're going to be able to support your family.

551
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:29.760
Richelle Direny: Being able to do everything, not knowing where the next meal is going to fall, it's, it's very stressful being locked up in a house or if I don't know how it is there in Ohio, but I know

552
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:36.000
Richelle Direny: In many states, they're pretty much like shutting down the state and telling everybody to quarantine themselves for however long

553
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.010
Daron B: And so there is a library.

554
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:47.700
Richelle Direny: That's a lot to be locked up in a house with six is screaming kids that is a lot. So yeah, exactly. A few you if

555
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.720
Daron B: You if you, you know,

556
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.070
Daron B: A few you

557
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.790
Daron B: But

558
00:49:50.820 --> 00:50:01.200
Richelle Direny: I mean, I'm just saying it is a lot. But what is your outline what is your self care routine sitting there and just being in your head is going to drive anyone

559
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:05.970
Richelle Direny: Up the wall. So, I mean, I will just say

560
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:18.420
Richelle Direny: Moving forward, we can check in. Once a month. That's not a problem because also, you know, being able to check on here financially with insurance and everything. And not everything not completely being in place.

561
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:27.360
Richelle Direny: From a government standpoint, I know they're lifting certain things with co pays or with insurance companies or what have you. So I

562
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:37.800
Richelle Direny: Understandable to say, you know, I can only be there if you want me to be there for you. I can only help you if you want me to help you, like, I can't do more than you're willing to do

563
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:49.950
Richelle Direny: So, you know, just, you know, every Thursday. The groups are 12 O'clock in six o'clock, whichever one, but the the six o'clock group starts the first week of

564
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.810
Richelle Direny: April.

565
00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:53.610
Richelle Direny: So,

566
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:54.990
Richelle Direny: I don't know, I think.

567
00:50:55.710 --> 00:51:06.810
Richelle Direny: Next week that the care coordinators are going to call everyone to just let them know to remind them again that the groups are going, they just moved up in our 12 o'clock and then starting in April, the group will be at six o'clock.

568
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:15.240
Richelle Direny: And so at least you have that option if you miss the sixth of the day group, you have the option to come to the evening group. So you do have that option.

569
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:30.330
Richelle Direny: You know, as long as I like I said you work with me. I'm, you know, if you if I send you a message of a reminder, just let me know if you're able to make it. If not, if you need changes, just let me know or whatever the situation is when it comes on to your script that is all.

570
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:40.500
Richelle Direny: From Natalie, she is the one that fills the script. So I'll send her a message, let her know I want to say that they did call it in. But I'll send a message to let them know

571
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:48.990
Richelle Direny: That you didn't meet for your, your session and that arm to go ahead and fill the script. So you will be able to pick it up, whether it's today or tomorrow.

572
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.460
Richelle Direny: You have any questions for me.

573
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.110
Daron B: Dog did these kids get it.

574
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:07.950
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right, then. No problem. So I'll send a message, letting them know so that they can fill your script and then I will see you on Thursday at 12 o'clock.

575
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.920
Daron B: Or low sugar call it there because

576
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.910
Richelle Direny: I'm going to send them the message right now.

577
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.390
Richelle Direny: They'll let you know. I'll send you a message and let you know if they respond to

578
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:19.890
Daron B: Me. So are you gonna send me a text.
