WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.929
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And asked what to appointment. Our scheduled for and they said it was only supposed to be one. So I don't know.

2
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:29.670
John Reinhart: Well, thanks for making this will go ahead and go through these questions and then kind of get this all set up just answer them the best you can. This is being recorded right now. And this is an assessment session with Chaz canola oil is that the proper way to say your last name. Chaz.

3
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.200
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

4
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.780
John Reinhart: Okay, and first question. Chaz is what brings you in treatment and why now.

5
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:59.040
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, I was having a little bit of troubles with the medication that I was that I was taking and it was for chronic pain in the back and in the knees and ankles. And, uh, I found myself needing

6
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:21.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: More and more. So instead of, you know, going out and trying to find pain meds and trying to, you know, resolve my my pain myself in my own way and take it into my own hands, I contacted you guys and I started the program with you guys.

7
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.370
John Reinhart: That's great. Yes.

8
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
John Reinhart: OK, the next question is, tell me your story with substances.

9
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: In the past, I had a diction problem.

10
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.180
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It bounced from alcohol to pain meds to

11
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.100
Galaxy J3 Orbit: To math a little bit and then

12
00:01:48.690 --> 00:02:01.140
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It kept very varying between the three and it used to be, marijuana, too. But other than that, it's only been

13
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Pills outgrow whole marijuana and math.

14
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.510
John Reinhart: Right okay um when when were you first exposed to using

15
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I was about 1617 years old.

16
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.840
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay.

17
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Little bell is exposed. Yeah, I was exposed to a um oxycodone

18
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.250
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh my goodness, that's

19
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.760
John Reinhart: Too big exposure there and start off right off the bat, you know,

20
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, they were the oxy the oxy cotton fives and alcohol and marijuana was eating.

21
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.260
John Reinhart: Yeah, so that's a big hurdle right off the get go.

22
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.900
John Reinhart: How did it progress.

23
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: A

24
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.590
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Couple of war with the medication. It was a couple of injuries that I had

25
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:11.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That that turned in chronic injuries, um, with the marijuana and alcohol. It was more of like a

26
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: What do you call that a social type of

27
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.680
John Reinhart: Recreational type of thing.

28
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, yeah. Recreational

29
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.070
Yeah.

30
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I

31
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.100
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Ended up

32
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.440
John Reinhart: Do you ever radio on in the background chest

33
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.450
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's my TV.

34
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.060
John Reinhart: Could you turn that off, just until we get through this. We get a good recording so they can make a good treatment plan.

35
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: There we go.

36
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.510
John Reinhart: That's usually how it happens, you know, the recreational but you're taking oxy code on for your pain.

37
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.250
John Reinhart: Right.

38
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I was getting it. I was getting it under the table.

39
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: From someone I knew and

40
00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:06.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It went from that. And then what happened is I ended up getting myself into trouble. And then I was being tested through probation and

41
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:19.260
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Had to stay clean from everything, including marijuana, alcohol pills, stuff like that. So I ended up digging a little deeper into my pain and actually getting a doctor that helped me

42
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:32.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, I never did like the the ox c's and the Norco. Those are the hydro or anything like that, but they were there. It was what I was able to get. And so I got it.

43
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But when I got my doctor, I actually got a doctor that helped me and they had put me on Tramadol

44
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And the thing with the Tramadol is you only take them for a certain amount of time and then you start to become immune to them.

45
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:59.490
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I was finding myself having to take more and more. And I talked to my doctor about it and I let my doctor know that, hey, you know, I'm starting to have to take more and more

46
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:14.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Is there something else I can do or something like that to help me with this pain that I'm having and stuff. And so they tried me on some other medications to go with my Tramadol which was like the GABA panting.

47
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:25.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then they've also tried me on a couple mental health medication as well because it's not only a chronic pain. It's also

48
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:36.120
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So I suffer from severe depression, sometimes as well as a DD and ADHD.

49
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:49.920
John Reinhart: Thanks for sharing that. That's good. It's good. Good stuff to know so we can kind of figure out a good game plan there for you. When was it worse for you. Chess, when was it the kind of the, the worst.

50
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.840
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um,

51
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.530
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It went up and down like there was a

52
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:19.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'd say it got really bad for me and between the age of 18 and 2218 and 22 and then I stopped everything cold turkey, because I was on probation.

53
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.460
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I was trying to do good and then I kept having my relapses with marijuana

54
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:38.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And so I ended up popping dirty for my probation officer and then eventually my probation officer revoked me and I sat out the rest of my time in prison.

55
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:47.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then I i discharged prison. I came to California, where my family's uh

56
00:06:48.540 --> 00:07:01.260
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I started getting involved with friends and stuff down here and trying to get to know people. You know, new town trying to know people you know making new friends, stuff like that.

57
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:14.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then it started to progress again. And that's when I got into math. I got into outdoor a little bit of marijuana as well as pain pills.

58
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:33.150
John Reinhart: Well, yeah, just the whole progression. Man You've come a long ways. I'm going to move on over now to chronic pain and I know this is a prevailing thing that that's with you. What was the precipitating event that caused your chronic pain Chazz

59
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:49.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It was a skateboarding accident accident. I ended up landing the wrong way. And when I was standing sideways on my skateboard. I came off of this this wedge.

60
00:07:50.340 --> 00:08:05.250
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And this ledge was taller than me that I came off of what my skateboard. And when I landed I caught grass and when I caught graphs. I got stuck. And this shoulder right here.

61
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:27.330
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Came down, sideways like this and touched my ankle and that happened. I had a pop go up my back from my tailbone, all the way to my neck and then I kind of flung forward like that. So it kind of did some damage in my spine.

62
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.140
John Reinhart: Yeah, no kidding i you're lucky, you're not paralyzed, you would have been better I concrete than the grass right

63
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:50.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, and I went for the grass thinking that it would be a little bit safer and tell I was a until I was comfortable with doing it on the concrete, kind of like a practice thing and it didn't work out so well.

64
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:58.050
John Reinhart: Oh, man. Okay, let me move on. Next question. Growing up, what was your family life like

65
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It had its ups and ups and downs.

66
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:11.850
Galaxy J3 Orbit: There was a time where my parents went through their addiction phases and then

67
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:20.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They as well quit and started doing good for themselves doing good in their life and everything and then this group.

68
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:40.590
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Uh, you know, it would be back and forth with with that. So yeah, I was familiar with alcohol. I was familiar with marijuana a half my family, um, had their green cards and all that stuff. So marijuana was pretty much around me my whole life.

69
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: All all the elders and in my family. Pretty much to used it. So I never saw this really

70
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.180
John Reinhart: Then yeah

71
00:09:52.050 --> 00:10:00.840
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I've never really seen it to be, you know, a bad thing because, you know, it was just there was normal.

72
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.080
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Normal, normal yeah yeah

73
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.310
John Reinhart: Did You Do you have any siblings bros bros and sisters

74
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.400
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I have two brothers.

75

John Reinhart: Oh,

76
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.680
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then a bunch of cousins.

77
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.710
John Reinhart: Okay, so you pretty tight knit family, then

78
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.390
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

79
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.040
John Reinhart: We're your parents together.

80
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, they they've been together my whole life.

81
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.860
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Well, they're still very now.

82
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.870
John Reinhart: That's awesome. And they've kind of gone through the whole thing and they're doing good. So that's great.

83
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.250
John Reinhart: Yeah.

84
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:40.260
John Reinhart: Anyone in your home life struggle with mental health, substance abuse or food issues kind of touched on that a little bit.

85
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Uh,

86
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Not, not, no. Not that I know of. Not mental health. My parents never

87
00:10:51.660 --> 00:11:08.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Went to any mental health places or nothing like that. They're not on any mental health medication nothing neither are my brothers, like the only thing that's really been through our family is, you know, just different types of drugs.

88
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.950
John Reinhart: Yeah, they just if they Na, that type of thing.

89
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:23.940
John Reinhart: Do you notice any other addictive type of behaviors that you might have or that were in the family.

90
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:28.500

John Reinhart: No. Okay.

92
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:38.880
John Reinhart: Such as gambling I showed that this a continuation said so I blew it, such as gambling working a lot awareness of sexual material.

93
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:54.540
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Not really. I mean, like myself, I used to gamble, a little bit here and there, but then I seen like

94
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.440
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I seen my money going to stop.

95
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:06.570
John Reinhart: With that, okay, we're We're more than halfway done. Chaz. What was school like for you.

96
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.330
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We were below poverty. Poverty. So, you know, like

97
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:25.860
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I wasn't like popular, nothing like that I had friends but you know there was there was times where I was teased about

98
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:38.730
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know how I smell come into school or, you know, like the clothes. I was wearing stuff like that but nothing really to effective

99
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:46.920
John Reinhart: See how far did you, how did you complete it or how far did you complete in school.

100
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:58.080
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, I made it to freshman year, which was ninth grade. And then I got homeschooled. I got my GED.

101
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Great. Um, yeah. So I did graduate, uh,

102
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:06.180
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

103
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:15.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I got homeschooled graduated and then I got a job, stuff like that started to, you know, take upon the adult life, you have

104
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:21.540
John Reinhart: Started started as a a 1718 or 16 or whatever, how started started working early

105
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.240
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, started at 16

106
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:33.960
John Reinhart: Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. The next one is, were there any events that. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you struggle with any learning disabilities.

107
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.390
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

108
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:51.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I had a few learning disabilities. I didn't. I can't, I can't remember exactly what they were called, but I know I had one with like reading and

109
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I had a couple disabilities and I'm

110
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.560
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Remembering

111
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:00.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Things.

112
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:02.640
John Reinhart: Mm hmm.

113
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:22.110
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like say like a test was coming off or something and say, I would read through this book or whatever, you know, to try and study I had problems, remembering. You know what I was reading and you know like how to put it in words.

114
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:32.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: For the questions on the test and stuff like that. So I had a few learning disabilities going through school. Yeah.

115
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:39.690
John Reinhart: Right, you know, the cool thing is, though, once you know you you go through the program get stable and your, your

116
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:51.930
John Reinhart: Front, you know, your cognitive. Well, we talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and you start seeing clearly a lot better. And you could you start getting retention. You know those things and you can

117
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.560
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

118
00:14:52.740 --> 00:15:05.460
John Reinhart: Slow down, and you could write, you know, write things out and you just progress. So, you know, you just getting where you're at right now and kind of your brains been stunted, in a sense, you know what I mean, because of the using and everything so

119
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.460
John Reinhart: You know, there's a lot of good stuff in your future here.

120
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

121
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:18.360
John Reinhart: Let's see. Okay, next question. Were there any events that stood out to you, growing up either in your neighborhood family or friends.

122
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.590
Galaxy J3 Orbit: For like for an example. What do you mean

123
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.170
John Reinhart: Yeah, that's good one right there is

124
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:41.910
John Reinhart: Were there any kind of like PTSD type of things or things that shocked you or anything that was out of the ordinary that that you experience while growing up are pretty much normal

125
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: A while we were ended up going through foster care for

126
00:15:50.400 --> 00:16:05.130
Galaxy J3 Orbit: For for what my, my parents got in trouble for and they got in trouble for their usage and then I'm not really having a stable environment. We got taken away from our parents and put into foster care.

127
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then

128
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:25.860
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My parents went through all the groups all the classes past everything got us back and then we ended up moving to Montana and we did good for the 10 years we're out there. And then we move back care because of family and

129
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Basically

130
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's pretty much where we're at. And now we're down here.

131
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.610
John Reinhart: Yeah, that's a good synopsis right there. Cool. Did you ever serve in the military.

132
00:16:41.310 --> 00:17:02.250
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'd like to, but no no i i tried, I tried joining the military, and I guess I was a year too late. They stopped recruiting people at the age of 24 so anybody older than 24 is too old to join anymore.

133
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.880
John Reinhart: Even the National Guard that applies for them to or

134
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:15.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I yeah talk to the recruiter recruiter down here at the Air Force Base, that we got and

135
