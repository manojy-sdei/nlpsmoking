00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.470
Frank Dickinson: I don't know.

Frank Dickinson: Jack did something to make it work. Again, or what, but I couldn't get

7
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.080
Richelle Direny: What you could do like okay so the next time like that happens like at four, eight your scheduled time and you're trying to get through.

8
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:54.990
Richelle Direny: Just send me a message you see like how you because I know that by the time you sent me the message you couldn't have logged in, then, because I had a five o'clock in the five o'clock, like you both sent me a message at the same time.

9
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.600
Frank Dickinson: Yeah, I honestly I don't know how this stuff works. I'm not really good at it.

10
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, um, but you did get my message. Well, you didn't. You did respond to the theme, you'll be there.

11
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.470
Frank Dickinson: Yeah, but I got your message that was timestamp, but he was like 415 or something. I didn't get that until I restarted my phone.

12
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.110
Frank Dickinson: And then I got a message. Is there a number that I can text you it

13
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.800
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.740
Frank Dickinson: That happens. Okay, I'm gonna save it under that

15
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.470
Frank Dickinson: That way if I can't get through. I'll just text you before it gets scary.

16
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.580
Richelle Direny: Yeah, cuz like I had someone in my group that

17
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.360
Richelle Direny: She was at which everybody was coming in, like, really late so he sent me the message and I just sent him the number so he could come in.

18
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.250
Richelle Direny: Oh,

19
00:01:46.110 --> 00:02:02.010
Frank Dickinson: And then Tuesday. I didn't know I was supposed to have group meeting with everyone and I forgot all about it. I got six kids and we were all trapped in the house because it was raining out. So it was it was super hectic and I didn't even remember to eight o'clock.

20
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.680
Richelle Direny: No, you're good.

21
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.690
Okay.

22
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, just, I'm just, just, you know, try to make it to the next one. I know.

23
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:23.310
Richelle Direny: Which was a pretty decent turnout on Tuesday, but, um, now that you have my information just just send me a message and let me know.

24
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.800
Richelle Direny: Whenever you know, the thing is, like, I appreciate, even if

25
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.160
Richelle Direny: You're coming so you know i appreciate when

26
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:50.550
Richelle Direny: Which a limited amount of people to it where I says please confirm and then they don't confirm so like I don't really know if a person is going to show her not hold on my fingers saying my internet is unstable. So, um,

27
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.070
Richelle Direny: If you know if you send me a message and be like, Hey, you know what I forgot, whatever the situation is like I can understand what can happen.

28
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.010
Richelle Direny: So just, you know, just always just send me a message that's part of the reason why I try to send the messages. So everyone

29
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:17.970
Richelle Direny: At least they can communicate with me because I can always relate it back instead of you trying to get it through bright heart and having to wait in this long. It's kind of like calling the doctor's office and you're sitting in light on hold forever waiting to get through.

30
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.310
Frank Dickinson: Make

31
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.080
Frank Dickinson: That's what I'm doing.

32
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.900
Frank Dickinson: When I was trying to call in, it was just going to that one screen and it didn't go pass there so I kept hanging up trying to call back in

33
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.500
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, but you're good now. So today is, um,

34
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:56.280
Richelle Direny: So today's session is what is called the bio. This is where I kind of get to know you, in terms of like understanding your history, sending your journey that you you're on.

35
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.580
Richelle Direny: How you started the journey kind of where you are now.

36
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.800
Richelle Direny: And what are your plans to continue

37
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.720
Frank Dickinson: That's kind of what are

38
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.160
Richelle Direny: What's going on now there's a knockin noise.

39
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.840
Frank Dickinson: Right.

40
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.140
Frank Dickinson: Like I started my addiction, if that's what you're talking about. That was probably

41
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.930
Richelle Direny: Well, let's start with this, like, let's start with how did you hear about like how did you hear about Braveheart to start

42
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.520
on a Thursday.

43
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.830
Frank Dickinson: I saw

44
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.650
Frank Dickinson: It was like a Facebook ad, I think.

45
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.570
Frank Dickinson: I seen. Oh, there's a, there's one called work it and I was looking at that and then I Googled it and then Braveheart came up

46
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.960
Frank Dickinson: That's how I found it.

47
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.240
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

48
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.120
Richelle Direny: Okay, um,

49
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.020
Richelle Direny: So he said that you feel this is the first time you've ever been in any type of treatment program.

50
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:30.750
Frank Dickinson: No, I was in Dr Basel had he had me on Suboxone for like nine months and then I got dropped out in the program.

51
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.670
Frank Dickinson: Because I I drug tested a dirty ones, and they dropped me from the program.

52
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.890
Richelle Direny: Okay.

53
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.700
Richelle Direny: Okay, yeah. And this program is not like backpedal

54
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.460
Frank Dickinson: Because I missed the group. I'm gonna get in trouble.

55
00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:02.430
Richelle Direny: Now the only the only thing that will have happen and more so in group, you'll hear me talk about AGAIN NEXT IN NEXT GROUP IS THAT THEY WILL

56
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.310
Richelle Direny: They will

57
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.690
Richelle Direny: decrease the number of refills that you get. So like let's say if you get, um,

58
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:20.880
Richelle Direny: One. I don't know how they do the refill. So like you go to group, you get a refill. And then you have like two or three films with it.

59
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.420
Richelle Direny: You won't, they won't, they won't do it like that. Like you would have to literally come and you would only get a script every week.

60
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.200
Richelle Direny: And that's how they

61
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.220
Frank Dickinson: That's how they do. That's how they're doing it anyway.

62
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.480
Richelle Direny: Yeah but but now they're becoming a lot more stricter with it.

63
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.990
Richelle Direny: Where if you have so like if you're not if you're consistently not showing so like there's people who come every week.

64
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.770
Richelle Direny: Like there. They've been consistent ever since they started the program. So then you'll find that in group. Some people only come in a group. Once on one

65
00:06:50.280 --> 00:07:01.110
Richelle Direny: Because like they had been a consistent with the program coming to group whether meeting with the therapist once or by someone. However, their schedule is like they're really they really showing

66
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:13.500
Richelle Direny: That like I'm committed. This is what I wanted to. So, then your point. It's kind of like the transition from inpatient, outpatient like once you're impatient, then they put you the how patient, you only have to go to groups, a couple times a week.

67
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.420
Richelle Direny: And that's, that's kind of how that

68
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:25.530
Richelle Direny: This program is so but they won't drop you only time you get dropped from the program is if you your Mia for like three, four months.

69
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.820
Frank Dickinson: Broke.

70
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:39.510
Richelle Direny: So that's how you get dropped from the program like at that point we review it before we even drop you with collagen no harm reduction program, we're not here to just be like, oh you you sidestepping. So let me get rid of you. It's not like that.

71
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.180
Frank Dickinson: Looks good.

72
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.010
Richelle Direny: So, um, so, so, yes. Start with tell me about like how you started like, how old were you when you got started.

73
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:56.280
Frank Dickinson: I think I was like 17 or 18 I was said to work full time. I like

74
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.090
Frank Dickinson: Somehow my back was hurting. And then I started seeing a doctor and they put me on Vikram

75
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:12.750
Frank Dickinson: And I really enjoyed it and I ended up at like the worst. And I was taking my 30 day. And the worst part.

76
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.680
Richelle Direny: Is how long did it take for you to get for 30 a day.

77
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.470
Frank Dickinson: My second awards.

78
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.540
Frank Dickinson: So probably like 17 years 15 years someone like that.

79
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.470
Frank Dickinson: I was on for a long time, when

80
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.310
Richelle Direny: You said your second or so in 15 years you had to

81
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.770
Richelle Direny: You were married twice and divorced twice.

82
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.680
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so when you were 17. So you started at 17 before you got married.

83
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.980
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Okay. Okay.

84
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:52.170
Richelle Direny: And so what was going on in back time and that increase the amount because you said it started because of

85
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.050
Frank Dickinson: Pain way but whenever I got sort of style.

86
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:03.570
Frank Dickinson: Just like non everything or got upset are using it didn't just was like an escape.

87
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.530
Frank Dickinson: Took the edge off a reality, I guess.

88
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:09.870
Richelle Direny: It.

89
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.640
Frank Dickinson: Also made me feel like really focused and really like

90
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.990
Frank Dickinson: I don't know how to explain it like a ton of energy.

91
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.620
Richelle Direny: When I'm now what started the back pain.

92
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.790
Frank Dickinson: Lean over

93
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.310
Richelle Direny: Oh, well, you started texting at 17

94
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.470
Frank Dickinson: I started a food scene.

95
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.310
Frank Dickinson: On the shop.

96
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.750
Richelle Direny: Said, your adoptive parents

97
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.060
Frank Dickinson: Yeah. On the shop.

98
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:59.100
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um, so, so, over the course of two years because of you straining your back, you were having a lot of back pain.

99
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.400
Frank Dickinson: Yeah, it started off like that really wasn't to where I should have been prescribed

100
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.100
Frank Dickinson: There's just an old resolves Dr. Trying to get a cut.

101
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.800
Frank Dickinson: got hooked on them. And they were just writing them every month.

102
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:26.430
Frank Dickinson: So just like very good description for every one of us would say when I started using them because I like the way that maybe she'll

103
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.750
Frank Dickinson: Actually song. Once I started out, I started finding them buying them on the street.

104
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.200
Frank Dickinson: That was

105
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.560
Frank Dickinson: In the beginning it was like five of the day, I would say.

106
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.290
Richelle Direny: Okay, and

107
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.850
Richelle Direny: So that was the only thing was prescription

108
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.360
Frank Dickinson: Yeah. Never done no hero.

109
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.760
Richelle Direny: You've never done anything drink it was always just pills.

110
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.890
Frank Dickinson: You know, it was always just like

111
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.990
Richelle Direny: Okay. And then, um,

112
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.350
Frank Dickinson: Oh god alcoholism runs in my family and

113
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:20.640
Frank Dickinson: When I i can't drink because like when I drink under this key right there. I don't know where to start. I blacked out and we can other hospitals.

114
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.070
Richelle Direny: So when you drink you drink hard but in that moment.

115
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.560
Frank Dickinson: Yeah yeah like it could start with just one or two beers and I

116
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.960
Frank Dickinson: Just hammered by that.

117
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.680
Frank Dickinson: And so I don't drink at all like, I'm no better

118

121
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.170
Frank Dickinson: Oh, is that very additional

122
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.010
Richelle Direny: That's when you went into the program.

123
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.290
Frank Dickinson: Yeah, I knew I was going to get help. I was gonna die.

124
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.920
Richelle Direny: And how old were you when that happened,

125
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.500

132
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.080
Richelle Direny: And then, and that's when you went into the program.

133
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.520
Frank Dickinson: That's when I started seeing Dr. Bob's only put me on Suboxone

134
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.440

Richelle Direny: Positive. What did you test positive

136
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:13.260
Frank Dickinson: For I was on the program for a long time. I can't remember. Like how long exactly I was on the program or

137
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:20.310
Frank Dickinson: Was on it for a long time, and it was working really good. I didn't take nothing for the whole town's on

138
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.020
Frank Dickinson: But I was writing. I was writing on a car and I was putting a transmission by myself and I twisted the wrong way and I hurt my back.

139
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:40.350
Frank Dickinson: And I had multiple in the drawer and that I found a bug in the drawer to I took the damn molten in divided and then the next day I had a doctor's appointment. I didn't think about it.

140
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.150
Frank Dickinson: And so they stay within my sister that one bill was in my system.

141
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.210

Richelle Direny: I think maybe

380
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:28.170
Richelle Direny: It's a little bit. I think it's maybe your internet connection. Maybe what is your back, you know, what is your battery dying.

Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah

384
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.140
Richelle Direny: I know that's another thing when your battery's dying, but it does that it starts really getting crackling

385
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.430
Richelle Direny: Um, were you born and raised in Ohio. I mean, in Michigan.

Frank Dickinson: When

392
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.860
Richelle Direny: You said it's real probation.

393
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:27.030

396
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.960
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, this is the thing. If your probation officer wants you to see a counselor.

397
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:54.480
Richelle Direny: If you don't want to specifically go to that. I mean, it's really up to you if you don't want to specifically on that one. You can give a release for bright heart and just let them know that you're doing counseling through right

398
00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:54.960
Well,

399
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.380
Richelle Direny: Well, you said that you're no longer on probation. So you don't have to do that anymore.

Richelle Direny: I'm struggling trying to make out what you're saying through correctly.

402
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.200
Frank Dickinson: Or

403
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.270
Richelle Direny: Maybe try plugging in the phones in another location because I think maybe because your phone is dying.

404
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.030
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah

405
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.250
