00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.950
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

2
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.920
Bonnie Burset: Sorry. Give me one second to change my background. Can you hear me ok I

3
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:33.960
Bonnie Burset: Came from doing, doing, you know, the kids. They love to show you at least my little ones love to show me the things I can do they think it's entertaining to do the virtual background.

4
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.380
Bonnie Burset: So I forgot I still had it on

5
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.960
Bonnie Burset: Kids are so funny. Let me do you mind if I just turn another light on in here because it's always good to darken

6
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.740
Bonnie Burset: Computer into but I lose you.

7
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.050
Bonnie Burset: There we go. Okay.

8
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.830
Bonnie Burset: Yeah. So yeah, I took that from our last conversation. It was really helpful for me and just kind of, I think, after we got off.

9
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.010
Bonnie Burset: The video. You know, I kind of realized why I was kind of in such a like feeling more fragile than usual and who can you

10
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:52.230
Bonnie Burset: I realized like, it's just so hard. Gosh, stupid. Sorry, I get like I plugged in my phone to charge it and then I get like hijacked with like, do you want to import videos. I'm like, no, um,

11
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.460
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, no, I mean, I've really been thinking about, like, I feel like for me, this whole process has been like

12
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:13.710
Bonnie Burset: You know, I sometimes take for granted. Like, this is all against the backdrop of a crazy pandemic, you know, where it's like it's like I just, I think one thing that's been really challenging for me and it ties into what we were talking about the unknown is that

13
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.980
Bonnie Burset: You know, there's just been one thing after another, since I've been home of just regular life stuff just regular like first

14
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.280
Bonnie Burset: My husband had to go to hospital. And it turned out he had shingles. Then I had stuff with my ovaries that turned out to be just this, but it's still just stuff that stressful. Right.

15
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.720
Bonnie Burset: And then like I kept thinking with my hours I would hear new information and think, Oh, totally. Everything's fine on, you have to stress it all. Then I realized like, Well, wait maybe I'm totally screwed. It's just like

16
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.530
Bonnie Burset: When I was realizing, and what I really took from our conversation. A lot of things, but one of the things was just remembering that there will be a way

17
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.860
Bonnie Burset: That there is a path and you just have to believe that, you know, I have to totally give up that I know what that path looks like.

18
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.750
Bonnie Burset: I think it's so what. And that's true about everything. During this pandemic, like it's just I don't know what anything looks like I have no clue.

19
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.870
Bonnie Burset: And that's kind of, you know, the reality. And I think you know what occurred to me as I think and

20
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.910
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think what happens. And maybe this is true for a lot of people I don't know but like that feeling of having the rug pulled out from under you.

21
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:27.270
Bonnie Burset: Is like I realized I go through like a mini Stages of Grief around it were first. I kind of go through shock and disbelief, or like know some fair, you know, just feeling

22
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.320
Bonnie Burset: Kind of the unfairness the frustration and that's kind of where I was when we were talking and then afterward.

23
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.620
Bonnie Burset: You know, just kind of moving into like acceptance around kind of where things are. And I've really

24
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.800
Bonnie Burset: Been enjoying I'm still trying to get myself in the daily meditation. I've done more. I've done a few days, a few days more which has been helpful and

25
00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:01.350
Bonnie Burset: Also the listening to. I've been really into like loving kindness meditation, like a mindfulness practice, you know, like just there's some authors. I'm listening to on my audio books and

26
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.540
Bonnie Burset: Just the concept of kind of just total acceptance like just radical acceptance of just like okay this is here. This is what's here.

27
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.600
Bonnie Burset: And just leaning into it and it's it's really hard even, even though I know that's the work right isn't there. That's what I'm encouraging people to do is not

28
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.600
Bonnie Burset: Distract or avoid or, you know, use other defenses against you know what's real, but

29
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.450
Bonnie Burset: It's still hard to do. You know, sometimes I tend to get stuck in, you know,

30
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:40.230
Bonnie Burset: The frustration and feeling unfair and that moment. And if it passes and it passed and it's kind of like, well,

31
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.890
Bonnie Burset: That's what it is. And it really was kind of comforting like it made me think of it differently, like the BBS isn't I mean so much of it is about

32
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:58.560
Bonnie Burset: You know the difference. Hope versus hopelessness, you know, and that's always something that comes up with clients you know even makes me think about

33
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.410
Bonnie Burset: I remember it was really interesting. One supervisor, I had this totally kind of side tracking, but

34
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:13.680
Bonnie Burset: Do you want to was kind of asking me, we were talking about a client with ideation and she was saying, well, what, what do you think makes people commit suicide. And I was like, I know at the time, I was like,

35
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:24.090
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, just inability to deal with their pain. And she was like, No, it's hopelessness and helplessness and those things together is what is different about you know

36
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:34.770
Bonnie Burset: ideation, rather than just having sad feelings and and so I really think about that in different ways, both in terms of when I deal with clients where that's an issue.

37
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.970
Bonnie Burset: But also just you know the importance of

38
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:49.560
Bonnie Burset: How like reminding myself how I'm looking at the world is that the BBS is against me and they're gonna like they're actively trying to stop me from getting my license. I don't think so.

39
00:06:49.890 --> 00:07:02.280
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think realistically, even if they don't make accommodations, there will be some I really took it to heart where you're saying there will be a way there will be some path. They may be inconvenient. It may be frustrating.

40
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:10.830
Bonnie Burset: Yes, I may have to do, like, apparently. Many of us many people have done more hours than should have been needed

41
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:20.190
Bonnie Burset: But that's it's, you know, that's just all there. It's not that there won't. I think my bigger fear was, you know,

42
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:31.230
Bonnie Burset: That there won't be a way I've worked as hard and it's just going to all be I'll just be rejected and I won't have a license at the end of the day, and that probably won't happen no matter. Yeah.

43
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:40.920
Bonnie Burset: How we go about it. Yeah. So yeah, I feel like there's just a lot of leaning in with things these days. And it's hard because some weeks I noticed you know

44
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.770
Bonnie Burset: How on my mood is is really, you know, it's hard to sometimes separate that out with clients you know when I'm like

45
00:07:50.220 --> 00:08:00.000
Bonnie Burset: God, you know, like I have two clients tonight. You know, it's kind of my heavier. Luckily, most of my clients are spread out, but the kids are so bored. There's zoomed out there like

46
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:10.650
Bonnie Burset: You know, and I feel them. Like, I feel that we are, you know, on some level, like I'm never totally bored because there's always something interesting. I find in the work or a new way of

47
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:21.120
Bonnie Burset: Thinking about something or something in supervision that kind of sparks. My, my, that part of my mind and but you know it is it is just like

48
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.940
Bonnie Burset: You know, I just keep trying to lean into things, and like

49
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:36.060
Bonnie Burset: Yeah work. I, I was just, I just found out that like there are health insurance quotes are going to be like

50
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.380
Bonnie Burset: 50% higher

51
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:49.710
Bonnie Burset: For the entire company because of my son because yeah because he has a chronic can well it's a few things I think cost will be higher for everybody across the board.

52
00:08:50.160 --> 00:09:00.810
Bonnie Burset: But it's some of it is about usage and because he's in the full time ABA therapy which is covered, mostly by insurance and it's like 50 to 100,000, I'm sure.

53
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:13.650
Bonnie Burset: In terms of therapy. So I mean, luckily the company I work for we've worked together for over like a small family. We've been working together for I've been with them 14 years they've been working like 20 some years so

54
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:25.200
Bonnie Burset: They're all they we all are very open, they know about my situation and and they were very supportive and very understanding of, like, no, we want to we may try to re evaluate insurance to try to do

55
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:34.200
Bonnie Burset: Something better for the company, but not not by any means to set, you know, like, you know, they were very supportive about all of it that it could be

56
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:42.750
Bonnie Burset: An issue affecting any of us, but it just is like it's just frustrating. It's the whole the whole system that's just frustrating where it's like

57
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:55.080
Bonnie Burset: Okay, well, like they want to charge us just to give you an idea as a small company were three people first of all three families. We all have well they have three kids, they're older and their kids are older.

58
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:05.940
Bonnie Burset: And I have to and worthy only families on the plan. They want to charge us the renewal rate, it will be 130 5000 a year.

59
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.370
Bonnie Burset: For the three of us.

60
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:23.460
Bonnie Burset: It's insane. Like, that's a whole like that's a whole like CEO level employee almost or like a whole, like, you know, it's crazy. Like it's it's a mind blowing, you know, and it's like

61
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:36.150
Bonnie Burset: You know, I don't know, it's just, I mean, I felt very grateful. It was kind of it yet another shock because I thought we were just talking about general renewal. I didn't realize that it was a special call because they were trying to prepare us for this.

62
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:49.140
Bonnie Burset: Likelihood that it's going to be raised significantly and I was kind of floored. You know, and, um, I guess they rate chronic conditions differently, you know, then they do like acute situations.

63
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.730
Bonnie Burset: But a new we were all saying it's kind of crazy. Like, what's the point of insurance if you're not supposed to use it like

64
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:07.020
Bonnie Burset: Like it, you know. Yeah, it is cheaper. I guess for the employee paying out of pocket, but in a small firm like ours, if they just pay me that money out right and like didn't pay my premiums, you know,

65
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:19.290
Bonnie Burset: Not really. I mean, it's still works out to my benefit, but I don't know. It just was crazy. So it's just like more leaning in to the challenges that just ongoing challenges and

66
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:29.820
Bonnie Burset: It just occurred to me like everything. It just reminded me and working with clients to always be keeping in mind. Any, anything that's going on right now, including like all the protests, we see

67
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:42.030
Bonnie Burset: You know, is against this backdrop of this this already stressful situation. It's like stress upon stress and just remembering that because like I almost kind of forgot

68
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:54.510
Bonnie Burset: And then after our conversation. I'm like, why this is so on wild about these hours. I mean, I know it's been really stressful for how many years now six years, will I will not, will I not get them but

69
00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:13.050
Bonnie Burset: Then I'm remembering it. Well, there's this whole other background of stress. That's kind of like constant, you know, just about this weird situation and, you know, luckily, I am feeling a little better about that. Like I'm feeling more like you know we just, you know, we had my son's

70
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:23.640
Bonnie Burset: Like therapists come in today. His instructor for four hours, and we did the best we could. And I'm getting better. I'm getting to a place where I'm like, not feeling like every

71
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.330
Bonnie Burset: Like, second is life or death. You know where it's like

72
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:36.750
Bonnie Burset: Okay well we're going to do the best we can. Here I'm going to what we're wearing masks. She's wearing masks. We're keeping distance as much as we can. And the housekeeping lots of ventilation.

73
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:47.700
Bonnie Burset: We're not using the bathroom. She's using you know like writing things down. And that's all we can do. I mean, it's not worth sabotaging my son's therapy for what, how many years like year

74
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.550
Bonnie Burset: Who knows, so I feel kind of better about that, that like, you know,

75
00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:04.050
Bonnie Burset: Do I feel like I would want to be sitting with clients right now. Probably not. I'm not there, but it's hard to know. It's just so

76
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:10.830
Bonnie Burset: Weird this whole thing and I see it affecting you know my clients the adult clients are are

77
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:17.610
Bonnie Burset: Are okay you know doing things by phone or by video. I think they kind of in some ways prefer it.

78
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:25.800
Bonnie Burset: But the kids are just like you know one of them, email me and say, Can we take a walk and you wear a mask and we see you walk six feet apart.

79
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.580
Bonnie Burset: The kid who is having trouble attending because like I realized for him like

80
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:41.100
Bonnie Burset: He's frustrated. He therapy does actually mean a lot to him, I think, and he just is fighting himself when we're online to use it. He's been doing better with it, but I think

81
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:51.300
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think it's a struggle for the kids are totally burnt out of video. Like, I get it, you know, and because their whole life right now is on video and

82
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.100
Bonnie Burset: I'm

83
00:13:54.210 --> 00:14:02.970
Bonnie Burset: You know, I forget that it's been helpful to remember. You know, I've been bringing up with them, you know, this is your time to be a kid and you're

84
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:10.530
Bonnie Burset: You know, like I forget how meaningful those moments of graduation even like one client was telling me about like

85
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:22.770
Bonnie Burset: You know how her little sister is going to start sixth grade in the fall, but if they're not there. She's not going to have the experience of like going to different classes because maybe they'll be all in one room and in smaller groups and

86
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:37.800
Bonnie Burset: Everything's going to be different. And, you know, feeling like this is her eighth grade year, and you know she's not even going to really be able to have the eighth grade experience, you know, and it's you know it's it's really interesting.

87
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:40.920
Bonnie Burset: And

88
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.500
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, it's, uh,

89
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.810
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, so, remembering all of that and I think

90
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:57.930
Bonnie Burset: Just definitely the mindfulness piece or like the meditation piece that I really want to in green. I'm trying to look at

91
00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:06.990
Bonnie Burset: Other things that kind of make me grounded, like maybe, you know, I like reading before I go to bed and just things that are more quiet, of course, I love to watch TV.

92
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.840
Bonnie Burset: But I never get that time with the kids. By the time the kids go to bed. So it's sometimes it's hard sometimes it's like

93
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:25.590
Bonnie Burset: You know, right now, especially myself care like I've been on the go, since this morning. I haven't even really spend time with my kids today. And I've been home the whole day. But it's just with work and everything else and

94
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.250
Bonnie Burset: You know, it's, it's

95
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.620
Bonnie Burset: It's

96
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:40.440
Bonnie Burset: Such a mixed bag. I think so much of it. And also what I'm trying to work with, with clients is, you know, kind of that.

97
00:15:41.970 --> 00:16:00.090
Bonnie Burset: You know, I'm thinking of DB T, but it's just the piece around the both and you know there's there's really great things about this experience. And there's really crappy things about being this experience like I love being with my kids and having this time with them. And it's really hard.

98
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:10.980
Bonnie Burset: It's all day and managing everything else and having this time with them, you know, I mean, everybody. I think it's, it helps me to remember like

99
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:23.340
Bonnie Burset: It's not surprising when people drop down a few levels in their coping for em, whatever that looks like for clients you know I've definitely seen that with some of my older clients who, you know,

100
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:31.080
Bonnie Burset: Are now going in and out of having a pretty hard time, you know, we're kind of just

101
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:43.590
Bonnie Burset: devolving in some ways or kind of, you know, like one of my clients is, you know, it has an included mushrooms and his, his therapeutic practice and I'm

102
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:59.310
Bonnie Burset: You know, it's like, you know, you just and there's only so much you get, you know, like people. I don't want to say they're going off the rails, because I think they're there was that period. And I feel like now people are kind of getting used to it, but it's still people are not

103
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.420
Bonnie Burset: You know, it's not it's not back to normal. For sure. And people are

104
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.690
Bonnie Burset: Wearing where they are, um,

105
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:16.290
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's not back to normal. And it's probably not going to be back to normal for a while.

106
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:29.160
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, and I think that we have probably a good six to eight or six months to a year being really wonky. Yeah, and

107
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.620
Shawn Phalen: I mean, I don't know, I could be wrong, but I think that

108
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.050
Shawn Phalen: For me mentally I've kind of prepared myself.

109
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.910
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, I think it how

110
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.400
Bonnie Burset: It's like, Mm hmm.

111
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:58.890
Shawn Phalen: I think that, you know, when this whole thing started with this, with this virus. I think that I was in denial because I I said me to remember thinking to myself when like

112
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.000
Shawn Phalen: California, close it was closing down and then you know New York and

113
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.770
Shawn Phalen: I was like, well, we're not gonna do that. Are we, you know,

114
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.400
When I

115
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:18.090
Shawn Phalen: Will Arizona's for it. We're just not can do that, you know, that's just our we're going to do what we did.

116
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.290
Bonnie Burset: So I was definitely in a space of

117
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.200
Shawn Phalen: Nobody is on the road like I'm

118
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:43.890
Shawn Phalen: People are really taking this seriously like I was driving into work and I was listening to the radio and they were talking about how over staying home. Well, I was, you know, going in and I'm like, well, there's no traffic.

119
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.270
Bonnie Burset: So are we really doing this.

120
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:56.580
Shawn Phalen: And so once I got past that and then you know working from home and creating this completely new routine.

121
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.020
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, totally.

122
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.680
Shawn Phalen: And I'm lucky because I've worked from home before and I really like it. I

123
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.070
Actually

124
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.240
Bonnie Burset: I don't like going into an office.

125
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:17.880
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, I don't like having to commute. I just don't like that. So yeah, the transition was, I think, a lot easier than it was for other people because

126
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.370
Shawn Phalen: I you know I do my night clients like you know it's like I know

127
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.000
Bonnie Burset: It's great.

128
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.560
Shawn Phalen: Like my days were really structured

129
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:44.700
Shawn Phalen: For this stuff even happened. And so for me, like, nothing, nothing really changed except I don't get to see my co workers face to face. And so my like everything else is just kind of

130
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.730
falling into place. If you love

131
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.560
Bonnie Burset: Oh,

132
00:19:52.080 --> 00:20:10.890
Shawn Phalen: I just mentally prepared myself for okay like this is going to be. We're in for the long haul. And I don't have any control over this, but I am what I've said to you what i do have control over is how I protect myself.

133
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:27.870
Bonnie Burset: Like distance where I choose to go how I choose to do self care, you know, all that stuff. And so for me this whole experience has been really simplifying my life. Mm hmm.

134
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:34.620
Shawn Phalen: I'm cool with that because I'm kind of in a place where that's really appealing for me.

135
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.670
Bonnie Burset: Mm hmm. That's not the case for everybody, you know,

136
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:50.490
Bonnie Burset: And you know your situation is obviously very different than mine and your semester are different and you've got a lot going on under your roof, you know,

137
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.950
Bonnie Burset: And so

138
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.840
If you can, you're right. If you lean and

139
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:07.560
Shawn Phalen: And you know that there's there's more than one way to address a problem or

140
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.360
Shawn Phalen: There's not just one way. That's gonna work.

141
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.610
Bonnie Burset: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

142
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:21.150
Shawn Phalen: So like if you remain open to the possibilities.

143
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.350
Mm hmm.

144
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.680
And you have faith.

145
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.530
Shawn Phalen: And you just know that

146
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:40.530
Bonnie Burset: It's gonna work out. Mm hmm. It's gonna work out. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

147
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.450
Shawn Phalen: So you getting your hours it's going to work out.

148
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.260
Shawn Phalen: Mm hmm. Having somebody come in to

149
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.530
Bonnie Burset: You know, do the therapy with your son is gonna work out. Yeah, yeah.

150
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.350
Bonnie Burset: And actually, you know, I'm surprised that

151
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:10.170
Bonnie Burset: I actually, it's kind of like, you know, sometimes when I think of anxiety and avoidance, you know, it actually was better to have that experience because now it's not so scary like

152
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:19.740
Bonnie Burset: I felt like, you know, but yet, some things are scary. It's interesting because like over the weekend, my son, my, my son loves to be outside with his dad. He loves being outside

153
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:32.310
Bonnie Burset: And we have a neighbor who their grandparents and but they take care of their I forget their situation but there. They take care of their grandkids were about the same age as our kids.

154
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:40.350
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, every once, twice a month, something like that, once a month and I came outside and I saw the little boy playing with my son.

155
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:49.200
Bonnie Burset: And I was kind of freaked out because I think they're from San Diego, or I don't know they don't live here. I don't know where they live. And I just, you know,

156
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:55.380
Bonnie Burset: Then it was such a mixed feeling because on one hand it's so exciting to see my son being social

157
00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.750
Bonnie Burset: Because it's a big deal for him to learn how to it because he's with his brother, they're kind of fighting, you know,

158
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:11.070
Bonnie Burset: You know the he just my son is like my oldest son is kind of just he's interested in older boys, I think, like, you know, he hasn't played with a playmate in a long time.

159
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:19.830
Bonnie Burset: And so, and especially because social issues are always. I mean, apparently he's so pretty. Very, very socially motivated, which is a good thing.

160
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:32.520
Bonnie Burset: But it's still, you know, probably not as much as other kids. So whenever you see it. We definitely like you know it's hard not to encourage it. When you see him. Laughing And playing and trying to initiate a game is a big deal.

161
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:39.120
Bonnie Burset: Right, you know, and so part of me was like, Oh, that's great. And the other part of is like cringing because I'm like

162
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:56.460
Bonnie Burset: Because you see the kids just get this close to each other, you know, like they don't have any sense of space or boundaries or and I said to my husband, you know, we just have really got to be careful. You know, like we just don't know. You know, they have no kids have no way of filtering.

163
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.430
Bonnie Burset: And what they're passing and

164
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:06.960
Bonnie Burset: You know, we just have to be extra careful. I don't really want him playing with anyone just yet. And it's sad. It's so sad to say that, but

165
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:20.160
Bonnie Burset: You know, so that situation, definitely did not feel okay but like her coming today and hearing talking to her about how she's been managing and seeing this stuff's washing her hands frequently made me feel better and

166
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:29.820
Bonnie Burset: You know, you just as you try these newest normal ways of dealing with things. You know, I think it actually helps

167
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:41.100
Shawn Phalen: I think that was an important step because then it can, you know, you get into the routine of it and it will hopefully reduce your anxiety.

168
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:59.820
Bonnie Burset: Because I truly believe that as long as those actions are being taken. Yeah, I think that you're you're saying, yeah, yeah. And so it's it's also kind of moving in that direction of okay now let's move to the next stage here.

169
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:06.600
And basic lockdown isolation for going on almost three months.

170
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:14.550
Bonnie Burset: Now we have to move forward with life. Right. Optionally, and we do it safely.

171
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:32.550
Bonnie Burset: Because don't take that next step in your what happens. Yeah, and I'm a little scared about that. I do think that, you know, certainly. I mean, the protests, I get are valid, I get it. Totally. And it's also frightening on a whole other level to see like I like

172
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:40.950
Bonnie Burset: To know this just the timing of everything. And it's just so it'll be interesting to see what happens with that. Yeah.

173
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.180
Shawn Phalen: Like right now, the media is very focused on the riots in the looting.

174
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:46.800
Bonnie Burset: Right, the

175
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.930
Shawn Phalen: Viruses way in the background. Now,

176
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.140
Bonnie Burset: Yes, it will be interesting to see, well,

177
00:25:52.200 --> 00:26:01.050
Shawn Phalen: Okay, how we kind of reached the peak here are. We are. They are we seeing increased cases.

178
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:21.330
Bonnie Burset: Gonna go i'm gonna i'm curious to see ya in almost every major city. We've had this rioting and looting and no social distancing with here. You know, we've had so um yeah I want to. I'm curious about that, like how yeah

179
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:31.950
Bonnie Burset: I think that will be very telling. Yeah, definitely about whether you know we need to dial things back or it's okay to keep going and

180
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:45.300
Bonnie Burset: Just get a gauge of. Yeah, I hear you. I think preparing for the long haul really is helpful, because I think one thing that affected me too, and I was talking to my supervisor on Friday for our regular call she was saying.

181
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:57.360
Bonnie Burset: You know, like she just really thinks this is going to be with us for a few years. This isn't going to be even with a vaccine, she was saying like the flu vaccines only what 50% effective 60% on a good year.

182
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:06.270
Bonnie Burset: I mean, the reality is if it behaves like a flu and you know like even a vaccine isn't going to, like, in my mind, it kind of like

183
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:16.590
Bonnie Burset: It's funny, the things we tell ourselves like you're saying like the can't happen here. You know, like in my mind I was like oh vaccine. Well, we just have to get to the vaccine. And then this is all going to be

184
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.790
Bonnie Burset: We can just throw our masks off and just go back to life and

185
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:30.600
Bonnie Burset: The reality is like when I'm when and when she says that rationally online. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Like why would I think didn't even have a vaccine for HIV. I'm for God's sake.

186
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:44.940
Bonnie Burset: So why would I think that like there's guaranteed next year to be some 100% vaccine for this. And, you know, especially given that act. I mean, it is kind of a flu of a kind. You know, like are in that family.

187
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.820
Bonnie Burset: And so it's like, yeah, I mean, and when I think of it that way as kind of like

188
00:27:52.800 --> 00:28:11.160
Bonnie Burset: It's scarier. On one hand, because there's this almost inevitability that I'll get it at some point. And yet, there's all there's another piece that's kind of like wall. There's no you know like I I don't run out to get the flu, but I don't like

189
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:28.470
Bonnie Burset: You know, change you. And it's somewhere in between. Right. Yeah. Obviously, it's more lethal. It seems like, then the flu, for sure, but it's like, and I would I get my flu shot. So I definitely am not trying to get the flu either but I realized like, there is a

190
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.180
Bonnie Burset: You know, a part of this were like you kind of have to did have kind of helped to think about it. And in terms of the long haul, like

191
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:48.750
Bonnie Burset: You know, if I don't allow an instructor my home for a month for a year. What will that that doesn't even change anything. So, you know, if we're kind of just preparing for that.

192
00:28:49.680 --> 00:29:00.510
Bonnie Burset: And then, you know, like you were saying with everything. It's about reevaluating risk at every stage like you know by that theory I should run back into therapy office, especially

193
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:12.420
Bonnie Burset: Those in person hours and yet that's still feels a little, like, I don't know how to do that safely. Right. Um, you know, that's a tough one.

194
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.110
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

195
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.230
Bonnie Burset: Those rooms are not really designed for that.

196
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.460
Bonnie Burset: Thank you there. Yeah, yeah.

197
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:36.360
Shawn Phalen: And I'm personally I'm not there yet either. I'm not rushing back to. I'm not saying, yay, you know, we're going to go back to the office, like I'm not, I don't want to catch this, okay.

198
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:36.750
Bonnie Burset: Yeah.

199
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.300
Shawn Phalen: You know, but but yeah I'm not

200
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:51.210
Bonnie Burset: No, I don't want to go back to my office, either. I don't think I need a little bit more time. Yeah, and more safety. I mean, I think the hard part is to like

201
00:29:51.660 --> 00:30:03.330
Bonnie Burset: You know, it's just hard to know. Like, like I was trying to explain to my young client, although I have heard from my supervisor that someone she knows is taking walks with our clients, you know, but

202
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:13.560
Bonnie Burset: And that's fine. But it raises. First of all, I'm thinking like within a 10 year old like I'm sorry if you're wearing a mask and I'm wearing a mask and we're six feet apart. I'm not gonna hear what you're saying.

203
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:23.970
Bonnie Burset: It's gonna be all muffled like it's like it just sounds like playing telephone. Like, I don't, I don't really think that would work out the way we think it would, in theory, but

204
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:29.760
Bonnie Burset: But on the other hand, it's like, that's part of the problem, too, is I can envision like

205
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:37.470
Bonnie Burset: As everything's changing. I mean restaurants are changing the way that they're doing things they're changing, you know, distance like you know like

206
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:43.650
Bonnie Burset: The instructor, because I haven't been to a grocery store in three months. So I don't know what they're like right now and my

207
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:52.530
Bonnie Burset: The instructor came was explaining to me. Oh no, they only let a certain number of people in in a time you have to wait in a line in the parking lot. They have taped set up for

208
00:30:52.890 --> 00:31:05.490
Bonnie Burset: How, and I'm like, Oh my God, it just was so weird to think about. You said that the cashiers have plexiglass and I was like, what, you know, it's just it was astounding to me how much the world that changed in three months.

209
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.190
Bonnie Burset: And even the grocery store because I haven't been out

210
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:20.190
Bonnie Burset: And it just made me realize that you know what I think there was kind of a fantasy. I had about all these things being short term just in place, till we get through this.

211
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:34.710
Bonnie Burset: And it may not look like that. It may be what our kids grow up with, you know, or like it may be, what, you know, just a new way of living, where people are more aware of things that passed between them and

212
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:42.120
Bonnie Burset: I don't know. It just was a strange thought and it made me realize though that therapy is a tricky one because

213
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:50.160
Bonnie Burset: It's just the space certain spaces like office spaces can be pretty easily adapted to meet like safety criteria. Right.

214
00:31:50.730 --> 00:32:00.900
Bonnie Burset: It's tough with therapy and even I didn't get into it with my young client. But one thing I said was, well, it's kind of tough to meet outside an office because we have certain confidentiality issues.

215
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:16.140
Bonnie Burset: You know, which I mean I guess people could sign waivers and they could do the do it. That could be part of informed consent. I guess to do outdoor but it changes the whole dynamic of therapy. There's no denying that you know like

216
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:21.210
Bonnie Burset: It, it really changes how safe people feel sharing their information.

217
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:31.110
Bonnie Burset: It changed. You know, it's so hard to think of the therapy office, especially, even with kids like it's hard to think about

218
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.350
Bonnie Burset: How it can be adapted to be more

219
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:45.810
Bonnie Burset: Especially because it's it's 15 minutes of sitting across from someone talking

220
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.430
Bonnie Burset: So I think it's see you know the sand trays and the tour. Oh, yeah.

221
00:32:53.940 --> 00:33:03.120
Bonnie Burset: That's that becomes a lot more complicated. Yeah, you know, and that might. Fortunately, have to be show. Yeah.

222
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.940
Bonnie Burset: You know, I, I just bought my sandbox to it's at the office.

223
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:25.800
Bonnie Burset: There's a therapist leaving. I bought all his stuff. And I'm like, oh, I bought maybe at some point I should go get it at least my kids can enjoy it. But yeah, it's like, I'm not going to be wiping. You know how many figurines my kids use. I'm not gonna be wiping down 50 horses for

224
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.930
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's just not very realistic it

225
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.490
Bonnie Burset: Is Yeah, looks like.

226
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:40.200
Shawn Phalen: You know, CDC guidelines for supposed to sanitize you know every time somebody sits in a chair, somebody

227
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.800
Bonnie Burset: Wow, or you know every time.

228
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:53.130
Shawn Phalen: You know, or do it every two hours or however it just depends on what kind of business who are, you know, so it doesn't really

229
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.670
Shawn Phalen: It presents a problem, it

230
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:06.990
Bonnie Burset: Boys Sam tres you know Kranz marker right type projects.

231
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.900
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's just kind of like God. You know, it's

232
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.660
You know, how do you get

233
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:26.370
Bonnie Burset: You know, how do you get creative. You can, you know, it's like, yeah, people can bring their own things or. Yeah. But even then, yeah, it's

234
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.000
Bonnie Burset: Tricky.

235
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.780
Bonnie Burset: And my biggest issue is even, like, there's that.

236
00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:41.280
Bonnie Burset: But then there's just like the act of being in a small room for 15 minutes like, you know, it's just it's a tough one. Even with masks on that still seems

237
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.160
Bonnie Burset: Tough and

238
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.170
Bonnie Burset: You know, maybe I'm just

239
00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:57.060
Shawn Phalen: You know, and I just, you know, it could be wrong but I kind of have this feeling like, yeah, I just don't think that she put me going back. I don't know that she'll be going back to the office system.

240
00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.790
Bonnie Burset: Yeah yeah

241
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:05.970
Shawn Phalen: I don't know that that can happen again. I, you know, that's just a complete guess on my part.

242
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.840
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, you know, I'm just kinda kind of talking here but

243
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:18.570
Again, you know, kind of leaning in and just kind of being really open to

244
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.350
Shawn Phalen: What that looks

245
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.610
Like and yeah

246
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:30.750
Shawn Phalen: You know, if it and if you're not going back until the end of summer. Okay.

247
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.700
Shawn Phalen: Okay, what's that look like now.

248
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.380
Shawn Phalen: Papers that can be, I don't know, there's just all these these questions and

249
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.380
Shawn Phalen: But, you know, of course, you know, this is the new norm.

250
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.690
Yeah. About like the new

251
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.590
Shawn Phalen: The new norm and will definitely be here for the end of the year, I think.

252
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.920
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, for sure. For sure.

253
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.390
So,

254
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.180
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's just constantly making those adjustments.

255
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:13.560
Bonnie Burset: Yeah.

256
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.270
Shawn Phalen: If you're able to have that flexibility within yourself.

257
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:28.650
Shawn Phalen: That attachment to the way you think it should be or the way you you know want it to be.

258
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:36.150
Bonnie Burset: Yeah. Then, and that's the weird part. Yeah, like I'm not

259
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.380
Bonnie Burset: I'm sorry, go ahead.

260
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:49.140
Shawn Phalen: You know, like, kind of trying to move through this will be a little bit easier because you're not going to be so attached to one way of doing things that you think is the only way

261
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.360
Shawn Phalen: So it's

262
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.010
Shawn Phalen: You know, it can be tricky. As long as you're

263
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:00.810
Shawn Phalen: Thankful

264
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:04.890
Shawn Phalen: Where you're taking

265
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.320
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, for sure.

266
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.210
Bonnie Burset: And I think to like

267
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:18.060
Bonnie Burset: You know, like, I'm not even sure like you're saying like, where I want to be like there's there's things I really love about working from home that

268
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.780
Bonnie Burset: You know,

269
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.970
Bonnie Burset: I'm not sad to change.

270
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:21.960
Bonnie Burset: You know, and maybe

271
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:30.780
Bonnie Burset: You know, I'm just thinking outside the box. But maybe there's ways for me to learn how to maybe it's the structure of Telehealth that

272
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:36.960
Bonnie Burset: Is your this my sessions that could be different, like maybe if I added a little more structure or

273
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.070
Bonnie Burset: In terms of like

274
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:44.130
Bonnie Burset: Like we've talked about like a certain like time, you know, certain kind of structure flow to a session.

275
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.560
Bonnie Burset: But maybe even just like I'm thinking

276
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.450
Bonnie Burset: Outside the box like I've been trying to end on you like what we talked about goals for the week or

277
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.230
Bonnie Burset: Things that

278
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.380
Bonnie Burset: You know, just kind of book ending it or because like

279
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:05.730
Bonnie Burset: Video is so n sessions in person or like this, too, but it's still kind of free flowing like maybe just like helping clients kind of focus their attention.

280
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.840
Bonnie Burset: To certain kind of

281
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.140
Bonnie Burset: Book ended. You know, like, I don't know, like

282
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.760
Bonnie Burset: I don't want to say rituals, but like, I don't know. I'm just thinking like maybe there's ways that I can

283
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.870
Bonnie Burset: Work better

284
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.130
Bonnie Burset: Or learn

285
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.790
Bonnie Burset: To be a better tell a therapist then then

286
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.430
Bonnie Burset: You know, in person.

287
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:32.970
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and that's a really good way of looking at it because I, I believe, and I believe this House health is the wave of the future.

288
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:42.450
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, for sure. I just, I feel like this is going to be something that it's not going to go away. Yeah.

289
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.680
Like

290
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.140
And

291
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:56.070
Shawn Phalen: Like I for me personally, I hope it doesn't go away and I mean I'm also talking cuz I work with adult I don't work with kids. Oh.

292
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.000
Yeah.

293
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.720
Bonnie Burset: And I got

294
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.440
Yeah, it's real.

295
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.390
Shawn Phalen: Challenging

296
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.790
Bonnie Burset: Wow. Yeah. And it's tricky because your

297
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.270
Bonnie Burset: Participation is so different, you know, like we do like whiteboard.

298
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.420
Bonnie Burset: Pictionary that's been pretty successful actually

299
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.440
Bonnie Burset: But like, you know, it's really hard to

300
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.680
Bonnie Burset: I mean, actually, for the most part it's worked

301
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:34.170
Bonnie Burset: Better than I thought it would. I thought I would lose a lot. I just didn't think it could really work out. Shockingly, like a lot, especially like my age group. Like, I think it's hardest with the younger the youngest ones.

302
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.860
Bonnie Burset: You know the between the age, I want to say, of like my like

303
00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.420
Bonnie Burset: Kind of pre teens like

304
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:44.880
Bonnie Burset: Between the age of, you know, like well preteen yeah like 10 to 12

305
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:49.740
Bonnie Burset: They're actually, it actually is fine because they're I maybe because they're more verbal

306
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.490
Bonnie Burset: That

307
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.920
Bonnie Burset: You know, um, I mean,

308
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.450
Bonnie Burset: Not that there aren't like

309
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.830
Bonnie Burset: Challenges like I'm saying with that one client.

310
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.610
Bonnie Burset: You know where he's distracted, you know, but um

311
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.160
Bonnie Burset: And the younger client, you know, I think it's just so maybe you know

312
00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.580
Bonnie Burset: It looks different. Maybe I think I you know what I think it is too.

313
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.750
Bonnie Burset: I'm just thinking

314
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.190
Bonnie Burset: Thinking Out Loud as we're talking that maybe the structure really needs to change for kids.

315
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.900
Bonnie Burset: And I don't have a lot of flexibility.

316
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.050
Shawn Phalen: With

317
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.850
Bonnie Burset: I feel like my supervisor is

318
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.680
Bonnie Burset: Trying to just get through things

319
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.010
Shawn Phalen: Like

320
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:35.310
Bonnie Burset: I think her style is definitely an office isn't in she kind of feels like we should be we're doing the best we can but kind of trying to translate everything we do in office to online in terms of like

321
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.960
Shawn Phalen: But it has to be different. Right.

322
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.780
Bonnie Burset: Like it just especially maybe for the adults are more

323
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.210
Bonnie Burset: Since it is more verbal, um, you know, maybe that can translate more

324
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.790
Bonnie Burset: More apples to apples. But I think with kids, you know, maybe their sessions do need to be half an

325
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:57.960
Bonnie Burset: Hour, maybe, maybe there. There has to be some adjustment for their attention span and like that's different than in person when

326
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:02.760
Bonnie Burset: You are playing with them and you're able to kind of engage them in a in a different way. I mean, it's just

327
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.360
Bonnie Burset: Really hard to

328
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.650
Bonnie Burset: Play with kids.

329
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.250
Bonnie Burset: Or even like if you're doing process comments like

330
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.500
Bonnie Burset: Are they listening who knows, you know, they're

331
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.750
Bonnie Burset: Still because you're not really there. You're

332
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.830
Bonnie Burset: There but you're not there. It's a different venue, you know,

333
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.170
Shawn Phalen: I wonder if there's any

334
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.270
Shawn Phalen: Have you, have you tried

335
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:31.110
Shawn Phalen: Like Googling or doing some research on telephone for kids.

336
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.280
And no

337
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.440
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, maybe.

338
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.610
It's try and find something like maybe

339
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:48.120
Shawn Phalen: There's some information like actually people like giving their own comments about

340
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.900
Bonnie Burset: What yeah

341
00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.200
Shawn Phalen: Their experience with it with this whole thing changing

342
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:59.280
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. And, um, you know, seeing if there's anything interesting that you can

343
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.720
Bonnie Burset: Find them online and then

344
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.180
Shawn Phalen: If there's not a lot like maybe even go on Amazon and there's a book.

345
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.090
Bonnie Burset: Out there, you know, like

346
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.880
Shawn Phalen: Tele health for kids.

347
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:20.970
Shawn Phalen: Email, just to try and just to get some ideas about like what other people. You know what they're

348
00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:33.540
Shawn Phalen: Experiencing to like what their barriers are and how they're working through it and what works for them. What doesn't work for them because I think that you you hit on something where maybe the structure

349
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.330
Of this sessions needs to be different.

350
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.530
No, I don't know what that was. He

351
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:46.860
Shawn Phalen: You know,

352
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.150
Shawn Phalen: It might have to be

353
00:42:52.740 --> 00:43:03.090
Shawn Phalen: Like face, you know, everybody's different. Right. So every session like to feel a little bit different, where you start off one way was fun and then

354
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.740
Shawn Phalen: And differently. I don't know. I'm kind of talking about last year.

355
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.430
Shawn Phalen: And I'm curious like because you're not the only person that

356
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:16.170
Bonnie Burset: You

357
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.470
Shawn Phalen: Are having this conversation, you're not the only

358
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.760
Shawn Phalen: And you know booking most of my work as well. Right. You know, adult so it's

359
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:35.100
Bonnie Burset: Which eventually I would prefer like it definitely if I have my own practice like

360
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.570
Bonnie Burset: I would love to, like,

361
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:42.420
Bonnie Burset: Be honing the skills to, like, you know, it would be there be a lot of flexibility and being

362
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:49.890
Bonnie Burset: Kind of a tele health practitioner, especially if I need to kind of keep my foot in another job financially for at least

363
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.800
Bonnie Burset: I don't know how long. But, you know,

364
00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:58.320
Bonnie Burset: This gives me a lot of flexibility that I can you know I don't have the overhead. I mean, even in the Bay Area.

365
00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.490
Shawn Phalen: renting an office.

366
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:05.070
Bonnie Burset: Is not cheap. Like most people do one day a week anyway and like stagger with someone, or like

367
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.560
Bonnie Burset: Because you can't have your i mean it's it's

368
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.150
Bonnie Burset: Pretty prohibitive, and a lot of ways, like in terms of what you actually

369
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:19.770
Bonnie Burset: You know, like I it just, it just, it just binds you in a certain way that like, you know, financially, like

370
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:20.280
Bonnie Burset: You know,

371
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.300
Shawn Phalen: I don't know, it just

372
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:26.220
Bonnie Burset: I feel like there could be a lot of opportunities and, you know, if I

373
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:31.560
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think it's interesting because I what made me think of it is when you're talking about acceptance and like

374
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:40.560
Bonnie Burset: You know, I think it's interesting, my supervisor kind of had a real gut reaction. I think it was really hard for her to go to Tele health because I think she has a

375
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.750
Bonnie Burset: bias toward traditional therapy and

376
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.480
Bonnie Burset: Office sessions and you know that

377
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.410
Bonnie Burset: Kind of

378
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.890
Bonnie Burset: The authenticity and I just agree with that. I think, I think it's a

379
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.210
Bonnie Burset: Different way of working. It doesn't have to be less than way of working. I think

380
00:44:54.510 --> 00:45:00.540
Bonnie Burset: You got to play to the strengths of the medium that you have. And I think there's, you know, I don't know what that is.

381
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:13.440
Bonnie Burset: But I think there's a way to do it. I think there's a way to, for example, I'm just thinking while we're talking I'm even thinking about couples therapy because I miss doing couples work. That's something I would love to get back into

382
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:18.300
Bonnie Burset: I really love EFT and that's kind of what I enjoy

383
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.590
Bonnie Burset: Working with most

384
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.950
Bonnie Burset: Men and just because my supervisor is kind of more known with

385
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.930
Bonnie Burset: Kids, she doesn't get tons

386
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.910
Bonnie Burset: Of couples or some individual

387
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:27.570
Bonnie Burset: Adults, but

388
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:32.400
Bonnie Burset: Mostly you know she gets a lot more child referrals. But if I were on my own.

389
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.320
Bonnie Burset: Which presumably someday I will be yeah um

390
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.890
Bonnie Burset: You know, um, you know, like, you think about the benefits of

391
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.710
Bonnie Burset: Like couples, let's say not being in the same room like

392
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.530
Bonnie Burset: Maybe there's an advantage to that. You know what I mean, like,

393
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.960
Bonnie Burset: We're not being physically present being in the, you know,

394
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.410
Bonnie Burset: Having

395
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.450
Bonnie Burset: I don't know. I'm thinking out loud, but like

396
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.530
Bonnie Burset: There's gonna be things that can be it's different, not less. And just, there's got to be ways to leverage

397
00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.820
Bonnie Burset: The benefits of it.

398
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.520
Bonnie Burset: For example, like my team is a good example.

399
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.000
Bonnie Burset: I think she did okay in the office.

400
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.920
Bonnie Burset: I'm trying to think if we didn't have that many sessions and we

401
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.070
Bonnie Burset: Had

402
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:12.090
Bonnie Burset: Quite a few.

403
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.610
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, I just feel like she's done really well with the

404
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.680
Bonnie Burset: Phone because she goes in the car.

405
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.160
Bonnie Burset: In outside her house and it's her private space.

406
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:20.790
Shawn Phalen: And

407
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.850
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, I just feel like something for her.

408
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.470
Um,

409
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:32.310
Bonnie Burset: Either was the same, or even better, I can't say there was any last ground there, you know, and

410
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:34.860
Bonnie Burset: With

411
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:43.650
Bonnie Burset: Different adult clients it was different. I think with the other two. It's been okay but I would prefer to see them in session just because you get more information.

412
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.950
Bonnie Burset: Yeah, because they opted to do by phone.

413
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:53.430
Bonnie Burset: Video which changes things. You know, you lose your eyes in a certain way or some of your senses.

414
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.610
Bonnie Burset: But if you're doing poorly video

415
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.170
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, like, I'm thinking, you know, maybe I won't ever like maybe I will decide to do

416
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.970
Bonnie Burset: Purely video and try to

417
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:03.390
Shawn Phalen: Make

418
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.340
Bonnie Burset: A niche in that somehow or, you know, I don't. Not that there isn't one.

419
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:14.250
Bonnie Burset: Because I mean, most people now have to have, I would think you have to have the ability to work.

420
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.540
Bonnie Burset: But I'm just thinking like there's options.

421
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.730
Bonnie Burset: There, there is, um,

422
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.470
Bonnie Burset: There's something to be mind here.

423
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.120
Bonnie Burset: That's what I'm thinking.

424
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.330
Bonnie Burset: And, you know, maybe for you. It's just honing your skills.

425
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:50.310
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you know, and cuz I do like I said before I do really believe that it is going to be the wave of the future because you're looking at is your you're able to capture people, number one, that have the means to try to your location.

426
00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:58.740
Bonnie Burset: Right, how these astronomical around that people pay attention. I, you know,

427
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.840
Shawn Phalen: All of that is going to be changing.

428
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.010
Yeah.

429
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.750
You know,

430
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.280
So I think that um

431
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:16.410
Shawn Phalen: And making it easier to to meet with with clients and

432
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.500
Shawn Phalen: That doesn't necessarily mean that

433
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.030
Bonnie Burset: Hey, right. What do you think about like

434
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:28.170
Bonnie Burset: I'm curious about what you when you're saying that I'm just thinking of different ideas.

435
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.630
Bonnie Burset: When you're talking about accessing because I had this issue with a

436
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.530
Bonnie Burset: Client today.

437
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.880
Bonnie Burset: Where the mom.

438
00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.370
Bonnie Burset: Has asked to

439
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.690
Bonnie Burset: To go every other week.

440
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.610
Bonnie Burset: And you know, we don't do that.

441
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:40.770
Bonnie Burset: You know, and I get clinically why we

442
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.110
Bonnie Burset: Don't because I do believe that

443
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:44.580
Bonnie Burset: You know, unless the client is

444
00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:53.610
Bonnie Burset: transitioning out of therapy and it's kind of just a maintenance period it's it isn't necessarily therapeutic to do every other week. And it was for financial reasons not

445
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.140
Shawn Phalen: Not because the client.

446
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.310
Shawn Phalen: You know,

447
00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.570
Bonnie Burset: The client can benefit from every other week, but the mom was, you know, having

448
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:02.130
Bonnie Burset: Kind of money struggles and

449
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.190
Bonnie Burset: She's already at my lowest sliding scale, which is 50

450
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:06.450
Bonnie Burset: And so

451
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.380
Bonnie Burset: But I was really in a dilemma and it put my super you know I have to work under her

452
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:12.540
Bonnie Burset: Is I'm working under her license. So it's her

453
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.890
Bonnie Burset: Call on things like that. And, but I don't wanna lose the hour for me the money.

454
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.930
Bonnie Burset: means less than the hour, you know,

455
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:28.110
Bonnie Burset: Like because I'm, you know, and so, but I can't let that be a determination, either. Either way, the clients best interest is every week, whether it's with me or somebody else so

456
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:36.180
Bonnie Burset: You know, we, I talked to the mom today. And I just, I don't know. Sometimes it's a hard conversation because we're sliding scale, you don't really know the full

457
00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.110
Bonnie Burset: Picture and

458
00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.030
Bonnie Burset: You know, um,

459
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.560
Bonnie Burset: Are they just

460
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:44.490
Bonnie Burset: I don't know. It was kind of a weird feeling because I don't feel like

461
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.330
Shawn Phalen: But

462
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.550
Bonnie Burset: Kind of makes sense. And the way the mom.

463
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:54.210
Bonnie Burset: Is oriented and how that affects her relationship with her daughter, but like I just felt like there was a very little consciousness about

464
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.310
Bonnie Burset: My side of the relationship

465
00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:56.970
Shawn Phalen: Um,

466
00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.620
Bonnie Burset: You know, like, yeah, I appreciate, I understand, trying to get the cheapest therapy possible

467
00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.150
Bonnie Burset: You know,

468
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.970
Bonnie Burset: And I understand this city. Anyway, it was just, I was one of those conversations I had

469
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:09.720
Bonnie Burset: To kind of like

470
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:10.830
Bonnie Burset: Give myself a Briton.

471
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:13.170
Bonnie Burset: That not the conversation was fine, but

472
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.370
Bonnie Burset: You know,

473
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:20.100
Bonnie Burset: It's all about boundaries. Right. I do see why sometimes you can't you relax the frame.

474
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:24.450
Bonnie Burset: Because then you feel kind of resentful that your time is invaluable like you're

475
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.400
Bonnie Burset: Already doing way under

476
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:31.530
Bonnie Burset: You know, this is like my, you know, like, Come on, at a certain point I'm getting half of that, you know, like, which

477
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.280
Bonnie Burset: Your brain. Now, like I said, the hour is more important to me, but

478
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:39.360
Bonnie Burset: Anyway, so, but when you're saying like

479
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:44.850
Bonnie Burset: I'm thinking about this client and I'm hearing what you're saying. Thinking about clients that don't have the means like

480
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:46.980
Bonnie Burset: I was just talking

481
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.730
To

482
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.460
Bonnie Burset: Oh my son's case.

483
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:58.260
Bonnie Burset: Worker for the regional center. She also went to the school. I went to which is JFK, which is very well known in the Bay Area for like millions of therapists came out.

484
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:05.850
Bonnie Burset: I think I think they cranked out therapists throughout from the 80s, until now, well they close their eyes, she was saying she heard they're closing

485
00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.850
Bonnie Burset: I don't know. But when I was there, I was the last person.

486
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:17.460
Bonnie Burset: Or one of the last people therapist there when they had a community center which is where I did a lot of my training and my intern hours.

487
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.280
Bonnie Burset: And it was very low fee like

488
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.450
Bonnie Burset: 2020 bucks.

489
00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:27.450
Bonnie Burset: 25 bucks a session sliding scale. Some even coins paid 15. I mean, it's like unconscionable now.

490
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:36.360
Bonnie Burset: Like, it's not even imagine. You can't even at 10 $10, you know, and it was such I remember because she started talking about how

491
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:37.260
Shawn Phalen: It was so

492
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:43.290
Bonnie Burset: You know, she can't imagine where all those people when I'm saying, yeah, it was really hard wives, ending with clients at that time had trying to make

493
00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:45.990
Bonnie Burset: Referrals and I couldn't. There was nowhere for them to go.

494
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.670
Bonnie Burset: At the rates, that they were paying

495
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:50.730
Bonnie Burset: So, I mean, of course, you know, there's a limit to what I would do in

496
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.110
Bonnie Burset: Private practice but

497
00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.910
Bonnie Burset: You know, maybe there are

498
00:51:53.970 --> 00:52:03.600
Bonnie Burset: There is room for providing more at, you know, maybe, maybe you do offer for, I don't know if it's possible to offer like 40 minute sessions or something shorter and then people

499
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.010
Bonnie Burset: Who can't

500
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:05.910
Bonnie Burset: Can

501
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.400
Bonnie Burset: Only afford a certain amount can then

502
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.450
Bonnie Burset: Still leverage therapy. You know, like, but having like

503
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:16.830
Bonnie Burset: I don't know, maybe there's flexibility there because it's not driving to an office. I don't

504
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:17.880
Bonnie Burset: Have rent to

505
00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.520
Bonnie Burset: I don't know if you can do things that way.

506
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:23.220
Shawn Phalen: I don't know.

507
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.280
Bonnie Burset: Like cuz I'm curious when you do so I know like

508
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:31.560
Bonnie Burset: They offered half an hour sessions.

509
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:37.980
Bonnie Burset: You know and I know with insurance, you know, there's certain so I don't know if that's insurance. So can we as therapists dictate

510
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.320
Bonnie Burset: Half an hour sessions or that's not

511
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.710
Shawn Phalen: You know you can do it.

512
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:50.010
Shawn Phalen: Typically someone's in private practice. They're not going to do a half an hour, they're going to

513
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:58.650
Bonnie Burset: Write and 15 minutes right but depending on like appeared with sunshine insurance Panama.

514
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.460
Then you have more flexibility.

515
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:07.980
Bonnie Burset: There's flexibility like therapists to take insurance. Sure.

516
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.680
Shawn Phalen: I don't know, they might be able to do half hour sessions. I don't know. That's a really good question.

517
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:18.690
Bonnie Burset: Because that's a way to kind of combat to

518
00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:22.470
Bonnie Burset: Kind of, I would think there's a flexibility there that can be leveraged

519
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.450
Bonnie Burset: You know, because why our sessions.

520
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:30.990
Bonnie Burset: I mean, I can see why you would have sessions, especially with adults be 15 minutes because it's hard to cover a lot of ground in half an hour.

521
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:37.290
Bonnie Burset: Half an hour feels tough to me it seems hard to do more than kind of checking in half an hour.

522
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.330
Bonnie Burset: Canfield tough, but I feel like there's

523
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.710
Bonnie Burset: Some room.

524
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.280
Bonnie Burset: I don't know. I'm just thinking like yours. I'm just thinking of

525
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.930
Bonnie Burset: You know, you're saying like

526
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.810
Bonnie Burset: How we're talking about ways to give people access that

527
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.710
Bonnie Burset: May not have access. And I'm thinking, both in terms of money. And if it's

528
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:53.220
Not

529
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.890
Bonnie Burset: A cost to me.

530
00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.870
Bonnie Burset: To have to go somewhere or maintain rent or if I'm just or if I can offer less time

531
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:08.280
Bonnie Burset: So that my time isn't like my value isn't compromised, like you know in a in a way that I'm uncomfortable with, you know, like

532
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.210
Bonnie Burset: I'm thinking

533
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.500
Bonnie Burset: In theory, there should be

534
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.750
Bonnie Burset: More flexibility to kind of

535
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:21.120
Bonnie Burset: Have, win, win situations like that. I don't know. I mean, there is a good question. You know, I don't know, that's a really now.

536
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:33.330
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I mean I know for me, like the day job. I have with the clinic, like there's codes that we use because it's an insurance right

537
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.750
Right.

538
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.650
Shawn Phalen: You know, I know there is a code for 15 minutes

539
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:39.240
Bonnie Burset: Oh,

540
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:45.180
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I don't know what the what they charge for that.

541
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.840
Shawn Phalen: Right, know what what

542
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:56.910
Shawn Phalen: Is built returns for $15 so I don't know if it's a good question, you know.

543
00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.030
Bonnie Burset: And I think it will. This is forcing change. You know, like I

544
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.480
Shawn Phalen: Think

545
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.430
Bonnie Burset: I think in private practice.

546
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.890
Bonnie Burset: There is kind of a tradition around it so

547
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:09.240
Bonnie Burset: It's been that way because it's been like, I'm guessing that most Tele health came from insurance.

548
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.500
Shawn Phalen: I'm guessing it came

549
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.580
Bonnie Burset: As a result of insurance companies and trying to provide more

550
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:18.870
Bonnie Burset: You know, efficient care now private practice. I'm guessing is

551
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.630
Bonnie Burset: Going to be slow is is going to be just now.

552
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:25.740
Bonnie Burset: catching on to, like, you know, so I'm guessing there some like

553
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:31.650
Bonnie Burset: You know, like we're talking about, like, is it the medium or is it us that has to change. You know, like as therapists like

554
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.970
Bonnie Burset: You know and and

555
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:35.490
Bonnie Burset: And maybe people do private practice maybe

556
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.990
Bonnie Burset: Their expectations have to change of what therapy looks like or what

557
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.250
Bonnie Burset: You know, like

558
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:45.120
Bonnie Burset: Your friends that have at home.

559
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:48.000
Bonnie Burset: As private practice that's like they're

560
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.730
Bonnie Burset: They don't have an office like they don't do in person.

561
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.870
Shawn Phalen: At all. Well,

562
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.040
Both

563
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.660
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

564
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.110
Yeah.

565
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:57.390
Bonnie Burset: That makes sense.

566
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:05.010
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so I think and and what my one friend, and thank you, Abby, she's in California.

567
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:07.770
Shawn Phalen: So,

568
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.850
Bonnie Burset: I'm because I think you're right. It is the wave of the future.

569
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.460
Bonnie Burset: It's like, maybe it's it's

570
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:18.870
Bonnie Burset: therapist who have to adapt.

571
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:22.950
Bonnie Burset: And we weren't you know i mean granted like everything we were trained and taught to

572
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:26.040
Bonnie Burset: Do was in person like you know there's just a gap between

573
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.930
Bonnie Burset: You mean you look at the BBS their whole criteria was based on this concept that

574
00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:31.440
Shawn Phalen: Like

575
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:32.910
Bonnie Burset: You know, in person is

576
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:38.340
Bonnie Burset: The way that people do therapy and it's like that is changing. And, you know,

577
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.440
Bonnie Burset: I, I can't

578
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.940
Shawn Phalen: help but see that these are

579
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.900
Bonnie Burset: Skills that are

580
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.730
Bonnie Burset: Crucial to build on and

581
00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:48.150
Bonnie Burset: Have and it could mean that, like, for example, I mean that

582
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:54.720
Bonnie Burset: You know, would give me a lot of flexibility to so maybe it's just a question of me, learning how to be a better therapist.

583
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.190
Bonnie Burset: Over this

584
00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:06.930
Shawn Phalen: Medium. Yeah, you know, and it's like, I'm not going to say feel more comfortable doing it because I don't think that that's the issue for you. I think that it's just, you know,

585
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:20.520
Shawn Phalen: With kids, you know, you're just like, how do you do that, like, how do you, honey. I mean, not that you're not doing it but you know it's

586
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:21.900
Shawn Phalen: It's

587
00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:24.510
Bonnie Burset: It's tough.

588
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.500
Shawn Phalen: I be curious like try and do some research on that trend.

589
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.820
Shawn Phalen: Will that and see if you can find anything on

590
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.620
Shawn Phalen: You know, tele health with kids like

591
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:39.330
Bonnie Burset: Doing it you know

592
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.560
Shawn Phalen: He come up with

593
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.620
Shawn Phalen: A chicken. Fine.

594
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.960
Bonnie Burset: Yeah yeah well

595
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.800
Bonnie Burset: And I think part of it is using your senses differently to like there's

596
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.130
Bonnie Burset: Challenges. I definitely have with kids where there's this element of

597
00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.590
Bonnie Burset: There is this element of, like, one step.

598
00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.420
Bonnie Burset: Removed them being in a therapy.

599
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.760
Bonnie Burset: Office, that's different. That

600
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.450
Bonnie Burset: I think, again, it's just where you're pulling your attention so

601
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.400
Bonnie Burset: It's just a different thing that

602
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:14.760
Bonnie Burset: You know, and it's different in the therapy office. There's different things that pulling your attention in the therapy office, then

603
00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:27.060
Bonnie Burset: Over video like I'm video. I'm more comfortable because I'm wearing my comfortable pants or whatever I'm wearing, like, you know, I don't know. I'm making things up, but I'm in my home, or I'm feeling so

604
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:33.450
Bonnie Burset: I'm not worried about, like, you know, being on time or what I'm wearing. Or like

605
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:34.350
Bonnie Burset: You know, like just

606
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.310
Shawn Phalen: Little things

607
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:39.660
Bonnie Burset: But again, I may have to work sometimes more to focus because

608
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:48.180
Bonnie Burset: You know, maybe I'm getting distracted. So I got to bring it back. So it's just kind of getting used to it, though, too, I think, is part of it is like just

609
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:51.900
Bonnie Burset: honing your skills in a different way.

610
00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.330
Bonnie Burset: I agree. Yeah, yeah.

611
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.340
Bonnie Burset: Okay, yeah.

612
00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:58.140
Shawn Phalen: Same time next week. Yeah.

613
00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.040
Bonnie Burset: Sounds great.

614
00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:07.320
Shawn Phalen: Okay so we are like I'm feel obviously working from problem.

615
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:12.990
Shawn Phalen: Okay, and they have said that they're going to

616
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:17.940
Shawn Phalen: Hang up my memory system if

617
00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:27.210
Shawn Phalen: They don't know what we're going to go back. We're, we're supposed to go back to the office in phases and

618
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:29.640
Bonnie Burset: I think I've said this before.

619
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:35.160
Shawn Phalen: So I'll just keep scheduling you at the yeah I hear something different.

620
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.820
Bonnie Burset: That's fine, and likely. I don't know if

621
00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:43.590
Bonnie Burset: I'm I have a strong sense of my going back till later in the summer. If not, so

622
00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:44.940
Bonnie Burset: My schedule is pretty

623
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:45.960
Flexible

624
00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.030
Bonnie Burset: Throughout the week.

625
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.180
Bonnie Burset: Yeah.

626
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.290
Bonnie Burset: All right.

627
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.670
Bonnie Burset: Thank you so much. Good seeing you, too. Take care.

628
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.780
Bye.

629
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.480
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

630
01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.470
Isaak: Hold on one sec.

631
01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:14.850
Isaak: Okay.

632
01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.320
Hold on.

633
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.600
Shawn Phalen: Sorry. Okay. Okay.

634
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:57.690
Isaak: Hi ago and haven't been you up. Yeah, no, I've been. I've been doing better than last time, I think that I just kind of went to tailspin because I was

635
01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:08.400
Isaak: Trying to taper too early and with the lock down and shake going on. I think, you know, it's just like a combination of things. But, um, but, yeah, for the most part I'm doing all right.

636
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:17.640
Isaak: I've had a toothache lately, though, so like I had to make a dentist appointment. Now it's like kind of, I don't know dragnet can just the way you know things are right now and

637
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:34.890
Isaak: I don't know. So I got that on Wednesday. So, I mean, I'm, I'm looking forward to it, though, of course, because like my tooth ache is so bad, like I've been taken like aspirin Tylenol, you know, like the smell. Two ways and like a, like where it is.

638
01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:36.630
Isaak: But

639
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:42.330
Isaak: But anyways, it just sucks because it usually comes at night, too. So like

640
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.580
Isaak: Nothing worse than that.

641
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:46.710
Isaak: Which

642
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:48.540
Shawn Phalen: Is it like a vacuum.

643
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.860
Isaak: Um, it's kind of like, I don't know, like on the side a little bit. Yeah.

644
01:01:53.940 --> 01:02:05.670
Isaak: Okay, um, other than that, I mean a good things. I guess I actually am getting get that unemployment that $600 bonus or whatever. I didn't think I was going to get it.

645
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:22.200
Isaak: But I'm going to and like I'm stoked on that, even though I want to work. I'm just stoked on that because like I only have like maybe 1000 like around almost $2,000 right now and I'm trying to save up for car so like when I get that I'll definitely be able to get a nice car.

646
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.620
Shawn Phalen: That We Are you on unemployment right now.

647
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:37.230
Isaak: On will no no I had it. It ran out like earlier like I think I've we were talking about it, but that that I might qualify for the extension with the pandemic and stuff.

648
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:47.700
Isaak: Yeah, so I got the stimulus check. I had a little money saved and now I might get that. And then I won't have to like get like a piece of shit car. You know what I mean.

649
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:51.870
Isaak: So it should be cool. Have you

650
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.520
Shawn Phalen: Filled out the paperwork to try and see if you get the attention. Have you done

651
01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.680
Isaak: Well, I did online like online, they said they were going to let me know so

652
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.710
Isaak: Yeah, so hopefully, if not, though. I mean, no big deal. But, um,

653
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:17.640
Isaak: I guess, other than me, though, like personally i mean i don't know this world's crazy right now with the protests and shit like Jesus.

654
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.930
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's crazy. Have you had protesting where you are.

655
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:30.450
Isaak: Um, yeah, I'm too close for comfort kind of because like I'm in the Bay Area, like, you know, San Francisco area. And so like

656
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:42.030
Isaak: Yeah, like literally like two or three towns away there's a Walnut Creek. It's called. I don't know if you heard about it on news. Yeah, like they've been it really yeah it's crazy.

657
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.100
Shawn Phalen: How far are you from, I'm not crazy.

658
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:52.590
Isaak: I'm probably about 25 minutes like Yeah, so I mean not super close but yeah

659
01:03:53.730 --> 01:04:02.880
Isaak: Yeah, it's a little crazy, isn't it all what's going on. Oh my gosh, yeah. Not like it's sad. What happened to that guy like George Floyd or whatever but

660
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:12.510
Isaak: It's like, now it just seems like these peaceful protests are just like turning into looting and stuff. You know what I mean, it's like it's a double edged sword away so

661
01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:14.310
Isaak: Yeah yeah

662
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.700
Shawn Phalen: How are you coping with all of this, like with the day homework.

663
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:21.210
Um,

664
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:39.750
Isaak: Yeah, I mean. Well, thankfully, we've we've kind of like loosened out on like restrictions around here. So I've got to see like more family like cousins stuff. And I think that's been helpful. I think that's like that might be why I'm like feeling a lot better to like this month.

665
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:45.330
Isaak: Like we had like a few barbecues and stuff and

666
01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:52.500
Isaak: But yeah, I mean honestly though. I mean, I don't know, it is kind of stressful just all the stuff going on.

667
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:56.730
Isaak: I'm just glad that I went back up on my medicine. Oh, for sure.

668
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:04.380
Isaak: For that hope. Okay. Yeah. All right. Good. I'm really glad. Yeah, and

669
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:11.790
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I mean, it's really hard with that stay home order you're isolated Jim can do this stuff, you know, really would do really good

670
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.210
Yeah.

671
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.420
A lot of anxiety for people

672
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:27.240
Isaak: You know yeah I know it. It was hard, like, but I talked to my grandmother. Oh, and she said, like I could start having friends over again. So that's kind of cool. I haven't really made any plans yet though but like
