00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.759
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Morning.

2
00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.069
Charles Dickens: Morning.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you today.

4
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.519
Charles Dickens: Good, how are you

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good just starting my morning in you.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
Charles Dickens: I've been out for a while with the girls took them to school. My wife's out of town for work.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, how are things going

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:51.780
Charles Dickens: I'm kind of confused with some stuff. So, um, so I tried to find out. You asked me to find out about the doctors appointment with Dr. Jamison, and I talked to Jamie and she and I could be wrong and but she's like, You only get a doctor appointment. If you ask for it.

10
00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:04.890
Charles Dickens: And then she said, and so I asked, What do I do if I need a question or whatever she's like, Oh, well, you can ask us and we'll send her a message and then we'll determine

11
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.240
Charles Dickens: If in show determine if there needs to be an appointment. And I said, Well, what about some type of direct email or something. And she said, they don't do that and then

12
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.320
Charles Dickens: Yesterday and group. Dr. Jamison sent me a private thing that she wants me to see some psychiatrists, I didn't understand what she was saying, because I think that

13
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.350
Charles Dickens: She, she typed something wrong, but it said something like the meta I confirm with the medical director that

14
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:52.920
Charles Dickens: Anti psychosis is a side effects of Suboxone I think in that she means psychosis is a side effect of Suboxone will you be willing to see a psychiatrist. And I said, Sure arm.

15
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.380
Charles Dickens: And and

16
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:07.140
Charles Dickens: And then the other thing I'm confused about which may not have anything to do with you is this group. The first 25 minutes is spent.

17
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.770
Charles Dickens: Asking people if they need refills so yesterday. There's like 10 or 11 people in the group and we didn't even start the group until like 1055

18
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:31.020
Charles Dickens: So I'm like, I don't know that benefit when some people, they'll say, Oh, yeah. Things are good. There's not enough time for me to talk about what's going on. So I'll let someone else talk. So I don't know if

19
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:40.950
Charles Dickens: How beneficial. It's going to be if there's 10 to 15 people in a group and at the end of the day, there's going to be like 35 minutes for people to get feedback but

20
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.650
Charles Dickens: But because so what I shared with her yesterday or the group is the same thing. I kind of shared last week is that

21
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.480
Charles Dickens: I

22
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.360
Charles Dickens: Probably my biggest stressors. My wife because she doesn't understand and she doesn't

23
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.580
Charles Dickens: Like she's

24
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:30.420
Charles Dickens: She started out as like a regular attorney and now she runs that law firm. She's the head partner and all that she's super, super, super, super Taipei and although I was a cop. I could be laid back and all that. Well, now I don't have the patience that I used to have, and

25
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.480
Charles Dickens: You know, we get into arguments over money and just like

26
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:48.690
Charles Dickens: The other day I went to the grocery and I got a coconut for the girls for $2 and I, and then when she comes home from work, she says, Well,

27
00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:08.580
Charles Dickens: Why are we spending 14% and credit card interest for $2 because I don't have any money I have to get money from her. And there's this huge argument. She wants to spend cash all the time and we have all this real estate and mortgages and 4000 a month for a girls.

28
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:24.810
Charles Dickens: School. And I'm like, babe. You're gonna you're gonna you're going to wipe our savings out, you're going to wipe everything out like you have to use a credit card until I get a job until I get medically stable. It's and she refuses to do it. She's like, no, and she just

29
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:37.140
Charles Dickens: So that's why I have no money anymore. I followed her what she wanted to do of spinning cash. So then the next day after lecturing me about $2. She's like, you take my Porsche.

30
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.160
Charles Dickens: To go get cleaned and I'm like, all right, where do you want me to take it and she's like Walnut Creek, which is like 25 minutes from relive

31
00:04:48.150 --> 00:05:01.200
Charles Dickens: And then it's 60 bucks. And I'm like, well, now I'm confused. And she's like, confused about what and I'm like, Okay, nevermind. Like, I'm not like I don't have the patience to be like okay you lecture me on $2 and now

32
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.610
Charles Dickens: You want me to go spend 60 bucks to clean your car and

33
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.120
Charles Dickens: And then

34
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.930
Charles Dickens: We got into a like really, really, really bad last Thursday, because I just tell her like

35
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.170
Charles Dickens: How much have you learned about Suboxone like how much have you learned about drug addiction. Like, how much have you learned

36
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.000
Charles Dickens: So you can help me and you can understand from your standpoint, and it's very frustrating because I'm like, at one point.

37
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:47.400
Charles Dickens: I can be the social worker that I used to be in a group counselor to tell her what she needs to do, and about addiction and I'm like, you got to look at this is like cancer. Like, literally, this is a medical issue. There's some type of chemical that's messing up my brain.

38
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:57.420
Charles Dickens: And she's like, I don't need to read it, I can listen to you and you can tell me what's going on. But if you're going to be an ass. Oh, I'm not. I don't take shit from anyone. And I'm like,

39
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:09.960
Charles Dickens: And she's like Suboxone and opioids are no longer an excuse because you you know what's going on. You know when you're having a bad day and you're not going to talk to me that way. And I'm like, You just can't.

40
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:26.370
Charles Dickens: You, you can't like people are going to have bad days, no matter what goes on. So it just kept getting worse and worse and she started screaming and I start screaming and she's like, shut the windows and they were going to hear. And I'm like, I don't understand, like,

41
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:35.400
Charles Dickens: You can have a bad day, but I can't. And she's like, well, you need to be a man and get a job. And we don't have no money and

42
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.110
Charles Dickens: And I'm like,

43
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:48.270
Charles Dickens: The reason why I want you to understand what's going on with addicts and whatever is if you realize what people do. I don't do any of that stuff.

44
00:06:49.410 --> 00:07:00.690
Charles Dickens: I take care of the kids. I do all the grocery shopping I do a laundry a clean your bathroom I clean your toilet I clean your sink. I do all the dishes, I do all that stuff.

45
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:14.100
Charles Dickens: And I try to keep it together every single day. She's like, but that's what you should do. You're the dad and you're the husband without a job. Like, why wouldn't you do that. I'm like, that's what I'm trying to tell you is not only do I not want to do it.

46
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.470
Charles Dickens: Regular people that are addicted. They're going to run out and they're going to

47
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.910
Charles Dickens: Use more they're going to cheat on their wives, they're going to spend money they're going to stay. They're going to stay away from a trigger your my trigger

48
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:37.170
Charles Dickens: One of my triggers and you make things worse. And she's like, Well, how can I make things worse. I'm the only one that loves you and support you. I'm the old and I'm like, but that's the thing.

49
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:44.850
Charles Dickens: So she said, I said, Can you just be nice and compassionate when I'm having a bad day. Can you like

50
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:55.260
Charles Dickens: Hug me and be like, hey, is everything going on. You want to fire back and be like, Don't talk to me. Either way, motherfucker. You want to talk to me that way, motherfucker. You can get out the house. It just goes on and on. And I'm like,

51
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.600
Charles Dickens: But when you have a bad day and you have to work late or whatever you sleep in.

52
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.020
Charles Dickens: She sleeps in every single day.

53
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:13.620
Charles Dickens: I get up at 630 with the girls and I get them ready for school and all that she gets up most of the time, after we leave for school.

54
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.380
Charles Dickens: He sleeps in

55
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:31.800
Charles Dickens: Sleeps in on the weekends and which I don't. The problem I don't have an issue with that. My thing is if I have a bad day. She's like, What, you don't, you're not working and you understand

56
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:43.710
Charles Dickens: That you have a you have the opioids problem, like you understand. So I don't understand. Like, why do you, that's your job is to take care of the kids while I work

57
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:55.140
Charles Dickens: So why would you need a day off like you get six hours off every single day in between taking them and picking them up from school. I'm like, it's just, it's

58
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:08.970
Charles Dickens: You have a very simplistic reductionist way of looking at life and it's just not that way. Like, you need to be very lucky that I don't do things that other people do. And she's like, Well, I wouldn't be with you then. And I'm like, it just goes around in this circle of

59
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.850
Charles Dickens: I'm just like, I don't know.

60
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.810
Charles Dickens: So then she said, can you be more thankful

61
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:29.190
Charles Dickens: For me, and I'm like, Okay, she's like, all you do is say, Thank you. Can you tell me why you're thankful and show me your gratitude and let me know why. So I'm like, okay, so I started doing that.

62
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.910
Charles Dickens: Saturday we got into a huge fight again because I said, hey, I don't really understand what's going on.

63
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:50.760
Charles Dickens: I tell you, ask you, like, Hey, how's it going, and I think for you. And she's like, but it's just kind of like a robot LIKE YOU'RE JUST KIND OF LIKE, OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR A, B and C. I don't think that you're sincere and I'm like why don't know

64
00:09:51.930 --> 00:10:06.690
Charles Dickens: I don't know what you want to do. And then she then I started getting triggered of feeling bad and getting really mad, and I was just like, all right, you got to give me some time, like, give me some time. So we get in the car and we're going to her parents house for

65
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:17.070
Charles Dickens: boxing match. I'm a huge boxing fan, we go there to watch this boxing match. And one of my buddies in from was came in from out of town, and that I hadn't seen since the wedding.

66
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:26.550
Charles Dickens: And she just keeps pounding me like, what are you thinking and answer my questions. And I'm like, you're not gonna like it. I'm not. I'm telling you right now. I've told you

67
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:40.170
Charles Dickens: When I asked you to give me my space, you got to give me my space and just calm down. The girls are in the back. I don't want to argue or anything. And she just kept going and going and then I started answering her questions.

68
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:54.900
Charles Dickens: And she got more and more pissed and just more and just you don't appreciate me and you think you're better than everyone and I'm the only one that loves you and support you and just like this belittling stuff and

69
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.840
Charles Dickens: And I'm like, You gotta stop. You gotta stop and then it just starts cycling out of control.

70
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:07.470
Charles Dickens: And I'm like, all right, well, then I'll just take myself out of the equation. Like, I'm just tired of I'd rather

71
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:25.170
Charles Dickens: KILL MYSELF. Then listen to you repeatedly tell me that I'm a failure when I'm not trying to fail, like everything that I'm trying to do. I said, I try to lead. So my day is how can I be better for myself and how could I make your life better and easier and how can I

72
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:38.790
Charles Dickens: Make the girl's life easier. And she's like, Well, I tell you that you can sleep in on the weekends. And I'm like, it's not about sleep. It's not, it's not like like right now she's out of town for work.

73
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:48.570
Charles Dickens: Then next week. She's gone for three days for work, she goes to Hawaii. You didn't say what she could. I don't care what she does. They're like,

74
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.850
Charles Dickens: We've caught her on FaceTime, and she's on the beach. I don't care. I don't care. You can

75
00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:02.610
Charles Dickens: You're working you're paying the bills. That's fine. I don't care if you're there for three days and you only have one day of meetings. I don't care. And your job pays for, I don't care.

76
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:12.450
Charles Dickens: What I'm saying is I never get a break. I've never had a break when I've had issues with or there's been like a day here there that she'll she can tell like I am.

77
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:20.490
Charles Dickens: Bad, and I can't get out of bed and stuff but like she's in Salt Lake City right now for two days she

78
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:31.050
Charles Dickens: That's a break. She's like, it's not a break, because I have to fly on a plane and now there's the coronavirus and now I have to be away from my kids. And I'm like, but there is no interruption.

79
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:38.670
Charles Dickens: You get to go out to eat. You all are high price attorneys, and I know you. You're my wife have been with you for 10 years you're not

80
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:45.690
Charles Dickens: Eating it nothing below 4.5 stars on Yelp and for dollar signs, you're going to get a good meal.

81
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:52.500
Charles Dickens: All of that you're going to get massages, you're going to the pole, you're going to the gym, you're going to relax. You're going to sleep.

82
00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:01.140
Charles Dickens: Now if you don't sleep well whatever cuz she'll be like, Oh, well I've missed the girls. Okay. Well, I understand that, but whatever.

83
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:16.740
Charles Dickens: I don't have any of that. I don't, I don't even know she was leaving until yesterday she forgot to send me all the emails for flights and I said, that's what I'm saying is I don't get a break every, every single time is you get to travel. You get breaks

84
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:26.640
Charles Dickens: If, when I was working and I was gone for days on end, she goes to her parents house and gets a break and takes off. I don't do that. I don't have any

85
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:40.740
Charles Dickens: I don't have any family here. I keep the kids and I keep them here and entertain, though, and she doesn't see that she's just like, Yeah, but I have to travel. I like but it's a break. Like that's, I don't understand what you don't see like

86
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.260
Charles Dickens: Most people not most, but a lot of people that I know that travel

87
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:55.980
Charles Dickens: 50% of the time they love to travel because they get a break from their family. And I'm like, so you can't say that it's not a break. Like, there is no interruptions and

88
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:12.510
Charles Dickens: Then she's like, Well, if you're trying to be a better person, why are you watching Netflix at 9pm should you be sleeping. And I'm like, Okay. Like, I don't. What do you want me to do to prove to you that I'm like struggling. Like I don't under, I just don't understand. I don't

89
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.460
Charles Dickens: Like, what can I do to prove

90
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:14.760
Like

91
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:25.590
Charles Dickens: What do you want me to do. Like what else is a person supposed to do, and she's like, well, I mean, I don't know if I should search through your emails to prove that you're

92
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.070
Charles Dickens: applying for jobs. And I'm like, Okay, you can search through my emails all you want, but here's the thing is that I don't

93
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.380
Charles Dickens: I don't, I don't even know if I can go back to her and the trigger for her. What happened is I got denied disability.

94
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This

95
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:51.150
Charles Dickens: may not make any sense because it took forever for me understand when I was working in Mountain View for the city of Mountain View, where Google is

96
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:57.180
Charles Dickens: They played into a private fund. So they never paid the state for any disability.

97
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:10.230
Charles Dickens: So when I applied for disability. They're like, there's no money for you here. We grant you the money, but there's no money to pull from. So when I went back to Mountain View, they they denied me for pre existing condition.

98
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:22.590
Charles Dickens: And they're like, you're done. You've, you've been dealing with your neurological disorder for 15 years. And so then unemployment was like, well, you're disabled, we can't give you any money.

99
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:36.150
Charles Dickens: With disabilities like if if there's no money for you. You have to get unemployment, like that's the only way that else you get money. So this has been almost four months now, three months, and she's just like, What do you want to like

100
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.770
Charles Dickens: Go washing dishes or whatever. And I'm like, Okay, we want to go wash the dishes, that's fine, I'll do that. But it's not going to be good for me mentally

101
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:50.850
Charles Dickens: Well, you need to be a man and you need to grow up. You're 40 years old, like, all right, and then and then like

102
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:57.540
Charles Dickens: She'll wake me up at like one in the morning because she's watching Netflix, even though I'm not supposed to be watching Netflix.

103
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:06.750
Charles Dickens: To be like, oh, I shouldn't have said that to you. I hope you feel better. And she just and then for like a day she'll be like, I shouldn't have said that. T. I'm so sorry.

104
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.580
Charles Dickens: And I'm like,

105
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:20.550
Charles Dickens: You want to live the same life that we had like six months ago, you can't you can't, we can't like the school gave us a break.

106
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.840
Charles Dickens: They, they gave us $1,000 off every month.

107
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:43.710
Charles Dickens: And she's like, now what I want to give me January in February for free for one of the, one of our girls and then March next March, she she gets a bonus every year for like $100,000 and she's like, I'm going to pay you back the money that oh you. I'm like, You gotta

108
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:55.290
Charles Dickens: If someone's being kind to you and offering you gotta, you got to take it like she's like, I'm not a bum and I don't take free gifts from anyone. I'm an immigrant, I had to fight for everything. I get

109
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:06.510
Charles Dickens: Oh, she's Indian and she from Fiji. She's like, I have to fight for everything I've ever had. And I'm not having anyone and all that. And so it just cycles into

110
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:21.180
Charles Dickens: That of that. And then I don't want to hang out with her family because they all. Some of them are just nosy because normal people are nosy her parents are like, super religious and in Hindu and

111
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:32.520
Charles Dickens: It's a, it's like I'm Catholic, so I don't. So they have to hire these priest and they pay him hundreds of dollars to pray for me to find a job. And I'm like,

112
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:43.650
Charles Dickens: I don't want you doing that. And I told my wife like where are your parents. Oh, don't disrespect my parents. That's how we do it in Hindu and I'm like, just, they can pray

113
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:56.640
Charles Dickens: Like you, my wife has a little one here ever every Hindu has like a private temple or area in our home. And I'm like, she can pray in the in the house like don't bring this priest in and

114
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:11.430
Charles Dickens: So, and then when friend. Well, I don't have that many. But when people call it a check on me or come over, I get very overwhelmed and like very

115
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:33.120
Charles Dickens: Have a stutter. Now, at times and I've memory loss and it becomes very overwhelming to like explain what's going on and try to be like to try to be normal, like right now like throughout the day, like doing the house stuff and all that. Like it doesn't really bother me like

116
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.870
Charles Dickens: Not that much like I'm not. But once I start picking up the girls and my wife comes home and

117
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He

118
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.690
Charles Dickens: I don't know if you have kids, but they're just

119
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.790
Charles Dickens: They just

120
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.150
Charles Dickens: The constant bickering and fighting and the screaming it's it's it's

121
00:18:52.230 --> 00:19:07.890
Charles Dickens: It's really hard for me to, like, kind of like keep it together and I have to like take breaks and go the bathroom a lot and kind of calm myself down because I get very overwhelmed and it's very challenging for something that used to be very easy for me.

122
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.200
Charles Dickens: Sure. So, and finally Monday.

123
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.560
Charles Dickens: I get to see this world. I don't know if he's world renowned but us renowned

124
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:37.290
Charles Dickens: Neurologist and for the neurological stuff. But Dr Jameson's like we can't. I can't. She's like, if you want to go up the method or the Suboxone slowly you can, but you don't have a neurologist like

125
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:55.230
Charles Dickens: So I have to talk to that neurologist on Monday about getting off this methadone, because I'm still are not methadone or Suboxone because I'm still just like a different person. And it's just it's and I have a job interview on Monday, but it's like a video thing.

126
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.360
Charles Dickens: But it's a it's for a police, it's a it's a

127
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:10.410
Charles Dickens: You know Marin County right rich people. So it's for the Marin County Sheriff's Office, but it's for a corner investigator.

128
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:18.690
Charles Dickens: And I'm like, I don't know if I want to see dead babies for the next 20 years and dead people. And so it's like you're a crime scene investigator and all this and

129
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:29.940
Charles Dickens: If I don't take that job, or even like go through. I'm going to talk to my wife about it tonight, but I just don't. I've seen enough dead people in my life. And I don't know if I just want to

130
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:41.760
Charles Dickens: see dead people like it's every single murder. I would have went out every the, you know, I'd be one of the investigators, but I don't know if I want to see. I used to be a

131
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:57.840
Charles Dickens: Sex Offender specialist and I don't know if I want for the federal government. I don't know if I want to see dead babies and dead people cut up and shotgun blown off Facebook and I've already done that stuff. And I don't know if I want to do it anymore and

132
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:09.360
Charles Dickens: I'm trying to get in like the private sector of like Facebook and Google and Pinkerton like all these places as like a threat assessment, like a

133
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:28.530
Charles Dickens: Stuff like that. But it doesn't work fast enough. My wife's name. She meaning it doesn't work fast enough for she immediately she gets so overwhelmed and and I'm like, you're overwhelmed will throw an opioid addiction and she's like, Yeah, but that's an every, every time I talk about like

134
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.560
Charles Dickens: This is overwhelming and this. She's like, but you know why it's overwhelming. And I'm like, babe, like

135
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:45.240
Charles Dickens: When I was a social worker. If I just told people, hey, if you stop smoking crack your life gets better. Some of those people would actually stop smoking crack and they didn't know what the fuck to do

136
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.350
Charles Dickens: Yeah, they didn't know what to do, because the answer is very simple, but the implementation of the plan. It's very difficult and

137
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:59.070
Charles Dickens: You know, we're at where we are partly my fault, but we also have the neurologist that

138
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.840
Charles Dickens: Like a spell. I felt bullied to go will not bullied, but

139
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:11.640
Charles Dickens: Thoroughly talked into the opioids, but I was also going through a significant amount of pain and all that and

140
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:19.290
Charles Dickens: So, and I completely cut out the marijuana. I did that, like two weeks ago because I gotta get a drug test.

141
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.000
Charles Dickens: So,

142
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.370
Charles Dickens: And I just

143
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:31.590
Charles Dickens: I don't know. And then my like one of my buddies called me last night that I kept ignoring and ignoring and

144
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:38.610
Charles Dickens: We talked for like two hours. And I told him what was going on. And he's like, why would you tell me this, and why would you ignore me like

145
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:45.300
Charles Dickens: My kids always asked about you. My wife says, You're my only true friend like and I thought I'd done something to you and

146
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:53.610
Charles Dickens: And then he's like, I don't believe you did. And I'm like, dude, I'm not lying, like I'm not like what I just told you is, it's not made up like that.

147
00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:03.660
Charles Dickens: He's like, I would never think that you would be suicidal and I'm like dude, that's, that's my issue is, that's what I was telling the neurologist and he wouldn't listen and

148
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.910
Charles Dickens: Why would anyone get on opioids for restless leg syndrome. And I'm like, dude, it's just

149
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:16.170
Charles Dickens: That's this is why I don't call people because they're gonna and I know that you don't mean to do it in a rude way but it's like

150
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:30.450
Charles Dickens: I don't want to be second guess for stuff that I've already. I understand that. I can't that I shouldn't have done a lot of things with medications, but I went through every single medication. I could before I got on the opioids and then

151
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.950
Charles Dickens: So,

152
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.630
Charles Dickens: You know, and

153
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.130
Charles Dickens: I mean, one thing I do understand is a lot of things.

154
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.650
Charles Dickens: A lot of the

155
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.710
Charles Dickens: Decisions that I made. So

156
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:54.120
Charles Dickens: I was at the Alameda County Sheriff's Office for five years and I don't know how much you watch the news, but even though some of this stuff. I was on the medication and opioids.

157
00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:10.770
Charles Dickens: I and my wife, my wife hate. She says, I have this huge moral code. Well, I mean with Trump. I don't even know. I mean, that just turn the world around when it comes to the moral code. But there's a lot of stuff on the news.

158
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:24.660
Charles Dickens: About Alameda County, all these guys being arrested and stuff like that. Well, I actually reported a lot of those guys long before they were arrested and I got just destroyed.

159
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.420
Charles Dickens: I just got destroyed at work, like I just got

160
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:35.820
Charles Dickens: You know, I mean, turn into a hostile work environment. So that's why I switch to the city of Mountain View, and then

161
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.360
Charles Dickens: Some stuff happened there to where

162
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.350
Charles Dickens: I just

163
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.270
Charles Dickens: Got like I got

164
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:52.470
Charles Dickens: Like 32 year old guys are like trying to bully me at home like Nah, bro. Like I'm 40, you're not gonna you're not. I'm not. This

165
00:24:53.010 --> 00:25:10.890
Charles Dickens: Fucking 22 year old out of the academy, you're not going to speak to me this way and then they just kept pushing me and pushing me and then I'm like, dude, I'm not. I don't I don't deal with this bullshit and they, you know, they go to they eventually went to like the surgeon and

166
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:21.330
Charles Dickens: Well, first, like some sergeants, and some other like respected guys are coming to me like, Hey, man. Just keep your mouth shut. Those guys are trouble leave them alone.

167
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:36.060
Charles Dickens: Well, then the same Sergeant that was telling me to just lay low is like hey, there's been some complaints out on you because you're reckless you've actually pointed your gun at people and I'm like this is fucking Mountain View. I mean,

168
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:44.160
Charles Dickens: How many times you pull your gun and Mountain View. Like, I don't like. And I'm like, well, who filed the complaints and then they told me. And I'm like,

169
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.820
Charles Dickens: You know, these guys are harassing me

170
00:25:48.900 --> 00:26:00.330
Charles Dickens: So like, why, and then this is though methadone stuff and the paranoia and all that. And I'm like, so you know that these guys are harass me

171
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:14.130
Charles Dickens: And now they're coming after me. Like, why, why, why are you not going after them and they spilled over into this. Hey, it's not going to work out, you're still on probation and that just pisses me off because she's like

172
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:21.660
Charles Dickens: This before I guess the hope, like we knew that really what the problem was with opioids and she's like, well,

173
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:32.700
Charles Dickens: You when you left the sheriff's office because you tried to be you were a whistleblower, and they they just destroyed you and now they came after you at Mountain View. Again, the old school guys and

174
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.910
Charles Dickens: You stood up to them and now like you. You didn't think about your family and think about kids and

175
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:48.900
Charles Dickens: And that's what I've told her is like, I don't know. I know that's something I have to work on. That's another reason I don't know if I want to go to the Marine County Sheriff because

176
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.210
Charles Dickens: It's hard to explain like

177
00:26:52.290 --> 00:27:03.420
Charles Dickens: Being inside as a cop. Like there's very few good cops and I don't mean like good at their jobs like good people like the old school guys are just

178
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.010
Charles Dickens: They use the ratio, the racially insensitive and

179
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:18.870
Charles Dickens: disrespectful to women and all this and those guys never get in trouble. And there's so much nepotism and harassment and sexual harassment and sleeping around and all this stuff that

180
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.330
Charles Dickens: I don't want to be a part of that.

181
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:33.870
Charles Dickens: And then you throw in opioids and withdrawals and all that and it becomes overwhelming. And that's what I was telling me like I gotta, like, get some type of baseline.

182
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:43.950
Charles Dickens: To wear or work somewhere. I know there's going to be politics or where you work, but I can't work with people that I've active domestic violence charges against them.

183
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.320
Charles Dickens: And they're a cop. Like I just can't. Oh, they're guilty until proven as. Come on, like,

184
00:27:51.480 --> 00:28:05.370
Charles Dickens: Being a cop. I can tell you, like probably 90% of arrest are going to be pretty much legitimate and that's so I told her, like I've ignored. A lot of this stuff for years and

185
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:18.660
Charles Dickens: Now that the girls are getting older and they realize that, because they asked all the time like are you going to work. Are you still sick and that hurts my feelings, because it's like, and I don't. They don't mean anything by it but it's like

186
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:26.700
Charles Dickens: That's what I tell her, like if I don't get better it's going to be a lot a lot worse, and I don't

187
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:42.330
Charles Dickens: And I told her, like, I don't know when I said that I'd rather kill myself then listen to you and other people think that I'm a disappointment. First off, I've never talked like that before. And second off. Like, why are you not like scared or surprised. Your responses.

188
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:51.960
Charles Dickens: Oh that's stupid. You know, it's the opioids. Just stop thinking that way. Like, it's just, it's not but Doc, I can tell you when my wife has a bad day.

189
00:28:53.970 --> 00:29:05.730
Charles Dickens: Who listens to her for the whole hour I don't I don't interrupt i don't i wait for her to ask me. Okay, wait for it, asked my feedback and this and the other. And so that's where I'm at, like, I don't

190
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:13.110
Charles Dickens: She, she doesn't realize it's like a huge circle of like everything relates

191
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:23.490
Charles Dickens: So, and she says stuff like, Well, why don't you go out with your buddies and I'm like, well, they don't know what's going on. And what if I have a seizure. What if I start freaking out and

192
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:32.760
Charles Dickens: They don't have to, like, get comfortable with you and the girls and public and taking them to school and hanging out with your family. That's my opinion I could be wrong but

193
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:42.810
Charles Dickens: I'm like, I got to get this baseline and keep working on that and working on that and working on that and not worry about these triggers and stuff like that and and

194
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:56.400
Charles Dickens: And I think what's frustrating for her is like, I think she she trusts me and knows I'm telling the truth is, like, I don't drink. I don't cut off the marijuana the marijuana helped, but I can't because of jobs but

195
00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:08.250
Charles Dickens: I'm not. I think because she sees me do what I do, what she's actually told me before. She's like, if you don't tell me that you need help.

196
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.860
Charles Dickens: Then I'm not going to help you not like, but when I asked for help. Sometimes

197
00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.160
Charles Dickens: Like one day I was a couple weeks ago.

198
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:27.150
Charles Dickens: And I'm like something wrong. I don't feel well. She just throw the huge fit you don't fucking work. And now I gotta fucking take off from work and now I got to work from home.

199
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:36.660
Charles Dickens: And because both girls had the flu, because the flu like wiped out their school so I think they got me sick. And then what the opioid stuff and then

200
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:54.360
Charles Dickens: I'm like, Something's wrong. And she's like, fuck, dad, and this is ridiculous. And I have to work from home and data. So that's what I tell her, like, that's why I don't tell you stuff like that's that's what happens like I i tell you stuff and I get

201
00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:10.380
Charles Dickens: I get fucking thrilled. It's like, no, it's just because I just, I'm so bad and work and that the girls are so overwhelming and I don't want them to watch TV. So I have to entertain them.

202
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:25.980
Charles Dickens: I'm like, well, then let them watch TV for so you can work and I can get better. And then she's like, what really made me upset, is you slept like 10 o'clock and you got up and you were trying to help me.

203
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:37.140
Charles Dickens: Like, don't try to help me when when I'm trying to the girls are sick and I don't want your help. If you're sick that you should stay in bed, and I'm like,

204
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:46.740
Charles Dickens: I'm just like, and I'm sure she would have a different way of presenting all this but I just tell her. Like that's that's

205
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:52.980
Charles Dickens: just not going to work. I don't know what you want me to do, like, I can't be this person that you want me to be like

206
00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:03.420
Charles Dickens: The old trolls isn't going to come back for a while until I get better. And unless you support it. She says that she is supportive, but she's not. And I'm like, if you are just nice.

207
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:13.800
Charles Dickens: And comforting, you will get super different results. And she's like, but that may not be my personality.

208
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:32.490
Charles Dickens: And it may be too hard for me. And I'm like, it should not be too hard, that I said. Think about it like with the girls when the girls come in and they're there, they're angry and upset or they're frustrated or they're they're there.

209
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:49.860
Charles Dickens: They're hungry and they don't want to take a bath. Like if you keep arguing with them. They get worse. Like, you have to give me a chance and they have to realize that sometimes people have bad days. And the problem is, is what I'm going through is probably more bad days than not, and

210
00:32:51.420 --> 00:33:03.810
Charles Dickens: That you have to realize like at nine o'clock watching Netflix. Why do people watch TV for an escape like it's just you can go do whatever you want and watch whatever you want. And that's why I do it. Like, I don't know.

211
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:09.360
Charles Dickens: That's why you do it. Like, that's what I tell my wife, and it's just a

212
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:20.850
Charles Dickens: And she gets very frustrated with. She's like, what's Dr jamison's plan. And I'm like, babe. I told you two days ago I I gotta get a neurologist, I cannot

213
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:33.450
Charles Dickens: Okay. First is, yes, the psychosis and the opioid the psychosis from the opioids and getting off though. Yes, we all are agreement that that's number one. Like, we're all are in agreement.

214
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:42.090
Charles Dickens: But if I stop the Suboxone I have to go through withdrawals from Suboxone and then the restless leg syndrome. And I've tried. I've tried it twice.

215
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.460
Charles Dickens: Since I got put on Suboxone and I just couldn't I just couldn't do it. Yeah.

216
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:58.740
Charles Dickens: Well, I have to have a neurologist as well to that walks through, you have to have to understand that and then two days later. Well, what's the plan.

217
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:09.390
Charles Dickens: Was like, why, like why don't you start it now. Like, why don't you start weaning off Suboxone and I'm like, it's just been two weeks to get off to marijuana

218
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:24.780
Charles Dickens: And I'm trying to get some type of consistency on Suboxone and mentally and we just had a knock down drag out fight like two days ago and I don't understand how you realize like, that's, that's not that's not healthy.

219
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:26.340
Charles Dickens: So,

220
00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got a lot going on.

221
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.620
Charles Dickens: Yeah.

222
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely and

223
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I hear is that

224
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There has to be a change in perception. First off, about what you do at home.

225
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it is a job.

226
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, the second thing that I hear is that

227
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:12.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You do need a break. You do need to be able to recover. You do need to be able to do healthy things for yourself to be able to build your strength, while you're going through this process.

228
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's a piece of it too.

229
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:30.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's not as easy as just stopping or just changing or knowing where the thoughts are coming from. But it's about learning how to work through the thoughts.

230
00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Learning how to

231
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Manage

232
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:49.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This whole thing in a whole different manner and you know that's where I think that your wife can definitely benefit from that educational piece about addiction and what it does to our brains and what it does to our body what it does to our emotions.

233
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's a bigger picture than then

234
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Than just stopping. It's a bigger picture than

235
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then what I think she believes that it is

236
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's also that the piece that

237
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:15.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, empathy is really an important piece of recovery.

238
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have to be able to put yourself first, you have to be able to put your recovery first before you can ever be been a be benefiting your family and your, your marriage and you know there's that piece as well. And then I also hear like there's, there's a whole underlying piece.

239
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About you not working. I think that there's

240
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:52.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know there is low self esteem that you know there for you. And there's a resentment piece you know tour with your wife that she probably needs to

241
00:36:53.790 --> 00:37:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Address. You know when you, when something constantly gets brought up and gets thrown up at in arguments, you're not working, but you are working

242
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's it. That's a piece, you know, that's a misunderstood piece about being at home with the kids and doing

243
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All the work that you do in the house and taking care of the family. It is a job, whether you know people want to believe it or not, it is it's work it's mentally exhausting emotionally exhausting and physically exhausting and then let's throw on you know what's going on with you.

244
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:36.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, neurologically let's get let's throw on you know the addictive part and that makes it 10 times worse. It feels so heavy.

245
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what are you doing as far as. Are you going to any meetings or are you going to any kind of support group system.

246
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That can help you.

247
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.170
Charles Dickens: Oh, I

248
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.120
Charles Dickens: Will I started back

249
00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:04.350
Charles Dickens: I'm slowly working back up to like my rigorous exercise training to get back up to like 15 miles of running like three, four times a week and

250
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:12.690
Charles Dickens: That's helped better with asleep, and I've never really had a problem with eating well, I mean, outside of methadone withdrawals, but

251
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:22.710
Charles Dickens: That's what I tried to do and I was at Kaiser and I repeatedly was like telling the neurologist and addiction specialist like

252
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:28.560
Charles Dickens: I need something like someone to talk to, and don't other. Oh, no, no, no. Like you have so much money and

253
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:46.350
Charles Dickens: We met your wife, she's so successful, you have a support system. And I'm like, No, dude, like I'm telling you, like, there's got to be like something else. So, I mean, I have the I Have you and then I have that the group on Wednesdays. But like I said, I don't. I feel

254
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.030
Charles Dickens: I don't like

255
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:54.930
Charles Dickens: It's not just me, but like we wait there for 20 minutes what Dr. James and ask everyone. What's your Suboxone and

256
00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:02.550
Charles Dickens: I don't, I don't know why that can't be done some other time because because some guy, like I say, like some guys don't even talk and I just

257
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.400
Charles Dickens: You know they bring them up on the they look so frustrated and beat down and then I'm new.

258
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:19.470
Charles Dickens: And they, they're like, okay, let's give Charles, a little bit more time and talk to us about what going on. And then all these guys are trying to give me advice and I'm like okay I appreciate all that and then I feel bad because

259
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:32.790
Charles Dickens: Other guys don't have enough time to talk. And so, I mean what I think would be good for me and I, my wife says she supports it, but it's it's it's the thing in the back of the head where you

260
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:48.390
Charles Dickens: And I'm not trying to like get involved in your personal life. I'm just trying to like related to you. It's like, I don't, I don't want to. This happens. It's very common marriages has nothing to do with like opioids during that and God, I don't

261
00:39:50.220 --> 00:40:00.330
Charles Dickens: I like when my wife says like, hey, you can sleep in tomorrow if you want. I don't believe her. I just don't. It's not sincere. I know my wife, my wife loves sleep like

262
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:08.580
Charles Dickens: It's like the girls sleep work and then me like I totally believe that I don't really, it's not that big of an issue to me but

263
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:20.610
Charles Dickens: So I don't find her sincere. So, what I mean is that if she's like, hey, go hang out with Chris and Craig and all of them is that in the back of her head is

264
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:30.630
Charles Dickens: How much is this costing us. Is this going to cost us money and this that and the other, and that that's the thing is like I when I was talking to my buddy Chris last night. He's like,

265
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:41.130
Charles Dickens: Hey, we're going to go to. We both a bunch of us listen to the same podcast. And I was like, hey man, you know, I've been going through a rough patch. I've been always wanting to take them to a live show

266
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:55.350
Charles Dickens: And he's like, Hey, dude. They're coming march 13 dude march 14 like why don't you go with me and Darryl and I'm like, I was like, I've always wanted to take you and and I'm like, okay, so, you know, let me talk to me and

267
00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:06.270
Charles Dickens: So, last week the big boxing match it cost 80 bucks. This has always been an issue, what I'm about to say. And like you can't

268
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:15.900
Charles Dickens: Show me. He always says like you do with your family and I'll deal with my meaning like if you have a problem with anyone in my family. You come to me and I'm going to take care of. And she does.

269
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:24.870
Charles Dickens: But if she perceives it as like disrespectful. She, she gets very defensive. Well, she never has to deal with me and my family because

270
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.020
Charles Dickens: They're never here so

271
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:40.770
Charles Dickens: She's a said, hey, this and this was true. And I'm like this is literally the biggest heavyweight boxing match and like 15 years. It really go me to show you the articles or whatever.

272
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.590
Charles Dickens: But I don't think I should have to defend myself.

273
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:58.560
Charles Dickens: And she's like, okay, how much is I said 80 bucks. The first thing she says is, so you're going to charge my family money to watch a fight. And I'm like, No, that's not what I'm saying, mom. My mom mom actually sent me

274
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.590
Charles Dickens: Some birthday money.

275
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.260
Charles Dickens: And some extra money.

276
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:14.940
Charles Dickens: And it's up there and the little you know we keep a little money thing to grab and I'm like, there's 100 bucks and I'll take 80 from it. She just like put your head down and I'm like,

277
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:32.850
Charles Dickens: Why are you upset and she's like, Well, you know, and I'm like, I understand a money thing, but I have to have something I have to have something of like a let go. And I'm like, Andy's coming in town. He wants to see you and the girls because he hasn't met the girls.

278
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.020
Charles Dickens: And and she's like, well,

279
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:47.580
Charles Dickens: What can you and Andy Do like a lunch thing. And I'm like, he wants to see you and the girls and I want my friend that I haven't seen. And I'm like,

280
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:59.820
Charles Dickens: When to go out to Brentwood to meet your fucking friend and went to Cheesecake Factory and spent like $300 when I escaped. I didn't, I didn't say one word. I'm like, cool. The girls want to go ice skating and all this.

281
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:06.930
Charles Dickens: She's like, but I don't want you to charge my family. And I'm like, and I'm like Babe, you can say whatever you want.

282
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:17.280
Charles Dickens: I'm the motherfucker that pays for all the fights. I pay. I will we go to other people's houses. If it's 80 bucks. I'll be like, Hey doc. Here's 80 bucks.

283
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:24.720
Charles Dickens: And not one person has ever said, no, no. Charles man here. Here, take 60 back. I'm going to get $20 from other people.

284
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:35.460
Charles Dickens: So we'll have boxing not at our house because it's not big enough, but we'll have like these parties boxing parties and there will literally be like 50 people there and I pay for the whole thing.

285
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:46.680
Charles Dickens: So I'm thinking, hey, maybe some people will chip in. No, they don't. And so if we go there. My buddy shows up and I'm like hey look

286
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:58.470
Charles Dickens: I'm going to kind of treat this as like if you need help. You need to come ask me, I'll help with the girls. I'll play with them and all that, but once boxing starts. You know, I want to watch boxing and hang out with. And I haven't seen them in five and a half years.

287
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.240
Charles Dickens: So,

288
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.580
Charles Dickens: We do all that. And she ignores me the whole time. And then once boxing's over

289
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:12.870
Charles Dickens: I tell her I'm like hey, it's going to be over like 945 10 just let the girls stay up just let them stay up it's

290
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.810
Charles Dickens: Whatever they go to bed at like nine 930 anyways, let them stay up to 10. She's like, no, I'm going to put them asleep.

291
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:29.670
Charles Dickens: So I go up there like 10 o'clock and she's like, Oh my gosh, this has been fucking horrible put them asleep, and they're running around and all this. I told you I didn't want to cut my parents house.

292
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.890
Charles Dickens: They always act the fuck up, and you're going to put them both asleep, she rolls over and goes to sleep. So I'm like,

293
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:43.410
Charles Dickens: So I look at it as like, okay, like, I'll put them asleep because I just had this whole boxing thing.

294
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:50.220
Charles Dickens: But it's like we agree to this, and then it's like I already told you to make it easier just let them hang out their cousins are there.

295
00:44:50.820 --> 00:45:02.430
Charles Dickens: The uncles and like their cousins, like the younger ones are there and everyone's watching the boxing match if usually if everyone's paying attention and they're not going to act up right

296
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.130
Charles Dickens: So then she just goes to sleep and then I spend like the next hour because

297
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:20.940
Charles Dickens: One one sleep with me. Then they both went to sleep, you know, it's what kids do. So I'm like, how is this like a payoff. Like how is this. It's like I'm going to give you a little bit, but then I'm going to throw more stuff on you, man.

298
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:30.630
Charles Dickens: You know and and that's it is like, that's what's always in my head is like that she's gonna be like well

299
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:38.880
Charles Dickens: It's like she wants me to get better, but she always is going to have some type of justification like and

300
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.680
Charles Dickens: Just like

301
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:42.450
Just

302
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.400
Charles Dickens: All of that when it just comes to, like, well, you should you should

303
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.460
Charles Dickens: You should hang out with the girls.

304
00:45:51.600 --> 00:46:02.310
Charles Dickens: I see him every fucking day like and then she gets upset. I'm like, I see I'm every fucking day like why would you say fucking. That means you don't care. No, no. And then my thing is like you're gonna you talk for two days.

305
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:09.300
Charles Dickens: Why don't you get your fucking ass out of bed and get them ready for school and then take them to school.

306
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.890
Charles Dickens: I don't care to do it, Doc. That's not my problem. I that's not my issue my issue. So she's gone for two days. She's going to be home.

307
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:27.210
Charles Dickens: Tonight like late tonight, where they're already be asleep. So then should be home Friday and Saturday. And then, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, it should be like Wednesday from Hawaii. And it's just like

308
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:36.090
Charles Dickens: Why don't you spend time with them, you're at work all day long. So that's what I'm saying is there's there's always in the back of my head.

309
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.330
Charles Dickens: That I believe that's in the front of her head is

310
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.570
Charles Dickens: It's not resentment. It's just like

311
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:52.260
Charles Dickens: He can get over this and like she's never had a problem with me going out and doing stuff, but she's just will be like, Well, I don't think that

312
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.790
Charles Dickens: I think that he needs to get better before he goes out and we don't need to spend money.

313
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:10.740
Charles Dickens: And I've told her, like, because that's what she says is like you get to work out and you get to apply for jobs and you, you get to like hang out the house by yourself. And I'm like, it's just that is such a reductionist way to look at it and

314
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:28.050
Charles Dickens: And she's always like you have this, you have this like eloquent way of speaking that you talk your way out of things. I'm like, No, I'm just honest and I said, the thing is, the more honest. I am so doc if my wife says, How does this dress. Look, I want to be like. Now, I don't like it.

315
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.060
Charles Dickens: She doesn't like that.

316
00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:40.770
Charles Dickens: If, if I come home from the grocery and she's like, hypothetically, why didn't you get the milk, if I'd be like, fuck. Damn, I forgot it.

317
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:49.440
Charles Dickens: I said I could say to you, Hey, babe. Do you know what you won't believe me, they're out of milk. So I won't get this that

318
00:47:50.160 --> 00:48:05.910
Charles Dickens: She's like, but why. Why would you do that. Why would you lie to your wife. And I'm like, that's the thing is I don't lie. I don't. That's part of my problem. I mean I'm not saying I don't lie. But because everyone lies, but I'm saying, like, I am always always honest and it's always got me in

319
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:06.330
Charles Dickens: Trouble.

320
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:20.100
Charles Dickens: And I said, that's the thing is like women bitch that men aren't nice compassionate and tell them the truth. Well, I get beat up more, I think, for being honest. So that's the thing is when I tried to tell her, like, hey,

321
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:30.810
Charles Dickens: Like fantasy baseball is coming up and I'm actually like really, really good at fantasy sports like I finished like first and second all the time.

322
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:44.010
Charles Dickens: And the draft coming up and it's going to be like four hours. And she's like, Oh yeah, that's cool. That's fine. And I'll tell her like weeks in advance, and then I'll go in the room. And then after like 30 minutes. Are you going to be finished when you finished.

323
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:59.310
Charles Dickens: Are you, are you done and I'm like I told you it's gonna be like four hours and she's just like, oh my, like, Are you finished like I got to give the girls are bad. And I'm like, well go give them a bath like and then that's the thing. It's like always, like, interrupted, and then just

324
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:08.580
Charles Dickens: If we go somewhere and I take a bunch of pictures or whatever, I immediately send them to my wife, three months later, I can see pictures.

325
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:20.910
Charles Dickens: On her parents phones and iPad and her sisters. I've never even seen before. And she's like, Oh, I'm busy I can't send them to you. So it's like when I try to get this equilibrium and

326
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:33.180
Charles Dickens: I call it consistency and she says that I look for contradictions, but I look for consistency that that's a huge problem because I'm like hey, if you want pictures I send you pictures right away right away.

327
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:38.010
Charles Dickens: And sometimes I never seen them from you, um, you want to work late

328
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:46.980
Charles Dickens: You want to work late and I'm like, cool, or whatever. Okay. Well, if I'm with the girls all fucking day long.

329
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:54.030
Charles Dickens: And you want to come on and take a shower, that's fine. But then I need like a 25 minute break and you're like that you're not working.

330
00:49:54.870 --> 00:50:05.730
Charles Dickens: You don't love your girls there, they get, they get on everybody's nerves like third that's this huge is problem of light and I already gave you the money example and just the

331
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:14.280
Charles Dickens: You know, and just whatever and everything and like the food day is like, because we have this

332
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:25.800
Charles Dickens: Were like super, super healthy but I'm like hey, when I was at Mountain View, and I was gone I would come home. Some weeks, I'd be home at like 10 o'clock at night and have to leave like four in the morning.

333
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:33.420
Charles Dickens: One of my goals was never ever to give my kids McDonald's number

334
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.540
Charles Dickens: It's just I don't want whatever

335
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:53.010
Charles Dickens: I come home and for a couple days there's McDonald's KFC and all this stuff. So I didn't say anything because I was like okay, although that's one of my goals. Maybe that's an extreme go. But my wife is probably very overwhelmed and very busy and all that. So I'm not gonna say anything.

336
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:55.350
Charles Dickens: Well,

337
00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:02.190
Charles Dickens: I can't use that excuse of, like, oh, I'm overwhelmed and I'm tired. That

338
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.950
Charles Dickens: Why would you orders. You can order something to eat, because you can fix it, you have time

339
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:16.620
Charles Dickens: And that's what this huge problem is and then this is which we cover some other time. This would kind of gets me in trouble at all jobs. I've ever had. Is this whole

340
00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:29.130
Charles Dickens: Consistency thing of, of, like, let's be nice to everyone needs to be nice to each other and no one needs to backstab and do all this. So I'm trying to say like, Hey, babe. This is what I need.

341
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:41.100
Charles Dickens: Like bait and I like to gamble. But I'm smart with gambling. I don't try to like that. She's like anti gambling, no matter why she can't even stand

342
00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:56.910
Charles Dickens: My fantasy sports costs money. And I'm like, Yeah, but actually like to be around my friends and kind of just sit at a poker table and fill the flow and all this and kind of get into it. She's just like, I got into a poker league one time and

343
00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:07.680
Charles Dickens: She sabotaged it she completes you show up late for work or late for work and then she had office meetings on Friday, like, eight o'clock and

344
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:16.530
Charles Dickens: Office parties and then she had to go shopping for it and she sabotage. I've never confronted on that. And then it's like when we were we've been back to Kentucky once

345
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:23.910
Charles Dickens: We went visit some friends and she's like, how long do we have to be here and I don't want to be here and

346
00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:28.800
Charles Dickens: Other houses kind of dirty and then like I'm like hey, let me show you my town.

347
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:40.860
Charles Dickens: After like 30 minutes in the car, she's like, Oh, we got to get home. I want to see the girls and I'm like your parents are there. Sorry, my parents, they're fine. I'm trying to show you who I am and where I came from. We went to Fiji. This last year.

348
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:56.040
Charles Dickens: We spent three fucking hours trying to track down one of her cousins who has been deported for six DUIs in America. He's a drug addict.

349
00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:11.910
Charles Dickens: He was on drugs when we finally found him with my kid. He's got flies on him worms on him because he's homeless and all this stuff. And I'm like, and her dad is is he's like this dude's a scumbag. I don't want

350
00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:19.200
Charles Dickens: MY GRANDKIDS meeting him. He's a piece of shit. And I'm just, I'm trying to go with the flow. And I'm like, babe. What are we doing, like, what are we doing

351
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:34.380
Charles Dickens: We finally get there and she like hands on and off. Hello, Mike, what's that she's like, Oh, my aunt wanted to give them like $1,000 and I'm like we just spent fucking three hours, we don't have enough food. We don't have enough water, we need to go to the restaurant to the city.

352
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:40.770
Charles Dickens: Because you and I'm like, we went to my buddy's house and the girls had to take a nap.

353
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:49.350
Charles Dickens: You said it was too dirty like that. Like, that's the thing is like when I want to do something like with Andy this past weekend. She's like, Well, why don't you

354
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:57.120
Charles Dickens: Why don't like why do we have the boxing fight like why do we, why can't you just meet up and I'm like, we don't do that with your friends.

355
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like there's

356
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:05.370
Charles Dickens: Always this thing and that's where I often say is like consistency. It doesn't. I understand that. I don't have family here and

357
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:14.070
Charles Dickens: I don't have the fringe you have you know you immigrated here when you're 15 so you have a lot more people, you know, in the Bay Area. I just want consistency. So

358
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:21.780
Charles Dickens: That's what I want. Like, if we're going to go to Brentwood, which is like an hour and a half of traffic sometimes to see your friends.

359
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:37.200
Charles Dickens: Why can't we go to San Rafael, which is like 30 minutes without traffic and our we're trying to see my friends like that. That's what I tried to get across to her and she just like, Oh, you just you make it all about you and all this stuff and I'm just like,

360
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.430
Charles Dickens: And then it's hard to talk to my mom because my mom.

361
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.310
Charles Dickens: She still was in denial, which deal with us as a kids.

362
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:53.670
Charles Dickens: Because my dad, my real dad was a drug addict and she left us at home with them and all that and now she's

363
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.090
Charles Dickens: She always if I call her to be like

364
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:05.100
Charles Dickens: I mean, she's with my stepdad now for like 25 years and he's a great man and all that, but it's like she doesn't. She won't come visit

365
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:23.190
Charles Dickens: She's like, I don't like to fly, but then she goes and sees my step dad's family all over the US, they'll drive 20 hours to go to like fucking Mexican border in Texas to see her his kids and all that, which is kind of same thing that my wife does and

366
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:30.990
Charles Dickens: I try to be like, Hey, what are you doing this situation and this and should I don't have any advice for you. I'm so sorry.

367
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:43.080
Charles Dickens: And then she's like, I don't understand, like how you got on addicted to opioids and I'm like your mother fuckers should probably be lucky that as you should be lucky or three kids aren't in jail with the shit that you expose us to and you are a cop.

368
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:49.380
Charles Dickens: And you let that shit go on in your house. So she didn't like complete denial. She just is.

369
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.560
Charles Dickens: You know, so

370
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.570
Charles Dickens: That

371
00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:02.400
Charles Dickens: And like I said, I talked to my buddy last night, and he's just like, I just, I don't believe you. Like, I believe you, but I just don't believe you.

372
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:15.750
Charles Dickens: You can always be there for me if you need to talk. And I'm like, Yeah, man. I understand that. But you got kids in high school and you got to take care of them and you don't need to sit here and waste your time with me and so

373
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:22.770
Charles Dickens: But that so what I'm trying to work on is, I know my wife is like a huge trigger and she she

374
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:35.880
Charles Dickens: She you know she's already columns, like can you pick me up from the airport and then take me to work and then then can you pick me up at 630 but pick the girls at first take them home bade them and feed I fucking doing that shit.

375
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:51.780
Charles Dickens: Now I will pick your ass up first, because you're the farthest away like why would I go through Alameda fucking trap. Even though alchemy is not bad, it's just a bunch of stoplights and all that shit. I'm like, no, I need to do what's convenient for the girls like you can work at home.

376
00:56:52.830 --> 00:57:11.520
Charles Dickens: And the whole raising the kids as a whole. My wife has a huge bark and I mean huge bark and she ain't got no fucking bite. She ain't she will she will scream at the girls for five minutes and a minute later hug them and give them candy.

377
00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:20.760
Charles Dickens: And I'm like, you have no because we don't spank i'ma you ain't got no by you ain't got no bite you have nobody is them kids ain't scared to you.

378
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:30.150
Charles Dickens: So that's that's that's a whole nother issue. We talked about how about raising the kids and she's, she's it so you know a little door knob thing that

379
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:39.030
Charles Dickens: The kids can oh so I finally bought those well she mean he is scared that they're going to go to school until a teacher and CPS is going to call and arrest us

380
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:44.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their door lock safety guards, so the kids don't go outside.

381
00:57:45.600 --> 00:58:01.530
Charles Dickens: No, no. Well, no, I put them on the, on the, on their rooms so at night if their act up because it takes two hours to put them to sleep, but is another time talking about that is so I put those things where they can open their door, but I do it for like 20 or 30 seconds.

382
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:05.160
Charles Dickens: What she thinks that's abuse. I'm like, That's not abuse because

383
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:14.640
Charles Dickens: Some of the stuff that I'm here that people do to their kids. I've got friends that have like a five year old twins and he puts them in diapers.

384
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:28.200
Charles Dickens: And has a porta potty or whatever the mini potty in their room and puts the little thing where they can't open the door and they have cameras in there and he doesn't let them out for anything. And he's like, that's how they go to sleep. And that's how a lot of people do it.

385
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:35.130
Charles Dickens: That I've learned from and she's just like the CPS is going to show up and arrest us like you can't do that and

386
00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.120
Charles Dickens: She's like, You're not allowed to

387
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:46.980
Charles Dickens: I don't want you kiss the girls on the lips, and I'm like, but you kiss on the lips and she's like, Yeah, but I'm a woman. And I'm like, well,

388
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:57.330
Charles Dickens: Kobe Bryant is shown on the TV all the time. And these memorials kissing his like 13 year old daughter. Yeah. Well, that's not you. And there's just this whole

389
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:09.690
Charles Dickens: Fight about how to raise the kids and stuff that I know that everything changes us when the kids came, we already had some issues before the opioids, but it has to do with the kids.

390
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:16.650
Charles Dickens: About how to raise them and then you throw in this opioids and losing the job and the money. It's just

391
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.260
Charles Dickens: What completely up

392
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it sounds like you guys maybe need to get into some kind of marriage counseling.

393
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We've tried

394
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.370
Charles Dickens: I've tried for three, four years.

395
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.120
Charles Dickens: And she always has an excuse. Oh, I have meetings on that day I have this

396
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:40.470
Charles Dickens: I don't want to tell my parents. And I'm like, well, now they're both in school. So we can go like whatever every Monday at four o'clock and she's like,

397
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:48.690
Charles Dickens: No, I have to do this. So I've tried it. I know from being a counselor. If you can't push them into it's only going to push them further away. I've tried

398
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:55.290
Charles Dickens: She won't talk to anyone. She doesn't talk to her. She doesn't tell anyone anything about her problems, no one

399
00:59:55.710 --> 01:00:07.140
Charles Dickens: And she said that that's this that's why she's so strong. She's like, I don't need to go to my friends or my parents for advice. I can work on it myself. And I'm like, doesn't mean you're weak. You need a different point of view.

400
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:13.140
Charles Dickens: That's all I'm saying. She's like, no, so she just she won't go

401
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what do you think, what do you do when you have a partner that's unwilling to take a look at the bigger picture and

402
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:45.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Change, you know, their behaviors as well as take a look at solutions for issues that are coming up, because what I hear is there's this inequity where she's you know here and you're here and we've got to get you to be able to get on an even playing field with her. That make sense.

403
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:56.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We've got to get, you know, to where you are able to do the things that you need to do and feel that you are a partner and not beneath her

404
01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you're not been either, you know, this is a partnership. It's that's what marriage is about is being partners.

405
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:09.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if there's, you know, a continuous in equity in that that's going to wreck. Yeah.

406
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, on top of everything else that's going on, you know, with you, trying to you know get your life back and trying to figure out where you want to go and what you want to do for you.

407
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:26.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, I can't stress enough how important it is that you know you and your recovery and you getting back to

408
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:39.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being in feeling healthy mentally, emotionally, spiritually, you know, is is vital to that whole piece you know you are you know you hurt you and her are supposed to come together and

409
01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's just this big, you know, in equity.

410
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So being able to do things for you and is going to be vitally important. You know that

411
01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:03.570
Charles Dickens: Yeah, I mean, I do know that. And that's the thing is, is she, she i'm not saying she gets confused and thinks she gets surprised because she's like

412
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:12.510
Charles Dickens: Like what you just said I wouldn't have said it that way. You said it better than I would, but I can say something like that to her and she's like that makes so much sense.

413
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:24.360
Charles Dickens: So if you understand that. Why are you still having problems. And I'm like, Oh, fuck. Now we're just right back to the beginning. It's just like going right back to the beginning. And, you know, and I just I don't and

414
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:43.110
Charles Dickens: I, you know, and then there's just like certain things that we fight over that we shouldn't like her dad is like this master handyman, and I appreciate everything that he does, but this is my fucking house and I don't want them doing anything without telling me, and she finds that disrespectful.

415
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:51.390
Charles Dickens: And she's like, Don't disrespect my dad. I'm like, I didn't say one fucking word about your dad. I'm talking about you, like, I don't want

416
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:59.160
Charles Dickens: So thank if my mom came in here and rearrange the girls room you that would piss you off because it's your kids and

417
01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:10.470
Charles Dickens: Like it's different because I'm a man. This is my house. I'm supposed to fix something don't run to your dad and tell you. And she's like, well, that's disrespect. I'm not. No, I'm not talking about your dad at all about you like

418
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:25.470
Charles Dickens: We have to do we have to stay on the same table. And here's the thing. Is your dad is so good at stuff that maybe I need him to teach me some stuff so I can be better. Your Dad's not always going to be here and something that made her really upsetting.

419
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:32.640
Charles Dickens: And I just said, you know, like if you're not going to be here for me now. Like, and I've told her, I said, hey,

420
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:40.320
Charles Dickens: The more the more you don't respond to me the more resentful. I'm going to get, the more better that I get

421
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:56.370
Charles Dickens: And I said, here's the thing is, if you're not going to support me during this like my parents are 75 and 78 years old, like they could die at any moment. They're not the healthiest people because they just eat go out to eat all the time and whatever, and

422
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:10.230
Charles Dickens: I walked to get the mail in the morning. I'm like, Mom, you walk an acre to get your newspaper in the mail. That's not enough exercise. I'm like, my parents could die tomorrow, and I would, I could think that you would be like

423
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.280
Charles Dickens: Get this money issue and

424
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:22.950
Charles Dickens: You know, maybe we keep the girls home and then it's like, then I don't even know if you could be there for me emotionally because like

425
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:29.070
Charles Dickens: You know, and then died. Is she got really, really pissed and like, why would I ever think that I'm like

426
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:44.070
Charles Dickens: This is the stuff that I should not be thinking, but that's what's popping in my head. And that's part of the opioids. But that's also part of our dynamic of our marriage is like I shouldn't have these thoughts that I'm having and

427
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:58.470
Charles Dickens: You know, and then she says stuff like, well, you would be stupid to cheat on me leave me and all that. And I'm like, I already know all that, like, I'm not fucking stupid you make $400,000 a year. Like why would I ever like, I don't

428
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:11.580
Charles Dickens: I'm trying to tell you. That's what some addicts. Do I don't have any of that. Like, I appreciate my life and I appreciate you and all this. It's just that if I don't get better.

429
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:30.060
Charles Dickens: And it's going to get worse for us, or if, as I get better and you're not supporting me along the way. I will get resentful. I'm telling you, because that is that that's just, it's just, that's just how life is. That has nothing to do with me. That's just

430
01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:31.020
Charles Dickens: How people are

431
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:32.490
Charles Dickens: So,

432
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's just what happens when there's this whole inequity. That happens and you getting better. Again, might not be so great for the relationship if she's not willing to change make changes with you.

433
01:05:45.210 --> 01:06:02.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what it's about. It's, it's about finding the solutions that work and being on an equal plane together and just because right now she's the one that makes the income doesn't make her better than or deserve more than you do in the relationship.

434
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:13.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the piece that people forget, you know, it's like, you know, the one the breadwinner things that they should be pampered and they should get, you know,

435
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be catered to but they forget that the other person is a partner and what they do what you do at home with your, with your girls and taking care of the house is a job is a job and it is work.

436
01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.580
Charles Dickens: And what's funny is like, I've always enjoyed like housework, because

437
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:36.300
Charles Dickens: My mom, she made us we were 10 years old she taught us housework.

438
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:44.940
Charles Dickens: And when we were in trouble. She wouldn't watch her clothes or cook or dinner or anything. So I'm actually very efficient with it and i and i say stuff like, not only is this

439
01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:57.810
Charles Dickens: That I enjoy it. But part of it when it becomes like a burden somewhere. I'm having a bad day and I have to work through it like, and she says stuff like, Well, I wouldn't be with you if you didn't like that stuff. And I'm like, I'm

440
01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:05.010
Charles Dickens: Like, that's not what I'm like that's not what I'm saying. What I'm telling you is it's very shameful.

441
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:15.120
Charles Dickens: Or I'm ashamed of not having a job, so I don't need you to remind me that I don't have a job and everything that you feel about our situation.

442
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:22.110
Charles Dickens: Not only do I feel worse because I'm from a paternalistic society where it's male dominated and all that.

443
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:29.670
Charles Dickens: That not only do I feel ashamed, is that now you throw in the opioid stuff and then I tell her stuff like

444
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:39.180
Charles Dickens: When I when I'm said before about having a bad day. I'm like, What, like, seriously. Like, what would you do if you poop once every four days.

445
01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:51.450
Charles Dickens: And then like it takes you literally 20 minutes to poke and then after that you're digging poop out of your ass because it's disgusting. And then, and then she knows this.

446
01:07:51.960 --> 01:08:02.490
Charles Dickens: It takes some I'm not lying. It will take 15 minutes to pee because it just like falls out and it falls, because that's all the Suboxone and I'm like, and then the stuff with my

447
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:22.020
Charles Dickens: Body temperature and just all these side effects that you get from Suboxone and I'm like, then you and then the nausea and the vertigo and the memory loss and the stutter and stuff, because I had a stutter as a kid. And then my mom put me in classes in it and it went away.

448
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:30.150
Charles Dickens: And it's very frustrating and then you throw in say show and shut. A. Those are my girls say show and shut. A like

449
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:36.660
Charles Dickens: throwing stuff and you're trying to calm them down and then you running out. Like, why are they fight like this. And what are you doing like

450
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:53.580
Charles Dickens: That is extremely overwhelming for me. And I don't think you realize like how well I do to like to stay in control of myself and then sometimes I'll be like, I got to take a break and I'll go out on the balcony and then like two minutes later. She's like, wasn't that bad.

451
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.330
Charles Dickens: Like that wasn't that bad, like, Are you okay, I'm just like,

452
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:05.460
Charles Dickens: You know, I mean, I think she gets it, but she just thinks it's very easy like she thinks it's like

453
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.350
Charles Dickens: Like

454
01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:23.130
Charles Dickens: Like she says, like say show is is that's the four year old and she is a nightmare. Sometimes she just like for no reason, showed us start flopping like a fish. She was he does in the morning and she searched

455
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.510
Charles Dickens: For no reason and she'll take Chinese food and throw it and take her spoon and throw it and all this stuff and all this.

456
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:38.850
Charles Dickens: And she means like I have to stay calm or it'll makes a show worse. And I'm like, that's what you have to do to me and she's like, No, you're a grown fucking adult like

457
01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.210
Charles Dickens: Like, you need to move on from things very quickly. And I'm like,

458
01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:51.450
Charles Dickens: It's very hard to move on from things very quickly when you're on my face. You need to move on from things very quickly when I haven't had time to process them. And I'm like, babe.

459
01:09:51.750 --> 01:10:04.980
Charles Dickens: I don't think you will. It is very, very, very frustrating. It's humbling it's shameful to know what's going on, and one side of your brain, the other side. This chemical that is just

460
01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:12.840
Charles Dickens: Eat like you fill it in your brain like having you do stuff that you don't want to do and all this stuff and having to sit back and like

461
01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:22.800
Charles Dickens: Come all together to pull it together and to know that you're not this way. You're not this and I was like you were at the lab. You were with me in the ER when the psychiatry says like

462
01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:31.770
Charles Dickens: I mean, at that time, it was methadone is like you understand that your husband is having like psychotic episodes from methadone, like this is

463
01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:51.000
Charles Dickens: This is all drug induced. This is not anything that you've said in the he said about his life. This is all drug induced and it's a medical thing and that's what I'm trying to like educator on like this is not this is something that some people can't control.

464
01:10:51.270 --> 01:11:06.090
Charles Dickens: And for me to have the ability to keep things in line, like I do, it's, it's, it's very hard. It's very hard and and you have to understand that and she just sometimes. She's like, Yeah, I know, and

465
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:15.180
Charles Dickens: Some days for like three or four days. She's just like, amazing and just very receptive and very compassionate and all that and then

466
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:28.140
Charles Dickens: She wants things to change and then like what, like the fight on Saturday, how it started, even before that. Is she wanted to know what what's Dr. Jamison doing

467
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:38.040
Charles Dickens: I already told you what she does. When you see her again. I don't have an appointment. Why, but, you know, which I already told you about the whole neurologist and all that. And she's just like,

468
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:50.700
Charles Dickens: And she's like, You gotta stop us. Yeah. But this is just, I'm like, babe. It's literally been like seven days like you. This is a, this is a process and

469
01:11:51.150 --> 01:12:02.400
Charles Dickens: And she's like, well, you told me when you found Breitbart, it's six to 12 months. Well, that's ridiculous because you're not out on the street sucking dick and and did all this stuff. And I'm like,

470
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:11.850
Charles Dickens: I was like, she's like yours is induced because of the neurologists and I'm like, I understand that, but I was like

471
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:18.780
Charles Dickens: Some of the stuff that I told her. I'm like, Yeah, you know, I probably wanted to do this and this, because I have this inside and dad and all this.

472
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:30.090
Charles Dickens: But I'm like, it's always going to be a case by case. But no matter what. It's no matter what. It's kind of be a process and it's going to be different. It is

473
01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:47.910
Charles Dickens: And what I try to tell her, as I was like the guy that you used to have, and she will give examples of, like, she's like when I had when I had say shell and I had the stitches in my ass. You went to like all these places in the Bay Area to find me as a pillow and

474
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:53.070
Charles Dickens: So I could go to the bathroom and go, and it'd be comfortable like

475
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:59.550
Charles Dickens: You do anything like you, you will go to a different town to find like what the girls one and they said the other, and

476
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:12.150
Charles Dickens: And you found our house and you save us money and all this stuff. Like, that's what I want. And I'm like, that's what I want. Like that we have the exact same goes like, trust me. And I'm like, you have to realize that

477
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:17.400
Charles Dickens: We're on the same page with the goes, we're not on the same page with

478
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:23.760
Charles Dickens: We're on the same page with how to get there, everything is a process and you

479
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:32.970
Charles Dickens: You have to go along with that. And she's in show say okay, but then the days when I if I and it's it's usually not me like

480
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:48.240
Charles Dickens: I'm not saying I'm not a dick, because I can be a dick is I'm not saying that like right when she walks in the door. I'm like, I never call her names. I never have. I'm not like don't talk to me because I don't cuss in front of kids. I know it'll be something like

481
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:55.650
Charles Dickens: Why, Why'd you turn the heater up and she's like, I'm code. And I'm like, I don't care if your code go put on some clothes.

482
01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.600
Charles Dickens: And that sparked a huge fight. And then I was just, and I'm like,

483
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:09.540
Charles Dickens: When we talked about it later. I'm like, in my head at the moment I'm like this motherfucker knows should know that.

484
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:22.680
Charles Dickens: Up and down body temperature with the with the Suboxone he's got girls, he's cooking, it's, it's hot outside, it's hot in the kitchen. He just gave them baths and all this stuff. Maybe it's a little overwhelming.

485
01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:31.590
Charles Dickens: And you could have been, like, Hey, what's going on, Charles. Is everything okay she's like I'm fucking doing that, you know, you're not supposed to fucking talk to me that way.

486
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:37.980
Charles Dickens: And I'm like, I understand. Now I understand, well if you understand it. Now, why didn't you understand it then. And I'm like,

487
01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:46.350
Charles Dickens: I just like that you you have to stop thinking that way like

488
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.150
Charles Dickens: You should appreciate

489
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:56.730
Charles Dickens: That now I have the insight. Well, you should have. If you know and I said, but what you don't realize is, sometimes I don't know when it's Suboxone

490
01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:05.370
Charles Dickens: Or whatever. That's my I say this a box like, you know, I don't know if it's the opioids and the brain or if it's me, like, some things are blurred out like

491
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.960
Charles Dickens: You have a bad day.

492
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.590
Charles Dickens: And you blurt out like you know like

493
01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:19.620
Charles Dickens: What did you fix me lamb today instead of hamburgers or whatever. And I'll be like, if I can talk about. I just fixed a hold on what's going on.

494
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:32.640
Charles Dickens: Everything okay like I just made you dinner. Well, I had a really bad day at work that I was like, that doesn't come from you. And she's like, I don't. I have a hard time thinking that you have a bad day because you don't work.

495
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you do

496
01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:45.960
Charles Dickens: And she's like an exercise and you you do all that. And I'm like, I know. And I'm like, yeah, I mean, probably some people would love my life but I don't like

497
01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:58.020
Charles Dickens: I don't, because everything that I do every day. Now, I basically when I was a cop because of swing shifts and all of that. I'd have like three or four days off. So I would be doing

498
01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:08.520
Charles Dickens: Everything I do now in those one of those one or two of those days off, but now I I do it all the time. Now that would take me like the whole day.

499
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.950
Charles Dickens: Where now I do stuff from like eight to like 11 or whatever and then go work out and

500
01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:19.050
Charles Dickens: Look for a job in the afternoon. So I was already doing all that stuff anyways. And I'm like, that's what you don't realize

501
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:34.380
Charles Dickens: I was already I control the money. Well, like the bills. I do all the girls medical I do all the girls schooling. I do all the gross shop and I do all the laundry. I was doing all this before she does help at times, but I do all that, because she has the the

502
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:40.980
Charles Dickens: She works like 80 hours a week, sometimes 60 hours and I knew that even when I was a cop.

503
01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:50.400
Charles Dickens: That I would have these three or four days off every now and then. So it I like to do that. I like to cook. And another reason I like to cook is because

504
01:16:50.730 --> 01:17:00.360
Charles Dickens: She's like, it makes a huge mess. When she cooks. So I like to keep everything clean so I like to do that because I grew up thinking my dad and my step dad.

505
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.820
Charles Dickens: my step dad still does it. He will sit at the table, and he will not get up my mom will bring in the salad. She will bring him a fork.

506
01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:16.800
Charles Dickens: She will he'll be like, I want some apple juice. She'll go get them apple juice. And I'm like, I never want to be like that. My mom's happy. So she wants to do that she can. She's happy now.

507
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:25.410
Charles Dickens: I'm like, I won't do that, I want to I want, I want to do my wife's laundry. I want to clean. I'm going to do all this because I want it to be equally. I don't want to paternalistic

508
01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:33.210
Charles Dickens: So I think she just got so used to how things were because I was already doing all that stuff. But now she looks at it as like

509
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:34.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not a big deal.

510
01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:40.590
Charles Dickens: When you were doing that all the time, but I know for a fact. I know, I know that my wife.

511
01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:52.260
Charles Dickens: Always say 99% and it pisses her off. But I'm just, I mean I'm present chance. Pretty sure my wife's not cheating on me because there's always a percent. I just think

512
01:17:53.160 --> 01:18:11.310
Charles Dickens: But I know that she, I know that she adores me and I know that she loves me and I know she doesn't want to leave me. And I know that she's extremely scared and extremely insecure and she she goes, she'll go along with the scared, but she's insecure because

513
01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:33.060
Charles Dickens: She doesn't want anyone thinking that we don't have money, and that we can't live a normal life there Indian. And then there's this whole Indian culture about Dr attorney or something else, her sister is a biologist. She's an attorney and our other sister is a engineer.

514
01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:46.440
Charles Dickens: The engineer. She's a fucking she's a bitch. I can't stand her. She's a multi multi millionaire and she married a man that inherited $30 million and they're complete right wing fucking assholes.

515
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:53.730
Charles Dickens: Her other sister. That's a biologist is like, the sweetest lady and her husband's a fucking right wing dickhead to

516
01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:12.420
Charles Dickens: And they inherited a $5 million house in Milpitas, so they have kind of ship kind of set he he inherited his parents house, but his parents live in a mobile home. So the reason why I tell you this is because that all happened before I was married. So there was this whole

517
01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:15.090
Charles Dickens: Show me shimmy is

518
01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:27.780
Charles Dickens: She's not married. She's the latest to get married, and she has she has a condo in San Francisco, which is worth a million dollars and we still have it.

519
01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:35.610
Charles Dickens: But now she's like, I want to get a bigger house. I want a bigger house and I want a yard and I want and I don't

520
01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:46.950
Charles Dickens: Want my family thinking this, and we need to be. I have a Porsche. That's why she wanted me to wash your car because she was going to an important meeting and she wants them to see that her car stays clean

521
01:19:47.460 --> 01:20:00.270
Charles Dickens: And she wants, and she doesn't like to drive my car because she likes my car, but not for work and she she she she's upset when she has to bargain shop for clothes because she never had a bargain shop before

522
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.770
Charles Dickens: She wants to go to Janie and jack for the girls and Walnut Creek and I'm like,

523
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:22.080
Charles Dickens: I'm like, I love polo but I buy my fucking kids polo because in fucking six months, they're going to be too old and I'm like you have like you got to get out of this mindset that you got to look better because of this Indian families that you got to look better than everyone else, like

524
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

525
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:32.580
Charles Dickens: You just have to look better than everyone else in your family and and that that's the thing is we have to sit here and get on the same page and

526
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:34.290
Charles Dickens: So,

527
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. A lot of you guys got a lot of things to

528
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To work through. That's for sure. You know,

529
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And treating this whole thing like you have

530
01:20:51.300 --> 01:21:00.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like you have a disease like you have something. I mean, if you were to find out that you had cancer, cancer, and you were going through the treatments to get better.

531
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It wouldn't be something that you would get through within a month, but something that would take six months to a year to actually start working through the process for it to go into remission.

532
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the same mindset that has to be when it comes to what you're going through right now to

533
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:23.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not something that's going to be fixed overnight. It's a process and it takes time and there has to be

534
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:31.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Consistency, there has to be work from you, and there has to be compassionate from her and understanding as well.

535
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:41.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because if not, that's when all of these, you know, all these cracks start coming and you start noticing them and then you get miserable and things aren't working the way that they're supposed to.

536
01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:53.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I really think that she needs to realize that what you do is a job. And so right now you're unable to be able to

537
01:21:54.210 --> 01:22:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do more than what you're able to do and her be okay with with where that's at.

538
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so there needs to be some understanding. You know what I mean. Charles and needs to be that piece because it's not going to get any better if you

539
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you continually stay in this frustrated state, you know,

540
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:21.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you're continually feeling like what you do as a good enough or you continually feel like what you do.

541
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:30.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you don't deserve to have these times, because you do deserve that the signs you deserve to have time off. You deserve to be able to spend time with your friends.

542
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:41.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there has to be that understanding and that piece there has to be, you need to have an outlet. You need to have people that you can go to that you can communicate with that understand where you're at.

543
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And understand what you're going through. It doesn't mean that she's bad or that she's writing or that you know it just

544
01:22:50.250 --> 01:23:00.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Means that the circle of argument that you guys continually stay in isn't benefiting anybody there. You guys have to get in the mindset of solution focused

545
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what's the solution for this. How can we come together in this area and and change that thought process. Does that make sense.

546
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:12.810
Charles Dickens: Yeah, and part of the what you're saying about the solution.

547
01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:19.170
Charles Dickens: mentality is she part of it is she wants me to be someone that I'm not like she

548
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.970
Charles Dickens: She's like why don't you go

549
01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:39.900
Charles Dickens: Go to Pinkerton or Google and these places where you want to work and, like, try to network and stuff. And I'm like, I've never done that. I don't know how to do it. I'm not a suck up and stuff. And I just got on LinkedIn, when I lost

550
01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:47.010
Charles Dickens: When I resigned from Mountain View. Because, and she's like, well, go do this and do this and this and I'm like,

551
01:23:48.810 --> 01:23:56.910
Charles Dickens: That's not my personality and it's something I have to work on, but I need to get through this medical stuff before I start being someone I've no longer

552
01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:03.420
Charles Dickens: And she's like, What, so you're just going to sit at home and apply for a job. And I'm like, like what else can I do like I don't

553
01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:08.910
Charles Dickens: Like, and you have all these connections. She knows so many people

554
01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:27.420
Charles Dickens: And she doesn't want to reach out to people because she doesn't want people to know that I'm unemployed, because it looks bad. So unlike the only thing that I could do is sit here and apply for jobs and it it's, you know, and I've had some hits and stuff like that. But, you know, and

555
01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.230
Charles Dickens: And you know, I think that she's like, Well, why don't you go volunteer.

556
01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:42.060
Charles Dickens: That's a great idea. And I'm like, okay, but I have to make sure that I'm stable.

557
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:54.420
Charles Dickens: And I'm like, and I'm not talking about as like Babe, I'm not talking mine when I say stable like 95% of time. I'm talking about medically. Like, I don't want to be like volunteering with a bunch of kids.

558
01:24:54.900 --> 01:25:13.350
Charles Dickens: And I have a seizure, and I want to see this neurologist. First I want to get medically stable and then let me go from there. And then network and volunteer and she just like, but you're not doing anything. It's just like we're right back to Ground Zero like that's the thing is like is

559
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:25.140
Charles Dickens: That try to tell her arms, like, you know, of course, everything is medical number one, but under that is we have to deal with the Suboxone and then we have to deal with restless leg syndrome and then

560
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:31.020
Charles Dickens: And I still have problems with lights and I froze with the sun and all this other stuff though my

561
01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:39.450
Charles Dickens: Maybe I can't go back to work yet i mean the the neurologist at Kaiser he put me off work until July, and she's like, but that doesn't count.

562
01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:47.820
Charles Dickens: Because you don't get any disability. So she's like, I know you're disabled but I guess you're not disabled because you're not getting any money. And I'm like,

563
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:59.100
Charles Dickens: That's just and I'm like, I understand your preface Bay, but it's like I have, like, I don't want to go through this huge process of getting a job and

564
01:25:59.610 --> 01:26:09.120
Charles Dickens: Background investigations and your family getting contacted again and all this stuff and everyone gets excited and I get a job and then like three weeks in, I just

565
01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.670
Charles Dickens: Can't. I'm not going to have the problems.

566
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:14.760
Charles Dickens: I'm not going to have the problems that I would methadone. Oh my gosh.

567
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:18.900
Charles Dickens: What a fucking nightmare. I'm like, I'm not gonna have

568
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:26.010
Charles Dickens: Those type of problem by need to make sure that like I can do because that's that's

569
01:26:27.090 --> 01:26:34.200
Charles Dickens: What I'm doing now and everything I'm doing now is like the kids and exercising and all that. I got to this point.

570
01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:42.150
Charles Dickens: And then are always is like, no, no. You need to go back to work in January and I'm like, Fuck that dude I'm going back in November, like, I'm done like

571
01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:54.030
Charles Dickens: I'm this I'm ready to go back. Well, he shouldn't assign the form and he did and and that's what happened is I got, I got it. I couldn't handle all that workload.

572
01:26:54.390 --> 01:27:09.660
Charles Dickens: And I could handle just, you know, normal stuff. It was too much for me. And I could handle the commute. I couldn't handle these 18 hour days going like right back into it. I should have. I should have either waited to go in January or should have went on.

573
01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:22.920
Charles Dickens: What's it called like when they take your gun and like desk duty. Basically, I should have done light duty. I should have done like light duty to get back into it and things like that. And that's what I'm telling her, like, I can't go full swing because

574
01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:30.990
Charles Dickens: I'm a really hard worker and I really liked the work that I'm going to go I'm going full strength from day one.

575
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:38.070
Charles Dickens: And that's what happened is I went back and I back in the car and I got 40 pounds of gear on me. I'm in fights and then

576
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:49.050
Charles Dickens: Then the side effects from the Methadone started happening and wasn't as bad as it was in the beginning, but then I started having the paranoia and some hallucinations, but I'm like okay, it's the methodology and then

577
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:57.930
Charles Dickens: Once the stuff came in from the co workers of the harassment or all that stuff. It became that's when I really increased the paranoia.

578
01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:04.680
Charles Dickens: So I need to prevent all of that. And she's like, Yeah, but you know that now, and I'm like, but that was one methadone.

579
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:17.100
Charles Dickens: And marijuana and I had no doctors. I didn't have anyone I had the neurologist, that would barely see me now I have all the support system that I need to be like okay I got to do this and this and this and this.

580
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:25.620
Charles Dickens: And it's, it's just always very simplistic to her, which is that's that's a normal American or normal person. I understand that.

581
01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:33.000
Charles Dickens: It's very, it's very normal for her to respond like that this simplistic way of thinking.

582
01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:40.020
Charles Dickens: Hey, if you didn't smoke crack and you didn't sleep on a cardboard box and prostitute yourself, you could probably have a better life.

583
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:48.360
Charles Dickens: Absolutely. Half of the homeless people in Oakland. But that's just not the solution in the long term. So that's just what I'm trying to get get across to her.

584
01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what are you going to your you see the neurologist on Monday.

585
01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Correct take

586
01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:08.520
Charles Dickens: This, this is the neurologist that minor all just always referred to, I just couldn't go to them because I had Kaiser and this guy like right here, this article he wrote for the Mayo Clinic.

587
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.810
Charles Dickens: So he's, he's very, very

588
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:22.770
Charles Dickens: Renowned so got to after I finished with you have to go and get my neurology medical records from Kaiser

589
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:37.290
Charles Dickens: Yeah, and figure out what to do from there and hopefully I can get on a plan to figure out what to do. But Dr. Jamison was saying maybe the psychiatrist. I didn't want to keep chatting back and forth in the group.

590
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.470
Charles Dickens: She's like, maybe the psychiatrists can help you with some additional medication. And I'm like,

591
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.430
Charles Dickens: Maybe I'm missing something like, I don't

592
01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:56.340
Charles Dickens: Think like I've never had these issues until opioids. So I don't know what psychosis, or what she's talking about and why

593
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:13.680
Charles Dickens: Why, what what medication. Does she want me to take to address what like I don't I don't understand that. Like I don't are is she, and I'm not saying you are. But if you are like, am I being seen as someone with

594
01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:27.720
Charles Dickens: Some type of psychosis issue that's not related to the Suboxone and opioids or she's saying it is because of the Suboxone because that's where I'm getting confused because I don't

595
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:37.170
Charles Dickens: Understand all the lines of depression and just buy me a on. I know all those disorders, and I'm like,

596
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:43.020
Charles Dickens: My life would completely change if I could get off the Suboxone

597
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:57.240
Charles Dickens: Be medically healthy and have a job, Gary. And then that should mean I would still have problems, but then we would be on that kind of evil playing field. That's what I feel like I get medically better

598
01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:10.770
Charles Dickens: It'll address. Yeah, the psychological stuff that that's that's what I feel. I don't know if she thinks something else. And like I said, when I was last at Kaiser and the, er, they kept saying like

599
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.260
Charles Dickens: You know, before they

600
01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:17.880
Charles Dickens: I don't know. I don't know if people are trying to think that

601
01:31:19.290 --> 01:31:21.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's more than what it is.

602
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:33.420
Charles Dickens: Yeah, because they're like, Are you sure you've never been hospitalized. I'm like, I've never there is no psychiatric history until the methadone. I'm telling you, like there is zero. The other opioids, where the

603
01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:42.330
Charles Dickens: The seizures of I got the Methadone started this whole psychosis and they're like, Are you sure and then like we have to talk to your wife, and then

604
01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:50.220
Charles Dickens: She means telling me, they're all like we think he's hiding something. And she's like, No, no, I'm telling you like this dude change once he started taking methadone that

605
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.040
Charles Dickens: That if people think like

606
01:31:54.180 --> 01:32:01.080
Charles Dickens: An underlying schizophrenia or bipolar or something, but it's not. I don't hear voices I don't, I don't know, it's just

607
01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.290
Charles Dickens: Maybe that's something I shouldn't even be thinking about, but

608
01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, let's get you through your

609
01:32:07.890 --> 01:32:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Through your appointment on Monday.

610
01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I, you know, don't. I'm a therapist. I'm not a doctor. And so there's that piece. So I'm here to help guide you

611
01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Through this process and to give you an outlet and to be able to walk you and talk you through all of these stressors in your life that you're going through so that it doesn't get worse for you.

612
01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:34.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's my role.

613
01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:45.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so what I am suggesting is that you get through your appointment on Monday, see what that doctor says, and take a look at that piece.

614
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:56.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because of it is you know strictly from the methadone and now you're on Suboxone and the plan is to take you off the Suboxone right

615
01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To get you to a point where you won't need it.

616
01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe the neurologist has other options and other solutions for the things that you are experiencing because of the medication. You know what I mean.

617
01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's how you and I will be working together.

618
01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:28.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so I don't know what Dr jamison's idea is or plan is, but I certainly can have a conversation with her and find out more, so that we can get some clarity on this part.

619
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:43.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we can kind of dissect it a little bit and figure out, you know where to go from here. Again, I just think a lot is going to depend on this this doctor's appointment for you on Monday to

620
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, I've got to cut this

621
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Out I have somebody else in the waiting room to. Can I put you on my schedule for Thursday again at nine o'clock for next week.

622
01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.200
Charles Dickens: Yeah, I thought that what we were doing was

623
01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.440
Charles Dickens: Every Thursday. Correct. Yeah.

624
01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:02.850
Charles Dickens: Yeah, that's what I

625
01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.140
Charles Dickens: That's what I have

626
01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:10.050
Charles Dickens: So what's today the 27th. So yeah, so yeah, I haven't my calendar every Thursday at nine.

627
01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:11.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, perfect. Good.

628
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So next Thursday at nine o'clock, and we will come together by then I'll have information for Dr. Jamison, you'll have information from you. Your neurologist and we'll kind of go from there. Okay.

629
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:27.780
Charles Dickens: All right. Thank you.

630
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:30.270

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I just put in a request for a refill on your meds and let her know that you are struggling with sleeping too so

677
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that can be something that

678
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:25.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That can be addressed, for sure.

679
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:27.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How the

680
01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:29.520
iPhone: Hardest thing to manage

681
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.590
iPhone: Everything else is everything else has been going like, good, good.

682
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:40.200
iPhone: I'm trying to just like kind of like set little goals for myself. Can I get back on track.

683
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:47.160
iPhone: Like cleaning my room and like the planning it and making sure I clean it every day and kind of just trying to find like

684
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.600
iPhone: As many routines, as I can find right now.

685
01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.840
iPhone: And so, like, stuff like journaling and like

686
01:38:56.370 --> 01:39:04.560
iPhone: Today, and then like myself read again and just going to like try and find what I like, I don't really know what I like.

687
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's like re rediscovering yourself again.

688
01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:14.400
iPhone: Yeah, and it's been kind of interesting kind of anxiety inducing but you know

689
01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.190
iPhone: Trying to figure all that out to

690
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, what do you. What's your job. What are your hours at your job.

691
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:28.410
iPhone: I'm a waitress at a 24 hour restaurant. So I work

692
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:30.870
iPhone: All sorts of just

693
01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:48.990
iPhone: Like all weekend. I'll be working from like 5pm until, like, you know, one 2am sometimes didn't work until like 4AM sometimes I go in at 9am and cut out at 3pm kind of just depends on the day. So that's also plays a part in like why my sleep is so weird. Yeah.

694
01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.340
iPhone: I never know what I'm going to sleep.

695
01:39:51.510 --> 01:40:00.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, then that makes it a little bit harder with getting your physical and your mental back on track to, you know what I mean.

696
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. Most people have routines and they're able to get back in a routine after a few weeks, you know, but when your schedule. So, up and down on all over the place. That makes it a little bit more difficult.

697
01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's still doable.

698
01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's certainly still doable but it just takes a little bit. A little bit more.

699
01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How have you been eating.

700
01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:33.000
iPhone: Not very much at all. I've been traveling a lot was actually like being hungry.

701
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:42.570
iPhone: I have smoked weed. A couple times. I gotta get my appetite going. And that was really helpful. And that's really like the only times I've actually

702
01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:51.900
iPhone: So kind of gone like been going like two, three days without eating anything and then just kind of like snapping a little bit

703
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:55.110
iPhone: Throughout the week you know

704
01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:00.570
iPhone: Yeah but yeah that's been another pretty solid challenge. It's trying to be

705
01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:02.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to manage

706
01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:03.960
iPhone: Yeah.

707
01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's two basic things that need to be

708
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Need to really be

709
01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: honed in on, I think, is what I'm looking for.

710
01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:19.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In order for your body to start healing and getting in.

711
01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:24.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A better routine as far as

712
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting better. You know what I mean like if you if you can't eat or you're struggling with putting nutrients in your body. Your body can't function that well and

713
01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It brings your immune system down and you're more susceptible to getting colds and you know getting sick and it's it's harder to

714
01:41:45.150 --> 01:41:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For mental clarity, it's harder for physical clarity. So even if you're may even if you're eating small little things throughout the day.

715
01:41:53.850 --> 01:42:07.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And really being conscious about eating small little small little healthy things, you know, throughout the day. That's better than not eating at all. What about on water.

716
01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.840
iPhone: Water. I'm really good about actually

717
01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.640
iPhone: Drink like probably like about a gallon a day.

718
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:17.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so that's good.

719
01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:21.510
iPhone: Yeah. One thing I'm going for me water consumption.

720
01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:33.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's good. You just got to keep up on that. But even if you're eating like a little bit of fruits and vegetables throughout the day, just something you know consciously really

721
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:34.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Making yourself. Do it.

722
01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that you don't have an appetite. But putting some fluid or some fuel in your body is better than none.

723
01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:42.900
iPhone: You know, yeah.

724
01:42:43.110 --> 01:42:43.620
iPhone: I hear you.

725
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And whether it be Apples or oranges or you know whatever it look like just munching on things throughout the day.

726
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:55.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Almonds are really, really good to you know that

727
01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:58.260
iPhone: Kind of keep them handy. Yeah.

728
01:42:58.290 --> 01:43:07.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: definitely keep it you know even set a timer on your phone, you know, four, and five times a day to be able to on your waking hours, whatever your waking hours are

729
01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:13.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being able to just, you know, fuel your body a little bit with

730
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With nutrients.

731
01:43:15.090 --> 01:43:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: will definitely help you get through your process and I hear your dog in the background. What kind of dog do you have

732
01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.330
iPhone: The Cockapoo

733
01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:23.880
iPhone: Is the little boy Duke

734
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.330
iPhone: Is an old man.

735
01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:31.440
iPhone: scrappy boy.

736
01:43:35.490 --> 01:43:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was turned on its back and make

737
01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.100
iPhone: That noise.

738
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's an old man knows for sure.

739
01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:43.770
iPhone: Yeah, certainly.

740
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:55.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how other than that. How's everything else going, how has your mind been where's your mind been sitting at and your emotions. How have your emotions been

741
01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.930
iPhone: I've had a couple days where I've been really irritable, for no reason.

742
01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:06.960
iPhone: But to be honest. Like, I feel pretty clear.

743
01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:17.310
iPhone: So like I've been having like, you know, pretty bad anxiety and like anxiety attacks and stuff, but I was expecting that no matter what.

744
01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.800
iPhone: But they haven't been like quite as severe

745
01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:26.850
iPhone: Over the last like week, which I think is pretty cool.

746
01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:34.230
iPhone: But more so like I kind of describe wouldn't try to keep my mind I'm like my routine and

747
01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:41.940
iPhone: Try to make sure I feel myself out of bed because it's been, I just have that's I've had like pretty low energy overall

748
01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.270
iPhone: So I'm just

749
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:48.540
iPhone: Trying to take it like one step at a time and

750
01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.240
iPhone: Pretty much work.

751
01:44:52.110 --> 01:45:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it gets better. You know it does. It gets better. It's just a process and you've just got to again be kind with yourself.

752
01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sure that you're putting fuel in your body. And I don't mean fueled by those energy drinks because I

753
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely don't help with it, but

754
01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm definitely

755
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Knowing that you know that you're going to feel better and better and better. The longer that you're going through this process and just giving yourself that that

756
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay Enos to breathe and rest. Take it easy when you when you don't feel like it but really honing in on that sleep piece is going to be a big issue, you know,

757
01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:44.880
iPhone: Yeah, I think that'll be super helpful. Like right now I slept for like three hours last night and woke up another. Okay, I'm ready to go.

758
01:45:47.130 --> 01:45:59.010
iPhone: And other days, almost like like last Wednesday I slept like 17 hours. I went to sleep at like 5am and like woke up like seven or something like that. It was crazy.

759
01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:03.120
iPhone: And I was kind of wake up my mom tried waking me up my dad tried waking

760
01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:06.210
iPhone: Me up nobody could

761
01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:08.580
iPhone: Get me moving

762
01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. When your body's done your body's done and that's for sure. It says

763
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:14.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've got enough we're sleeping.

764
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:17.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How have things been going with

765
01:46:19.170 --> 01:46:20.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With your recovery.

766
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:24.090
iPhone: As in, like,

767
01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:27.210
iPhone: A craving stuff.

768
01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:29.040
iPhone: Yeah yeah

769
01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's start there.

770
01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:37.350
iPhone: Well yeah, I really had like any severe cravings, to be honest.

771
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:45.330
iPhone: When I kind of get like a little like tidbits of cravings. I kind of just try and distract myself for a little bit, whether it's like watching a YouTube video.

772
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:57.390
iPhone: Or like messing with my dogs and usually by the time that like I think of that thought. Again, it's like so far back in my mind. I've been doing something else that like

773
01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:08.040
iPhone: You know, I haven't even come close to using again, which has been pretty cool, like I haven't been able to get this far as comfortably years

774
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.490
iPhone: Yeah, so I feel like

775
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:14.370
iPhone: I feel pretty confident to me.

776
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:27.030
iPhone: Justin, like, you know, like I made the right choice. And it's kind of just acknowledging that like I kind of need to take everything, day by day, sometimes like second by second and

777
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.450
iPhone: Yeah, give myself more credit

778
01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. You do, you know,

779
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:36.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which one

780
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:46.020
iPhone: Is like an app like it tells you, like all your milestones that you had. And like has like a breakdown of like ours, and seconds and everything. And that's been pretty cool to

781
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:49.860
iPhone: You know, watch. I send my mom a screenshot of it, like every day.

782
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good.

783
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:52.650
iPhone: Yeah.

784
01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:58.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's carry good, you know, knowing that you're, you know, you're willing to walk through these processes just, you know, that's huge.

785
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:10.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, and I'm glad that you're taking it one step at a time. You know, one day at a time and just walking through it you know the best that you possibly can.

786
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:21.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And confident. There's nothing wrong with having confidence you know in yourself to know that this is the path that you're choosing and this is what you want to do for your life. And that's vitally important to, you know,

787
01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're able to do that.

788
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about

789
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:30.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about your environment, as far as old friends hitting you up wanting to

790
01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get you back trying to pull you back into that stuff. How's that been going

791
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:43.500
iPhone: No, my friends actually us at all. So, um, it's been

792
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:51.150
iPhone: I've been more open with my friends about it like that. I was traveling with it. You know, so I'm doing right now.

793
01:48:54.270 --> 01:49:02.130
iPhone: And everyone's been really receptive, but I haven't really had like anybody trying to pull me back into it. It's like that part of my life was like so separate from

794
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.670
iPhone: My life not like it hasn't been

795
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:10.050
iPhone: Hasn't like shown up anywhere like

796
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:18.480
iPhone: Anything like like I'm cleaning my room like just felt good, because that was kind of living in this

797
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:25.890
iPhone: Cycle just going around and, you know, not caring about where I am.

798
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:27.690
iPhone: And

799
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:35.760
iPhone: You know that's been like good from a mental health and also the cravings and everything. It was just like having my nice little space.

800
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:36.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I can

801
01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:39.120
iPhone: Light a candle sit on my floor.

802
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.610
iPhone: Not be sitting on a pile of clothes.

803
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

804
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:57.150
iPhone: I haven't really I don't know if we've ever really encounter too many instances where I'm going to be around people that will make me want to use anything like that but I'm also nervous for like the day is like where I'm like, super anxious

805
01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:11.460
iPhone: That's what I'm going to want to use them. Like I did have, like, my boyfriend and I are you doing during the week and it's got pretty shitty. So that was like one of the biggest craving. I've had so far, I would say.

Yeah.

813
01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:46.620
iPhone: Now that is a, like a bit better with him, but I'm also like to remind myself that like his moves and Stephen nothing to do with me and I focus on myself. Instead of, you know, being caught up in his bullshit.

814
01:50:47.730 --> 01:51:03.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, which is a good. That's a good, that's okay. That's a good place to actually be. You know what I mean is detaching from you know what he's going through with love and realizing that isn't about you. It's about him, you know,

815
01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:05.970
iPhone: I can live with her without him.

816
01:51:07.710 --> 01:51:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just knowing that knowing that either which way you're going to be okay you know that there's nothing in the there's nothing that can happen in this life that you need to go back to us and again for and that feels like a like such a big

817
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: broad statement, but from experience. I know that to be true.

818
01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:33.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, we can go through some of the hardest things and we get to go

819
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Through some of the hardest things in our life when we're sober. But when we're using. It's like it's done to our growth and being able to walk through, you know, hard stuff in our life and it's always waiting for us when we get sober anyways.

820
01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

821
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.910

822
01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.260
iPhone: Going to worse to. Yeah.

823
01:51:50.130 --> 01:51:52.470

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:53.370
iPhone: So, yeah.

825
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:56.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's no fun, you know,

826
01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's good that you're able to identify that. And you know detach a little bit from it.

827
01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:05.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what about

828
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.560

830
01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:24.780

iPhone: My brother and sister and dad are all disabled. So my mom kind of takes care of them all day. So like, pretty much. I just kind of get my ride to work and like

832
01:52:34.230 --> 01:52:41.490
iPhone: You know, I don't really get much time to say, Okay, can I get a ride this point my disappointment. So I've been going to a lot of online appointments basis.

836
01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:10.530

837
01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ability to

838
01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.470

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to engage in

840
01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That kind of support system online because you got to have something. I mean, you gotta learn how to change the way you think you got to learn how to manage

841
01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anxiety and DVD is really, really a good way to help manage

842
01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, if you learn those skills and you learn those tools, then you know what I mean when you're stuck in a really bad anxiety attack you can calm yourself down and you can work on pulling yourself out of it just takes a lot of practice, you know,

843
01:53:45.690 --> 01:53:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But being able being able to do that is huge, you know. So how many, how many times a week do you go well.

844
01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:55.230
iPhone: Every day.

845
01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:56.640

846
01:53:57.150 --> 01:54:09.510
iPhone: Yeah, I joined like there's like one lady in particular that I really liked so she has a chat every single day. And so, get on there and you know like talk with the ladies. And, you know,

847
01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:17.370
iPhone: It's like they're always the two. There's always someone in mind, you know, yeah, which is pretty cool.

848
01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.730
iPhone: Always somebody to talk to you that knows what you're going through.

849
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:22.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

850
01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:30.270
iPhone: Yeah, I've been a little more nervous about going to like meetings in real life, to just because, like, a lot of the plot. I know.

851
01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:36.630
iPhone: Yeah, and like where I work. There's like a lot of people that come in, like, it's like

852
01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.600
iPhone: Their parties and stuff.

853
01:54:40.530 --> 01:54:48.450
iPhone: Like this, like this in a group and our town. So you know I don't want it like run into work or whatever.

854
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:52.350
iPhone: Just makes me nervous. But I'm thinking about going

855
01:54:53.640 --> 01:55:08.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, if you're engaging in in you know group online that's in and nobody at its finest. You know, nobody needs to know that you're, you know, this is your path. This is your course nobody needs to know, you know,

856
01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think that face to face meeting sometimes forget that that that is a foundation of recovery is being able to, you know, work on yourself in a manner that is safe for you without judgment and so

857
01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:32.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Knowing that you're getting that online is is huge, you know,

858
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:43.020
iPhone: Online support has been awesome from like this all the way to like all the groups on Facebook and stuff. I didn't know there was this much like available either

859
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.060
iPhone: Which was pretty cool.

860
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:57.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. I try to encourage everybody to they can't get to it. Then go online, because you'd be amazed at what you find, and tell me some of the things will be that you and I can work on while we're working together.

861
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:10.650
iPhone: I kind of want to work more on my routines and finding more like habits. I can do that would kind of better my day, whether it's like things like

862
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:24.300
iPhone: Some forms of like meditation or like, you know, like workbooks or anything like that. You know what I mean like I like something like that. I kind of, I can incorporate into my day every day. You know what I mean.

863
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:25.200
Yeah.

864
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:36.240
iPhone: And then, and honestly kind of just like like more coping mechanisms can I kind of want to build my toolbox, much as I can during this time and

865
01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:45.390
iPhone: And that's my number one problem is just like learning how to code and you know live again.

866
01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Live

867
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.330
iPhone: And whatever whatever tools. Yeah.

868
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:52.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly. Just

869
01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:53.190
Feel

870
01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:56.520
iPhone: Alive and do it.

871
01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just know that with you, engaging in in your DVD group you're going to gain a lot of a lot of coping skills learning those those skills DVD is, in my opinion, is one of the best

872
01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Therapeutic tools that you can possibly have because it teaches us how to stay present today, you know, keeps us out of the past keeps us out of the present, it helps us learn how to communicate.

873
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:43.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Evaluate situations and detach for detach from things that are going to do us harm. And it helps us become assertive in our communication, get our needs met in a healthy manner.

874
01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It helps us except things radical acceptance is one of my favorite, favorite things, you know, and really being able to identify if your

875
01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:11.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: mindset is in. Are you being willing or are you being willful. Are you stuck in your, your will or are you really doing things in a willingness manner, which is a huge piece of it, to which I absolutely love that concept as well.

876
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:28.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there are all these different tools that you can learn through DPT that really can build your toolbox up to be able to work with your anxiety. Learn how to communicate manners that are healthy for you and that

877
01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Help you deal with your anxiety to help you deal with cravings, they can. I mean, they

878
01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:45.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One of the ones that I that I really like is when you're, you're in the heat of the moment, and you're trying to calm yourself down but nothing's working

879
01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your anxieties crazy and you don't know, you know, your mind is racing and there you're sitting and you don't know what to do but

880
01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They suggest doing things as going in the kitchen and grabbing ice cubes and putting them in your hand and holding them.

881
01:58:57.750 --> 01:59:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because then your focus gets out of your head and all fear, anxiety and into the coldness of your hand, which is what it wants what it's meant to do is to pull you out of that anxiety state and focus on what's going on with the coldness right

882
01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mindfulness is huge.

883
01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:26.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wise mind, you know, is another one. And you know, when you are not sure if you were in the right state of mind to be able to deal with things.

884
01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, are you really responding to situations out of your emotional mind or your logical mind you know there. You've got to kind of be find that center for you in the middle. And so a lot of the tools.

885
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:44.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are going to be really, really beneficial, you know, in that area.

886
01:59:45.930 --> 01:59:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about, do you have a lot of negative thinking that's going on or are you able to curb it

887
01:59:55.350 --> 02:00:00.570
iPhone: I do a lot of negative thinking I've never really been able to

888
02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.510
iPhone: Curb be honest.

889
02:00:04.290 --> 02:00:04.650
iPhone: Okay.

890
02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's something definitely like negative self talk

891
02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's something that we can definitely work on because negative self talk is toxic.

892
02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that really kind of

893
02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can be a downfall. For a lot of people not being able to get out of that negative thought process.

894
02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:42.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you're able to change that negative thought process to to something that becomes more positive and being able to look at things in a different manner. It raises your self worth is self esteem, you know, your belief system search stop, you know, starts changing

895
02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of those things to make us become more healthy

896
02:00:50.370 --> 02:00:50.880
iPhone: I agree.

897
02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.020
iPhone: Like I had to work on. So I would love to work on that as well.

898
02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:57.150
iPhone: Definitely

899
02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:58.140
iPhone: Definitely a more

900
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:59.850
iPhone: Compassionate to myself.

901
02:01:00.930 --> 02:01:07.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because you know what, if you're not compassionate and take care of yourself everything around you suffers.

902
02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:17.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And so being able to do that. It's going to be huge. And so, all right. So there's something else that we can work on throughout this process.

903
02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And and do we have your email.

And it's nothing major. It's just you know us paragraph a day, you know, and to help you kind of change that that mindset.

918
02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then there's just for today. And then there's

919
02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:09.120

920
02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:17.940

921
02:03:19.050 --> 02:03:21.510

922
02:03:23.010 --> 02:03:23.520

02:03:25.290 --> 02:03:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the more

924
02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. I want a bunch of them and try and find what I like, totally, you know, and just explore and see which ones you know work for you and

925
02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:36.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The more positive that we put inside our brain.

926
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The easier it is to turn our negative thoughts into positive, you know,

927
02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:43.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To combat them.

928
02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so we'll work on that that piece as well.

929
02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are some of the other things that you want to work on.

930
02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:57.720
