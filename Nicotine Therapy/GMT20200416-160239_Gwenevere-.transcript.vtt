Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of some chat about artwork and people how they're experiencing this this phenomenon of even more isolation and

71
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take take some time and look inside.

76
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just identify what you want.

77
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.310
Cynthia We: I want to not feel angry at my family right now.

Cynthia We: To hear them. I just want to feel like love, you know, and

84
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:33.000
Cynthia We: One of the things they don't they don't understand that it's impossible to hear when they're standing outside the door talking

85
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.240
Cynthia We: I don't want to feel anger I I'm tired of feeling frustrated and angry.

86
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

87
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.990
Cynthia We: I feel really disrespected

88
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see that.

89
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine what your life would be if they somehow had been traveling to Colorado and they were stuck.

90
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.920
Cynthia We: Date. Oh, no.

91
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.940
Cynthia We: No, it can't.

92
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, try it for a moment and just imagine that there was no one to be irritated with right now that you were stuck in this home all alone.

93
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Just me this therapist in Florida.

94
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it would be so lonely.

95
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.470
Yeah.

96
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How did those two get married, how, how can you

97
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: feel respected and grateful at the same time.

98
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:51.960
Cynthia We: Um,

99
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.510
Cynthia We: If they just went to a different room.

100
00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.100
Cynthia We: Easy.

101
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know what surprised me.

102
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You identify at least I believe you have as someone who has that sort of

103
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been given this label ADHD and I take a stimulant. Is that right,

104
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To address it. It surprises me that

105
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're bothered by this this other sound, but then I think we'll wait. It's not a consistent sound. It's not this sort of trance music that's a predictable sound it catches your interest. And so then your attention goes toward that. So that was happening.

106
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And so then you, you feel maybe you're supposed to be attending here.

107
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if you knew there wasn't a wrong way to do therapy that may be attending out there might be useful in here. What if there was no wrong way.

108
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What if if your attention drifted off and you started to hear them. And you told me I can hear Lola is talking about the deal with Teagan a wonder, would that reduce the irritability or what would happen if if that were to happen in session.

109
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.190
Cynthia We: Um,

110
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.760
Cynthia We: Yeah, I

111
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

112
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:37.290
Cynthia We: I guess I don't know I don't know I just I just asked for an hour all week.

113
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the problem.

114
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy. That's the problem.

115
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not asking for what you need a long way. It's too much pressure right now.

116
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a setup.

117
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All I ask

118
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And even then no one

119
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What is going on during the week over there, Cindy. Why are you not we've played with little ideas of going for a walk. Reading

120
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

121
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what's actually happening.

122
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.910
Cynthia We: What's actually happening right now is that the the

123
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.620
Cynthia We: The writing the freelance writing

124
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:39.000
Cynthia We: Course, it's like a course but she's got like 350 different things on our website. So it's like 200 bucks. And I've wanted to take it for years.

125
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.710
Cynthia We: And the few little things that I have done in her class.

126
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:58.830
Cynthia We: I felt so confident. After doing them that I know that this is like a jumping off point for me. I know that if I take this class I will be making money writing

127
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:16.080
Cynthia We: I know it because I have, I have a history and I have experience. So it's just a matter of having confidence to put myself out there and she teaches you all of that she and her team. I'm so, so it's free right now for a week.

128
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:22.080
Cynthia We: Is she's opened it up and it's free, and I have not been able to sit down one time this week.

129
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.840
Cynthia We: And, um,

130
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.420
Cynthia We: And work on it.

131
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:51.840
Cynthia We: And I don't know if that is because what's really going on because I really do have to help Lola with her work, or I really do have to give them my computer for two hours so they can go to young playwrights or if it's me making excuses because I'm afraid.

132
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.010
Oh,

133
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

134
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

135
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:07.140
Cynthia We: So five days it's five days of free of free content and I wasted three of them.

136
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.130
Cynthia We: And I'm pissed at myself.

137
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.350
Cynthia We: And be touched.

138
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.610
Cynthia We: I still have a chance

139
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:16.140
Cynthia We: To start over.

140
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.580
Cynthia We: Today is a new day.

141
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.450
Cindy.

142
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you really want to get in your life right now. You want to do it differently.

143
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I do not a metaphor, you really, you mean it.

144
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, okay, you can go do it. Now go talk to your family go speak with your daughter and your husband and Tegan and tell them

145
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if some of my irritability with you in your own send your way. Wonder if some of my irritability with you guys. I might be taking out frickin pistons, not the frickin I'm pissed at myself because I'm procrastinating. I'm scared if I finish this course.

146
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to have to face writing. And what if they don't like my writing.

147
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.280

153
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.550

160
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.410
Cynthia We: And I just want to apologize.

161
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.850
Cynthia We: I think he was surprised when

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:29.790
Cynthia We: I said, I just wanted to let you know that some of my frustration that I think I have with with this morning and yesterday is because

163
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:43.440
Cynthia We: I have been procrastinating. The Carrollton workshop, because I know that if I do it that I'm going to have to write and put myself out there and I'm a little nervous about it and word people won't like my writing.

164
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it

165
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.230
Cynthia We: Was just like

166
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.540
Cynthia We: I don't think he had a clue. It was

167
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Waiting, waiting, waiting to do the face again. Oh.

168
00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.660
Yeah.

169
00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but it

170
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't it wasn't

171
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:11.430
Cynthia We: It wasn't negative at all. It was just, just like completely surprised and and like taken yeah he, I don't think it's ever heard me apologize like that before.

172
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What about Lola.

173
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.160
Cynthia We: No, I don't know where she is. She's

174
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside or something. Yeah.

175
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Parker. Okay. Okay. So what now. What was this like for you. We can take each one to see some was already in the midst. This was very impromptu. And so, but still if you had an experience of it. What was this like

176
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.830
Cynthia We: Um,

177
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.650
Cynthia We: It felt a little awkward felt very awkward.

178
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.150
Actually, okay.

179
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.200
Cynthia We: Very different from what I would normally do.

180
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.580
Mm hmm.

181
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of that awkwardness. What do you think of it being very different

182
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.480
Cynthia We: I like the way of

183
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:19.860
Cynthia We: Understanding that I've got shit going on inside and and

184
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.590
Cynthia We: And talking about that.

185
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:33.090
Cynthia We: Because I don't think people usually get to see that I have these feeling like there are reasons for my reactions that and they have to do with me, not them.

186
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.480
Cynthia We: And I don't think people usually get to see that.

187
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:43.980
Cynthia We: So I like that. But then I also don't like talking like that like it's just really uncomfortable. Yeah.

188
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we call that like that. What is that, what do we call

189
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.110
Cynthia We: Oh, um,

190
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.020
Cynthia We: I don't know.

191
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Come up with something. Take your time. Let me give it a labor label.

192
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:11.760
Cynthia We: Like diminutive small and small. I feel like yeah mousy or something.

193
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.350
Oh,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah look at that word.

196
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.410
Cynthia We: I'm not sure I'm

197
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.470
Cynthia We: Like using it right

198
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: See definition.

199
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.870

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Minute minute or mini yeah didn't

203
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Admit diminutive

204
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a girl.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, we have a tool writer to know all those fancy word

206
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. So, oh wow you feel small.

Cynthia We: Yeah, I'm not

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:05.940
Cynthia We: gonna lie.

209
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you were with your feelings. Do you think that might be why

210
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:18.600
Cynthia We: Yeah, with my feelings with people who were interested in hearing them because they were in the middle of

211
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.340
Cynthia We: Trying to fix the telephone.

212
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:32.700
Cynthia We: Yeah, that's totally it because I could talk about my feelings. You know, when feelings are the expected topic of conversation.

213
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.780
Cynthia We: Or with Lola, she's much I'm

214
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.660
Cynthia We: Taking you know he gets very awkward when you start talking about things. Certain things like

215
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Your goal today is to not have the anger towards your family. Have you noticed that you feel less anger towards them now.

216
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, very less. Even though. Yeah.

217
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.860
Cynthia We: Even though the talking right outside the door.

218
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

219
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Team got a surprise reaction Scott was halfway out so he already had a plan in motion. You're the one changing up

220
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You came from nowhere, out of a session. You already said you were going to be busy.

221
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So this was a surprise for him but you felt disrespected

222
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we do with that certainly come at this from a lot of different directions.

223
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that somehow people like Scott because you're sacrificing so much throughout the day that he owes you something.

224
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what's going on.

225
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.020
Cynthia We: I don't know.

226
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.650
Cynthia We: I feel like

227
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:24.960
Cynthia We: With the kids when they're on zoom. I am very careful to not everything they do it out in the living room. I'm very careful to not

228
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:36.720
Cynthia We: Pop up in their screen, you know, like wash my hands are washing my hands in the kitchen sink and then realize, oh, oh. And then I'll go to the other room.

229
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:50.790
Cynthia We: When they gave me a look and I'm Scott. He doesn't do zoom. Usually, but he when he's on the phone like I'll leave him and I won't bother him, so I just I just want the same

230
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:59.070
Cynthia We: The same treatment. It's a thoughtful this and I'm not sure. It's about knowing

231
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.500
Cynthia We: Okay, as it is about

232
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.170
Cynthia We: Just common courtesy.

233
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.710
Cynthia We: Is that that's the right word.

234
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

235
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.400
Cynthia We: Sounds a little bit you that's not what I mean at all. I just mean like that we treat each other the same

236
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.440
Okay.

237
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, if that was a five year old would you expect common courtesy.

238
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: No seven, seven year old.

239
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.310
Cynthia We: On know probably a like nine or 10

240
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Nine or 10 so you can acknowledge that is a developmental thing.

241
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's something learned

242
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Other teenagers that still don't get common courtesy.

243
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:45.900
Cynthia We: Yes.

244
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we gotta teach them right

245
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Are you teaching them.

246
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:07.230
Cynthia We: I am I am I like yes, every time I see an article about 10 things your 10 year old must know how to do I make sure they know all those things.

247
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

248
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing it and shaping of behavior difference. What do you do, let's say yesterday, day before to shape.

249
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Etiquette, what did you do to shape the behavior of your children. Let's just take a peek.

250
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.850
Um,

251
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:48.180
Cynthia We: Well, I think that part of that, like, recognizing that they're on zoom or they're in a class and being careful to not interrupt is modeling that for them.

252
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.160
Cynthia We: Isn't that I mean 14 anyway. Like, I don't know about for Lola.

253
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.820
Cynthia We: She's a little young to just get catch that, but

254
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: She has taken supposed to know whether you were busy versus deliberately didn't open the door and intrude on his face.

255
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:12.090
Cynthia We: Oh, well, he knows that I'm washing my hands and then see. Oh, he's a zoom and

256
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.050
Cynthia We: And see his eyebrows and I turn it off and I go to the other bathroom.

257
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.270
Cynthia We: wash my hands so

258
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, one's a good one. That's actually a good one.

259
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.320
Cynthia We: Well, I

260
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.310
Cynthia We: Like yeah, or that I start to come outside

261
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:33.840
Cynthia We: And then realize that he's zooming and I shut the door and I go out the front door instead

262
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you seen more Teague and has done the same for you. Really search. See if you can see some

263
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.610
Cynthia We: Yeah, he doesn't bother me at all. And I'm in here.

264
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

265
00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:02.160
Cynthia We: But, um, but he does not all see doesn't recognize how loud voices when he is sitting right there.

266
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.570
Cynthia We: So I might share that with them nicely.

267
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.280
Cynthia We: We just went through this like two weeks ago about this feeling

268
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.440
Cynthia We: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I topic. Because Scott kept coming in.

269
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.820
Yeah.

270
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:35.160
Cynthia We: I'm

271
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Here it is again.

272
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.880
Cynthia We: Our friend did

273
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.350
Cynthia We: That art died.

274
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

275
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.800
Cynthia We: He's our friend from high school.

276
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know you guys travel together. I think for a

277
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.760
Cynthia We: Period. We went to New York, we moved to New York together.

278
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.160
Cynthia We: Um, so he's been talking to his friends all week and

279
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.320
Cynthia We: I feel terrible like

280
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.430
Cynthia We: And helpless.

281
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:33.270
Cynthia We: Like, I can't do anything to help his, his wife's all alone. I don't even really know her that well but

282
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:48.480
Cynthia We: I just idea of losing my husband at 50 and watching him die and not being able to save them is overwhelming to me and I can't imagine what she's going through

283
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:52.980
Cynthia We: His brother.

284
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.900
Cynthia We: Is really upset and um

285
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:11.880
Cynthia We: You know worked in an airport at a bar bar. So, so he was at. And I guess he has anxiety. I've known that forever, but

286
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:27.000
Cynthia We: Really, really bad anxiety, like he was really freaked out about going into work and afraid he was going to get sick. And so I'm Joe his brother just said that he had been on the couch for like a month and I'm

287
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.050
Cynthia We: Like not really able to function.

288
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:38.130
Cynthia We: And was having some pain and numbness and his legs, which I guess he had like 10 years ago.

289
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:53.730
Cynthia We: And Angela finally got him up, got in the shower to go to the hospital. He didn't want to go to the hospital because of what's going on and she got him up. You can get in the shower and he got out of the shower and he dropped dead right that

290
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.340
Cynthia We: You have a clot.

291
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.050
Cynthia We: And and

292
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:00.930
Cynthia We: And they couldn't believe it.

293
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.630
Cynthia We: It's really, really, really surprising and I'm

294
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.970
Cynthia We: Worried that I didn't tell art that I loved him enough

295
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.960
Cynthia We: He doesn't know how I feel about him.

296
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.660
Cynthia We: There's gonna be like was always there. He was like,

297
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.060
Cynthia We: Ready to hang out whenever we went back to Michigan and

298
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:41.040
Cynthia We: You kind of grow apart with a family and you don't focus so much on your friends, but he was a good fighter for so many years.

299
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:42.930
Cynthia We: And, um,

300
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.340
Cynthia We: I don't know. I'm just

301
00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.530
Cynthia We: I'm really

302
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.720
Cynthia We: Surprised and sad.

303
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.880
Cynthia We: Is the first friends that I

304
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.700
Cynthia We: That I have that died.

305
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:16.860
Cynthia We: You know, my grandparents died my uncle died. Everybody has been a little bit distant and older so you don't really have to look at

306
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.510
Cynthia We: Oh my god, this has to be

307
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.170
Cynthia We: You know, it can it can remain a little bit far away if if it's older people.

308
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.250
Cynthia We: That makes that doesn't make sense, but

309
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:33.660
Cynthia We: You know,

310
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.210
Cynthia We: It stayed in the distance.

311
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.420
Cynthia We: Now, it feels like it's right up close and

312
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.230
Cynthia We: Threatening and scary and

313
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.510
Cynthia We: It's poor parents

314
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.630
Cynthia We: And then Scott talk to Mark who

315
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.870
Cynthia We: Mark was the best man in a wedding.

316
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:20.550
Cynthia We: Talk to him for a couple hours last night and Mark is getting a divorce. The second divorce his wife works and how to a Troy, the Detroit area.

317
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:31.260
Cynthia We: And they started. He started bringing like should I maybe not. They have a three year old, so maybe be staying here in the House with you. And she's like, Oh, no, it's fine.

318
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:40.140
Cynthia We: And then that night she she called him back and said it's a cluster fuck here. You should go stay with your parents.

319
00:35:45.360 --> 00:36:04.140
Cynthia We: So he went and he stayed with his parents took us three year old and like a week later, he developed cough that a fever and then three or four days later, his mom got it. And his dad and his mom and dad both got tested and they have

320
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:19.470
Cynthia We: And He probably does too. But he hasn't it hasn't been bad enough where he's had to go to the hospital. Um, so, the three of them do. And the person who's working in the hospital.

321
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.510
Cynthia We: Who should probably get tested. I guess the hospital won't tester.

322
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:37.020
Cynthia We: And won't test anybody unless they have a fever and very specific symptoms and she doesn't have any yet. It's pretty obvious to me where it came from.

323
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:38.820
Cynthia We: His

324
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:57.090
Cynthia We: His mom and dad or my parents age as moms having some mental things like she swears she's losing her mind, which I know is one of the symptoms that they've discovered that it can have some neurological symptoms and it's cause some strokes.

325
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:08.970
Cynthia We: They are not sure if tax the brain, but it might. So anyway, so that's going on. And now I'm free. Mark, it's gonna something terrible is going to happen to him and his family.

326
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:10.920
Cynthia We: And I'm

327
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.290
Cynthia We: I think that would be that would be too much for Scott

328
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.410
Cynthia We: And I don't think

329
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.200
Cynthia We: It's really pretty broken up about art.

330
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.640
Cynthia We: And broken up about art but Mark was never really, you know, I was never close with Mark So art was my friend.

331
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.860
Cynthia We: But still, I've, you know, I don't want to watch my husband go through any

332
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.790
Cynthia We: more pain than era already is going through

333
00:37:54.870 --> 00:38:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What about for you and you hear what happened with the friend and nurse and it's really chaotic here, go go somewhere else what what what's going on for you around that story that one.

334
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:24.480
Cynthia We: What the fuck was she thinking sending him to his mom and dad's house. Like, is it really possible that people in New Mexico are smarter than the people in Michigan, because we wouldn't have done that we would have

335
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:34.830
Cynthia We: And I don't know why I don't know why I know that that's a terrible idea. Is it like did I learned that from our governor or just from reading the newspaper.

336
00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wait. So what do you mean we, I can tell you right now, you have several neighbors.

337
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And that you probably would not join would want not have anything to do with a collective we decision making. How come you lump, a whole state, together with what this one woman did I

338
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that.

339
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.960
Um,

340
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:09.480
Cynthia We: Well, we, I guess we meaning me and Scott wouldn't like it. Like, why, why do we have facts that somebody who works at a hospital doesn't have

341
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, why don't we have a knowledge that somebody

342
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no.

343
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: No, and that one.

344
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that defied logic and facts all day every day.

345
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Has nothing to do with facts.

346
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.110
Cynthia We: Now,

347
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:39.540
Cynthia We: People who work in hospitals that have a degree nurse or whatever it is.

348
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.500
Cynthia We: They should be doing more in facts than I do.

349
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We just found it.

350
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You just found a shirt, how that worked out for you.

351
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.050
Cynthia We: Well now, his whole family sick so it didn't work out very well.

352
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.880
Cynthia We: He should have spoken to me, I would have told him that that's a terrible idea.

353
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe she would have done any number of things. There's a piece that's missing from all of this, the, the acceptance part is missing from

354
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

355
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're missing.

356
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.030
You're missing.

357
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you're going to a should

358
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A how far back.

359
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:27.630
Cynthia We: It was common sense to me it seems like such common sense and I'm

360
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: She just there's chaos going on you and I don't know what she's talking

361
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: About. Yeah, that's an emotional conversation.

362
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:36.540
Yeah.

363
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Are not only states away from. I have no idea what this random person is going through, but I'm going to tell you right now, when someone is going through an emotional experience.

364
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.470
Cynthia We: Right, they're not working.

365
00:40:53.310 --> 00:41:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I am so sorry, is that it's close to you are right close and now this other stories, right there. And then what about your own family, and look how close this is happening to us.

366
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to rely on should

367
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:23.190
Cynthia We: I rely on people having common sense. But I forget the people even I lose my common sense. What I'm emotional. Yeah.

368
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All the facts in the world. You don't have access to them. You are hijacked doesn't matter how high. My IQ is

369
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The limbic system will get you it

370
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter how smart you

371
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Know amount of education. It doesn't discriminate

372
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:49.830
Cynthia We: Well that makes a lot more sense. I could forgive her. Then I'll quit calling her dumb ass.

373
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We can call her a dumb ass. I mean,

374
00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not the end of the story. It's what do you want to do in your home. Where are you, where are you putting action into your highest thought are you compromising your own standards are you going to be the dumb ass of your story. I know I want to hear that. But are you compromising

375
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

376
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

377
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:16.770
Cynthia We: And we

378
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.800
Cynthia We: We have been

379
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:29.220
Cynthia We: Only going out for really important things and wearing masks and wearing gloves and

380
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:39.420
Cynthia We: I feel like we've been locked down for so long. And I'm worried about opening up and letting up

381
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:41.280
Cynthia We: I'm worried about it.

382
00:42:43.320 --> 00:43:01.230
Cynthia We: And I'm I feel like look for me, it's more about taking care of my mental health and making sure I I get out and walk and do some little exercises at home. It's about like committing to that and staying healthy mentally. Okay.

383
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing it.

384
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:09.090
Cynthia We: And I am on occasion. Yes, I have been walking every day.

385
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.920
Cynthia We: I don't think I've skipped any days.

386
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicely for

387
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.280
Cynthia We: Us. Yeah, okay.

388
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.010
Cynthia We: And I'm and I'm doing some

389
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:27.600
Cynthia We: High intensity. I forgot what the second I stands for, but so that kind of walking, where he goes, Oh, we're regular for two minutes and then really fast.

390
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.820
Cynthia We: For 45 seconds and then

391
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.260
Regular

392
00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: aerobic and anaerobic

393
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.410
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

394
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

395
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:41.400
Cynthia We: It's H I T, and I'm not sure what it stands for. And I'm and

396
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.370
Cynthia We: I was going to join a streaming thing.

397
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:56.760
Cynthia We: But I have not done that I've just I found a book that I have that has some just little exercises in it sit ups and

398
00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:01.290
Cynthia We: shit like that, you know, just wait a little bit of weight.

399
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:11.310
Cynthia We: So I'm doing that until I i know it's actually which when I want to get which streaming thing i want to get

400
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.350
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah, yeah.

401
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.900
Cynthia We: Well, I was, I was going to get p Vol. But then I found another one called the sculpt society, which I think

402
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:24.810
Cynthia We: I might like better.

403
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:33.390
Cynthia We: People by actually downloaded onto my phone and I never did the two weeks, the free two weeks.

404
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:45.390
Cynthia We: Like they give you two weeks free so you could try it out and then they build it and i i never touched it during the two weeks that I had so

405
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.320
Cynthia We: I still had the gym know at that point. So,

406
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.930
Cynthia We: It's a different situation.

407
00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to share a video with you, but I want to get. I want to ask you about whether you want to watch it or not.

408
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So a client brought this video to my attention, but

409
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It could end up provoking and emotion.

410
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know because you have a lift just now. Like you're kind of like book kind of talking like cash you know i mean you're not deep in an emotion right now.

411
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

412
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.860
Cynthia We: Maybe I don't watch it. It's like

413
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Dark. Yeah. So let me tell you what it is. So this was given to me by someone who identifies is very creative.

414
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a poem, but recited like as if more like a sort of speaking rap poetry.

415
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.470
Cynthia We: And word yeah like that.

416
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then it's video, but it could emotionally provoking is very relevant to our current global crisis, it is, you know, maybe it's one minute 30 seconds.

417
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to pass it along. If you like it, I'm hoping. What it does is offer, you're not in this alone in the fact that it's so the wording is beautifully done the way she says it or intonation. I'm hoping that it sparks that creative side, it's not intended to to say

418
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything other than that.

419
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To see if

420
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I go to meet that creative

421
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm assuming as far as rescheduling we're okay for next Thursday. Same time

422
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.710
Cynthia We: It's a text message from somebody

423
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go.

424
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Devil historical moment. We just went stumbling

425
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Dancing in the rumbling talk. So come a little closer. Give me some things

426
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be your beautiful crumbling

427
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: working every day that is given much freedom, like the person people meet really isn't within a bottle underneath the truck, like any minute now struggles kind of finish.

428
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we smile.

429
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Even when we cannot break in our staff weeping on the train station, because I can see your face.

430
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There was so much peace to be found in people's face.

431
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I love people's faces.

432
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:22.980
I hadn't

433
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Read before

434
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of got me again.

435
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd only seen it on a little street.

436
00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And seen it up here so big.

437
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.470
Cynthia We: Oh, I love that.

438
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.380
Cynthia We: You said that to me, please.

439
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.460
You bet.

440
00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you want to pull it out. All I do just now if you want to I can certainly send it, but it's also YouTube going to, we're never lost if you just keep that in, you'll see that we're never lost if we can find each other.

441
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We apostrophe.

442
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: RT.

443
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We are never lost if we can find each other.

444
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, I can do that. Um, so

445
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: As we come to the end of the session after that and all the other things we did today, what, what do you notice about where we started and where we are now.

446
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.270
Cynthia We: I really really really liked that. That was great.

447
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.240
Cynthia We: Um,

448
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.370
Cynthia We: I feel more peaceful than I did when we first started I was anxious

449
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.370
Cynthia We: An angry little angry.

450
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there something specific that you did to make it possible to make that shift.

451
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.350
Cynthia We: I listen to you.

452
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.070
Cynthia We: Sure.

453
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: About walking out and doing that experiment.

454
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.770
Cynthia We: Yeah, making myself vulnerable.

455
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:42.780
Yeah.

456
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you like about this video.

457
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:50.820
Cynthia We: That it reminded me that we're all in this

458
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.560
Cynthia We: That everybody's feeling lucky and weird and scared.

459
00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:56.850
And vulnerable.

460
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, we are any it can

461
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Either

462
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: shut us down.

463
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You can either shut us down and pull us apart or we can decide to get closer.

464
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And like it or not work. That's the burden and how will you meet it. Will you decide

465
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to act on fear, or will you go out and be vulnerable with people and be in gratitude and call that wife color anyway.

466
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: not mattering what her responses, but just to do it because you don't know. And hey, I'm going to call you again. I love you and I know we don't know each other very well, but

467
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

468
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm deeply affected.

469
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: deeply affected.

470
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't inhibit those natural

471
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Instincts to connect. Not now.

472
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We need each other so much

473
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It feeds itself. It'll feed your soul. It'll feed hers, and it just gets passed along to the next person into the next person.

474
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Into your family, the same thing, getting them a hug and I'm saying I love you for no good reason and

475
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: being vulnerable with them.

476
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.690
Cynthia We: I wrote a story after one of our sessions. I'm

477
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:43.650
Cynthia We: Like maybe a couple months ago and I shared it with my writing group this past week, and they just loved it like

478
00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.950
Cynthia We: Wow. They're like, this is your last chapter, right here.

479
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

480
00:52:48.150 --> 00:53:01.500
Cynthia We: So I'll send it to you. I don't know that I necessarily believe it's my last chapter, because it's because Helga hasn't weighed in yet. First of all, but I didn't have any intention of it even touching that book.

481
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.530
Cynthia We: But I'll send it to you anyway because

482
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.360
Cynthia We: I think it's relevant. So

483
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:07.140
Okay.

484
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because right um you had started that texting conversation, an interest to connect with Ray, they didn't have if you wanted to know more about that, where it landed.

485
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.220
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, what's he doing

486
00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:24.270
Cynthia We: Um,

487
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't say that that's

488
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's history to tell, but what you wanted was for me to relate your interest.

489
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.610
Cynthia We: To connect. Yes.

490
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I did pass it along.

491
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I passed them on your interest. So is it safe to say it has he hasn't gotten back there hasn't been a connection to you.

492
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:45.390
Cynthia We: Know he hasn't

493
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.080
Okay.

494
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:47.820
Cynthia We: And I figured

495
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.400
Cynthia We: Oh, you know, that's fine.

496
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You make them you may decide in group to ask him.

497
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Directly, you know, you may decide you may not to that will be up to you.

498
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But just that part of you had said passes so

499
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

500
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't pass along

501
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:05.490
Cynthia We: Thank you.

502
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think if you do decide to ask a direct question. I think it will end up being really useful in you coming up with

503
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A story versus the one you may have made up.

504
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:25.770
Cynthia We: Oh, that's funny, because you know I made up a whole story.

505
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we all

506
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.570
Cynthia We: We all, I actually had forgotten about it.

507
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:41.670
Cynthia We: And then, um, and I just kind of, I started to go with a story and I stopped myself from coming up with a story and said, Dude, you don't need to go there Sunday. Stop it.

508
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I will see you in group.

509
00:54:49.200 --> 00:55:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely. I've got you booked for this 23rd of April 23 and I think, let me see where I have you written in I don't know when you're is yours on the 20th or 27th. When are you planning on coming in.

510
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:03.300
Cynthia We: I came in on the sixth

511
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.810
Cynthia We: So I'll come in when I'll come in on the 27th.

512
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:08.820
Cynthia We: Or the fourth

513
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.760
Cynthia We: 27th is fine.

514
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. I look forward to seeing you then and

515
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.160

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:20.580
Cynthia We: See, before that. Right. Yes.

517
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard thing to say. I'll see you in group then

518
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:24.480
Right.

519
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:26.490
