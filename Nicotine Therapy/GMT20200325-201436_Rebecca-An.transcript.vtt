54
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.990
iPhone: I had an appointment with you guys. I

55
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:38.670
iPhone: Was between insurances and I got my farm see from the pharmacy that I've been using for like my whole life, which is CBS in my town and i and i paid out cash for that one.

56
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:56.910
iPhone: Because I was in between insurances and then immediately after that all the, the other two that I've picked up are from I picked them up from Kaiser pharmacy and they were covered, but the price was $15 which is my insurance copay

57
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.260
iPhone: Yeah, so

58
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.370

iPhone: I'm so sorry she sent it to CBS, which was the problem I needed it to be sent to Kaiser

62
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:24.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you called in to give him the information and then you went to pick it up, you don't recognize that doctor's name from somebody you've seen in the past at all.

63
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.520
iPhone: No.

64
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right. I'm just trying to get some clarity so that way we can get it all straightened out, you know, and I

65
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you

66
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:43.560
iPhone: Know I i do know what you mean. And I totally understand. You know what, I totally understand. Yeah, like, you know,

67
00:06:44.160 --> 00:07:01.800
iPhone: I'm totally willing to find that out to the tone that, you know, Danielle was taking with me was that I was just being a one, a big waste of time into as if I'm trying to abuse the system, somehow, and I was just telling her, like, okay, like I'm

68
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:13.890
iPhone: I'm sorry, she's like I'm at patients at my door and your, your have meds and I was like, I'm just trying to be on top of my care and I don't. Yeah.

69
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, well, don't take your personal

70
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try not to

71
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:28.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, again, because you know she is very overwhelmed and it probably confused her because of the name, you know,

72
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You did you get that

73
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you get that prescription on the 13th.

74
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.170
iPhone: Yeah, the one that is written, I

75
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.600

76
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right.

77
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so

78
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:53.490
iPhone: The reason why I asked for a refill and in our last appointment was because I'm going to be out by

79
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:08.850
iPhone: I think it's Friday or that weekend and, you know, I'm just trying to stay on top of it. I didn't want to have to be like putting in my prescription when it's like a one dose left you know

80
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.080
iPhone: But I guess.

81
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.910
iPhone: That's what I'm supposed to do.

82
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, only because you know and i think you know this, but I'm not program is, you know, the therapy on top of the prescription and you engage. You're always up front. I want you to, I want to identify this for you too.

83
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that you're always in group you're always up front. You know you do. What's asked of you. So don't think for one second that

84
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:47.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, we believe in any way, shape, or form missing that you're doing something that you shouldn't or that it shady or that you know that you're not, I can understand Danielle is confusion and concern.

85
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.470
iPhone: I didn't know you know

86
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.040
It's

87
00:08:51.600 --> 00:09:06.690
iPhone: Pretty like harsh, but I understand it's a crazy time right now there's so much stuff. And you know, that's why it's fine, whatever. I'm just gonna let it go. But, I mean, I had to say something. It was just, it really like rubbed me the wrong way. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

88
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's especially when you're doing the right thing and you're

89
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:18.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, complying and you're trying to stay on top of your care. I get it. Yeah, definitely. How are you doing with all of this.

90
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.350
iPhone: Stress wise yeah I'm I'm doing okay. Um, I mean, cuz I

91
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:37.740
iPhone: Was able to pick up my clonazepam from CVS because. Fortunately, it wasn't a ridiculous price, like the buprenorphine is

92
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.180
iPhone: And so I paid up front. From that for that from CVS and so

93
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:50.910
iPhone: I, you know, so I've taken my anxiety meds, but, um, I mean like right now. You've been like, you know, I'm, I'm feeling some anxiety, like, you know,

94
00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:01.530
iPhone: I mean, you could probably hear in my voice. I mean, I'm, I'm a little high strung but I mean I'm, I'm okay. I'm handling it. I just need to like

95
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.170
iPhone: Relax and do my thing.

96
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.800

101
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:37.380
iPhone: I'm going to be kicked out of this program right now and I really love being in this program that works for me perfectly. I like seeing all of you guys and I just think it's a great program. And I'm I am really scared that I'm going to get kicked out now because my insurance.

102
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, let's just let's play it by ear and see what's going to happen. Okay, let me be excuse me do some research for it. And remember that Mary used to work for Kaiser

103
00:10:49.290 --> 00:11:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that she's working with other clients with Kaiser so you know let's you know don't sit yourself into fear and stay there. Let me talk to Mary. Let me talk to Daniella and Helena, and let's get this figured out. Okay.

104
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because we enjoy you in group to Mason and if we if there is any possible way.

105
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That we can work with Kaiser and Kaiser is willing to work with us and we can keep you, we want to keep you engaged with us. Okay.

106
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

107
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just know that. All right. And just know that we're going to do. I'm working with Mary, what we can to make it your, your treatment to continue. So I don't want you to stress out and I don't want you to be in fear. All right.

108
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:47.880
iPhone: Okay, I will try my best to and thank you and thank you for those words and I yes I I will try my hardest to stay with it and

110
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.750
Yeah, and

111
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's just figure it out. All right.

112
00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's just do let me do some footwork with Mary and see what we can do. And we'll just kind of go from there. And if it turns out that Kaiser says no, which I honestly don't see how they would say no, especially right now.

113
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.550
iPhone: Yeah.

114
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.790

115
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.850
iPhone: Yeah, Mary's work with them and so far that they have filled prescriptions for me and God is

116
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.720
iPhone: Under my insurance and you know it's been okay before so

117
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:32.070
iPhone: Yeah, I don't understand why it would be seems like that would be a process of just being like, like, kind of like a useless process of, like, you know, getting rid of somebody care.

118
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's not not in your best interest. So

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

120
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:38.910

123
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:17.670
iPhone: Their Therapy System is like you see your therapist once every two months, and she got me approved to go outside of Kaiser care for my therapy. I have like

124
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:27.000
iPhone: A I have, you know, the papers and everything that I'm actually allowed to go outside my Karen Kaiser will cover it like the tweet and certain boundaries.

125
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So one

126
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.240

127
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.280
Good.

128
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.230
