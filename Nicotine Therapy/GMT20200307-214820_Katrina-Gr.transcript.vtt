Timothy Howard: Right after I lost my job. Yep.

40
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.700
Katrina Groves: Didn't you lose your job because of your relapse. I didn't realize that it was the other way around.

41
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:24.900
Timothy Howard: Oh no you're right. I started relaxing at the job and then I shortly lost it, like right after you know

42
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:34.350
Timothy Howard: And then I continued my relapse for. Well, I don't think it's three laps at that point. I think it's going back into my addiction for a minute.

43
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:43.470
Timothy Howard: And then I got out pretty quickly. Thank God you know didn't last four years, or, you know, so I've been clean

44
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:52.920
Timothy Howard: Mean Tony signed the contract, stating that I would not use. Did you hear about it. No. No. Okay. It states that I will not use

45
00:08:53.670 --> 00:09:05.340
Timothy Howard: For the time being, while I'm in the program and in bright or I will not use pencils or any other substance, otherwise I would dismiss myself from the program and I've been clean ever since.

46
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.010
Katrina Groves: So, and when did that contract get signed

47
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.570
Timothy Howard: About a month ago.

48
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.490
Timothy Howard: And so I've been clean for over there should be longer than that.

49
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:21.390
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I've been noticing your labs on from the computer from your drug screens have been better.

50
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.440
Yeah.

51
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.500
Katrina Groves: I'm trying to remember when the last using date was

52
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.490
I don't know.

53
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.740
Timothy Howard: It's been a little while. I haven't been this time, I haven't really been keeping track. You know, I've just been taking it a day at a time and

54
00:09:42.270 --> 00:10:01.740
Timothy Howard: Yeah, it's been a lot better that way I know the contract, you know, really like as a lot of accountability over my head and I'm doing better. You know, I'm taking it slow. I'm looking for other housing right now and I'm looking for work in town, but I'm holding off for the lumber mill until

55
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.190
Timothy Howard: I am more setup in town, you know, and then I'll go back to work, probably for lumber mill.

56
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:18.120
Katrina Groves: Okay, sounds like a plan. So do you have any allergies to any medication.

57
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:27.870
Katrina Groves: No, no allergies and medication that you're on right now. But Suboxone you're doing three strips a day. Right.

58
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.100
Katrina Groves: Yeah. And are you still taking Gabba Penton Tim

59
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.800
Katrina Groves: Yes, and is it 600 milligrams for a day or is it different.

60
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.480
Timothy Howard: You know, as for day

61
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:47.370
Katrina Groves: And the Wellbutrin. Are you back on that thing on that. Yep 300 milligrams

62
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.050
Timothy Howard: Yep.

63
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.100
Timothy Howard: Once only

64
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.330
Timothy Howard: Once a day is

65
00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:03.210
Timothy Howard: That seems to be working. Everything you know I'm I've been, I guess, I guess I've been depressed a lot more lately, you know, just

66
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:10.260
Timothy Howard: From now. And, you know, fill in everything out like audition and done what I did. You know, I should ask for help when

67
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:17.850
Timothy Howard: Because I had a friend the lumber mill that asked me if I was okay, you know, Mike. He was in the auction house with me and it kind of took it like

68
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:27.720
Timothy Howard: Yeah, why wouldn't I be but really I wasn't okay, you know, that was the starting of it. You know, I was really like messed up inside and I was trying to hide it and

69
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.730
Timothy Howard: lead lead to relapse. Yeah.

70
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.850
Katrina Groves: I mean, that's what our minds do is like hiding things and isolating it and

71
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:53.730
Katrina Groves: The good thing about it is that now you know your mind and when this if this ever happens again as far as the behavior, you're going to catch it and go, oh, I don't want to go down this road.

72
00:11:54.270 --> 00:12:03.060
Timothy Howard: Yeah, I don't know, it's, it's scary. You know, because, because what my addiction does you know as it goes to the max of where I just want to die, you know,

73
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:14.640
Timothy Howard: I don't, I really don't want to die i want to i i love my life, you know, and I really want to see myself continue on this road that I'm on, now you know I'm gained a lot of way.

Katrina Groves: That's hard. It'll take time to to work your way down.

80
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.670
Timothy Howard: Yeah. Yeah. Whoa.

81
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.180
Katrina Groves: But the most important thing is just to stay clean for now.

Timothy Howard: Yeah, stay clean and I mean as soon as they go back to work off the now you know yeah yeah so

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.870
Katrina Groves: Yeah, applies to you or not.

100
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:20.040
Timothy Howard: It does, because I have racing thoughts. I don't know when to slow down, you know, and like I find myself trying to control it and I can you know so

101
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.110
Timothy Howard: You, you, you, you said it might be slight slightly, but I mean, I don't know, I just

102
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:36.420
Timothy Howard: Think this is me, you know, maybe had to do it. My past may, you know, I don't know. I know how I feel. But I know how I think and

103
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:49.260
Timothy Howard: It's a, it's a lot of work, you know, feels like a over exert myself and no matter what I do. I over exert myself to like if it comes to work or what, no matter what I'm doing. I over exert myself and I mean

104
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.190
Timothy Howard: It could be a good thing and it could be a really, really bad thing, you know.

105
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.760
Katrina Groves: It's like you don't have a middle speed, it's like all or nothing.

106
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.130
Timothy Howard: Yes, yes it is.

107
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.420
Katrina Groves: With. Um, it's, it's, I'm shit or I'm perfection.

108
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.410
Right.

109
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.860
Katrina Groves: And it's like, I don't work at all. I'm lazy or I I kill myself at my job.

110
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:35.040
Timothy Howard: Yes. Yeah, but you know, I'm trying to be different with that, you know, I'm trying to take things slowly and I know I have to. I was doing. I have an appointment with George for counseling. He thinks, because I had a really bad car accident on in January 7 rumors.

111
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.450
Timothy Howard: That yeah

112
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:45.720
Timothy Howard: And I was talking to him about it and he said he thinks some kind of trauma could have happened with that as well. So he said he really wants to talk to me because how I found it was like

113
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.500
Timothy Howard: I'm letting it affect me too as well so

114
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.300
Timothy Howard: I don't know.

115
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.070
Katrina Groves: Yeah, now you do know.

116
00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:01.890
Katrina Groves: I have to catch you. Every time you say that because people in recovery. You say that all the time like

117
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:09.000
Katrina Groves: They say whatever done it. I did a really good insight and then they say, oh, I don't know, like you just dissed your whole self.

118
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.840
Timothy Howard: Yeah.

119
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:16.500
Katrina Groves: Which is not true. What you said is all that's true. So you gotta catch yourself when you say I don't know cuz you do not

120
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:22.800
Timothy Howard: Yeah, it's just, it's just with the car accident. I don't see how I mean I don't

121
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:32.580
Timothy Howard: See how it's affecting me that bad, though, you know, like, I mean, I still feel like I want to draw. I still feel like I want a vehicle, you know, good.

122
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:43.920
Timothy Howard: But I guess they, how are you saying like we I almost could have died, I need to leave it at that. I didn't die, you know, and I didn't kill someone else, you know, so it's just a scary thing.

123
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.510
Katrina Groves: And I think it goes back to what we call it ace.

124
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.750
Katrina Groves: Adverse Childhood events.

125
00:16:52.920 --> 00:17:04.770
Katrina Groves: You have some PTSD because of your neglect of your parents have their drug abuse in front of you of the violence that you saw as a kid and all that.

126
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:17.340
Katrina Groves: Is causes post traumatic stress and it gets triggered by things like car accidents. So, so, stuff like that. If you don't deal with it, then it can fester. You know,

127
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.260
Timothy Howard: Inside. Okay.

128
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.210
Katrina Groves: So I would think that would be good for you to any, any kind of counseling, you can get. Go for it.

129
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:25.530
Timothy Howard: I will

130
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:33.180
Katrina Groves: So now I'm kind of switch gears to kind of talking about your family.

131
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.260
Katrina Groves: Family history, your mother is

132
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.300
Katrina Groves: Know your

133
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:46.410
Timothy Howard: Yeah deceased. She's gone. She was an addict as well alcoholic. She died from cirrhosis.

134
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:56.400
Timothy Howard: I couldn't be there. I was locked up around the time she passed away. So some other things, you know, that's still bugging me till today but I talked about that, you know,

135
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.770
Katrina Groves: And your father.

136
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.420
Timothy Howard: He's still an active addiction.

137
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:11.520
Timothy Howard: He has also use my whole life and has been incarcerated, my whole life. You know, in and out of prison, you know,

138
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:26.640
Timothy Howard: He still tries to come around every so often, but I I try not to keep it for too long. You know, it's just like a high love you and by type thing, because he's someone I've used with. And so it's not a good ratio so

139
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.980
Timothy Howard: He's getting mad at me again because of what I'm doing but it's, it's something I know I have to do.

153
00:19:49.950 --> 00:20:04.260
Katrina Groves: So spinal bifida is just a mild congenital condition like say you're born with a mobile somewhere. It's, it's just an area in your backbone that doesn't completely fuse it doesn't necessarily hurt.

154
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.970
Katrina Groves: But you know you're prone to be getting back pain like the rest of us are more so when you're working so hard.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:10.500
Katrina Groves: You might not know the whole history. If you're paying a lot and you've gained weight and you're hungry, a lot. I mean, it could be just depression and all that, but you want to get checked for diabetes there.

176
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.780

Katrina Groves: Know, and for your ears. Any trouble hearing or pain or drainage.

181
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.940
Timothy Howard: I'm hearing. I noticed my hearing is like

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.650
Timothy Howard: As close as they really bad so

196
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.490
Timothy Howard: What's your

197
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.540
Katrina Groves: Plan for that.

198
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.760
Timothy Howard: I have to know that I have a medical again I want to

199
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.870
Timothy Howard: We're thinking about going to a maybe a dentist down in Humboldt County area since it's so forth here.

200
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:46.800
Timothy Howard: Okay, but right now. Yeah. But right now I haven't had like any more abscess or anything going on in my teeth so

201
00:23:47.220 --> 00:24:00.450
Timothy Howard: If it does happen again. Then I'm gonna go in early in the morning and be seen like I have before or, you know, I had work done on these by doing that when when he referred me last time they ended up doing surgery on on the side of my mouth so

202
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:06.420
Katrina Groves: There's a dentist in town and her name, I believe, is dr are she, she's married to the

203
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:16.140
Katrina Groves: Somebody in politics. I can't remember his name right now. She used to work at the donor community health center when it was on a street and she does do

204
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:27.690
Katrina Groves: Trying to think she's she takes clients from the clinic. If you tell her you know Dr. Gross referred me. She might see you

205
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.110
Katrina Groves: But

206
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:46.800
Katrina Groves: Remember that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure latrines now's the time to go get an appointment and get seen while your teeth are not inflamed because then you're established and then they can start working on

207
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.210
Timothy Howard: fixing them up. Don't

208
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.920
Katrina Groves: Wait till you get an infection.

209
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:57.030
Timothy Howard: Okay, so I can do that right away. I mean, it's not like I'm not really much going on. I mean, I gotta, you

210
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.420
Katrina Groves: Gotta just

211
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:03.330
Timothy Howard: Yeah. We just got our head and stuff. So we are we are looking for in house. So, I mean, we're trying to make

212
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.180
Timothy Howard: That we are trying to move back the Crescent City.

213
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.610
Katrina Groves: I think town would be better for you as far as what transportation and just

214
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.050
Timothy Howard: Translate.

215
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:23.820
Timothy Howard: Transportation going to group Malaya school all of it all the way around and plant. All of it is too far, all the way up here. We can't do anything, you know,

216
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.860
Katrina Groves: You can do that when you're retired and, you know, hanging out by the river. When you're 90 okay but I

217
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.270
Katrina Groves: Need to be in town.

218
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.920
Timothy Howard: I know I do.

219
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:40.560
Katrina Groves: Alright, so going back to ear, nose and throat. We got stuck on teeth. Any trouble was swallowing your food or choking on food.

220
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.600
Timothy Howard: No. Okay.

221
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:49.530
Katrina Groves: I'm getting into your neck. Do you have any lumps in your neck like you know how you swell up when you get infections.

222
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.240
Katrina Groves: No, no good. Do you have pain or stiffness in your neck.

223
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.500
Timothy Howard: No, not in my neck, just in my lower back.

224
00:25:59.010 --> 00:25:59.400
Okay.

225
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.840
Katrina Groves: trouble breathing with your coffee wheezing.

226
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.630
Katrina Groves: Shortness of breath.

227
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:07.470
Timothy Howard: No.

228
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.840
Timothy Howard: No asthma. No.

229
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:16.380
Katrina Groves: I'm down to your heart, do you have chest pain, palpitations chest pressure

230
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:24.060
Timothy Howard: Know, every once in a while, I might have like a palpitation here and there, you know, but I have any regular RV.

231
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:40.620
Timothy Howard: That could come with caffeine to consumption, because I can't. I mean, I know I can. I just don't want to. Okay. When is that is that caffeine or the energy drinks. I've only shutting down one energy drink the day though so good.

232
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.500
Katrina Groves: So the energy drink have sugar in it as well.

233
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.300
Timothy Howard: Yes, absolutely. And I guess I

234
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:45.480
Mean

235
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:57.810
Katrina Groves: You'd almost be better off just drinking black coffee or coffee with a sweetener in it. That's not an artificial sweetener, because that way you can still get your one energy without

236
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:04.890
Katrina Groves: The weight gain and the sugar in the diabetes and all that. So that's the first step is for people to kind of switch to

237
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:13.170
Katrina Groves: Not to decaf but just take get the sugar out because one of those lattes and mochas is like your whole days calories right there.

238
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:21.960
Timothy Howard: Yeah, I know. Yeah. And I've gained. It's going great. It's almost like a pound a day. I swear like God quit eating you fatty

239
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:37.080
Katrina Groves: I know, but that's what you're, you don't have your drug right now. So your, your body's craving something right you and Tony talked about this. It's like you crave sugar you crave sex mean, it'd be better to have sex all day long, rather than eating sugar.

240
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.030
Timothy Howard: Yeah.

241
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:50.070
Timothy Howard: I want to eat sugar and when he food. It's like, oh, I see. So good. And then like being born on top of it, you know, and not working as a lot to do with that too. So that's true. Yeah.

242
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:56.370
Katrina Groves: Okay, so, um, heart. Oh, so you don't have any swelling of your legs, though, they're not puffing up

243
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.900
Timothy Howard: No, not popping up.

244
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.720
Katrina Groves: And you don't get do you get short of breath when you're trying to walk because you're out of shape or do you feel like you're short of breath.

245
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:13.260
Timothy Howard: No, just like when I run i mean i i guess everyone does. But I've noticed I could run far distance. But now, like I had to run from

246
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:25.830
Timothy Howard: The bus stop to Walmart and I was so out of breath. It's like I had heard and render and get back in time for the bus, you know, and I would die. And I was like, wait, and I was like oh so

247
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.480
Timothy Howard: Yeah.

248
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.550
Katrina Groves: That will come back, you're young.

249
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.900
Katrina Groves: So what about any skin problems I'm dry skin itchy skin rashes mole.

250
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.390
Timothy Howard: I do have, I have psoriasis on my elbows.

251
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.390
Katrina Groves: Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, so

252
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.450
Katrina Groves: Is that the only place you have the psoriasis.

253
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.690

Katrina Groves: Nausea, vomiting,

257
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.020
Timothy Howard: No, not now.

258
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.790
Katrina Groves: Not now. Did you

259
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:15.900
Timothy Howard: Know, yeah, I was getting really like seeing like maybe a week ago was getting really sick. I'm throwing up nauseous in the morning. I don't know what the hell it was but it's gone now. Good.

260
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.480
Katrina Groves: constipation, diarrhea,

261
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.520
Timothy Howard: Know, I've been gone to the bathroom.

262
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.480
Timothy Howard: It's been regular now once a day.

263
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.730
Katrina Groves: Suboxone doesn't make you constipated.

264
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.440
Timothy Howard: Know, as it

265
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.370
Katrina Groves: Okay, and no bleeding in your stool at all like red blood when you poop or

266
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.260
Timothy Howard: Anything like that. Good.

267
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:45.690
Katrina Groves: And how about urination. Are you having any trouble with burning when you pay or your urine stream sort of stopping and starting

268
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:50.550
Timothy Howard: No, it's just a lot. And then there's been pressure so

269
00:29:51.390 --> 00:30:01.470
Timothy Howard: I've been having a lot of pressure and and inside, you know, and it's causing me to have to pee. It's like, I almost can't hold my pee and I went to see Dustin

270
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:09.900
Timothy Howard: And he did give me antibiotics. He gave me a mock Sicilian, and then it was a high dose of amoxicillin and it had something else with it.

271
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:22.800
Katrina Groves: It's augmented so it's like amoxicillin clubby organic acid, but I wonder. Let's see what he did. Oh, we talked about your back pain, too.

272
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.700
Yeah.

273
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.410
Katrina Groves: I'm Kevin Penton

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.800
Katrina Groves: So yeah that's that's concerning to as far as diabetes because people

275
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:49.320
Katrina Groves: When you have a ton of sugar in your system, your body's trying to get rid of the sugar. So how does it get rid of it at peace it out. So, you know, drink it sounds silly but drink water.

276
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.780

Okay.

279
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.800
Katrina Groves: It's important to drink enough water to get that sugar out and and you should get checked for diabetes, basically.

280
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.150
Timothy Howard: Okay. All right.

284
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.180
Katrina Groves: So the Gabba pension is good for restless legs.

285
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.410
Timothy Howard: I think you're on the right is

286
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:43.710
Timothy Howard: It has been a miracle that stuff has been helping me. You know, I take two in the morning and then to at night and

287
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:50.850
Katrina Groves: Check with Dustin and increase it to three at night. If that helps more with your legs and evening.

288
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:59.040
Timothy Howard: Okay yeah cuz I do wake up and I sometimes early in the morning and I'm back at it again. You know, it's not going away.

289
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:08.760
Katrina Groves: Right. There's also other medications that you can add on top of it to help. So okay, so I'll put that down. You want to follow up on that one.

290
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.830
Katrina Groves: neurologically though you've never had a seizure. As far as, you know,

291
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.480
Unless it was an overdose.

292
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.550
Timothy Howard: Yeah.

293
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.670
Timothy Howard: No tremors. No, no.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.830
Katrina Groves: No fainting or dizzy spells.

295
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.430
Timothy Howard: Know, just the concussion. I had

296
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.680
Timothy Howard: When I after I had to rack what seemed like after the week I was really

297
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:42.870

298
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:48.300
Katrina Groves: Yeah, you're I remember that your brain kind of gets shaken up one, literally. All right.

299
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.070
Katrina Groves: And as far as your

300
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:57.060
Katrina Groves: Bless you, your depression. Do you feel that's interfering with your life.

301
00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:58.650
Timothy Howard: And

302
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.940
Katrina Groves: The sadness or is it getting better or the Wellbutrin working

303
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:12.360
Timothy Howard: There will be a chain. It does. It does help. But, I mean, I might need a higher dose, because I've noticed that it i'm still depressed, you know,

304
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.970
Katrina Groves: Do you feel, how does your depression manifest itself. Do you feel like hopeless worthless.

305
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.440
Katrina Groves: Not being able to not a bad

306
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:27.960
Timothy Howard: Of course, worthless no good. You know, like, but i know i i'm not none of those things. I know this, you know, but I do feel like that, you know,

307
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:32.370
Katrina Groves: It. So how do you counter your, your negative self talk. What do you do

308
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:49.380
Timothy Howard: I usually I'll go outside and I'll tell myself that you know I'm worth it. You've came so far. Look at what you've accomplished. You know, I think all these things, you know, they all go to my head, but then it'll all be okay. And it'll happen again. You know, yeah, so like

309
00:33:50.580 --> 00:34:00.420
Katrina Groves: It just gets longer between times. You know when you when you fight it like that, it, it, it goes away. It just takes time. Like everything else.

310
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.680
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I know, I know you know any suicidal ideation at all.

311
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:14.070
Katrina Groves: Feeling like you want to die. No, no, um, any bruising anemia or anything like that.

312
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.210
Nope.

313
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.220
Alrighty.

314
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.120
Katrina Groves: Um,

315
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:37.140
Katrina Groves: What am I missing here. Oh, I guess I need to go back to the beginning. And I know I've heard this before but not with bright heart. Um, what age were you when you first started using any substance at all.

316
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.220
16

317
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.550
Katrina Groves: And that substance was pot.

318
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:48.480
Timothy Howard: I'm not well yeah pot and then it started off with pills.

319
00:34:51.090 --> 00:35:02.850
Timothy Howard: Well, I guess, alcohol. Yeah, but I mean, I mean it's a drug to so I'll call you know I've messed around with that was a young age, and then it progressed to pills and then it progressed to

320
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.260
Timothy Howard: Heroin and then from heroin to other drugs, you know,

321
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.030
Timothy Howard: Speed

322
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:19.140
Timothy Howard: And hallucinogenic stuff like that but I never got into the others, that was just experimental the heroin is what really stuck.

323
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:20.610
Katrina Groves: Yeah.

324
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.790
Katrina Groves: And did you spend time in jail or have any legal issues, early on.

325
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.040
Katrina Groves: Do juvenile hall or

326
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:42.720
Timothy Howard: Oh yeah I did go to jail when i was i think 17 or 16 when I was younger, I got arrested for cultivation.

327
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.720
Timothy Howard: For what cultivation, I had a big old farm going in my backyard. I got it.

328
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.390
Katrina Groves: Okay, gotcha.

329
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:59.700
Katrina Groves: And was. Were you working at that time. Did you always work. Did you have a part time job or anything as a kid.

330
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:18.660
Timothy Howard: I, I, I worked for a part time, place, it was still like trying to think of the program. I think it was called. It was a program to school. It was like, you know, learning how to work and, you know, get some experience and stuff like that. Um, I work for a nursery.

331
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:30.240
Timothy Howard: Yeah, so that's how I started you know getting all my pop my soil and stuff from was from the nursery. I work that and then I would grow my weed that way and

332
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:36.810
Katrina Groves: Did you have trouble with work because of your you're using as you got older. Did it cause problems with your job.

333
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:37.740
Timothy Howard: Oh, yeah.

334
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:44.220
Timothy Howard: Trips always, always, causing issue, eventually. Yeah. Except for

335
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:52.560
Timothy Howard: Well, I wasn't using it on that time so that doesn't count the job. I ended up getting when I was 20

336
00:36:53.610 --> 00:37:03.750
Timothy Howard: It was 24 so I just stopped using and I was clean for almost a year and I worked for Sun Valley and

337
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:13.440
Timothy Howard: I did that pretty well for a little while. That's like rats. I lost my kids. I was like, when I was going through the proper you reunification process to get my children back, you know, and then I

338
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:34.410
Timothy Howard: Didn't work out, I got sick really bad. And then I lost my kids. And then I moved back up here and then that's when I started getting back in the math really bad and heroin and it progressed, all the way up till the age of 29 or 30 when I got into Suboxone program.

339
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:40.080
Katrina Groves: And so you've been able to get clean a couple times yourself.

340
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:59.610
Timothy Howard: Yeah, but it. No, not really. I've tried it just never lasted that long. You know, like, one time was nine months, but there was always like me going to the doctor and getting prescribed medication. So it didn't really count. You know, I was getting pills pills.

341
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.510
Timothy Howard: I know

342
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.920
Katrina Groves: You just walk on the street.

343
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:10.650
Timothy Howard: Yeah, I just, I was prescribed and they couldn't do nothing to me at the time, you know, so it was like it was it was always a battle to like

344
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:18.300
Timothy Howard: With my counselors and stuff like that, during the time they're always fighting with me, telling me they knew what I was doing. Oh, that they were going to catch me and

345
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.310
Timothy Howard: Well, yeah.

346
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:34.950
Timothy Howard: It's better that you know it's better this way and this program has helped me tremendously. You know that it has changed my whole life around. I mean, I've done other folks. I've done other programs. You know, I've went to an inpatient program called

347
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:41.370
Timothy Howard: Oh, I can't think of the name of it was called. It's the one off in Eureka crossroads.

348
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.930
Timothy Howard: Right.

349
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:48.270
Timothy Howard: And then I ended up doing another couple of programs you know through

350
00:38:49.920 --> 00:39:06.720
Timothy Howard: Through the courts. It was called prop 36 actually completing that program. I did complete that program and but I still was using prescription drugs at the time. So they still didn't count it, you know. So I was able to complete the program.

351
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.340
Katrina Groves: Oh, yeah.

352
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:16.170
Katrina Groves: All right, and so what coping skills do you have now like moving forward. What makes it better.

353
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:18.570
Timothy Howard: Um,

354
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.250
Katrina Groves: You said walking

355
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:32.040
Timothy Howard: Walking with driving usually would do a to, like, just get now working with do it, you know, cooking skills right and like are you talking about, like right now.

356
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.580
Timothy Howard: Yeah. So walking going to group.

357
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:44.070
Timothy Howard: I call my friend, Mike, you know, he usually helps to sometimes it's actually a really good support person you know he is

358
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.300
Timothy Howard: So I'm huh

359
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.010
Katrina Groves: I said, That's excellent.

360
00:39:50.490 --> 00:40:01.620
Timothy Howard: Okay, yeah, it's, um, it's there for not having the car, you know, it's a lot harder. You know, for me, and I still make it work, though no matter what I'm determined

361
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.640
Katrina Groves: When are you going to get your car back a car any car.

362
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.260
Timothy Howard: I'm hoping

363
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:22.320
Timothy Howard: In the next month. So we have a settlement income coming in. So we're going to use all that money to get like a really decent car and movement. And as we're moving and we're hoping to get put into town before we get the car, you know, so we have a place already

364
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.550
Timothy Howard: But if not,

365
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.970
Timothy Howard: Then we're going to use the money to do both to do both things.

366
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.460
Timothy Howard: Good. So, and

367
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.780
Katrina Groves: What made you not want to go back to a one point you wanted to go back to the clean and sober house or you were thinking that was an option.

368
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:38.760
Timothy Howard: It was an option.

369
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:47.580
Timothy Howard: Yeah, they wouldn't let me come back because this is the third, the second time that I left, as you know,

370
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:57.570
Timothy Howard: before my time was up, you know, so I left a little bit too early. I, I signed a contract stating I at least stay there a certain amount of time. And I, and I just didn't do that. So,

371
00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.010
Katrina Groves: That's too bad.

372
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.260
Timothy Howard: So yeah, now they won't let me come back there.

373
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.790
Okay.

374
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.470
Timothy Howard: I know

375
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.980
Timothy Howard: I'm making it work. Things are going a lot better.

376
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.940
Katrina Groves: I you are

377
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:14.700
Timothy Howard: Yes. Yeah. And we're both doing good. She's doing Shannon's doing very well as well so

378
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:19.800
Katrina Groves: I'm happy to hear that because she's taking Suboxone through Dr bets are bad.

379
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:21.000
Timothy Howard: Yeah.

380
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.870
Katrina Groves: All right, and drinking and kind of backtracking, you're not drinking now.

381
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.880
Timothy Howard: ARE YOU ARE ALL I DID HAVE I did have some wine. Just recently, like

382
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.300
Timothy Howard: I think it was a few days like maybe a week ago.

383
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.580
Timothy Howard: Okay, I did drink some wine.

384
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.960
Katrina Groves: And did that make you feel like really good, like, oh, I want to do that again.

385
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:54.510
Timothy Howard: No, it didn't. Actually, it's like a it was with a lot of actually I just didn't want to do it again because there's too many people over. We had some other people that were

386
00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:03.630
Timothy Howard: Actually Shannon's friends someone that's been in the right that's in the right heart program, you know, so they all came over, we ate dinner. They had their kids over

387
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:18.090
Timothy Howard: And we all ended up getting some wine and drinking it and sending on a front porch, and then also I kind of stressed out a little bit, you know. So I guess I'm not used to having so many people like that around and kids running around my house. You know, so

388
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:34.380
Timothy Howard: Right, find overwhelming. So I was like, I don't want to do that again. So even without cause it's just, it's not really my thing. It doesn't do doesn't do for me what the other stuff. I would normally crave for like the heroin and the pills, you know, right.

389
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:48.900
Katrina Groves: Although, you have to look at that and say well, gee, if I feel like I need a drug to get through this social situation and is this really a kind of social situation I should be doing, you know, having those people so

390
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.770
Katrina Groves: Have you and Shannon

391
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.910
Katrina Groves: Talked about it again.

392
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.690
Timothy Howard: No, no, because it wasn't like that, it was, it was just like

393
00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:00.300
Timothy Howard: We all were having a good time and

394
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.280
Timothy Howard: Everyone just came up with the idea of the Cisco, get some mine so

395
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.040
Timothy Howard: And I drink with them. Yeah. So it's just

396
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:15.870
Timothy Howard: Some. I don't know. So it was there and I think mine. I was like, I didn't think it was a big deal because I normally don't drink, but

397
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:21.690
Timothy Howard: Yeah, I just look at it and be you know i i'm aware of it. Okay.

398
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.790
Katrina Groves: It doesn't go well with Suboxone when you drink. That's the only thing

399
00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.690
So,

400
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.400
Katrina Groves: Um,

401
00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.100
Katrina Groves: Okay, what else

402
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.640
Katrina Groves: Any surgeries that you've had. Tim like appendix or tonsils or

403
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:42.750
Timothy Howard: Yes, I had my opinion it's taken out when I was 12 okay

404
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.310
Katrina Groves: That is that it

405
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.080
Katrina Groves: No gallbladder surgery now shoulder surgery. No other

406
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:58.830
Timothy Howard: No. Oh, no, no. I had that was a procedure that wasn't a surgery I had when I had those access to my hip joint.

407
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:03.990
Timothy Howard: They did something I can't do it. They stuck a needle in my back and then

408
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.170
Timothy Howard: Split that was

409
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:12.990
Timothy Howard: What was called a pic line, but that was a surgery. It's like a procedure.

410
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:19.560
Katrina Groves: Okay, yeah, I'd forgotten about that. How, how you got the abscess in your hips, was that shooting up

411
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:37.860
Timothy Howard: No, I was clean. During that all the doctors that did it. There was a team of doctors. They don't know how it happened. They said that they think it could have been from my past history and it was caught up with me. I'm at the time I was playing. I was losing so

412
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:51.210
Timothy Howard: Weird. Yeah, I don't know. This is just probably developed over time. And then eventually, after they got so big it caused a blood infection and caused

413
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.190
Timothy Howard: Said, almost, almost a bone infection, what they were looking at. So

414
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.120
Katrina Groves: Yeah, like osteomyelitis or something like that.

415
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:08.490
Timothy Howard: It was a weird name to it, but I know it was very serious and I was in the hospital for a very long time. Okay.

416
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:16.830
Katrina Groves: Okay, so you're Suboxone. How much do you have left, or do you have

417
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:34.890
Timothy Howard: My script is due on Tuesday. I MEAN, I'M TONY We're talking about it and we were going to ask you to sequence I signed the contract and that it's so hard for me on Skype day i when i by the time I get the script.

418
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:44.640
Timothy Howard: I end up missing my bus and I always have to wait like five o'clock to catch the bus to come home, you know, so you can talk to Tony before you do it, but I was

419
00:45:45.090 --> 00:46:00.060
Timothy Howard: And I signed the contract stating, I can't use anymore. So if I do, I'm gone from the program, you know, so I was going to see if I could have my my script back you know it'd be a lot easier. I mean, it'd be up to you and her. You can talk to her beforehand.

420
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:05.040
Katrina Groves: I, are you wanting monthly then or every other week you're getting it every week. Now, right.

421
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.040
Timothy Howard: I'm getting every week. Yeah. Okay, so

422
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:24.090
Katrina Groves: Other it's that's fine with me because you get other medications as well. And I kind of worry about having more than a certain number of prescriptions. Your you jeopardize your, your partnership only accept so many. I think

423
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.740
Timothy Howard: Okay. Every, every two weeks. I mean, whatever.

424
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.870
Timothy Howard: You think is best, you know, and

425
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.060
Katrina Groves: I think if you're compliant will do monthly and then if you mess up, and no

426
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.110
Katrina Groves: But I am

427
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.240
Timothy Howard: I'm gone. If I messed up. So

428
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.060
Timothy Howard: I don't want, I can't mess up.

429
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.910
Katrina Groves: And I don't want to write

430
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.060
Katrina Groves: I don't want the prescription to be held over your head. So, you know,

431
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:54.930
Katrina Groves: You got it. You just make it two groups. So are you able to come. Are you working right now at all.

432
00:46:55.590 --> 00:47:06.120
Timothy Howard: No, I was no it's over with. Now, I was doing like side work where I was leaving with a private contractor and we were going up to cave junction and working that's over now.

433
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:15.330
Timothy Howard: I was trying to get back to it but it. The guy said that he would get ahold of me if he needed more help. So that kind of gives me a sign of saying it's over, you know,

434
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:23.130
Katrina Groves: Okay, what about once you working at Burger King or as fast food restaurant. What happened with that.

435
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:44.370
Timothy Howard: Talk about, um, they didn't want to pay for some I gotten a big argument with the boss there because he didn't pay me what I worked for. So yeah, things are really, really heated and I took my talk to girls I messed up. This is why I could I could get in trouble. I took my money from him.

436
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.590
Katrina Groves: Oh, Tony told me about that.

437
00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.960
Timothy Howard: Yes, I went in there and took my money.

438
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.040
Katrina Groves: That sounds kind of unlike you, I mean to be so angry and

439
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:57.390
Timothy Howard: Yeah, but I was on. I was on Xanax at the time as well.

440
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.250
Katrina Groves: There you go. That explains it.

441
00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.320
Timothy Howard: I was under the influence.

442
00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:05.640
Timothy Howard: Yeah. Wow. And again, I've been very angry to like

443
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:11.040
Timothy Howard: I could do this when Shannon and me in the room, you know, next time when I see you

444
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:16.080
Timothy Howard: I was gonna, I was going to show you the damage that I did that I had to repair on the house like

445
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:31.590
Timothy Howard: Just me sitting around and like I've know where I get so angry and I'll just destroy my stuff like, Wow, a holes in the walls rip the doors off the walls, I very rarely, but you can still see like where I repaired it you know

446
00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.710
Katrina Groves: So is that when you're using the Benz's

447
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.290
Timothy Howard: Know that's even less now.

448
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:38.910
Timothy Howard: Yes.

449
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.890
Katrina Groves: And where do you think that

450
00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:41.490
Katrina Groves: Anger is

451
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:53.070
Timothy Howard: Coming from angry anxiety. Like, I'll start crying like I don't know but i i know i know i can't use, you know, no matter what, you know, so

452
00:48:53.580 --> 00:49:04.980
Timothy Howard: This program means so much to me. You know, it really does. So it's like normal, I guess. Normally I probably went out and got the bends those, you know, but I can't you know you're

453
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:14.910
Katrina Groves: Going, some of this is benzo withdrawal to Tim is like you're going through withdrawals of your benzo you gone through withdrawals of the pie, you're going through withdrawals of everything at once so

454
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:20.040
Timothy Howard: But it's been a long time you know it's been a long since I've used, you know, it's

455
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.660
Timothy Howard: almost a month and a half and was too old, two months, probably

456
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:30.210
Katrina Groves: In the cosmic dimensions of your brain. That's a very small amount of time, like you're

457
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.020
Katrina Groves: You're going to need

458
00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:35.850
Katrina Groves: A year, six months, at least to start feeling like more normal

459
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:44.910
Timothy Howard: Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't seem like I used out long and and prior to that I had over three years, clean, you know, so it was like, it feels like I would

460
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:54.420
Timothy Howard: I mean I feel like I'm getting better, but but then I still have these like anger issues, but I guess a lot of things get brought up to, you know, like I get

461
00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:08.460
Timothy Howard: Angry over my sister or get angry over my past relationship, you know, or, you know, I have these I've been having like really, really bad dreams like last night wasn't as bad as they

462
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:18.360
Timothy Howard: It was a weird, weird dream, but the so vivid, you know, and last night, I didn't get angry or nothing but the night terrors. I have, you know, like the ones

463
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:28.200
Timothy Howard: They're really bad to talk about, but they're really that, you know, so I've been having those a lot too. And I get really angry over those. Yeah.

464
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.790
Katrina Groves: So anger is usually a sign that you're having a lot of fear.

465
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.450
Timothy Howard: Emotional I mean I'm emotional to know

466
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:47.880
Katrina Groves: That's okay because you've been blocking your emotion. So I think it's really good to get in some counseling, not just with Tony. But if she hadn't you go with one like

467
00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:49.170
Katrina Groves: Greg is that his name.

468
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:58.140
Timothy Howard: Great, great guy does actually Dustin he proved. He's the one that referred me to break Dustin did and stuff like I haven't even really

469
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:05.400
Timothy Howard: Brought up with Tony or anyone yet you you're my doctor, so I'll bring it up with you, you know, but I don't know I just

470
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:17.190
Timothy Howard: Things I don't want to talk about and group, I guess, but I'm going to have to, you know, it's things I need to throw out there. I mean, Shannon knows about it. You know, I've talked with her about it. I've cried with her about it, you know.

471
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.110
Katrina Groves: Like being abused and

472
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:25.230
Timothy Howard: Yeah yeah yeah it's it's like really, really hard. You know, it's

473
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:33.450
Timothy Howard: Yeah, just over my life I've been through a lot or my life, you know, there's things. Some things I don't talk enough about like that. I have stuffed down, you know, even

474
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:49.440
Timothy Howard: Even getting through my three years, clean, you know, like these are things I haven't worked on that. I should have worked on. So there's a lot of things of why these relapses could have happened, you know, and now I know why. Now I know why.

475
00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.910
Katrina Groves: Exactly. And now you know that you can work through it and no you don't have

476
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.430
Katrina Groves: To say stuff in the middle of group. I mean, if, if you're here and telemedicine and there's all these people and

477
00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:12.120
Katrina Groves: If you're not comfortable sharing something, then you just wait for your private counselor or you we have something we call breakout groups, you can kind of break out with me individually. If something really bothers you, and come back in. So

478
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:20.850
Katrina Groves: No, you don't have to say stuff everything in the world. I mean, you know, Casey. He talks about his abuse.

479
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.170
Katrina Groves: And doesn't bother him so

480
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.740
Katrina Groves: You know,

481
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:39.480
Katrina Groves: It's just, you got to make it work for you and but to know that that you've got that in you and and to have an outlet and to work on that you're exactly right. You will set yourself up for relapse. Again, if you don't deal with this now.

482
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:53.130
Timothy Howard: Yeah, yeah, it's a lot, a lot of it has to do with me being D and really bad, you know, me and my I feel bad for my younger brother, you know, and my sister even, you know, she loves what she's been through, you know,

483
00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.980
Timothy Howard: It is really bad. It's horrific, you know,

484
00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:01.770
Katrina Groves: It is. It's very, it's called adverse childhood events. We call it. It's got a name aceee

485
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:15.390
Katrina Groves: Adverse Childhood events cause people to have these kind of emotional problems and leads to drug use and I would say probably 99% of the addicts out there have had some sort of

486
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:26.730
Katrina Groves: Abuse trauma as a child and that could be physical, verbal abandonment, you know, who knows what and and if you address them. That's what lets you free.

487
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.290
Katrina Groves: That's what

488
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:29.820
Katrina Groves: gets you out of your

489
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:47.640
Timothy Howard: You know, you know, it's so weird is like the three years that I got through it seemed like like even though how explain explain this. It's like I stuffed those away and almost like, forgot about them for a second there and like started this whole new life, you know,

490
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:56.700
Timothy Howard: Right. And after this after this relax all of this stuff is coming out like every all this time it's so much heavier. You know, it's like

491
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:02.430
Timothy Howard: But I do have tools. I don't lose those tools, you know, I know. I'm strong. I'm determined, you know, in the last

492
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:16.680
Timothy Howard: Things I do need to bring out about, you know, my childhood, me being be and about how I lost my kids how I feel about that. You know, stuff like that. I don't talk much about that. Not enough anyway you know

493
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.740
Katrina Groves: You are now that's that's an important thing.

494
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:26.250
Katrina Groves: That's good. Yeah. So do you want to try any have I given you praise, a son before it's a

495
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:41.610
Katrina Groves: It's a nighttime medication for nightmares and for post traumatic stress. It takes nightmares away it's just a blood pressure pill. It's not a benzo it's nothing addicting. Not sure if you're interested in having me prescribe something for sleep like that.

496
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:52.140
Timothy Howard: Yeah. Well, right now, it would be fine, because if I'm going to do it. I might as well do it now because I'm not, I'm not working right now. You know, I can try it. It might help me, you know. Yeah.

497
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:53.640
Timothy Howard: We

498
00:54:53.880 --> 00:55:07.980
Katrina Groves: Got those nightmares and those horrific nightmares that that's what we want to stop because your brain is playing the tape and part of it is is good that you're you're more aware of it with your conscious mind so your subconscious is trying to work through it.

499
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:08.790
Timothy Howard: But

500
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:16.230
Katrina Groves: You need your needs your sleep too. So I'll just prescribe it for you and just take one at night and see if it helps with the nightmares.

501
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:20.580
Katrina Groves: Okay um what pharmacy. Are you at

502
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.690
Walmart.

503
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:28.290
Katrina Groves: And so we'll do your I'll do your Suboxone I'll get that called in

504
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.980
Katrina Groves: I'll probably do it now because

505
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.460
Timothy Howard: When Sunday, Tuesday. Tuesday.

506
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:42.000
Timothy Howard: Tuesday Tuesdays. When I go pick up my script and is it going to be the months worth

507
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:46.680
Timothy Howard: Yeah okay and you can you can talk to Tony today. We have already talked about it.

508
00:55:47.460 --> 00:56:01.260
Katrina Groves: I believe you. So I'm, I'm looking at my schedule for your first group and I'm doing groups. Now I'm only doing a Monday nights from 545 till 645 so that works for your schedule now because you don't have a job.

509
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:14.370
Katrina Groves: Is. Let's see. Monday. I've got 123456 think I got six people. But you could do the ninth, or you could do the 16th.

510
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:20.340
Timothy Howard: So I'm getting my desk Monday, I will

511
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:35.640
Timothy Howard: Sort of be in the evening time. I don't know if I'm going to be home around that time though either. I'm going to have, I have caught on the 10th. So it's going to be a really, really busy day Monday I mean I'm I might be able to do it but i'm not i'm not 100% sure

512
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.840
Katrina Groves: I'd rather you if the ninth is a bad day. Then what about the 16th, can you look, you have a calendar for you.

513
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:47.100
Timothy Howard: ain't doing anything around the 16th. I have the 10th and then

514
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:58.650
Timothy Howard: I have that I have a court date on the 10th and then I should have enough to coordinate like another month out. So I said, be free to do whatever. OK.

515
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:12.450
Katrina Groves: So I'll put you down for the 16th, which is a Monday at 545 try to check in at like 530 because there'll be a bunch of other people and they have to do like a little brief check in with you every time so

516
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.500
Timothy Howard: Okay.

517
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:23.730
Timothy Howard: 530 would be good. Yeah. This time, I think I did it wrong because she said, I went to the waiting room, and then I checked in and then she said,

518
00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:39.810
Timothy Howard: She said something about a brief check in, or whatever, like don't type in my idea wait five minutes before my time, but I just wanted to get back and typed in your meeting and then I waited for like 2025 minutes before so

519
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:40.290
Katrina Groves: Now,

520
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:41.520
Katrina Groves: I think you got lost.

521
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:48.660
Timothy Howard: No, I didn't see the chicken lady talk to her. Yeah. She just told me to.

522
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:56.790
Timothy Howard: Don't take any idea to like five or 10 minutes before two o'clock. I think is what she said. Maybe I misunderstood or I don't know.

523
00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:57.360
Katrina Groves: I don't know.

524
00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:03.120
Timothy Howard: We're out we're learning. Either way, either way it would work. She says, just that, you know, I would be waiting longer, she said.

525
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:05.580
Timothy Howard: Okay. Okay, great.

526
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:13.920
Katrina Groves: Yeah, and so good. I'm glad to see you, that you're okay and give Shannon my best and

527
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.570
Katrina Groves: I will, um,

528
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.660
Timothy Howard: We're strong, you know, we really

529
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:21.990
Katrina Groves: When you're strong you're strong. Yeah.

530
00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:26.790
Timothy Howard: I know we've been through so much together and where we feel like we're on this.

531
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:36.450
Timothy Howard: The downhill slope. Now, you know, we're just not downhill or uphill. You know, we're just getting getting better. We're on our way. You know, climbing stairs, you know, good.

532
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:47.640
Katrina Groves: And it'll help you, you'll get your head, you'll get your car, you know, just baby steps and try to be patient with yourself. And as soon as you can get in with Glenn or Greg, I think. Great.

533
00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.380
Timothy Howard: Great George

534
00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.360
Timothy Howard: George, George.

535
00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:53.850
