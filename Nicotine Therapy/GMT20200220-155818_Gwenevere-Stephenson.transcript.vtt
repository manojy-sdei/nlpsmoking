00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Front door.

2
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you got some good stuff happening.

3
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.930
Jen: Oh my god.

4
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.370
Jen: It's been such an intense two weeks. I can't even tell you, um,

5
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.920
Jen: So, yeah.

6
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440
Jen: Is it okay if I begin

7
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Course notes.

8
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.600
Okay.

9
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.580
Jen: Um, it involves just a tad bit of exposition. I'm going to make that as quick as possible.

10
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.910
Jen: Um, so, it involves a family that I was working with. I'm a 14 year old gender queer identifying person.

11
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:31.740
Jen: Lives on tribal land with her mom and stepdad and sister. I had to do a CPS REPORT ON THEM BACK IN NOVEMBER for physical abuse. She disclosed to me, including bruises that she had taken pictures of

12
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.650
Jen: It was pretty intense. Um, I asked to remain anonymous. They did not

13
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.870
Jen: Respect.

14
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.450
Jen: Yeah. And so I had a family session with the mom, she was really upset with me. Um, but we actually had a pretty good session.

15
00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:01.590
Jen: And then we had another two after that, by the third one. She was like, okay, like things feel good. And then I resumed just doing individual

16
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:12.810
Jen: And it was in December. I'm my client reached out to me that she had left her headphones at my office and she was going to be in Arizona.

17
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:27.840
Jen: With her father for the holidays. So I was not going to see her for a month. And so I i had a doctor's appointment that I had to be at work. And so I met her at her school in the parking lot and gave her her headphones.

18
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.520
Jen: So,

19
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:41.070
Jen: Fast forward to it was actually the day. The last time I had therapy that day I got a text from her mom saying that she had

20
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:56.310
Jen: Downloaded apps to her phone that were not acceptable. She was in trouble, she was worried she wanted to merge an emergency session. So I got them on that day and they came in and it was evident immediately that the mom and stepdad were not happy with me.

21
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:07.500
Jen: They kept referring like I would say because they claimed that she was having this online role play with people. She hadn't met

22
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:21.150
Jen: And what they were saying did sound unsafe, um, nothing that she had disclosed to me. And so, um, we talked about that. And I was like, so when did this first come up and they would say when you called CPS on us.

23
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:34.020
Jen: And I was like, Okay, I'm sorry. What was that again. And they were like, November, and I was like okay so since November, and then I would say, and then when did that happen. And they'd be like when you called CPS on us.

24
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:47.280
Jen: Like, okay, so it came became very apparent. So then I was just trying to do role play. I was like, let's try and get it so you can ask your parents when you want to download an app, because that's what they're asking

25
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:56.940
Jen: Apparently, that has never happened. And so let's figure out why. And so we role played her asking and the mom came back at her very angrily.

26
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.580
Jen: Um, and so I was like okay let's maybe let's try it again because and she was just like, no, I don't want to do this. This is stupid.

27
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:20.250
Jen: So then I was like, let's try some mirroring and they were like, no, I'm not in it was just like it was bad. So at that point, I was just like, Okay. Um, what do you want me to do.

28
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.530
Jen: Mm hmm. And she was like, well, that's your job. You're the therapist and i said i am i'm I've been doing this for almost 10 years and

29
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:39.360
Jen: I'm you don't want to try and do the things that I'm encouraged. So I guess I'm asking what you would like did went nowhere. So

30
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.790
Jen: Okay, um, you make the decision. If you would like me to continue to work with your family, I very much enjoy it. And they were like, will make a decision and they left

31
00:04:48.330 --> 00:05:01.020
Jen: I had like three more clients that afterwards I texted because during the session. It was tumultuous she yelled at her daughter was like when you say you want to kill yourself rather than talk to me. How do you think that makes me feel

32
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:11.910
Jen: So I was just so I reached out and I said, You know, I just want to say I'm really concerned with what came up in session as far as her feeling suicidal.

33
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:23.790
Jen: What app, rather than talk to you. I really think she should be evaluated clinically like you should take her to an ER have her evaluated, like if they were like, we will have her evaluated and we will seek other

34
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.170
Jen: Other help and I was like, great.

35
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know, that was happening.

36
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:43.980
Jen: Without a doubt, so I was like, I wish you the best um but then I was stuck with a I feel like I should make another report based on what was happened in that session.

37
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:55.050
Jen: And I was really conflicted about it. I saw advice from my peer I sought advice from my boss and ultimately we decided

38
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.260
Jen: To make the report because, ultimately. All I was saying was, What happened to the session. And it was just disclosing

39
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:15.990
Jen: Um, but I, and I did it in anonymously through the city, but they knew. They knew exactly who it was. They called my Boston next day they said I was harassing them and then they went and they left to each of them Yelp reviews.

40
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.210
Jen: I'm just saying that, you know, Jennifer at thrive counseling will brainwashed your child against her parents

41
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.810
Jen: So, um,

42
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.340
Jen: It was just a lot of like psychic trauma.

43
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Happened in the last seven days.

44
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.020
Jen: This last actually it

45
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:44.610
Jen: Actually happened two weeks ago today. Wow, when all that happened. Um, and then the next day.

46
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.650
Jen: Uh,

47
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:58.950
Jen: So my boss was basically like I need you to reach out to your clients and get other Yelp reviews to counteract those Yelp reviews. Right. And I was like,

48
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:10.560
Jen: Um, I don't want to do that like a, I like that looks really contrived be. I don't like asking clients for reviews, which is something he asks us to do.

49
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.990
Jen: For in in return for $10 amazon gift cards.

50
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what

51
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:30.210
Jen: Yeah. And so then the following week because now he's in full like meltdown mode. He sends out this email to all of us that we are all responsible with asking all of our clients to do this week he

52
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: He's on he's on meltdown mode.

53
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, only because of what happened with the Yelp reviews or other things.

54
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:54.000
Jen: I would assume other things. In addition to us, but it seemed. It seemed like the Yelp reviews like kind of triggered this because, and then it was this whole thing. Oh god, it was so long. It was like, um, I want you to think of yourself as shareholders in the company.

55
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Wouldn't that be nice for him.

56
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:06.180
Jen: Yes and yes he printed out these papers for us to go to all of our clients to do reviews and in return for $10 amazon gift cards.

57
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:21.660
Jen: To me and asked me if I would ask my clients to do it on Yelp for $20 amazon gift cards because and I was just like, I just said sounds good, with no intention of doing it whatsoever because I just that's easier and

58
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you a part of any associations.

59
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.020
Jen: Interestingly enough, um,

60
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.640
Jen: No, but, uh, so be anyways.

61
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.390
Jen: I'm looking into totally because there's, it's like it sort of operates is like an unofficial union. Okay.

62
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:54.000
Jen: But it's mainly for private practitioners. Um, but they also help get you credentialed so I've been like in talks with them, but in the middle of all this, I've just been a stressed out and miserable ad and a

63
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Spreadsheet. Why didn't you reach out to me.

64
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:08.730
Jen: Gosh. Thank you. Um, well, I guess, cuz like I was able to get through it like I I processed with

65
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:16.890
Jen: My peer at work who I adore. She's such a great comrade. And then my husband. Yeah, and

66
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:29.310
Jen: And so then this is just so crazy. So yesterday morning I woke up and I couldn't sleep and this woman that I worked with when I first went independent contractor.

67
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:40.710
Jen: Four years ago, five years ago now. Her name is Annie Snyder and she's just a wonderful woman, we've made really good friends, and she's been such a great like mentor for me.

68
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:50.790
Jen: She's a phenomenal clinician I've referred people to her over the years but I reached out to her and I didn't go into details. I just said that I was in a situation. I didn't want to be in

69
00:09:51.810 --> 00:10:00.780
Jen: Explained my caseload explained what I was being paid and a little of how I was being treated as far as wanting to leave and then basically was like

70
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:09.870
Jen: I'm I have every right to take my clients anywhere. I'm getting credentialed on my own is going to take a while. But in the meantime, can I

71
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:23.280
Jen: Just come to you. I can bring a caseload. Um, what do you think, and we emailed back and forth over the course of yesterday and by four o'clock. She gave me an offer.

72
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.870
Jen: Oh, and I start march 24

73
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.970
Jen: She's paying me way more than me.

74
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:45.840
Jen: She's paying me like $15 more Good, good. Yeah. And like, what is amazing. Is that what she's going to do is bring me on and like in return for bringing my caseload.

75
00:10:46.260 --> 00:11:02.490
Jen: Even though she's paying me a phenomenal amount. She is going to help me get credentialed and on my own, so that it's sort of like I slowly peel off from her as I get potential on my own. So I'm going to find my own place. She's gonna pay a third of the rent.

76
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, that's great.

77
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.080
Jen: Yeah, so

78
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:17.580
Jen: It was amazing because when I first got the first email back from her because I drafted it like 430 in the morning and set it to send it 8am. So I didn't look like a crazy person.

79
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:35.160
Jen: And yeah, when I got that response back at 1113 I was just it, it felt like such a huge weight had been lifted like and what was amazing is that at the end. She was like, You don't deserve to be treated this way and

80
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:45.540
Jen: From what I know of you, all you do is bring value to every agency that you work with, I would be delighted to have you back. When do you want to come

81
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:56.910
Jen: Oh, it was just, oh yeah oh so easy that was amazing and and then I started rehearsal for the show that I'm directing. Oh, we could go

82
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:09.390
Jen: So I have a weekend to that. And I don't know if I told you much about it, but it's about sexual assault on a college campus in an African American man and a Jewish one and it's

83
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:31.440
Jen: It's so good at it. So satiating and my actors are amazing and I have this all female team of stage manager assistant stage manager assistant director and it just, it feels so good. And we're doing really good work and

84
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:44.340
Jen: Even though I'm dead tired and everyone around me a sick and I'm trying so hard not to get shit and I'm doing I'm actually succeeding at that somehow and

85
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.460
Jen: Yeah, that's not

86
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What a great story.

87
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.890
Jen: Right, yeah. Sorry.

88
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:54.900
Yeah.

89
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:16.380
Jen: Um, but there were a couple times in the middle of that that I wanted to use so bad, okay, because I wanted to escape. I wanted to just get away from how all of that felt

90
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.450
Jen: I slept a lot last weekend, um,

91
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:39.060
Jen: And found myself like on Saturday I woke up at 638 and I didn't want to be awake and I took six Benadryl and went back to sleep, which is something I haven't done in like

92
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.150
Jen: Least a couple of months.

93
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:43.770
Jen: And

94
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:55.320
Jen: It didn't feel good. Like I woke up, like, you know, dazed and groggy like 1130

95
00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:07.050
Jen: And it was on Sunday that my husband said to me, he after my first rehearsal. So it was like eight three. And he was just like, are you okay

96
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.470
Jen: And I just broke down.

97
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.660
Jen: And it was amazing the way those three words were just like,

98
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.060
Jen: No.

99
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:29.490
Jen: Yeah. Um, but it was nice. Just because like I broke down. He helped me. And he was just like they quit the stupid fucking job.

100
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's it. That's exactly

101
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:47.400
Jen: Yeah. And I was like, I can't do it. He was like, fuck it. He was like, we have credit cards, we can figure it out. Like, it is not worth you be this miserable know

102
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.280
Jen: What I was just like,

103
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:59.310
Jen: The hue, just for like making me feel like that would be okay, even if we did have to struggle a bit like that would be okay.

104
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Allowing that space for that out.

105
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, wow.

106
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.350
Jen: Yeah yeah

107
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's then it's I choose to stay here not, I have to. And I'm trapped

108
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.000
Jen: And that feels so much better.

109
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So different, isn't it.

110
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.390
Jen: No different. Well,

111
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then, then you're like, No, I'm gonna stay and work it out until I'm ready to go. Right.

112
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.020
Jen: That's how I felt I was like

113
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.830
Jen: Like no, he's not making me quit. He's not making me lose money like this is not know

114
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

115
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.640
Jen: And then just who was just like, if that's your choice, that's fine, but like I know that like

116
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:46.950
Jen: Yeah, if you need this, you walk away at any time. And I was just like, they love you. Thank you.

117
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So much love there that is just such a beautiful. That's the perfect response.

118
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.270
Jen: Right. Oh god yeah so lucky.

119
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.680
Jen: So, yeah. And it was interesting because then when I went into work on Tuesday.

120
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.180
Jen: I just had this whole different outlook. I was just like,

121
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:16.440
Jen: Yeah, I don't have to be here. He doesn't control my paycheck. He doesn't

122
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.940
Jen: Like I control my paycheck.

123
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.630
Jen: That's who does and

124
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:41.520
Jen: If I look at it that way. It feels so much easier. And then he even came in and talk to me yesterday. And it was interesting because I had been at the pulmonologist because I get shots every two weeks for my asthma and I ran into his mother.

125
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:51.480
Jen: my boss's mother who was on oxygen. And I was like, Oh my God, because she's a really sweet woman. She's coming seemed like every one of my shows.

126
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.120
Jen: And so I gave her a big hug. We were talking and she was like, yeah, did he tell you I was a hospital.

127
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.870
Jen: And I was like, No. And she said, yeah, I was in the hospital with pneumonia at the beginning of February.

128
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:20.460
Jen: And I was just like, I'm so sorry. Oh my god. And she said, Yeah, you know, he really stepped up he really, he really took care of me. He really did a good job. And I was just like so glad, and I actually texted him. And I was like, hey, I ran into your mom. I'm really sorry.

129
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.150
Jen: That must have been really hard. I hope you're doing okay.

130
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:39.450
Jen: And so then he stopped into my office and was like Hey, don't worry about those Yelp reviews, Jen. You like yeah, you've got a point like we should probably just like let it go and and well and I was like, thanks. Cool.

131
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't even have you didn't weren't making a point you just said sure.

132
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.140
Jen: Yeah, totally. Well,

133
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: his conscience made a point is ethical obligation to not buy someone's review hit him finally

134
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.090
Jen: Well, and I don't even. I don't think that that

135
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:06.180
Jen: Did I think they like hounding me to get the Yelp reviews. He's like, Oh, back off there but

136
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.690
Jen: He doesn't get it. No. Yeah, and

137
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh yeah i mean

138
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.460
Jen: Is that now I feel like I have

139
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.680
Jen: I just have the strength within me to just say that now.

140
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, you know, I don't feel comfortable with this. That's right.

141
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.340
Yeah.

142
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.330
It's a bit of exploitation behavior, isn't it is

143
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's where a way not in my comfort zone.

144
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's unethical.

145
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, and the nice thing. If you are ever a part of an association, you can always just say you can kind of see it right here.

146
00:18:51.300 --> 00:19:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do it. I want to, I want to stay in good standing and. Absolutely. Well, I'm like, I think that I should even just look at the NSW code about it. Yeah, you'll see it.

147
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.610
Jen: It's right there. And yeah.

148
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Under exploitation, probably, it'll be in there or it's not really bartering, but I think exploitation.

149
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.000
Jen: Without a doubt, yeah.

150
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, let's, let's go back to probably uncomfortable part

151
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta do my job.

152
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And talk a little bit about that that that period. Now, there's really cool things that happened to let me press in a little harder. Yes.

153
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there increased alcohol use know was there increase marijuana. Yes. Okay. And so to how much that day about that increased sleeping. The six Benadryl how much more marijuana that day.

154
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:47.970
Jen: Um, I would say.

155
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.890
It was

156
00:19:54.630 --> 00:20:03.960
Jen: I can't remember the exact day. It wasn't the same day as the Benadryl. Okay. Um, but I would say that whole weekend. It was just sort of like

157
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.050
Jen: Hitting the vapor pen.

158
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:18.090
Jen: At least six times that day and taking at least like I'd say probably around 100 milligrams of edibles each day.

159
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.450
Jen: Which isn't like off the charts for me but is more than I usually consumed. Okay.

160
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So on.

161
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.480
Jen: Yeah.

162
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Any increased use of the pornography.

163
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:39.900
Jen: No. And that was really awesome because I wanted to like I have a memory. I think that it was

164
00:20:41.460 --> 00:21:05.160
Jen: Last Thursday or Friday I it was so vivid, because I had just walked a client out and I walked back in and it hit me immediately in the lobby that I was triggered and I wanted to escape. And I thought to myself like I have for two milligrams strips in my wallet.

165
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.700
Jen: And that's as far as it got

166
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do instead. Did you immediately have your client.

167
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.890
Jen: I did it pretty quick. But, um, NO, I DID I stretch

168
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:31.140
Jen: Stretch I did so in in theater. One of my favorite things to do is the drop down role. So basically stand straight up and you drop your head and then you roll vertebra by vertebra, all the way down until you're hanging

169
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:39.300
Jen: From your tailbone. And then you roll up vertebra by vertebra with your head being the very, very last thing to come out. Yeah.

170
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice.

171
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:47.580
Jen: So that's what I did. I did a drop down rollover I took a deep breath and it was like literally my phone was like

172
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.090
Jen: I had to go get my client, but

173
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.370
Jen: It was enough.

174
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Alright, so things that you're feeling proud of is you were faced with frustration.

175
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you noticed that the automatic thought to use was there, you remembered stretching and breathing and you happen to have conveniently already a constraint of a commitment of an of an appointment, indeed.

176
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Curious to know sometime when there is no appointment. What happens, that's okay. Another another time.

177
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.250
Jen: That was

178
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: In itself. Right.

179
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:37.890
Jen: Well, and I think that that was likely what happened over the weekend with the increased cannabis rules so

180
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.840
Jen: Other things. Yeah.

181
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you tell me what you notice

182
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear you.

183
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Text your husband.

184
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear you say.

185
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know how to put it into words this shit storm at work.

186
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: He's asking me to do something unethical.

187
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel collapsing. I'm I feel trapped or whatever your truth, but I didn't hear you say it reached out to my sweetheart, and it's beautiful lady came to you, but all that time past all that time past, when when it really comes down to it.

188
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not reaching out. Yeah. To him, and you, you have a he said exactly the right thing. Do you know what would you know why you didn't reach out to him.

189
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.250
Jen: Well, it was interesting cuz he did say the right thing, um,

190
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.170
Jen: But it began with

191
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.020
Jen: He has this tendency lately. Like when I bitch about work.

192
00:23:53.130 --> 00:24:06.090
Jen: Where it's sort of like he he responds basing YEah Bit like he's obviously following like a corporatist style of management, like, I don't know what you expect.

193
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:24.270
Jen: Like pretty typical for like businesses. And I'm like, babe, you're not hearing that, like in therapy agencies. This is not typical like oftentimes therapy agencies don't have places you can leave reviews, because we're dealing with people with mental illness.

194
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I make everybody cry. I piss everyone off.

195
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, that's my job.

196
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.360
Jen: Totally

197
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:45.390
Jen: Yeah. And, and so I think that there was definitely some hesitancy there because of that. And when I did like first breakdown

198
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:55.080
Jen: He was just like, Let's get you like, you know, he wasn't triage mode. He was like, fuck this shit you're fine. But then, like, as I come down. He was like, but you know like

199
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:07.440
Jen: It seems kind of par for the course and I'm getting that from both him my brother and my dad all like my brother owns a company. My husband is

200
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:19.380
Jen: It's just him and his dad who run the ad agency. And then my father works very closely with the owner of that agency as well. And they're all like they have nothing to do with therapy. You know, it's advertising and like

201
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:24.810
Jen: Creating iPhone app said like, like, you know, environmentally conscious lighting.

202
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.500
Jen: And so it was difficult to really feel heard, yeah.

203
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it nice and crisp and clear now. So let's let's let's see if we can

204
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:51.450
Just sort of dissect this a little bit more but yeah I did reach out to my peer who also works, subscribe, and she was the perfect person to process that was

205
00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not his permission you needed. Yeah, it doesn't work. She can say Fuck that guy she can say it all day long but

206
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your husband saying quit it, we can handle this financially, she doesn't have any skin in the game and your finances, that's different. Yeah.

207
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, my, on my onto something here.

208
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.400
Jen: Definitely, obviously. Yeah.

209
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

210
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: as bright as insightful as you are, because you're in it. It's hard to see.

211
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: When you your well let me work this the other way.

212
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If we just use the I feel structure if I'm your find your husband.

213
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And again,

214
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm partially getting it. I can contain what you're talking about. And then I do a comma button I minimize it. And I'm your brother and I contain what you're doing. But it's kind of the way it is. Work it out. And again, and again. So I'm that person who once again.

215
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Half of it is helpful and really empathetic and the second half is a bit like rug pulled out.

216
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how you feel.

217
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.890
Jen: I feel sad.

218
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.490
feel hurt.

219
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.070
I don't understand.

220
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:30.990
I

221
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.740
Jen: I feel like when

222
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:57.300
Jen: When you say that it makes me feel like you're devaluing my perspective of my field. Yeah.

223
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to put that I feel devalued and that's about what just happened between you and I were going to put it over here for a second.

224
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: First I want to hear how you feel when you're at work and you're asked to go ask for counter positive Yelp reviews from your boss. I want to hear how you feel.

225
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.710
Jen: I feel like you feel like it's my fault that I got those negative reviews.

226
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a like I'm gonna do it again. It's really hard to do.

227
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.270
Jen: I know your

228
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.680
Jen: Weight. I got it.

229
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it.

230
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.460
I feel angry.

231
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, finish the sentence I feel angry.

232
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.190
Jen: That you've asked me to do something unethical.

233
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes.

234
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:08.790
Jen: I feel angry that you seem to be demanding that I do something unethical.

235
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.130
Jen: Yeah, yeah. I feel angry. Mm hmm.

236
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about the anger. If there's anything around that.

237
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is the first time I'm hearing it, I wonder, I wonder why I didn't hear it from you.

238
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.490
Jen: I cut it feel

239
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:41.400
Jen: It feels like a huge betrayal. Okay. It feels like something I never expected and I'm

240
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.060
Yeah, I feel

241
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.760
Jen: Pressure and I feel depleted. Yeah.

242
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the tears. What are those. What's the emotion behind there.

243
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.440
Jen: Cuz I feel really heard

244
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That I would ask you to do something unethical and pressure you to do it.

245
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.730
Jen: Yeah and that

246
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:13.290
Jen: I'm

247
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.290
Jen: I've allowed myself to

248
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.870
Jen: Muzzle myself.

249
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.710
Okay.

250
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it mean to you that I need to do something unethical.

251
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.780
Jen: It means that you care more about the business or you care more about money.

252
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Than what

253
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:51.270
Jen: Then the well being of people both clients and employees.

254
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And specifically, what about you.

255
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.580
Jen: Specifically, you don't care about my well being.

256
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.560
Jen: My core values.

257
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

258
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.000
Yeah.

259
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:52.290
Jen: Okay.

260
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

261
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.240
Jen: Um,

262
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.800
Jen: I mean creed that

263
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.050
Jen: Yeah, that I've muzzled myself.

264
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.640
Jen: I'm angry that I let myself thinks that I needed to do that.

265
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.160
Jen: And

266
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.720
Jen: I'm angry that you let your anger.

267
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.340
Jen: over onto me.

268
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.880
Jen: When you had me into your office for that meeting in December.

269
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.550
Jen: I don't think I've let go, that

270
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:48.540
Jen: I honestly don't know how because it doesn't feel like you feel like anything that happened that night was not okay.

271
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.980
Jen: And that really concerns me

272
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jen. See if you can see

273
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Where a projection occurred in the notion. This gets kind of tricky. See if you can catch a projection. What was you were doing to yourself.

274
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to stay here.

275
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you drop that on to your brother and onto your husband that that's what they were telling you to do you need to stay

276
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to stay there.

277
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not caring about your well being, just see what comes up around that.

278
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.230
Jen: I feel like the first thing that comes up is, um,

279
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:06.960
Jen: I don't think they weren't caring about my well being. They were just trying to be realistic and

280
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.030
Jen: Like giving me more perspective from his perspective.

281
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they caring about your well being.

282
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.590
Jen: I think they were in their own way, if that makes sense. Um,

283
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And Damien's your boss.

284
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:25.740
Yeah.

285
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Caring about your well being and so anyway.

286
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.320
No.

287
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.570
Jen: Okay, I get it now.

288
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you thinking about

289
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:58.950
Jen: Well, I guess I the first thing came up is that I was willing to give a more credit to my husband father and brother as far as them caring about my wealthy, even while they were saying things that I didn't like and didn't agree with and felt

290
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.660
Jen: Like they're siding with was devaluing my point of view.

291
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.300
Jen: Whereas when I look at him.

292
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.710
Jen: And you say, does he care about your well being. I'm like, no.

293
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there, is there any fraction that

294
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe Damien does care.

295
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:33.240
Jen: I think that he does, like I do, like, I mean even like him coming into my office yesterday, I could tell that he

296
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:53.730
Jen: Wanted to be kind, like I had texted with him. The I was just like, I can't reach out to any people about Yelp. Right now I can't put energy towards it. I'm trying to protect my self esteem right now. And that's actually like what I need to put energy towards for this moment.

297
00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:02.460
Jen: And I felt like him coming in and encouraging me at the same time. Do not read the reviews.

298
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:10.650
Jen: Because that's not a good thing to do. Yeah, which is so counterintuitive to what he's encouraging us to get reviews but

299
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.010
Jen: I think that he does. He does care about my well being and some in some place.

300
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.960
Jen: Of course he absolutely does.

301
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: A portion of it. Yes. All right.

302
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When you didn't

303
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: speak your truth and Damien say

304
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That you would ask me to do something that

305
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We are similar training.

306
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Both know that this has the potential to be interpreted as exploitive um it's surprising surprises me that you would say it. I'm angry, I feel pressured, I need this money.

307
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: real challenge. I need this job.

308
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's being butted up against an ethical decision coming from you is so difficult.

309
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't feel like an investment and I care about my well being, I need this license.

310
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my

311
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: source of income.

312
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it threatens my license.

313
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we talk more about it. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're hearing what you're saying to me.

314
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't do that up front.

315
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So kind of what I was poking around with was the idea that

316
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't giving yourself that ability to do that. Yeah.

317
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Your husband was able to tap into finally say it clean and simple.

318
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:10.410
Jen: Yeah.

319
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But you first.

320
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Happens with you. First, this, this is happening.

321
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so we can see other people doing it to us.

322
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were doing it to yourself so you repeated a couple of times and Mac that I didn't speak didn't speak at that table didn't do it here. There it is again, you do not like it when you are not spot on. This is how, what is going on for me.

323
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you just don't like those moments. No.

324
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.260
Jen: Well, I'm like,

325
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.000
Jen: I'm not one to hold my tongue and that's what's killing me.

326
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:14.970
Jen: And honestly, God, I wish so badly that I was so bad that I could go back and just say what I felt at that table.

327
00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

328
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Comfortable, you know,

329
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't remember if you're someone who does the reduce but I think Dan

330
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: In my world, reduce our regular practice that was a failure that just went sideways fast and a lot of different directions bad

331
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to walk out. We're going to redo this and see how it goes.

332
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I find that that's a viable option, you know,

333
00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It almost seems like once that confidence is back in yourself and you really have a sense of, I've got this other place I'm going

334
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.100
Jen: Yeah.

335
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be cathartic for you to say, you know, Damien I small community. I know we're going to be running into each other and i wanna i want to continue to invest in in our professional relationship because the other ones did and

336
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.840
Jen: Like

337
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:26.940
Jen: My to

338
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:32.100
Jen: Continue to invest in our professional relationship. Oh my god, I'm so using that

339
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it. I'm an important in in order to do that, there's been this unsaid piece for me. Do you have a minute. I just want to redo that moment that we had at the table. I wasn't able to sort of

340
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about something really important. It's still sort of stuck inside and it keeps popping up in other places.

341
00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt, you know, humiliated embarrassed and

342
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like I got sucker punched at that table.

343
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have liked to have said, I'm not comfortable with this change happening moving forward. Maybe we can pick these topics up again in a week from now.

344
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And really understand the long term objective of this and

345
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

346
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I'm acutely aware of my size I I don't like jokes I already know how to make people feel comfortable around it. I love my body.

347
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But I still get triggered when people act out and say funky things to try and cover it. I've got it. You know, I felt embarrassed and I was already vulnerable from not speaking up at the table. So just want you to know. That's still been sticking with me.

348
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I got hurt because you know from our other conversations. This is an area of vulnerability for me.

349
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I was embarrassed and I was already like mad at myself for not speaking. And then I was embarrassed and it's still just really stuck with me and

350
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, that's all I'm done.

351
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.780
Jen: Yeah, no, I

352
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:33.840
Jen: I guess I'm trying to figure out how to go forward. I can't decide if I want to send him an email or try to figure out a way to see him in person, which is very difficult. There's also we have a meeting coming up on March.

353
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

354
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.830
Jen: You feel like it should be once I've gone

355
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I can't, I can't give you advice I'm not an advice.

356
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: giver. Absolutely. But what's coming up for me is emails or not. They don't land in the body. The same. They don't land. They just don't you can't see the guys like oh

357
00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:58.140
Yeah.

358
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

359
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.920
Jen: Which is like the best part.

360
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to see him squirm. No.

361
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it's just it is won't because we're wired for connection when the wounding was interpersonal the healings got to be in our personal and email just doesn't cut it.

362
00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: True and and i know you take a lot of pride in being courageous and being bold and that doesn't match your style. Totally.

363
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I was hinting at, and it's a projection on my part, wanting safety wanting that really sure everything's already set up with this other gig.

364
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If it happens to happen organically, you might like that one where right, I got it right now my strong opinion just popped up. It doesn't mean you have to redo what I just did in front of you, but rather it's

365
00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All this is the same kind of moment I am. Here's my classroom. Again, I've got this lesson to learn

366
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go for it. Boy, you know, I hear how important this is for you. Damien and all of you. I'm not hearing any objections.

367
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel strongly and I'm not, I don't even have it put together the reasons why but something's coming up for me. I'd like a little bit of time to think about it, can we pick this topic up again later. Yeah.

368
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I can come up with the words or something. Maybe I'll throw that out in an email but something's hitting me and I don't know if it's past experience or

369
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe there is a an ethical thing. I don't know, but I'd like some time to really think about what's going on, but something really important is happening.

370
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a redo like that like a similar moment and it's more organic and then you just got to be spontaneous, which I think you like

371
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So that totally don't have to be a plan thing because then you're going to like exactly when. How about now. And oh,

372
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.760
Jen: Where is it happening organically sounds much better.

373
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you don't have to think about it. Yeah, well,

374
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:18.240
Jen: It was interesting because like I said, even when he came into my office yesterday and talk to me. I felt it then it was like, I didn't say anything to him for him. Does that make sense. Yeah.

375
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I hear the center when I was like, oh, that sounded like I'm you know taking care of my self esteem right now really just managing that part just just can't just be doing that.

376
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:37.980
Jen: Putting up that boundary and him respecting it being like, Oh, okay. Just boundary. And then I was like, I've been. I've been doing

377
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah and your husband just

378
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: just gave you love just gave me this huge orphan space, but you were depriving yourself from it and easily seeing and and brother in dead.

379
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And in your husband to write scanning because there it is, you're already doing it to yourself. And there it is again. And it's offensive and he does, he's not giving me this freedom. You're not giving yourself the freedom. Yeah, that's the tricky part about projection it slick.

380
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It is so slick. It's so much easier to look to hate it on him.

381
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Then to look at ourselves. It's just like, that's awful.

382
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

383
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hard to see. Yeah. It is hard to see.

384
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

385
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's that. Maybe if we're under a good hypothesis there. And then there's

386
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue continued reaching for substances, that's still there some success behind it, the convenience of having distraction.

387
00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You did stretch you did do some breathing.

388
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If this piece about

389
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Remembering this event quite on purpose.

390
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately, my husband does want my well being. He wants that for me.

391
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I have all this awareness about communication and psychology. They don't understand it. They're not going to see the yes but they're not going to see that I'm going to see it long before they do unfortunately I'm going to have to own my duty. I'm going to have to own what I need clear

392
00:47:44.160 --> 00:48:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I need you to tell me that if I walk off this job. You're going to still love me. You're not going to think I'm a quitter or whatever your worst thought of yourself is totally. I need to know. I can just walk away. I'm scared. That's what's out here looks like what was missing. Yeah.

393
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.380
Let's definitely

394
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.770
Hmm.

395
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

396
00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you give them a call, Hey, what's the belief about you and your husband that she didn't call him.

397
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it just what you told me that story, he will he has this other side

398
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:26.970
I mean,

399
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:29.580
That and I think

400
00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:48.030
Jen: I am just so used to handling it on my own. I'm so used to like not reaching out about it and even like when I got in this program. I was really contemplative about telling people that I was in the program.

401
00:48:48.510 --> 00:49:00.060
Jen: And reaching out in that way and it, but it's still so and it's not even that it's hard for me, it's like, because if I make the decision. I'm like, yes, of course.

402
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.940
Jen: So habitually ingrained

403
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.100
Jen: To solve it down.

404
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All that's all, that's all it. Yep. And that's it, isn't beauty of being being this this independent woman and I, you know, we don't want to get rid of that part.

I am

422
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:59.820
Jen: A burden. I am making everything hard for everyone else.

423
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.410
Jen: I don't think I would ever say that I don't even realize that's their

424
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:14.400
Jen: That's their

425
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:15.990

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to know it to be true. It's going to be there. You just were witness to it. What if it means you have to completely fall apart to be rescued you run the risk of dipping into addictive stuff.

431
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want that for you. I want you to be able to see that you have a right to resource, just like everybody else does. Yeah, it doesn't deplete your strength.

437
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.390
Now,

438
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive belief about yourself.

439
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That you want to be thinking, instead of I'm weak and I'm a burden.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and they are possibly resting there, right there. Gravity's to sort of holding them down, there's this sort of

458
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Pulling down sort of heavy weight of a sense of down and warm. He

459
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.670

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull that WORST piece hearing him ask you to do that. Maybe somewhere in there.
