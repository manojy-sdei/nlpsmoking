Jennífer castro: Go ahead. My sister has a girlfriend or and they're they're constantly fighting she's constantly calling her putting her down and calling my sister names and starting fights with their for no reason. And that's what I usually wake up to

24
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.480

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.780

Jennífer castro: This one I'm sorry. I mean, this has been. All right. I've actually kind of

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.270
Jennífer castro: Trying to start new things. I started crocheting, which I'm not very good at, but I try, I'm starting are trying

33
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.410
Good.

34
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.580
Jennífer castro: Very fun. Hey, good morning.

35
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.380
Jennífer castro: All right.

36
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not very

37
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.450
Jennífer castro: Fun. Well, though, because I'm not very good at it yet. So like I can chain it and I can go, I'm doing rows back and forth.

38
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

39
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.760
Jennífer castro: Oh, it's not really fun yet because I haven't been able to make anything yet. I think that's the fun part is making things anything. I haven't done it yet. I'm just doing rose

40
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you get in the rhythm and you get it down pat, you'll be able to pump out anything that you want.

41
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

42
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.890
Jennífer castro: Yeah, I'm hoping

43
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.840
Jennífer castro: With all this

44
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.620
Jennífer castro: What do you plan on team time. I just want to make like handbag or person or something like that that will actually use like sweaters, or nothing like that. I just want to make like handbag or something.

45
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh nice blanket.

46
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.850
Jennífer castro: And I think that's too much time.

47
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Consuming

48
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.110
Jennífer castro: I know my mom. My mom took her like

49
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.130
Jennífer castro: She made up of like it for all of her grandbabies and we'll take her a long time like

50
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.250
Jennífer castro: I don't know. Yeah.

51
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.030
Jennífer castro: Hello.

52
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah definitely time consuming.

53
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

54
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.670
Jennífer castro: I guess all I got the cloud, right now, though, right. Can you hear me.

55
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.950
Jennífer castro: I could barely hear you.

56
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.660
Jennífer castro: keep cutting in and out.

57
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't know what's going on with the internet or my zoom, but it's definitely been playing havoc today.

58
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.300
Jennífer castro: Okay, so it's not me then.

59
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.090
Jennífer castro: Okay.

60
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I think that Zoom is overloaded, a little bit right now. And that's part of the problem.

61
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.980
Jennífer castro: I'll probably because they use zoom for everything now.

62
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.950
Jennífer castro: I did it. I did an interview on it.

63
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You did.

64
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.160
Jennífer castro: Mm hmm.

65
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How'd that go

66
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.750
Jennífer castro: Oh, I'm fine. I mean, it's more, it's not as nerve wracking as when you go in, you know,

67
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.690
Jennífer castro: So it was, it was, it wasn't good, I think.

69
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I don't know why they were

70
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.260
Jennífer castro: Home Depot.

71
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:42.600
Jennífer castro: Nice. I can't go up and I can't, I'm a massage therapist. I can't go back into my field of work for a while. The governor actually put $75 million aside for people like us that do hands on.

72
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.330
Jennífer castro: To get benefits or whatever, like I guess it's some kind of unemployment.

73
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.430
Jennífer castro: What is it called, especially the P. But so we can fall for that as of April 28

74
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.640
Jennífer castro: And will be approved.

75
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.750
Jennífer castro: As, obviously I'm not going back to work for a while.

76
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.800
Right.

77
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

78
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean that they've done that.

79
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:17.520
Jennífer castro: Yeah, yeah. So I'm actually kind of looking into other fields, you know that I've done before prior or whatever, just because I don't think that

80
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.070
Jennífer castro: I don't time it's going to be my devil, and I'm already had enough of that right now, I think. Yeah.

81
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.750
Jennífer castro: Oh, and if I can get out of the house for any reason. I'm sure that I'm going to find it.

82
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable.

83
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. So how have you been doing on

84
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Using

85
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.860
Jennífer castro: What do you mean the math.

86
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.790
Yeah.

87
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.330
Jennífer castro: Well, I'm not gonna lie to you that I

88
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.920
Jennífer castro: I

89
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.230
Jennífer castro: Yesterday did black

90
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.120
Jennífer castro: I don't know.

91
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.010
Jennífer castro: I just felt like a

92
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.970
Jennífer castro: I don't know. It was like in a room, I guess, like, I don't know, I just felt really foggy yesterday.

93
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.380
Jennífer castro: And then I did something yesterday afternoon.

94
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.590
Jennífer castro: And it felt great. I hate that I hate that it feels good. I hate that. I like it.

95
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.610
Right.

96
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.320
Jennífer castro: So, but I told my man and and I told my mom and

97
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.210
Jennífer castro: She's like, Well, you know what it does. And you know what, where you go. So I'm almost pretty disappointed.

98
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And are you on Suboxone

99
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.450
Jennífer castro: Yes, ma'am.

100
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.140
Jennífer castro: And now it doesn't make me throw up or nothing. Want to use it.

101
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.290
Jennífer castro: They say it's supposed to. But it doesn't

102
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What does it do what are the effects that you do get

103
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.360
Jennífer castro: It. I might get maybe get a little nauseous. But that's, that's it.

104
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.510
Jennífer castro: It doesn't like alter my

105
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.840
Jennífer castro: appetite for it, or none of that it's

106
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.120
Jennífer castro: Just even affected.

107
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Milligrams, are you on

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.550
Jennífer castro: Eight and I take two and a half.

109
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're like, I'm 18 eight

110
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: eight milligrams strips.

113
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.350
Jennífer castro: Yeah, like I was listening to group yesterday. And there's a scroll that takes five of them and a day.

114
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.760
Jennífer castro: Oh,

115
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you talked to the doctor. Yeah. Have you talked to

116

Jennífer castro: Okay, and I do actually told her that I was getting trying to take her down, and she told me not to that she would just

119
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.940
Jennífer castro: Take me on put me back on to instead of two and a half, because I just

120
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.990
Jennífer castro: I don't know, yesterday was like I said I was hired to though, so I don't know if I was just filling myself or what

121
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you tell them in group that you would

122
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.970
Jennífer castro: Use that Dell. No. No, I didn't.

123
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.230
Jennífer castro: She didn't pass

124
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.650
But yeah

125
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important that

126
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that she knows that just so that she can adjust your medication and not lower it but maybe you know maybe she can raise it a little

127
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.220
Jennífer castro: Bit to help you with

128
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.790
Jennífer castro: Yeah, I think I was a little embarrassed that I did. You know what I mean, like,

129
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.520
Jennífer castro: I was doing really good

130
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.440
Jennífer castro: But I guess.

131
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.570
Jennífer castro: If they just got to me.

132
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:44.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that happens, Jennifer, you know, the important thing is that we get it out and that we, you know, adjust things to help us, you know, stay on the path that we, that we are on, you know, definitely. Nobody is here to to judge you. We want to help you get better. Right.

133
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.570
Yeah.

134
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.210
Jennífer castro: Yeah.

135
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just know that you know that you're not going to be kicked off the program, you're not going to be condemned. You know, you're showing up.

136
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you are going to group you're engaging individual with me. You know what I mean, it's about supporting you through this process to build that foundation that you need, you know,

137
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.470
Jennífer castro: Okay.

138
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I kind of know I

139
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:28.980
Jennífer castro: Guess it doesn't stick. I don't know. I think I get more ashamed or whatever, like when I did that, like, I don't know. I mean this, I went into this my, on my own. Nobody asked me to do it. I just decided to do it that I was ready, and I'm not even

140
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.100
Jennífer castro: It did good for the first three weeks or two months or whatever it was.

141
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can do you can continue to do good, you know,

142
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:45.480
Jennífer castro: I don't, I don't know, lately. I just don't feel like myself. So it was a good day I woke up. All right.

143
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.210
Jennífer castro: I don't know.

144
00:09:49.290 --> 00:10:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot going on, you know, one thing that we don't like is change. And when change happens and we feel powerless around about the world around us makes this tough. So we want to be able to control what we can, you know,

145
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.410
Jennífer castro: Well, I haven't seen my grandkids and my kids and my month

146
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.070

147
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.090
Yeah.

148
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.510
Jennífer castro: I mean, I haven't seen him at all.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.930
Jennífer castro: My granddaughter FaceTime me one time.

Jennífer castro: My son just turned 22 my middle one.

152
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.870

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.970

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

264
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.770

Jennífer castro: I know usually when I'm on my like reading like this. I'm outside in the sun. They're not the water because I lived up with the river.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.000
Jennífer castro: My name my my piece.

291
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.300
Jennífer castro: That

292
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I will contact Dr. Jamison and let her know

293
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About your relapse let her know if she would evaluate your medication.

294
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

295
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See if you know she can raise it a little bit that will help you with those triggers and cravings, definitely.

296
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.330
I've definitely heard

297
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.560
Huh.

298
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.700
Jennífer castro: Do you think there's a difference between the pills in the strip because

299
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.960
Jennífer castro: Somebody told me that the one the pills will actually kerger

300
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.300
Jennífer castro: I thought it was the strips that did that. But I guess it's the pills.

301
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know which ones to yeah i i don't know which ones do. But I do know that people do have a preference on on

302
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which ones. You know that they like better, and some people I've heard like the pills better and some people like the strips better. So I think it's really an individual basis thing.

303
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.510
Jennífer castro: Because either way, kind of melt under your tongue so

304
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.930
Jennífer castro: Uh huh.

305
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it takes longer for the pills.

306
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.330
Jennífer castro: I bet brightest grocer

307
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And probably tastes more nasty. Yeah.

308
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:54.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it part of what it's supposed to do. The Suboxone with it naloxone in it is to help with the triggers and the cravings, so that they're more manageable.

309
00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I've also, you know, had people say that you know that they're not experiencing cravings, like they used to.

310
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.370
Jennífer castro: So I haven't been

311
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.580
Jennífer castro: I just think something triggered it or

312
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.040
Jennífer castro: Something that's what I think.

313
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We got to figure out what that trigger is so that we can squash it like a bug.

314
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know,

315
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we can identify it and squash it

316
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, because we want to keep you on this path right

317
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On this

318
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you got a grandbaby coming, you need to be present for you know that baby's birth.

319
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.880
Jennífer castro: Need to be there now.

320
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.590
Jennífer castro: I've been there all of them.

321
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:35.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

322
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nothing better about them.

323
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.500
Jennífer castro: EVEN THINK WE around each other at that

324
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:40.890
Point.

325
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.740
Jennífer castro: So,

326
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be nice if you were able to be up front and present all the time, you know,

327
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.170
Yeah.

328
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:50.640
Jennífer castro: Well,

329
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.940
Jennífer castro: I kind of pride myself on that I think

330
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

331
00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.780
Jennífer castro: But yeah, I don't know, I just because I don't feel like I'm doing good enough to be around them. Sometimes

332
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:18.240
Jennífer castro: Because what, what am I, kids will tell me how that I'm not another one, don't care, and then my youngest son's gone all the time. He works he's gone, five days a week. So he went. He is always with this girl and his other kids are step kids. So I don't see him much. Oh.

333
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

334
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you were

335
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:34.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 100% clean and had been for a while you're, you know, working on changing you know all the things that kept you in your addiction.

336
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that's what people would see

337
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is, you know, the effort that that you're putting in what you're trying to do, how you're, you know, trying to make the changes that you need to make to be able to stay on this path. You know what I mean.

338
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's been my experience that people are more open to give you the opportunity, you know, to be there versus

339
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, versus not. So there's that piece, you know,

340
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.810
Jennífer castro: I'm fine with parking sign language. My sister.

341
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.330
Jennífer castro: Okay.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.280
Jennífer castro: Okay.

344
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:31.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that piece to, you know, we want to we want to be able to identify your triggers so that we can put roadblocks in its path.

345
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.420
Jennífer castro: Before it gets to the point of view.

346
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.500
Jennífer castro: Sir, hey,

347
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.750
Jennífer castro: I know she talked about

348
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.110
Jennífer castro: Wanting to come on

349
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.210
Jennífer castro: Okay, I gotta go in here.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

354
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Life happens. It's all right.

355
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's kind of where we want to get. So the next time that you

356
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: feel the urge or the craving to use

357
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try to identify what

358
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What caused that that switch

359
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.390
Jennífer castro: Okay.

360
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, what's

361
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.750
Jennífer castro: My counselor, you

362
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.430
Jennífer castro: My mom.

363
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.480
Oh hi guy.

364
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.230
Jennífer castro: Yeah.

365
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.570
Jennífer castro: Okay.

366
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.220
Jennífer castro: So,

367
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, maybe that's the first step that we need to work on is really identifying you know what your triggers are

368
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that one can

369
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.770
Jennífer castro: What do you say he's like

370
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.120
Jennífer castro: Oh,

371
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.820
Jennífer castro: All right. I love you.

372
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.180
Jennífer castro: Know a house or who that okay

373
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:55.770
Jennífer castro: Okay.

375
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.610
Okay.

376
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:07.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so I think that that's the first thing that we need to start working on is identifying your triggers.

377
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so that we can manage your cravings and put roadblocks.

378
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.750
In our

379
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, things that that make you think about using thinking, thinking that that would be a good idea. Now remember that your disease lives inside your brain. Remember that

380
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it is it is a manipulator, and then it tells you all of the things that it knows that you need to hear in order to bring you back you know that can be working on your self esteem that can be working on your guilt that can be working on all of these

381
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things that you still have internally.

382
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're holding on to right

383
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

384
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:51.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: it'll grab ahold of you in any way that I possibly can. But the minute that you can identify that that's what's going on.

385
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're able to combat it a little bit and fight it.

386
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.620
Jennífer castro: Okay.

387
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

388
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:01.710
