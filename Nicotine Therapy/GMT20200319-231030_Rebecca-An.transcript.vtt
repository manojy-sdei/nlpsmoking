00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.290

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hello there.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.009
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hello, hear me. Oh.

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.880
I thought my

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Headphones work connecting up or something.

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.220
Matt Huss III: Okay, I'm

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.430
Matt Huss III: hanging in there I am, I'm struggling with

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.390
Matt Huss III: being stuck in the house, basically.

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.550
Matt Huss III: My, my only time I really enjoyed was

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.590
Matt Huss III: Going to campus and you know socializing and

11
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.570
Matt Huss III: Classes and stuff. That was my only real

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:05.310
Matt Huss III: Time that I enjoy part of the day that I, you know, really enjoy so on and and I don't think I probably told you but I told my vehicle I'm

13
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.600
Matt Huss III: A little while ago so

14
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.100
Matt Huss III: Sorry, I wanted to get one in

15
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.410
Matt Huss III: One sec.

16
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.210
Matt Huss III: Mr. We're

17
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.420
Matt Huss III: Moving

18
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.110
Matt Huss III: I just

19
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.810
Matt Huss III: Like when I

20
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.680
Matt Huss III: When I don't think about it, it's good. But I'm in group. Last night I almost broke down because I was like

21
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:10.980
Matt Huss III: I was telling me they were asking how everybody's doing. And I'm like, you know, I'm going crazy because of this, you know, like I just told you before,

22
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.870
Matt Huss III: And everybody else was like what are you talking about this is we get to stay home and do whatever we want all day and hang on. I have nothing to do

23
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.910
Matt Huss III: That like that's not I shut down. I, you know, over the weekend there was

24
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.920
Matt Huss III: Two or three days where I did just did not get out of bed, basically.

25
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.900
Matt Huss III: Yeah, um,

26
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.950
Matt Huss III: So, so yeah, so I'm having a hard time with that.

27
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.540
Matt Huss III: But

28
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did they make it in your area that you can't leave your house, unless it's a necessity.

29
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.890
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

30
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, taking a walk is a

31
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.300
Matt Huss III: Necessity and

32
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.740
Matt Huss III: It's only been a week.

33
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.530
Matt Huss III: For us, but

34
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.670
Matt Huss III: I guess it's just me like thinking about it and then like you know how I

35
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:21.270
Matt Huss III: Spiral and thing. Worst thing possible out of every option or outcome that could happen. I'm always assuming or

36
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.720
Yeah.

37
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

38
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.510
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so

39
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.390
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so maybe it's me, like, just like

40
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:43.470
Matt Huss III: Because I I already know from experience. If I'm you know stuck somewhere in a house or somewhere like you know without a vehicle and, you know,

41
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.080
Matt Huss III: I shut down and become depressed.

42
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.060
Matt Huss III: And so I'm like scaring myself into it. Basically, I don't know how else to explain it.

43
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I totally understand. But you've got to find things that you can do.

44
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the entry I'm of not being able to go to school, you know,

45
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Parents is can you take a walk.

46
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.110
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, it's just

47
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.750
Matt Huss III: Um,

48
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.920
Matt Huss III: I hate walks so much

49
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.630
Matt Huss III: Everything.

50
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.240
Matt Huss III: I've ever had. Is old need to take walks

51
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:41.250
Matt Huss III: You know i just i when i when I'm feeling up to it when I've been clean long enough, I start going to the gym and that like does wonders for me. But those are closed down now but

52
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.860
Matt Huss III: I just, I cannot stand walks like I will do it. If I have to get something that I absolutely need

53
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:59.190
Matt Huss III: Yeah, you know, but I need a purpose somewhere to go and then come back can't just walk around, you know, I don't know.

54
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable.

55
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understood. How was the sale going before all this happened.

56
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:16.140
Matt Huss III: Well, we haven't started it yet we're still cleaning up the house because he just owns so much random crap. It's unbelievable.

57
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

58
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.010
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so

59
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.820
Matt Huss III: You know, we've had a break for the last few days.

60
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.220
Matt Huss III: Because of

61
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:45.060
Matt Huss III: Just, you know, the sale date isn't until this upcoming weekend or something. So we've had a few days to relax and rest until but because of that I shut down and you know yeah myself into depression. Yeah.

62
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.610
Matt Huss III: So,

63
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:57.420
Matt Huss III: After a few days of that I forced myself to get up and work a little bit here and there, you know, on my real more on the house.

64
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.240
Matt Huss III: I'm working on essays that they're not do for like another two weeks now, because of the virus.

65
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.940
Matt Huss III: They extended, you know,

66
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.160
Matt Huss III: But it's, it helps to, you know, read and write at least if

67
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your mind busy.

68
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.450
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and and and I enjoy it because all my classes are philosophy.

69
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.160
Matt Huss III: Except for one of my philosophy classes is early modern so that's

70
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.450
Matt Huss III: A cop Descartes, through can't

71
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.610
Matt Huss III: You don't mind but

72
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.870
Matt Huss III: We're not up to him yet and I cannot stand all of them.

73
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:50.070
Matt Huss III: I just I just like that one class I'm so I hate, but it's still about as bad as math or chemistry or something.

74
00:06:51.750 --> 00:07:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah, I remember having some classes that I absolutely procrastinated on getting anything done because I had no interest in

75
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: what it was about. But, you know, we just gotta persevere right through it and do it anyway.

76
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He said that you know what I mean. Definitely.

77
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.920
Doing

78
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.970
Matt Huss III: You know, but I'm worried because that class, my other two

79
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:26.400
Matt Huss III: Got extended two extra weeks and nothing to do. And those are the two classes that I've been working on because I like the subject.

80
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.860
Matt Huss III: The one that I hate starts this Monday, I think.

81
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.410
Matt Huss III: The end of the real spring break if it was normal.

82
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.370
Matt Huss III: And it's all the classes are going to be online for the rest of the semester.

83
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.130
Matt Huss III: And I am

84
00:07:48.780 --> 00:08:01.440
Matt Huss III: Horrible at arm. I've tried, I tried taking an online course, once and I've never done it again because I was so not disciplined enough you know activated it too much. And yeah.

85
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.060
Matt Huss III: Plus

86
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.210
Matt Huss III: Us, like I said, my only

87
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.300
Matt Huss III: The only time I am

88
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:20.220
Matt Huss III: You know that my anxiety and depression doesn't shut me down enough where I'm able to go socialize is in class in school and stuff so

89
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, now you got to find alternatives to that you know that in person connection. What about. I know that you were talking about going on another date. What happened with that.

90
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:46.050
Matt Huss III: forgot all about it. Actually, it was doing it was supposed to be doing that weekend where I shut down and forgot all about it actually until you just mentioned it.

91
00:08:52.080 --> 00:09:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wasn't on the top of your top of your list, even if you guys together with one other person. You know what I mean is still a lot safer again.

92
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:18.270
Matt Huss III: I don't, I don't have like friends like that. No, I haven't been here long enough and the time that I have been here, it's been, I've had too bad of anxiety and depression. And because of recovering that I haven't actually made any friends. Sure.

93
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.630
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so there's nobody I can really, you know,

94
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.330
Matt Huss III: call and talk to you know

95
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.430
Matt Huss III: I've actually never I've no matter where I am. I've never, I never take the time to make friends. For some reason, because

96
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.910
Matt Huss III: I've always had

97
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.690
Matt Huss III: Any of my free time, I would spend with my wife, basically.

98
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.330
Matt Huss III: Or whoever I was with

99
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.330
Matt Huss III: Before that, so

100
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have this girl that you're supposed to have a date with

101
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.290
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and I

102
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:14.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mean it's like it's it's just really working within the boundaries that you know that you have to work with. And if it means you know what I mean, reaching out to the one person that

103
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you did have plans with

104
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just trying to even if it's just phone conversations or you know what I mean. But just keeping that piece.

105
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: on the forefront of your mind. You know what I mean.

106
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.410
Matt Huss III: But I, I, I hate the phone to I hate texting and talking on the phone like it's

107
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.850
Matt Huss III: self defeating or contradictory or whatever but

108
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just got to step out of your comfort zone, a little bit and you did pretty good on video chat.

109
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.980
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that this is actually been

110
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.440
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've never, I've never done video chat until this program actually

111
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:08.070
Matt Huss III: The first people I've ever talked to, well, since I moved here. I've done it a few times.

112
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.540
Matt Huss III: To see, you know, the kids and you know but besides that I've never actually

113
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.720
Matt Huss III: Spent time talking to somebody

114
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:29.910
Matt Huss III: I'm phone. Definitely not your by far the longest I've ever spent talking on the phone with somebody, let alone video chat.

115
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: While you're doing a great job. See, you can do it.

116
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:41.070
Matt Huss III: Well, yeah. Because, because I know I could say whatever I want to you or anything that comes into my head.

117
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:56.490
Matt Huss III: It's not, you know, I've finally it's taken years and years and it's taking well 20 years of relaxing and trying to clean. And finally, this time to

118
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:06.150
Matt Huss III: Get rid of that one that anxiety to talk, be able to talk to a therapist. You know,

119
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:14.910
Matt Huss III: The one person that you should should be able to talk to without anxiety. You know, it's taking 20 years to do that stuff.

120
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's it takes what it takes. Right.

121
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:28.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It does. It's about trying to do something different. And, you know, it makes me wonder

122
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just about what

123
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is the underlined reason that you don't connect with people like you.

124
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean what you heard in the past. Do you have abuse in your past. No.

125
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.590
Matt Huss III: But

126
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.480
Matt Huss III: I was extremely self absorbed.

127
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.360
Matt Huss III: Most of my life. I know that.

128
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.030
Matt Huss III: Were

129
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:11.160
Matt Huss III: You know, even in high school, I didn't have friends I had people who I partied with, you know,

130
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.440
Matt Huss III: So I've never really had a friend and I've moved to so often that I've never actually had a

131
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.360
Matt Huss III: Good friend.

132
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At a time that you could connect with somebody

133
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.390
Matt Huss III: Yeah, no, never not entire life.

134
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.900
Matt Huss III: Yeah, there's somebody that I would call you know my best friend, or a good friend, a real friend. Yeah.

135
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.940
Matt Huss III: I've never had that

136
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, maybe once you get moved and get settled that might, that might be something to explore

137
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.790
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah and and I started to try to

138
00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:01.260
Matt Huss III: When I first got here after a little while, of, you know, being clean. When I got here before I knew I was moving right back.

139
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.680
Matt Huss III: But the one person or anybody that

140
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:19.620
Matt Huss III: I would start connecting with, you know, the thing is to go grab a beer after class.

141
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.690
Matt Huss III: And

142
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:30.960
Matt Huss III: I can't do that. I have one or two beers and I'm like stupid drunk because of my anxiety medicine.

143
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

144
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.990
Matt Huss III: Um, and, and I'm too much of an attic to not have any beer.

145
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.070
Matt Huss III: With just a friend or something, you know,

146
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:42.870
Matt Huss III: So,

147
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's some good self actualization. You know what I mean.

148
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You stay away from the places that you know are risky places and you know that that one is risky.

149
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.550
Matt Huss III: And it's it's taken a long time to do that.

150
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.700
Matt Huss III: I did go out on one date.

151
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.200
Matt Huss III: To

152
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.830
Matt Huss III: You know this place. It's a brewery, but they have like games, you know,

153
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.030
Matt Huss III: Like basketball hoops and

154
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gain investors.

155
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.560
Matt Huss III: Like

156
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:16.200
Matt Huss III: That cornhole basically not not not as cool as that but you know

157
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.740
Matt Huss III: But still I couldn't help myself from having

158
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.980
Matt Huss III: You know, one or two many

159
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.930
Matt Huss III: Beers

160
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.410
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

161
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.600
Matt Huss III: Stop it, just one or two.

162
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that was your date that you went on a couple weeks ago.

163
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:46.860
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I wasn't, you know, I didn't make an ad out of myself like I used to.

164
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:47.760
Matt Huss III: I was able to

165
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.300
Matt Huss III: Stop eventually and actually eat something.

166
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.600
Matt Huss III: So progress there.

167
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.340
Matt Huss III: But now I still

168
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.590
Matt Huss III: Was

169
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.090
Matt Huss III: Yeah, but

170
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.170
Yeah.

171
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.600
Matt Huss III: No. Um, yeah, I tried it. I didn't get a chance to tell you

172
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:24.330
Matt Huss III: I don't think she ended up being way older than her profile or pictures let on. So that yeah so that

173
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.310
Matt Huss III: It it pissed me off, but

174
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.860
Matt Huss III: It ended up being a good time because I was not

175
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:47.040
Matt Huss III: You know, nervous or anxious in the whole time I was just like, whatever, I'm here, I might as well just enjoy myself and hang out with somebody, I wasn't trying to impress or, you know,

176
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

177
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.540
Well, I mean,

178
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.870
Matt Huss III: I can't help lock picking scabs and then making myself bleed.

179
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.690
Matt Huss III: Just cannot not do it.

180
00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's it.

181
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a nervous piece of it too. But also, did you ever use math.

182
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.000
Matt Huss III: I

183
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.550
Matt Huss III: That like right before moving out of Florida.

184
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:33.300
Matt Huss III: I tried it a couple times because this girl I was, you know, seeing was really bad, which I didn't she hid from me really well. I didn't know it, but she was so I've tried it a couple times, but

185
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.560
Matt Huss III: I was able, I moved before it became a problem or before I, you know, did it too many times where it became

186
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.160
Matt Huss III: You know, that was lucky actually

187
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, because that is definitely something that

188
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, it's, it's an obsession about about that. You know what I mean. And

189
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.730
Matt Huss III: I don't like because the one time I snorted it I hated it.

190
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.560
Matt Huss III: And you will never do it again.

191
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.420
Matt Huss III: But with this girl we

192
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.770
Matt Huss III: Her. She would shoot it up. So that's the way I tried it and that way is really great.

193
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:29.340
Matt Huss III: But it's only for you know 10 or 20 minutes, you know, for the rush. But yeah, so I don't really know the appeal in it. Unless, yeah.

194
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's why I was asking because sometimes we pick up when we have a history of methamphetamine use we pick up certain traits.

195
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That even in sobriety. We continue

196
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and picking is one of them. That's why I was asking.

197
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.570
Matt Huss III: Oh no, I've done that since I was a little kid.

198
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, boys.

199
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Boys. I love her.

200
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, always there. They've always yeah

201
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any young boys that I've ever known pick

202
00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.330
Matt Huss III: I think my scabs and my fingernails and my toenails instead of like cutting them.

203
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.060
Matt Huss III: Now you hear them for some reason. I don't know why.

204
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.050
Whole life.

205
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's so funny. I was just talking to somebody else about biting fingernails and the nervous. You know, it's a, it's just a nervous reaction, you know, we get in the habit, we get in the habit of doing those things. And that's how we continue to do them, you know, you have to consciously

206
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:34.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not and when you're, you know, when you're on autopilot. You're not conscious at all you know is do these things, no matter what because it's a habit. Right. Yeah.

207
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:46.980
Matt Huss III: It's definitely got Leah, if I didn't pick it up before I started my medication, then I'd probably be fine. But yeah, now it's just something I don't even think about it and I just do it. Yeah.

208
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you got to be conscious when you

209
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go and find yourself become aware that that's what you're doing. You know what I mean.

210
00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:03.270
Matt Huss III: The weird thing is I actually, to some extent, I actually enjoyed doing it like, especially in scab one. I don't know why.

211
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:11.430
Matt Huss III: Does it work. Yeah, it does. But I don't mind it. I don't mind the pain, you know,

212
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.550
Matt Huss III: I don't know, it's weird.

213
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, it's not really weird because you think about people that struggle with.

214
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With self harm.

215
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.210
Matt Huss III: Um,

216
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:34.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happens is they don't have to think about the things internally, because then they become focused on the things externally. The external pain becomes

217
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A relief some

218
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:44.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Focus on there's like a relief in that. And so that makes perfect sense, you know, to me,

219
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.860
Matt Huss III: Yeah, now I think of it.

220
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.230
Matt Huss III: does to me as well.

221
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:57.510
Matt Huss III: As far as the never wall. I'm thankful. I'd never, you know, did any real trick like Siri.

222
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:57.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

223
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.420
Matt Huss III: You know what I mean. Yeah.

224
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. And so what do you tell me some of the things that you can do while we're in this whole lockdown.

225
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: stuff that you can do that will help you get out of your head.

226
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:24.600
Matt Huss III: Well, reading and writing is one that but, and then I I love to paint, but I have to be

227
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:39.360
Matt Huss III: Like I've never painted, or really read to a good extent, you know, well I have since this time being clean. But really, I've never done any hobbies, unless I was

228
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.040
Matt Huss III: You know, pretty high on some kind of opiate

229
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.710
Matt Huss III: Where you know and then where I'd feel that I would get motivated enough to do something. I actually enjoy doing.

230
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.030
Matt Huss III: You mean like even right now. And when we get off the phone. I would I would

231
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:03.270
Matt Huss III: Love to be able to go paint something, you know, but I, I know I won't

232
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

233
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.670
Matt Huss III: You know, like

234
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.360
I think

235
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.490
Matt Huss III: There's no, there's no motivation, um,

236
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:22.230
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. I don't, I don't know what else I enjoy doing. That's, that's, that's another big thing is I've never picked up actually any hobbies, because of

237
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.230
Matt Huss III: My hobbies, have been

238
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.440
Matt Huss III: Just figuring out ways to alter my state of

239
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.390
Matt Huss III: My consciousness. Yeah.

240
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

241
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:49.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You had motivation to do that. And so it's really taking a look at that piece and saying, How can I motivate myself to find things that I like to do

242
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That give me pleasure, while I'm, you know, being in recovery.

243
00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:11.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that you have to replace it right you got to replace you know that piece of it because that artistic piece of news is still there. And it doesn't have to be medicated to come out. But you've got to be able to tap into it. And you know what I mean, and be motivated to tap into it.

244
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.480
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, I'm never, I never feel creative of my son.

245
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.640
Matt Huss III: I'm an opiate

246
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.840
Matt Huss III: Or on enough bentos one of the other or

247
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.520
Matt Huss III: You know out of my head.

248
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

249
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

250
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:29.910
I was like,

251
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:42.540
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I can't think of what to paint or like, you know, let alone feel like it but I can't even figure out what depending or what to write

252
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.320
Matt Huss III: One. Um, yeah, clean

253
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to start like and these are you know little suggestions that might help. But like

254
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:55.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you dream.

255
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.130
Matt Huss III: Very, very rarely

256
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:03.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do

257
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.680
Matt Huss III: I just started very once in a while.

258
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.110
Matt Huss III: Since I got clean

259
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.560
Matt Huss III: But I've never really in my life.

260
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:21.060
Matt Huss III: Until now that I'm cleaning my house. I have a couple times why

261
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, because you can definitely start there. Like when you get up in the morning.

262
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. What you drink.

263
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you monitor what your mind is telling you when you're sleeping. I mean, there's definitely you know a lot of telling in

264
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.600
Matt Huss III: The only ones that I can really think of right now, was literally

265
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.520
Matt Huss III: Being

266
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:58.800
Matt Huss III: So anxious or feeling like I'm supposed to be doing something that's it woke me up, you know, or it's all been very negative feelings. Well, I'm

267
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.020
Matt Huss III: Sure. Anytime I've dreamt

268
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, that will help process if if it is negative, that can help process that negativity to, you know,

269
00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you just

270
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Take two minutes when you get up and just write what your dream was and then close it.

271
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And don't touch it until the next time the dream, but you'll, you'll see this pattern within you know your subconscious in that manner.

272
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:40.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would be pretty amazing, you know, even if you wrote in a journal like in the beginning of recovery, you start writing in a journal. It doesn't have to be anything specific. But just your thoughts and your feelings and

273
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Throughout the first year of recovery, you can actually watch the difference

274
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your thought process and your feelings and the stability that comes throughout that process.

275
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.900
Matt Huss III: It's kind of amazing. That's actually. Yeah, sounds very inspiring.

276
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.540
Matt Huss III: That actually might motivate me to write a journal or something.

277
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe take a tablet, or if you had a

278
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: folder that you could just jot it down. You know what I mean, good and bad.

279
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:18.030
Matt Huss III: Please, somebody last Christmas all my birthdays Christmas Eve. So I'm not sure what

280
00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:18.960
It was for

281
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.870
Matt Huss III: People just give me one gift for both now.

282
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:23.580
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

283
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.060
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

284
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:35.310
Matt Huss III: Every book i i i get spent the same amount of money on then everybody else.

285
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.910
Matt Huss III: Gets twice a year, I get one.

286
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Change, for sure.

287
00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.420
Matt Huss III: That never used to happen, but it did once a year old.

288
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:46.950
Matt Huss III: But

289
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.170
Matt Huss III: Um, somebody just wanted somebody

290
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.980
Matt Huss III: Close to me, gave me a

291
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.840
Matt Huss III: Actually they talked about it beforehand. My daughter bought me this.

292
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.380
Matt Huss III: One of those quill pens.

293
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:15.690
Matt Huss III: Mm hmm. So cool. It's like so cool. I don't even want to use it you know it came with a little bottle of ink, you know, really big white feather.

294
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:22.530
Matt Huss III: But anyways, and so the other person bought me this really nice leather bound journal. That's like

295
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.150
Matt Huss III: I will. I can't show you but

296
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.150
Matt Huss III: It's perfect. It would be perfect for that.

297
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can be pulled him out.

298
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.520
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

299
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Times are using them, you know,

300
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just monitor your thought but it's it's it's amazing. Like I have journals that I did, you know,

301
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:54.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My first year. And I'll tell you what, it's amazing because for me when I read it. It's like, oh my god, I was really thinking in that manner.

302
00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And then to see the difference, you know, to be an inconsistency. First off, because it helps us get motivated. It helps us be consistent. It helps us get our feelings and our thoughts out good and bad.

303
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you could actually I could actually watch going from this chaos.

304
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:22.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, to you know to normalcy, and it was almost like that. It's like watching yourself from the outside in.

305
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instead of inside out.

306
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:38.310
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's, that's actually what I find most interesting about him. What might actually motivate me to do it is that long term goal of being able to see how my mind went from, you know,

307
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.860
Matt Huss III: Now to

308
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.400
Matt Huss III: You know when I actually

309
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you get to a year.

310
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.490
Matt Huss III: He. Well, it's been about a year now and I'm still just as

311
00:28:51.690 --> 00:29:00.900
Matt Huss III: Messed up as anybody is, you know, mentally, but, um, so hopefully in a couple of years. I don't

312
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.590
Know,

313
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm just gonna throw a few things out there. You are not as messed up is what you think you are.

314
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Number one.

315
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's just in the time that I have been working with you. I can tell you, you are not as messed up as what you think you are, I think you don't

316
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.730
Matt Huss III: Do that.

317
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.870
Matt Huss III: That's not true.

318
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

319
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you and I first started talking, you were very

320
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're very kind of guarded a little bit but your, your thought process was very. This is the only way I can explain it.

321
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like this.

322
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:46.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Compared to to where you are now. And you've got to give yourself credit for that progress that you've made because you have

323
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, you don't see it. You don't feel it. It's there.

324
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:52.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

325
00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.330
Matt Huss III: It'll be nice when I actually feel it.

326
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it's one way for you to be able to monitor it and see see things from a different perspective to

327
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.020
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

328
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that

329
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.320
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that sounds really cool man.

330
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:27.420
Matt Huss III: Yeah, if I can motivate my dad. Yeah, that might be the first thing that you know because I don't do one thing every day.

331
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.130
Matt Huss III: You know anything

332
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:36.570
Matt Huss III: Shave, you know, yeah. Yeah, nothing except go to the bathroom and sleep.

333
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.420
Matt Huss III: The only things I could think of. And I do at the same time every day.

334
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:42.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every day.

335
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.090
Matt Huss III: Every day you know

336
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. The basic

337
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.590
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so there's gotta be something I start something somewhere. I gotta start

338
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.120
Matt Huss III: That makes some kind of routine or consistency.

339
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.170
Yeah.

340
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what a perfect time

341
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.270
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

342
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you're not in school and you're still doing papers, but you get to slow down the pace on those

343
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

344
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have all this free time right now and you're going stir crazy

345
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know what a great time for you to be able to start building on a routine that

346
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can possibly last you even when you go back into school

347
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.770
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's true.

348
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

349
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely you just got to take that first step in and do it that one time and then after you do it that one time. Then the second time becomes easier.

350
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

351
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:52.920
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

352
00:31:53.160 --> 00:32:12.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I want to point out also that you know your first year of recovery, your first year. This past year, you know, have you been working on changing your thought process or managing your emotions or have you just been kind of going with the flow and staying sober, day by day.

353
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.470
Matt Huss III: I have

354
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.250
Matt Huss III: I worked with therapist before you, which took

355
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:41.610
Matt Huss III: Like six months, even to just start talking to. That's why it took. That's the only reason it took so quick for me to open up with you because I I it, it took six to eight months just to not just sit there, you know, and actually talk

356
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:50.490
Matt Huss III: But and and I have been working on become more and more self aware

357
00:32:52.260 --> 00:33:05.370
Matt Huss III: You know, things that I say that might be hypocritical or, you know, just I have been doing things to better me as a person, as far as

358
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.980
Matt Huss III: Like

359
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.050
Matt Huss III: Well, what what is possible to do when

360
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:27.120
Matt Huss III: You're alone or just your father's around, you know. So not much, but I, yeah, the more especially, the more I read philosophy and stuff, that helps.

361
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:33.840
Matt Huss III: Open up my mind and think. Try to think differently and

362
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.120
Matt Huss III: think differently about things that I never would have before.

363
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But so again.

364
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.810
Matt Huss III: I'm not, I'm not as much as I could or should you know

365
00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.430
Matt Huss III: What you are

366
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:58.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's, that's another piece of it is that. You've just identified things that you are working on and that you are doing. You know what I mean. And

367
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:10.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know humans. It's human nature to to really focus on what we're not doing or you know what what we don't have versus, you know what, we do have and what we are doing.

368
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:21.960
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I really believe x x or x press people are, you know, messed up in the head people. You know what I mean like are more

369
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:41.610
Matt Huss III: Wise if they do come out of it ever and become clean and normal. They're a lot more. They're definitely way more self aware. Yeah, most people and and but I still that that brings up another thing I know it's kind of off topic, but

370
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:52.650
Matt Huss III: I'm still in a you know that phase they call divorce stage, I guess, or that stage where

371
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.020
Matt Huss III: You know, I, I feel like I'm never going to feel as good as I did.

372
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.030
Matt Huss III: That's one part

373
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:09.150
Matt Huss III: It's like nothing again in my entire life you know even sex is never going to feel as good as

374
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.600
Matt Huss III: You know, shooting up

375
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.930
Matt Huss III: oxycodone

376
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.940
Matt Huss III: But the thing I was thinking of is

377
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:32.670
Matt Huss III: Just getting up every day to go to work. I think I've said this actually kind of same thing is scares the hell out of me.

378
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:33.810
Matt Huss III: You know,

379
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.300
Matt Huss III: That that just constant monotony.

380
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.190
Matt Huss III: Of life.

381
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:53.040
Matt Huss III: As has scared the hell out of me for a long time. And I think that a big reason I've used as an excuse or justification or not even

382
00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:01.830
Matt Huss III: That might be much deeper than that naturally have used because of it you know of out of

383
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.170
Matt Huss III: A FEAR OF

384
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.230
Matt Huss III: Yeah, it's a very existential crises kind of thing.

385
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:13.170
Matt Huss III: But

386
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.470
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that, that, that

387
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.970
Matt Huss III: That

388
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:29.910
Matt Huss III: There's still there's still aspects of me, where if I have the chance to alter my consciousness in some way. I will take it so now

389
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:38.550
Matt Huss III: Once in a while. It's become very, very rare, like, oh, which is real progress.

390
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.190
Matt Huss III: Like I've made I've made.

391
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:49.260
Matt Huss III: Bounds of, you know, strides, whatever you aren't call it in that area. But, um,

392
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.370
Matt Huss III: Yeah, there's still

393
00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:02.040
Matt Huss III: Things that scare me about becoming normal, I guess. Sure.

394
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, okay. So first off, you're never going to be normal.

395
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're always going to struggle with, with an addicted brain right

396
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

397
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.360
Matt Huss III: Would like to go away.

398
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.350
Matt Huss III: One day away. Well,

399
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so if we have this mindset that are addicted brain.

400
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is a burden, then we can never get out of that cycle of that's what it is, but I believe 100% you're right that people that become

401
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:54.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Struggle with addiction, whether it be something because they are predisposed to it by their generational factors in our family or environment, whatever it is, I believe that we are the most smartest, we are the most self aware

402
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Compassionate people that there are

403
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:14.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we have a step up of people that claim to be normal. Because what is normal. These days, right, if there's no Leave It to Beaver foundation anymore, you know, to begin that's gone white picket fence is gone. You know what I mean.

404
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the great part about it is, people that that live every day and don't experience that inner change that has to happen when we struggle with addiction, they never get the opportunity to have the self evaluation.

405
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or to learn how to be 100% honest.

406
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or

407
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to really

408
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be comfortable in their own skin become comfortable in their own skin. So the issues that they have they're unaware that there's another way to live.

409
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.560
Matt Huss III: Yeah, but I wonder if you know that saying ignorance is bliss, you know,

410
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:10.350
Matt Huss III: I wonder if you know, normal people, you know, even though they're, you know, a lot of them are hypocritical and very, very unselfish where most like 90% of people say

411
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.380
Matt Huss III: Are very on self aware

412
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.930
Matt Huss III: But they have no clue. They, you know, they

413
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:26.130
Matt Huss III: They enjoy their life for their work, you know, or, you know, the people that do enjoy their, their work.

414
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.230
Matt Huss III: Or even the people that don't enjoy their work, they still

415
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.100
Matt Huss III: are okay with doing it.

416
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.950
Matt Huss III: Just everything everything yeah and

417
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.200
Matt Huss III: But they don't know any different. So

418
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's this whole piece.

419
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That if you've never experienced pain you've never experienced love

420
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about it in those

421
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:03.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Terms about people don't live these lives that are okay and being ignorant, they've never really lived

422
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, we've had the opportunity and the experience to be in the most excruciating pain, ever, but also to appreciate

423
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The small things in life that they take for granted.

424
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:23.760
Matt Huss III: And I, and I tell myself that a lot, and I've experienced it where you know even if I'm

425
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.020
Matt Huss III: Not when I'm shut down depressed. But when I'm

426
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:43.050
Matt Huss III: Sad or even sad or hurt or something. But I'm not shut down from my, you know, depression or anxiety symptoms like you know those things.

427
00:40:43.980 --> 00:41:04.230
Matt Huss III: I still let enjoy it because I'm I feel something. I'm not just numb. And I wonder if that's kind of, you know, because we've had such highs and such lows. You know that's that's basically what scares me to like about it is those, you know, normal people.

428
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:18.750
Matt Huss III: They don't know, like you said, they don't know what real love is because they've never truly been, you know, hurt or they don't really truly know what happiness is, you know what I'm saying.

429
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:19.980
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and

430
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:30.060
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and and so that that's that that's what I mean by bait. Yeah. Basically, it scares me to be that consistent

431
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.720
Matt Huss III: I oh I was on this medication on time for

432
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.140
Matt Huss III: They get for bipolar illness.

433
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.130
Matt Huss III: And

434
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:44.520
Matt Huss III: I was my shrink just we just, it was just something we tried one time.

435
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:57.630
Matt Huss III: And it made me a zombie like no emotion. No, like I didn't even laugh at funny stuff for comedy movies. I was just a zombie and

436
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:11.100
Matt Huss III: You know, I got rid of it. I just stopped taking it as, you know, very, very soon after feeling that way because and that's what scares me about

437
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.460
Matt Huss III: You know, staying

438
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.730
Matt Huss III: Clean and boring.

439
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.670
Matt Huss III: You know what I mean not boring but

440
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:24.900
Matt Huss III: You know that it's kind of

441
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.050
Matt Huss III: I'm scared to get off that roller coaster that sometimes

442
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.680
Yeah.

443
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:33.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense.

444
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, your life is just

445
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:45.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just beginning in so many different areas. And when you become comfortable in your own skin.

446
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're able to combat the negativity that goes on inside your head.

447
00:42:52.110 --> 00:43:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And take a look at. Take a look at yourself from another perspective, you start becoming okay with who you are and the more that you become okay with who you are, the more you start accepting who you are.

448
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that piece and you are in a grief grief cycle with, you know, with your drug of choice with you're using

449
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:32.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it was a coping skill for a very long time, and it has been, you know, it's not there any longer. And you've got to find other avenues that can fill its spot and nothing's ever going to fill it the way that it did.

450
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:45.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But when you take a look at, you know, being under the influence and feeling that that was the great way to be is because you're not looking at the downside of

451
00:43:45.840 --> 00:44:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The whole thing to say it's good for me. I feel like the abuse cycle is a lot like the addictive cycle, right. So why people one question about you, about people that stay in abusive relationships. Why do they stay. Why do we keep getting high. So here's the deal.

452
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.170
Matt Huss III: That a woman that's got

453
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.810
Matt Huss III: That gets beaten by her husband, wife,

454
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.400
Matt Huss III: Day. Yeah.

455
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.490
Matt Huss III: The whole yeah

456
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's that hope that it's going to get better. This is just a moment in time. And there's a fear of being without that person, regardless of how they're treating you. Same thing with your drug

457
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.950
Matt Huss III: You know know instead of the devil. You don't know. Yeah.

458
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:41.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so there's that piece, but they're always hoping that it's going to change and get better. Right. And they forget the bad that they've been experiencing in that relationship.

459
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:54.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's a piece of it is that you have to, you can always remember the good times that you have, because you know every person that has become addicted to something always had good times for cereals and would have more than

460
00:44:54.750 --> 00:45:08.430
Matt Huss III: One, why do we, why do we, why are we always missing those and never not thinking about how horrible it has made our lives, you know, or how horrible it has made us feel at times.

461
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.180
Matt Huss III: Or

462
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:13.740
Matt Huss III: You know, miserable or how sick or in jail or

463
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:19.110
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that that's, yeah, that when I was going through that whole thing of, you know,

464
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:31.740
Matt Huss III: Missing the highs and lows. I was thinking I was just thinking about the highs, you know, and not thinking about just, I was thinking about lows, but not not the you don't

465
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:42.510
Matt Huss III: Like brain doesn't allow you to think about just how low you did go you know just just let you go to the low that you're okay with buddy.

466
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.410
Matt Huss III: Yeah, you just thought you totally don't think about

467
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:48.810
The real bad.

468
00:45:50.070 --> 00:46:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's an important piece that you have to make yourself bring up you know when you start having those thoughts of it and that fear around, you know, not having it anymore. But you really got to think about what how bad it really got

469
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and put yourself back in that piece to realize that you started this whole process for a reason.

470
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

471
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the reason

472
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:26.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the memories are cool and they're there, and they'll always be there. But, you know, going back into it. The misery is just waiting for you to

473
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

474
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are you going to do this week.

475
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.570
Matt Huss III: Start a journal

476
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:48.000
Matt Huss III: Try not to. Well, it's a good thing. I'm not. I'm pro gun control. So chance me blow my brains out.

477
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:50.700
Matt Huss III: From

478
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:53.850
Matt Huss III: being trapped in here.

479
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.410
Matt Huss III: That's just

480
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

481
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:58.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah.

482
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.600
Matt Huss III: That was, that was a joke. So

483
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.870
Matt Huss III: I forget sometimes who I'm talking to the thing you have to like, you know,

484
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We would have to do a whole safety plan around that if you're

485
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.900
Matt Huss III: Sorry about that.

486
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.300
Matt Huss III: Oh god. What else was it um

487
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.800
Matt Huss III: Whenever I think about

488
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:33.930
Matt Huss III: You know, getting afraid of being normal. I have to think about the real lows.

489
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:39.360
Matt Huss III: That have that it has. I've been through.

490
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:58.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It even if you write it down like in your journal, you know, don't focus on the good points but focus on the, the, the, the ways that it has hurt or hindered your life. Write them down. And when you start, start getting in that fear of not having it read it.

491
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:06.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's what's waiting and you have to remember. Matthew that you're that addiction, has one job.

492
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that it's to take you out.

493
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the bottom line, you know, they talked about jails institutions of death at the end of it, and that is the reality of where it goes.

494
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean,

495
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:27.600
Matt Huss III: Why, why is that an aspect of our brain chemistry. I wonder

496
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:29.550
Matt Huss III: Like

497
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:40.560
Matt Huss III: This, you know, nobody can answer that, you know, and if made might never be able to or someday they will, but for sure, but who knows I'm just curious why

498
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to research and

499
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.250
Matt Huss III: Why we are so yeah self defeating sometimes and so

500
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:56.490
Matt Huss III: Yeah, but oh and I'm trying to eat healthier, but not going as well as, oh, but trying to

501
00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At least you're trying. Right. That's all you can do is try and when we fail at trying something one day we get up a we try again the next day.

502
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until we get it right, just like being in sobriety, you know, relapse can be a part of someone's story right you get up and you do it again, you get up and you do it again until something sticks and you're able to do it.

503
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:26.100
Matt Huss III: Right, yeah. Yeah, I wanna, I want to start a

504
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:45.480
Matt Huss III: Normal sleep pattern where I go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time. And then as soon as I wake up, you know, take a shower, get dressed brush my teeth, instead of but that one is going to be hard being stuck in the house now, I think I'll start that one when we're not

505
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:46.980
Matt Huss III: Sure.

506
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.930
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

507
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just those little

508
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.880
Matt Huss III: Try to paint. Honestly, but it's all packed.

509
00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.190
Matt Huss III: Away now in the storage unit. So

510
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would rather you right just start

511
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.240
Matt Huss III: Writing. Yeah.

512
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, right, a list of the negative things that you're use brought into your life. So you have that in the forefront and then write every day and I really want you to also identify some some positive good things about yourself.

513
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:27.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I believe that that is a huge issue to

514
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That really drives a lot of fear.

515
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:45.360
Matt Huss III: Yeah, cuz i mean i i tried to tell myself, stuff like that. And I don't truly, I don't think I truly believe it, you know, even when somebody says it to me or about me. I don't

516
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.070
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

517
00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yet

518
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You put that in your vocabulary yet.

519
00:50:53.310 --> 00:51:08.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a process. All right. It is a process when we have had this negative image of ourselves for so long that it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to be something that you have to continually work at. And I'll help you work at it. I hope you but

520
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.060
Matt Huss III: Well, old may 15 apparently

521
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

522
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: During our session.

523
00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll cram it and I'll create during a recession, but it's vitally important that you realize the good

524
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:30.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you read, you remember the bad of your addiction and where it took you

525
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:35.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you remember the good of Matthew, because there's a lot of good

526
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot of good

527
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's gonna come a point in time where you're going to be able to look me in the eyes when I say that before our time is done working together.

528
00:51:51.780 --> 00:52:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, because it's important that you grab ahold of that. And it's important that you identify those good things within yourself.

529
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I bet you that if you got your daughter on the phone, your daughter can definitely give you a list of good things about her dad.

530
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:20.970
Matt Huss III: They would still totally not outweigh the bad so done much more

531
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not asking you to outweigh the bad I'm

532
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not asking it out way that what I'm asking.

533
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For you to do is to identify period to first step.

534
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just to identify

535
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mr philosopher

536
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.850
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm sorry.

537
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.470
Matt Huss III: About that.

538
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.870
As well.

539
00:52:53.340 --> 00:53:01.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So every time that we get together. I'm going to give you some positive affirmations to think about. All right.

540
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:19.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because Matthew him. You know, I've worked with you for for a little while and you know you're good, good human being you care about people, you know, you're hard worker. You definitely are doing the best that you can do as far as school goes and

541
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I see with your roommate over there.

542
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you're pretty good friend.

543
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As well and just those basic qualities that I just mentioned are hard to come by for people

544
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

545
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anytime that you have a negative thought about yourself about who you are or who you're becoming

546
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to remember that.

547
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There lies. They're not true.

548
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:54.150
Matt Huss III: That's just something I just don't think about it at all.

549
00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:03.990
Matt Huss III: That might be one of those things that it will happen. You know what, I'm always anxious, even though I'm dedicated

550
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.690
Matt Huss III: But I can't pinpoint

551
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.560
Matt Huss III: I can never pinpoint what I'm anxious about maybe it's just that's

552
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.830
Matt Huss III: One of those things that I'm bottling down, you know,

553
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is definitely

554
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It definitely is. And so, you know, let's let's work on these things so that we can kind of, you know, get you to a point of acceptance, you know,

555
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you willing to work with me on it.

556
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:40.230
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, I've come, actually that's that's progress that I've made. I'm actually

557
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:44.880
Matt Huss III: Trying to

558
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:48.120
Matt Huss III: And willing to

559
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:53.190
Matt Huss III: Work on myself. I've never ever done.

560
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To get busy.

561
00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:58.560
Matt Huss III: Okay.

562
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we have, you have a couple things to do. And so, next week when we get together.

563
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want you to

564
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:12.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me how your progresses with your journaling and it's something simple. So your don't become overwhelmed with

565
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With this stuff because you got school and you are, you've got homework and you've got, you know, this packing and stuff, but I really want you to pull your journal out if you would please and

566
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

567
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:26.520
Matt Huss III: Like

568
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:32.910
Matt Huss III: I feel like if I have a like I'll get overwhelmed. If I feel like I have to write a page or at least

569
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:34.410
Matt Huss III: You don't

570
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.140
Matt Huss III: There's no one thing I'll do it myself.

571
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.740
Matt Huss III: But

572
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:38.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't have to

573
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.180
Matt Huss III: You know,

574
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:40.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't have to write a page.

575
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.730
I'm not asking

576
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You

577
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you have thoughts.

578
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, that that

579
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:56.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In one sentence perfectly okay but it is a beginning of a pattern that we're going to try to create

580
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:05.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. If you don't feel like writing and you just want to write not feeling it today, totally okay.

581
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

582
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:15.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no worry about disappointment. There's no worry about not being good enough. There's no worry about

583
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:26.070
Matt Huss III: Help if I'm not. If I don't if I really don't feel like it and really cannot do it. Does it help if I just write that down.

584
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.060
Matt Huss III: Yes, right.

585
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nope it, there is a point to it. And it's because it still gets you in the habit.

586
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:40.200
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, I can see how yeah okay

587
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:54.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you have days that go by that say, and you put in there. I'm not feeling it. I'm not feeling it might be three or four days later, where you do feel it and you are able to write, but it's just beginning, that that habit.

588
00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay.

589
00:56:58.830 --> 00:56:59.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Feel yeah

590
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, alright. So, I will see you next week, same time, same place. Mm hmm. All right, and in the meantime.

591
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get out of your head. Okay.

592
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.870
Matt Huss III: Always trying to

593
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Say,

594
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Philosophy has got some some really great

595
00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:31.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Readings on self awareness and on why we think

596
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:39.180
Matt Huss III: It's so it's so hard to find real stuff and then that like self help stuff, you know,

597
00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:39.870
Yeah.

598
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:52.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did you can decipher it. That's another piece of it because they're the wording and the writing of it is so different than normal writing that you have to concentrate on what it's telling you

599
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I remember I went there for

600
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.440
