00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.540
Kyle Smith: Tell me why you are seeking help with bright heart health.

31
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.530
Well,

32
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.810
Matthew dille: I had tried in the past, but I never really had enough money to try to get help with it. And in the past, whenever I've stopped doing opiates, it's because I went to jail or prison.

33
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.660
Matthew dille: Able to stop then obviously, because you don't have much choice, but it's I've never been able to accomplish it on the streets.

34
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:08.040
Matthew dille: Stopping because I've never had to help you know Suboxone or anything like that. No time I've ever got to take some boxes, you know, buying it off the streets, obviously, and trying to trying to do it that way, but it never works because you always run out.

35
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.120
Matthew dille: You know me, I'm not. I'm

36
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:25.380
Matthew dille: Not on set set, you know, you don't have it whenever you can always get it on the streets, you know, but I just think that and I've got a family and stuff. I'm trying to not lose everything right. The second I'm getting pretty close to losing everything and

37
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.730
Matthew dille: I know that this is the only way that I'm going to be able to get it back together as if I can try to seek help this way and and

38
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.620
Matthew dille: You know,

39
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.410
Matthew dille: Save. Everything is just right at the last, the last second right now if I don't do something right. The second, I'm going to lose everything so

40
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.400
Kyle Smith: Matthew, tell me you give me a brief drug history. When did you start using drugs. What were you using

41
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.640
Matthew dille: Um, well I I smoke pot. When I was younger, in my teens and then

42
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.360
Matthew dille: I've dabbled with a little bit of this and that just not much not really getting hooked. And then here about 810 years ago I got

43
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.230
Matthew dille: Moved up here and got kind of hooked on pills never really been into him before. And then I got hooked on them and they're just a hard thing to kick, especially if you don't have any

44
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:30.090
Matthew dille: You know that you can. It's just really hard to just stop doing, um, you know, you can have it set your head, don't you, but it's really hard to just quit doing, you know,

45
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.500
Kyle Smith: Cold turkey, so to speak. Yeah, okay, what pills are you taking

46
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.910
Matthew dille: Open is

47
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.780
Kyle Smith: Okay, what do you remember what dosage and how much

48
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.930
Kyle Smith: When I when you were using the most

49
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.010
Matthew dille: Well i one point in time, a long time ago I I could do. It's hard to believe, but probably 640 hours in a day.

50
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.860
Matthew dille: Okay 640 milligrams

51
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.840
Kyle Smith: 20 milligrams. Okay.

52
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.170
Matthew dille: Not that point right now, but I'm have been that bad.

53
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:16.530
Kyle Smith: And so was it just kind of a progression from marijuana and other drugs to the to the opiates, or did you have surgery where you were prescribed some opiates or anything like that.

54
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.080
Matthew dille: But I did have some teams work done and kind of got that's probably where the ball started rolling

55
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.600
Matthew dille: Okay then teeth and I just kind of moved on from like hydrocodone Parker sets.

56
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.830
Matthew dille: Up.

57
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:42.270
Matthew dille: Okay, seem to be the thing everybody was doing at the time I'd never really been into it and I just kind of just snowball effect. And next thing you know your pill sick and you're, you know, you're figuring out what what withdrawals are horrible.

58
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.710
Kyle Smith: Sure. When was your last opiate use

59
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.580

63
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:12.060
Matthew dille: Yeah, taking it on the streets. I've gotten a couple strips from somebody, and I was able to quit for a couple of days.

64
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.640
Kyle Smith: To get rid of the withdrawals.

65
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.650
Kyle Smith: Right, okay.

66
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.740
Matthew dille: And, you know, after I ran out. I just went right back to the to the pills, because you know you don't have

67
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:37.560
Matthew dille: A supply of, you know, if I had a constant splash box and I could stop noon, you know and feel good and be in and be able to save everything but right now I'm, I'm really hoping that you can help me.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.360

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.790
Kyle Smith: And have you had any recent blood work.

176
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.310
Kyle Smith: Any

177
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.510
Kyle Smith: Any benzo use recently.

178
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:46.200
Kyle Smith: All right, Matthew. Well, I think we got a good kind of medical history there and let me just tell you a little bit about

179
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.040
Kyle Smith: This whole process is called MIT or

180
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.700
Kyle Smith: medication assisted treatment. I think you would benefit from some medication.

181
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.700
Kyle Smith: It sounds like you've had

182
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.980
Kyle Smith: A PRETTY, PRETTY LONG HISTORY OF opiate use

183
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:13.170
Kyle Smith: And you can meet all the classic signs and symptoms for opioid dependence.

184
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:30.120
Kyle Smith: Because when you when you stop them. You go into withdrawal between now know is a is a flu like syndrome, you know, headache, runny nose, stomach upset, muscle aches, etc, etc.

185
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:48.000
Kyle Smith: And you know, I think it's good that that you that you understand that that's a problem. That means that you have something that we call insight into your condition you have kids at home that you want to take care of. And I think that's that's commendable.

186
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:55.440
Kyle Smith: And so, so what I think I'd like to do is get you get you on some Suboxone

187
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:13.530
Kyle Smith: And let you sort of initiate this process of medication assisted treatment with us here at bright heart health, generally, what we do is when someone's starting program.

188
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:28.230
Kyle Smith: From the beginning is I'll see you pretty frequently maybe once a week at the beginning and then as we go along and and we get to know each other, and you're doing well on the medication will space those meetings out

189
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.560
Kyle Smith: In conjunction with the medication that that will will use

190
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:46.860
Kyle Smith: Bright heart health will help me provide you with some counseling services and of course this is all done via telemedicine to help you talk through some things like

191
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.560
Kyle Smith: How to Prevent relapses how to think about your treatment.

192
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.270
Kyle Smith: How to

193
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:05.370
Kyle Smith: How to to get through this process and hopefully improve your quality of life, because that's what this whole treatment process is about

194
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:16.800
Kyle Smith: And, you know, so that you can do the things that you enjoy and take care of your family as far as the medication goes, it sounds like you've taken it before.

195
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:27.930
Kyle Smith: Suboxone is is what's called a partial opioid agonist, which means that it binds to the same receptors as the OH panna that you're taking

196
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.260
Kyle Smith: But at a lower

197
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.170
Kyle Smith: Has a lower chance of

198
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:48.420
Kyle Smith: Making you, you know, feel that you for sort of high feeling, but because it's sitting in that same receptor. It's not gonna it's you're not going to go into withdrawal. If you don't have the Japan. Okay.

199
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:48.840
Right.

200
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.700
Kyle Smith: So,

201
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:58.680
Kyle Smith: What we'll do initially, it is. I'll do you remember how much you took before when you were buying them.

202
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.140
Matthew dille: Phone call

203
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.700
Matthew dille: No, I don't really call it was before it was

204
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.540
Matthew dille: Going to doctors minute

205
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.000
Matthew dille: I'm taking care of them and

206
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.960
Matthew dille: I spent that I know I'm just

207
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.150
Matthew dille: Sorry.

208
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.880
Kyle Smith: I'm sorry buddy. I'll get you

209
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.930
Kyle Smith: I'll get you fixed. So, so what we're gonna do is

210
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.080
Kyle Smith: I'm gonna have you take

211
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.430
Kyle Smith: I'm going to have you take some films. Some Suboxone films.

212
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.700
Kyle Smith: And what I want you to do is take the first film. What time did you take the pan of this morning.

213
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:52.800
Matthew dille: Phobos

214
00:21:53.610 --> 00:22:14.010
Kyle Smith: 3530 okay so probably by the time you get off work your prescription should be ready and that'll be about 12 hours or so I want you to wait to take the first knows when you're having some symptoms when you start feeling so withdrawal symptoms.

215
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:29.700
Kyle Smith: That way that we know that the Japan is leaving your body and that the Suboxone will go in there and start to act pretty quickly. You should feel better within about an hour. You're going to put it, but the the film under your tongue and let it dissolve.

216
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.100
Kyle Smith: It's going to go straight into the bloodstream.

217
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:39.390
Kyle Smith: And help reduce those withdrawal and cravings that you that you would develop if you didn't have anything. Okay.

218
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.500
Kyle Smith: So you're in

220
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:07.950
Kyle Smith: Yeah, Matthew, I would I would direct you to the care coordinator for those questions.

221
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:16.800
Kyle Smith: Each each visit costs a different amount. I know the initial visit probably cost a little bit more than the subsequent visits.

279
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.900
Kyle Smith: Um, it can

280
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.550
Kyle Smith: Have a an additive effect when you take both those together and

281
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.470
Kyle Smith: Just slow your breathing down and you

282
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.140
Kyle Smith: Have a high risk of overdose. Okay.

283
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.840
Kyle Smith: The side effects.

284
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.190
Kyle Smith: From Suboxone

285
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.170
Kyle Smith: The common things

286
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.570
Kyle Smith: Are headache constipation. Okay.

287
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.080
Kyle Smith: Of course, if you have any any weird

288
00:27:47.520 --> 00:28:05.520
Kyle Smith: Alarming symptoms like shortness of breath you break out rash start swell and I want you to call 911. Okay, any other problems with your medication. I want you to, you can call right heart health, call the care coordinators and if it's something that I need to address, they can find me.

Kyle Smith: The care coordinators are going to assign you to a group. Okay. For count for some counseling and they we can we can we have so many different groups, there'll be able to hopefully work around your schedule and your work schedule.

292
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.080
Kyle Smith: I think it's important that you're working and I'm gonna let you go here and just SEC because I know you got to get back

293
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:29.250
Matthew dille: There.

294
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:41.790
Kyle Smith: My experience people who do well with this, with this program, Matthew, are people like yourself who have a job and have a purpose. I think working is very important.

295
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:54.420
Kyle Smith: They have a support system at home, he sounds like you've got kids who you love and who love you, I think that will that will help you as well. Do you have someone else at home that you can talk to

296
00:28:55.290 --> 00:29:08.520
Kyle Smith: Yes. Okay. All right. Um, and then and then some medication. I mean, the overall goal here initially is to prevent you from from going into withdrawal.

297
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:23.190
Kyle Smith: Okay, right. And the medication that's that's the number one goal of the medication is to reduce cravings and withdrawal. It does that very well over these first couple weeks. Our goal is to just get the dose right

298
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.480
