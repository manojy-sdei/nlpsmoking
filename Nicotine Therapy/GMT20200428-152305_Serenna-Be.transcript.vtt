1
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:17.789
Serenna Beers: Good morning.

2
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.930
Serenna Beers: Good. I can't see your face.

3
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.330
Annie m: Yes. Sorry, I'm just trying to

4
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.530
Annie m: Make my sister's coffee. She's still sleep.

5
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.440
Serenna Beers: Okay.

6
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.500
Serenna Beers: Okay.

7
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.630
Serenna Beers: How are you today, you feel a little more rested.

8
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.920
Yeah.

9
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.810
Annie m: I have a slip so

10
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.230
You know, and

11
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.440
Serenna Beers: And I just, um,

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.170
Serenna Beers: I want to say to you, first and foremost, my intention was not to shame you in any way, shape, or form. But you got to know. I mean, being in recovery myself.

13
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.890
Serenna Beers: Experiencing the same addiction as you

14
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:21.300
Serenna Beers: I see things I know things. And so I was trying to come at it in a way where it felt gentle. So if I offended you. I want to first and foremost say that I'm genuinely sorry that was not my intent.

15
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.970
Annie m: No worries, you know, at that point, I had not really

16
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.850
Annie m: Lucky enough

17
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.410
Annie m: Okay.

18
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.070
Annie m: I had

19
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.140
Annie m: Not real

20
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:48.360
Annie m: And I had been trying to tie tree my sandbox by myself like take less amount. Some days, and

21
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.560
Annie m: I just

22
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.320
Annie m: I was feeling like I really didn't want to be on

23
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.560
Annie m: Anywhere, which I know is like a symptom bipolar always happens.

24
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.210
Annie m: Normally I take him.

25
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.990
Annie m: Anyway, but

26
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.350
Annie m: It was just like my body was

27
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.940
Annie m: My family.

28
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:23.130
Annie m: Had just like finished questioning me about everything and then I got into the group. And it was just like too much. I felt attacked so

29
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.850
Annie m: When it however than I did relapse. See, you're onto something like

30
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.150
Annie m: Two nights ago

31
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:45.390
Annie m: Not on my drug of choice for some reason they decided to use Coke, which is I don't understand, like, I've never been interested in Coke well

32
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.730
Serenna Beers: Would you like me to explain it to you why.

33
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.400
Serenna Beers: Okay, first of all,

34
00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:08.250
Serenna Beers: Oftentimes folks that are opiate usage or opiate use and have been on this Suboxone there's something that that that occurs within your brain because obviously you know that if you're on the Suboxone, you're not going to get the same effect from

35
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.460
Serenna Beers: Using an opiate and so and

36
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:22.830
Serenna Beers: Also, you were you, you were in a very different place. You were tired. You were worn down exhausted. So really the come down the ghost slow had no appeal.

37
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:35.100
Serenna Beers: Yeah, me up had more of an appeal and it's crazy how our minds will justify. It's like, well, if I use this. It's not really my drug of choice. So it's not that bad.

38
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.700
Annie m: Yes.

39
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.830
Serenna Beers: I mean, yeah, it's, it's funny how our brains will rationalize

40
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:53.250
Serenna Beers: The stuff that we do. It's crazy. So for you to say I relapse, gosh, it doesn't make any sense. Not on my drug of choice. And in my mind, I'm like, that makes perfect sense.

41
00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:04.980
Serenna Beers: Yeah, you know, trying to trying to tie, treat yourself, you obviously know are you if you didn't know then you now know that's probably not the wisest thing for me to do.

42
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.810
Annie m: And then I think it's

43
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.850
Annie m: The time. No.

44
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:18.150
Serenna Beers: No. What was something I mean did a life event occur or something. I mean, what happened that flipped because

45
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:34.830
Serenna Beers: In one week's time. Well, first of all, let me back up and say a relapse for us happens. It's called dry. There's dry and wet. That's how we differentiate dry is where you start to exhibit all the be haters. You were in group and you were nodding out

46
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.000
Annie m: Yeah.

47
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:48.810
Serenna Beers: You were exhausted. You were defensive. You were like, How dare you think I'm going to relapse, or that I did when the reality was, you are already spinning your wheels inside of your mind. You just hadn't acted on it yet.

48
00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:02.850
Annie m: Yeah, and I honestly I didn't know it yet. Like, it felt like it came out of nowhere, just to the night before last, I was sewing, you know, face masks for my mom and

49
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.710
Annie m: They're all awesome

50
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:13.110
Annie m: For Korean sitting there talking to an old friend. He likes to do Coke and it was just like a bright idea.

51
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:33.870
Annie m: I like was like holy to still have that. And he was like, yeah, and within half an hour like of even starting the conversation with him. I was still saying the masks. He dropped it off outside. I went out there. I got it.

52
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.170
Annie m: You did almost the whole bag and then told my mom.

53
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:55.110
Annie m: It was crazy. It happened with the whole thing within the span of like three hours, but it was crazy. And I wasn't snorting it I was IV.

54
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.430
Okay.

55
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.270
Serenna Beers: So how many days, clean, are you then at this point.

56
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.890
Serenna Beers: So,

57
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.340
Annie m: It was all that night, so too.

58
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.430
Serenna Beers: Okay. How are you feeling right now.

59
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.950
Serenna Beers: Like where's your, what is your state of mind.

60
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.140
Annie m: And so sad.

61
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.950
Annie m: Like I love my surprise, he died.

62
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.510
Serenna Beers: Okay.

63
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.290
Annie m: Just my hundred days like me and my sister me this like

64
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:38.580
Annie m: Best cheesecake that we have seen on for them cook on show some and like

65
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.760
Annie m: poking me in person.

66
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:52.620
Annie m: You know, like Mr. Brady Davis January 1 everything's been so wonderful, this time there been no road bumps.

67
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.230
Annie m: And it was like, there's still wasn't number bump except

68
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:09.540
Annie m: Feeling like I wasn't getting a lot of sleeping like feeling like I was I wrong thought I already had, you know,

69
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.570
Annie m: So, so, Stephen.

70
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.670
Annie m: Okay, so here's what I want to

71
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.260
Annie m: Get my arms hurt.

72
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.740
Serenna Beers: Oh, I can imagine. Do you have some track marks.

73
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.170
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay.

74
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.470
Serenna Beers: Anna.

75
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:46.770
Serenna Beers: Unfortunately, sometimes relapse has to occur to really get a hold, and a grasp on just how powerful our addictive brain is like once that switch flips, we lose all sense of control and

76
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.500
Serenna Beers: That happened for you before you ever picked up. You just didn't see it, so

77
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.820
Serenna Beers: Here's the good news. Do you, do you want to hear some good news. Can you believe that there's some good news in all this because there really is.

78
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:10.680
Serenna Beers: One, you know, now more than you did before. So you're probably one of the smartest ones in the group. So as a newcomer

79
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:25.830
Serenna Beers: You can say, gosh. Now, I know I can't for one second, take my eye off the prize, like when you start to feel tired and overwhelmed. You stop right then and there and you do something to protect that sobriety.

80
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:34.770
Serenna Beers: That sobriety has to come before family. I'm not saying that you weren't putting it first. I believe that you were putting it first. However,

81
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.640
Serenna Beers: Because you thought that you were so strong, which you are

82
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:51.090
Serenna Beers: But when you're new. I mean, it took me well into my second year before I started to even think differently. I still had the criminality, I still had the manipulation. I still had all those types of

83
00:08:51.840 --> 00:09:05.220
Serenna Beers: Behaviors, the line I would lie about dumb stuff that I don't even know why I'd lie about it. It just didn't make any sense. I wanted to feel good about myself. But those type of things are so slippery and we don't realize it until it's too late.

84
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:14.460
Serenna Beers: I pray that this isn't your path, but sometimes it takes those kind of slips for us to realize

85
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.950
Serenna Beers: What we need to do differently.

86
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.870
Serenna Beers: So the good, the good news is, now you understand exactly what self care means and what happens when you let it go. Right.

87
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:34.950
Serenna Beers: In January one is just a date. And what I mean by that is, like, that's one of the reasons why I've never like put my sobriety date on me.

88
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:52.560
Serenna Beers: And I almost did 111 time but I swear, everybody that I know that has has slept. So what do you do. So if you put all your, your efforts into that date if that date be becomes the end all be all then you lose sight of really what it's about and what it's about is that day.

89
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:59.340
Serenna Beers: I have no I have today, just like you. I may have collected

90
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:08.010
Serenna Beers: Gosh dang 14 years and August never returned, November, December, January, February, March.

91
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.950
Serenna Beers: 14 years, eight months and 2028 days.

92
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.640
Serenna Beers: But that could be gone in an instant in an instant. All I have to do is

93
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.320
Serenna Beers: Remember that when I wake up.

94
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.270
Serenna Beers: I'm no better or no different than anybody else. I have the day I have the day to make

95
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:47.400
Serenna Beers: The healthiest choices that I possibly can. So now you have a new date and with this new date comes new experience comes New Hope comes new strategies comes new type of mindset, you have to figure out a way to pull yourself up. I am. Are you into reading at all.

96
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.860
Annie m: I'm reading

97
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:57.990
Serenna Beers: Okay, so if you've never have read this book and I don't normally cuss especially on video, but it's the name of the book. This book is called unstuck yourself.

98
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:07.770
Serenna Beers: And it's all about self sabotage. It is the greatest book and it is. It's one that I'll read at least once a year because I learned

99
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:15.570
Serenna Beers: Something new in it, you know, every time I have a breakup, you know, or I get. I get my little heartbroken.

100
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:26.430
Serenna Beers: Or every time I say something bad to my 10 year old kid because I get mad because I'm exhausted from doing this type of work all day so I lash out on her and then I have this guilt. This parental guilt or

101
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:43.530
Serenna Beers: Every time I, you know, just anything that I do, I will go to a place so fast, of where I beat myself up. That's what us addicts in recovery do we're good at that. We don't need anybody else to beat us up for to shame us because we do a great job all on our own.

102
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.440
Annie m: Mean only do it anyway.

103
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:55.320
Serenna Beers: I know. But Anna. Listen, you are still that same brave strong woman, you are still that woman who has

104
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:08.700
Serenna Beers: All that time she just had a slip in it. Okay, you, you didn't lose what you've gained in those 100 days. What you're going to do is you're going to take those 100 days and apply it with your new walk

105
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:09.930
Yeah.

106
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.180
Serenna Beers: You know what I mean.

107
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:22.860
Annie m: Totally like. That's how I feel. I'm like, so what I mean, in a way, I know it's a big deal. But I'm like, What's changed and like

108
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:42.930
Annie m: Everything in my life has been so good and I'm doing things so well and taking care of stuff that I've needed to take care of for years my relationship with my family so close being home taking care of my sisters just been a blessing. It's the best thing for me.

109
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:50.340
Annie m: Like I'm excited for things they feel more and more myself every day.

110
00:12:50.880 --> 00:13:12.300
Annie m: And here I am like a couple of days after that slip and other than being kind of tired and sad. I know, I really don't understand what has changed so much in everyone's eyes like they like, they do not want me anymore.

111
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.750
Annie m: I was honest.

112
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:35.760
Annie m: You know, I mean they waited till I finished the bag but excellence and to me relapses when okay you slip and then you look back on your life until it takes so I everything now, but I do that.

113
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.720
Annie m: I stopped so

114
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.730
Annie m: I just

115
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:51.810
Annie m: I just wish that my family and I could see that still mean like

116
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.160
Annie m: I didn't lose everything.

117
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.990
Serenna Beers: Unfortunately, dealing with family systems.

118
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:11.400
Serenna Beers: That was one of the most difficult parts of when I used to. I ran a treatment center in Oregon and I used to do the family weekends.

119
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:25.440
Serenna Beers: And families were oftentimes sicker than the clients were and what I mean by that is, is they don't see what their part in it is family members have relapse be hey beers that is where there. They don't trust.

120
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:41.970
Serenna Beers: They enable or they go cold and just cut you off. They do that whole tough love without connection. I mean, there's all different kinds of things that family participate in your addiction, but they don't understand that part. And as much as

121
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:48.810
Serenna Beers: You know it, even if you beat them over the head with 12 step and all the education and the proof and the

122
00:14:49.680 --> 00:15:04.800
Serenna Beers: Research. It was very interesting to me how a lot of the patients that I saw would recover and families wouldn't because they just because there's so much in denial about their own part in it.

123
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.730
Serenna Beers: Right, oftentimes, they will hold their loved one.

124
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:17.970
Serenna Beers: Hostage and they won't forgive. They won't give another chance. They won't, you know. But on the flip side of that,

125
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.410
Serenna Beers: Annie. That's the consequences of our use and unfortunately you

126
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.050
Serenna Beers: When you chose to do what you did.

127
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.170
Serenna Beers: Now you're going to sit with the consequences.

128
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.720
Serenna Beers: What whatever that looks like.

129
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:47.130
Serenna Beers: If your family truly loves you and support you, they will come around, but it has to be in their time because you broke their trust and regardless of

130
00:15:47.520 --> 00:16:00.090
Serenna Beers: You know how good that you had been doing. They're not going to see that because they don't understand the addiction, like you do, or like I do, or like anybody else who understood stands, it does.

131
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:17.580
Serenna Beers: And so no matter what you say or do you can't change how a person feels. All you can do is just continue to do your best and not let this change your course you're very strong you're very willing, you're very brave. I mean,

132
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:35.460
Serenna Beers: And you're just gonna have to pick yourself up and figure out, okay, so they if they don't want want me here, then what are, what are my other. What are my other options do you have other other other other options like do you live with someone else other than them.

133
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:44.550
Annie m: Know, skip ahead a scholarship to a super living but then quarantine is stop taking people

134
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.140
Serenna Beers: Time.

135
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.290
Serenna Beers: I mean, are they wanting to kick you out on the street. It has that

136
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.620
Annie m: I think that mean dead ends.

137
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:07.380
Annie m: I think my mom is like, Oh my God, she's an angel. Like, it feels like she's not she reads books about addictions just

138
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.290
Annie m: But she's the only one that will

139
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:20.490
Annie m: Like after something happens and nurture me and like, give me a hug Tomatina be okay. Like, you know,

140
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.560
Annie m: Be with me and like love me and it feels so good.

141
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:36.540
Annie m: Like she's, she's only one but it puts her in a compromising position because the main dad's mad at her. I take

142
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.360
Annie m: That next morning after everything when I went downstairs.

143
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:51.720
Annie m: I wanted so bad that call into my sister's hospital bed and just cuddle and watch something

144
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:59.880
Annie m: I like walked up and she just screaming, screaming at me. She didn't want to look at me.

145
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.520
Annie m: I wish everyone could just remember love like to me.

146
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.140
Annie m: Still human that still hurts.

147
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:26.340
Serenna Beers: What if you were to and and i don't know how willing that you are. But what if you I mean I know for me, it literally took me throwing myself down

148
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:41.250
Serenna Beers: At the mercy of my family for them to trust me again. I literally said whatever your rules are, I will abide by. And if I break them this time. And this was the final time that and and i didn't pick up or drink or use again.

149
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.310
Serenna Beers: I said if you give me this chance

150
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:58.080
Serenna Beers: If I mess up, then that then you won't have to ask me to leave because I will leave, I will take the consequences of my choice. But I asked you to read about

151
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:08.340
Serenna Beers: Relapse I asked you to read. You know, I asked you to, you know, help me help myself you know i i i understand why you're angry and hurt.

152
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:16.500
Serenna Beers: But I'm telling you that I'm still that same girl who had 100 days. I just had a slip and now I know differently. I'm better now because I know

153
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:25.350
Serenna Beers: What I did that led me up to that, you know, you can't get tired, you know, you can't do too too much and you know that you have to, no matter what.

154
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:37.080
Serenna Beers: Stay away from people, places and things like obviously to continue a relationship with this gentleman who's has the cocaine is not wise and is not. It is not in your best interest.

155
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.710
Serenna Beers: No.

156
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.090

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.720
Annie m: And my dad in so long.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.540
Annie m: He took like I said he texted me half hour later, he is dropping it off like

159
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.650
Annie m: First time via text to me in three years.

160
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.100
Serenna Beers: Did you remove him from your phone.

161
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.640
Annie m: Yeah, I'm Jim, what

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.200
Serenna Beers: Is number out

163
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:10.560
Annie m: Well, yeah, that too because otherwise you can just unblock him. No, I had my mom block him from it's a family.

164
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.060
Serenna Beers: Plan. Okay, gotcha.

165
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.440
Annie m: She does it in I or is it, like, there's no way

166
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.600
Annie m: That like

167
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:36.540
Annie m: Number. And also, but it's like there's always Facebook or there's always asking someone else but I have to trust that every step, they put between mean relapse like every step that makes it a little bit.

168
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.800
Annie m: Harder is a step to that mentally gives me a

169
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.780
Annie m: Chance to change my mind.

170
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:58.110
Serenna Beers: So until we get you on track. Are you opposed to me just doing and it doesn't have to be long, like this is only going to be a 30 minute check in. Can I see you every single week for for at least a month.

171
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.960
Serenna Beers: And then we can maybe talk talk about moving it up.

172
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.950
Okay.

173
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:03.930
Serenna Beers: Does that work.

174
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.670
Serenna Beers: Yeah okay are you jerk jerk journaling at all.

175
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.190
Annie m: Then start

176
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:17.070
Serenna Beers: Okay, I want you to start tonight, even if all you put down is

177
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.470
Serenna Beers: Today sucked.

178
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:28.560
Serenna Beers: The next day, you might put today was a better day I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The next day, you might put just feelings you might put the word

179
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.270
Serenna Beers: Back. I mean, you might like sometimes my

180
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:42.660
Serenna Beers: Journal has just a happy face. Sometimes my journal all draw and I with a tear and I'll get all like artsy just because

181
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.940
Serenna Beers: I can't put put my emotions in

182
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.460
Serenna Beers: And into words.

183
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.520
Annie m: But as long as you're putting it down.

184
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.280
Serenna Beers: On paper, it does something inside the brain.

185
00:21:54.330 --> 00:22:03.210
Serenna Beers: So can you commit to even if you literally put the date down and say I got nothing. You're making the attempt to journal every

186
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.570
Annie m: Day.

187
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.660
Serenna Beers: When you're trying to create is a pattern. Okay.

188
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:16.980
Serenna Beers: And then all I asked from you is when I talk to you each week and I say, How's the journaling house, how are the thoughts feeling urges

189
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:23.250
Serenna Beers: Honest. I'm the one that you can be honest with okay there's no judgment here because

190
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:37.740
Serenna Beers: I promise you if I haven't experienced it. I've heard about it and I've coached folks through it. Okay. I am here to help you. I'm on your team. I'm one of your biggest fans because I want to see you do this. Okay.

191
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.810
Serenna Beers: And

192
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:51.390
Serenna Beers: If I am struggling with something I see in the group for now because you're very vulnerable and fragile. I'm going to

193
00:22:52.650 --> 00:23:04.860
Serenna Beers: I'll privately text. Dr. Allah DAG and will either remove you from the room, but I'm not going to call you out like that. Because what I don't want you to do is shut down. Okay.

194
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:15.720
Serenna Beers: Yeah, I'm not going to enable you but if I need to remove you versus confront you in the group until you can come back. But what I do want you to do with the group.

195
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.080
Serenna Beers: If you can, is just to be honest, because you'd be shocked you might help save someone else.

196
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.740
Serenna Beers: You might have no clue how many others are short struggling with exactly where you're at.

197
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.200
Serenna Beers: Maybe, maybe acted on it to maybe they

198
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.700
Serenna Beers: Haven't but you're not the only one in the group that we see.

199
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:43.740
Serenna Beers: As providers that struggling, but you are one of the ones that have come up and said, I messed up. That takes a lot of guts.

200
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.250
Annie m: To do that, and I want you to know that. And I don't think

201
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:58.350
Serenna Beers: That you'll get anything but support and and people who understand you and just want to see you, walk, walk through this. Okay.
