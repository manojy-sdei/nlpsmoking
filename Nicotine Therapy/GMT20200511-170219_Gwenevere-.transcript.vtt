00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this like for you to live with someone

64
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have that kind of relationship with

65
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.900
iPhone: Well, that's actually one of the topics that I wanted to talk about today. He

66
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.580
iPhone: Um,

67
00:07:51.780 --> 00:08:00.630
iPhone: Is that for me right now in my head and and I know that I'm setting myself up for failure because ever since I was younger, I did that I

68
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:13.710
iPhone: I like would get this idea in my head and and and and start like thinking about it and thinking about it and all it's going to solve all my problems like

69
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:25.680
iPhone: Well, right now, what I have in my head is like that. We're going to move into a two bedroom apartment and I'm getting one of the rooms for myself and

70
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You've mentioned this before.

71
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:36.540
iPhone: And so this is one of the things that I wanted to talk about it says, Is it bad that I want to have my own room in the new apartment.

72
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you, you can kind of tell based on working with me. Am I going to say that anything is bad.

73
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't use that kind of language. Right.

74
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's interesting is

75
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You have

76
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not mysticism, what would be

77
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the traditions spirituality and then superstition that was a word you use superstition.

78
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.890
iPhone: Right. Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Certain things that I won't know about. There are certain powers or compelling constraints like superstition like religion, that I may not fully understand you'll tell me if we bump into them, but

80
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there one of these that we're bumping into that you decided to go to isn't bad.

81
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this religion. Is this a superstition, as if it's not okay for you to

82
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Set your own boundaries and have your own room in a relationship that's

83
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Like just

84
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationship of convenience.

85
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's he'll share the rent will live here. We're both the parents. So, but this is it is exactly what it is. There's no denying and it's not trying to conform to something else, or is it. What are you trying to compare it against to decide whether it's bad or not.

86
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:30.450
iPhone: I think my, my concern is, is if I'm being selfish, if I'm being selfish. If my son, if it is what my auntie told me and my son does deserve to have a room to himself and

87
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:41.880
iPhone: Have his own space and him know you know that it is. And I'm like, I'm gonna get him his own bed or a queen size bed, we can both like you know

88
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just heard it. So tell me about with the artist because I just

89
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the

90
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:49.950
Well,

91
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.520

93
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.270
iPhone: Um,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.210
iPhone: Can I explain it like the same way. He's like the same character not character, but like

95
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.650
iPhone: Personality, I want to say are the same, like the same ways like

96
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.280
iPhone: Well, I'm

97
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:40.230
iPhone: I told her that, uh, that things just aren't working out for me, you know, he I want my own space and I'm excited to have my own. I feel like I need it for my my my own my sanity my

98
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.760
iPhone: You know,

99
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:56.610
iPhone: And she said, Yeah, but you have to think about the baby. It's not just you anymore. You have to think about the baby because worrying. You want to be able to fix that room up for him and

100
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:05.370
iPhone: Feel like he belongs and like you'd like. It's his own space where he can go and play and sleep. And I'm like,

101
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.780
iPhone: Yeah, I guess I didn't think about that.

102
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.970
iPhone: And

103
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:22.560
iPhone: So now I've just been thinking about it and thinking about it like I want, I want to separate myself from him so bad.

104
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.930
iPhone: But at the cost of what like in my end my being selfish and my

105
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.350
iPhone: Not thinking about my son.

106
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Played all the way out. So he has his own space and what what's the impact on your son at two.

107
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: For what's, what's the impact because it's not just what she's saying, what does it mean to you that he has his own room at age at a baby age, just a little thing so

108
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.290
What is that supposed to do.

109
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.940
iPhone: Um, I don't know, just that he sees that it to

110
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Him now.

111
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And how have you possibly been living with yourself. You're such a terrible mother.

112
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.060
iPhone: That's

113
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.530

116
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't keep your sanity. Look at all the things that are at risk.

117

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't go crazy.

119
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.970
iPhone: Oh,

120
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.850
iPhone: I think I have the right idea. I think I needed. I need a separate

121
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:08.910
iPhone: What's mine. And what's his and if he really wants to treat me because he's. That's the way he's treating you know and so if he really wants it that way. Okay.

122
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.150
iPhone: For my own that hey,

123
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.520

124
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing.

iPhone: The dog and the baby. The baby goes and like puts a toy on her something. She does. She's an old lady, so she doesn't like it and

128
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.810
iPhone: But, um,

129
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so in order to not go crazy. Let's stick with this a little bit more, not as in, you're doing it because you're trying to send a message to Ramon well you don't love me enough to show me you care.

130
00:14:52.890 --> 00:15:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are there different motivations. So let's just put a pin in that one. Unless that's true, unless you're only doing it to retaliate against Ramon, and it

131
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

132
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.530

138
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You engaged in a conversation with her it put that vulnerability of yours at risk.

139
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Now think about why you decided to even bring it up with her.

140
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.540
iPhone: I guess because

141
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:53.010
iPhone: I wanted her advice. I wanted her to buy. So I wanted

142
00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:02.190

Gwenevere Abriel: You have the type of relationship that you can say, Aunty

144
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what's best for me.

145
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And

146
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The advice I want is around

147
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the actual advice or were you looking for approval from her.

148
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.930
iPhone: Probably, probably looking for

149
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.310
Yeah.

150
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't get what you wanted. And now you're having to wonder whether you're being selfish.

151
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But then come back in here.

152
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's happening.

153
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you getting approval.

154
00:16:52.470 --> 00:17:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, getting approval. Okay, so, but I don't say it like that do it well I approve you you tune back into

155
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm beginning know myself that I gotta have it. I just I just do suffer Ramon, it's not because I'm neglecting my child. It's because I have to take care of my sanity. I have to

156
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue to nurture this developing self and beginning to know myself and I can't do it right. I guess I'm assuming in this toxic proximity with boyfriend, there needs to be this sort of physical distance, I think.

157
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.850
iPhone: I would send you a picture of what our room looks like.

158
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.930
iPhone: I'm sure you can imagine. Yeah.

159
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go back to the original thought

160
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how bad it could get if you

161
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: were faced with having to conform to the way things look or conform to, you know, your aunt's idea of what right and wrong is

162
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But look what's at stake, but some of the horrible things that can happen if you just about to go crazy. What might happen.

163
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.890
iPhone: Yeah, I think that it's

164
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.420
iPhone: It's gonna wear on me even more.

165
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.060
iPhone: And I'm really going to get into like

166
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:48.600
iPhone: Some kind of rough like a depression like something. It's wearing on me, is what I'm trying to say.

167
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.220
iPhone: It's really wearing on me and

168
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And in order for the depression to stop.

169
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the worst part of a depression.

170
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you have to do what might happen.

171
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:17.160
iPhone: I need to get my, I need to separate myself from the situation and me to do something.

172
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.940
iPhone: Change something that, because what our dynamic right now isn't working out.

173
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the past when you are depressed, what happened.

174
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.260
iPhone: I would begin to self medicate. Yep.

175
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So there it is. That's the piece right it's your recovery is at stake which WITHOUT THE RECOVERY PIECE.

176
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That brings in availability to your son that brings in question of continuing to work it brings everything up.

177
00:19:51.600 --> 00:20:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you can you afford a two bedroom kit isn't even part of the conversation anymore. It's all connected to you tethering back to tuning into what you want to do, and it's not selfish.

178
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What's more selfish you laying in bed and unavailable to people in your life in a depression.

179
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Spending diverting money in a drive for substance use.

180
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, well that goes into it, which is really more selfish addiction, right, or seeing that the limitations of this relationship this romantic relationship.

181
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.920
iPhone: Probably using and

182
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.180
iPhone: being depressed.

183
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.840
iPhone: Being unavailable.

184
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And your audience is much as similar as you guys are she's not you, only you know

185
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't need her approval.

186
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be convenient, but this is where that concept of radical acceptance comes in. Not everybody could understand my reasoning. Not everybody's going to know exactly the specifics of what's going on in this House, only you know

187
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're on.

188
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Years.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are going to have your own home, you decide to continue to share with her that vulnerable space of honesty with her.

190
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What might you say she throws a superstition and religious doctrine doctrine or right and wrong about spirituality or something she throws something at you, where you are a bad

191
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Person mother.

192
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Partner, something like that. She throws that out you was her her own beliefs. But if she throws that actually what what might you do or say

193
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.460
iPhone: I know what I should say.

194
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:15.720
Okay.

195
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.330

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.650
iPhone: Not, not sit there and obsess about it like I usually do, like I would do.

Gwenevere Abriel: And where you are in this last week or two. Are you doing that.

213
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we have to have something ready in the background. Ready to redirect the conversation so that it gets off that topic so that you feel comfortable and she can what's called Safe face so she doesn't feel like her good advice is dismissed.

214
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So not only might you say thank you for that input sounds a little cold.

215
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you, but you might say thank you, Auntie.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Change the subject.

222
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So what can you do right then to steer the conversation somewhere else.

223
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.220
iPhone: I can

224
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.210
iPhone: I can bring up her work.

225
00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:01.170
iPhone: She's really happy about that because she just recently started working again after yours.

226
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So thank you for giving me a safe place to think through this important decision on T.

Well,

232
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That was the sort of

233
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.540
Rhetorical

234
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of the role play, you might say.

235
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, how might that go sideways. Is there any chance she would decide to be offended.

236
00:25:46.590 --> 00:26:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If you didn't take her advice or she would demand that you tell her. Well, are you moving into your own room or not. Is that the type of person. She is to demand that you tell her not got go off the topic I want to hear you are gonna have a room for him.

237
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.400
iPhone: No, I don't think she would

238
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't that hard then right you have someone who's really aggressive about it.

239
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

240
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for letting being there for me to think this through this, this feels like a big decision.

241
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm almost there. Tell me about work.

242
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

243
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.820
iPhone: Yeah, I think it's more, it's more me being hard on myself.

244
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.590
iPhone: Being that person to my towards myself.

245
00:26:49.230 --> 00:27:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So the halfway point a compromise and no way. Do I think that your son's ability to identify what is his and what is not learning that from you all the time. You just did it. He said, that hurt. He's learning those things.

246
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: kids when they're like in middle school and high school they need their own space. So, this

247
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right when he becomes like especially like being

248
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.340
iPhone: Stop it. Hey, get away from her, please.

249
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

250
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:26.670
iPhone: sit on the couch.

251
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Not even until he's like six. Does he even have

252
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be like a comparison of self to other he's basically he's fantastic you know whose it was a classroom full of three year olds and four year olds.

253
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone might say, well, who's the smartest kid in the class, everybody's hands going to go up. Who's the funniest kid in the class, everybody's hands go up. Who's the strongest can Nicholas everybody's hands going to go up right around 567 you say, who's the smartest kid.

254
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to point they're going to know who it is. They, they begin this sort of comparison thing right now he's just loving hanging out with you.

255
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just hanging out with you what the timing on this.

256
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it feel good to be close to him anyway.

257
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

258
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So the compromise part might have to do with a space in the room.

259
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: A certain cubby area. Maybe you build a little fork or something that really feels like his own space that could be a little compromise.

260
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: recast his own area that he may be learns to put toys away. He may learn something. I don't know what your approach is about those things. But he could still have a sense of

261
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: These are my things treat don't don't don't throw them. Don't break them. This is, I like my bed need this is how I like like it. I see. You don't really care about your stuffed animals, that's fine, but they do last longer. When we treat them. Nice. I'm just telling you might get dirty.

262
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you see there can be sort of a middle. What are you thinking

263
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: With that is an idea.

264
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.090
iPhone: Yeah.

265
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:21.390
iPhone: I think without putting a name or like a label on it like putting a name to it. I kind of did that.

266
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:30.150
iPhone: But I'm glad that you know now I have that idea like okay I can compromise.

267
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.830
iPhone: By getting him his own space his own little bed.

268
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like a cool you know those little tense or, you know, something that's like right in the corner.

269
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something, and then you do

270
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Not. Can I come in.

271
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can show about boundaries about where those are.

272
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We doing like that.

273
00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say no, don't be don't come in. Okay. I'll wait. Let me know when we can teach boundaries that way and wait

274
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.310

280
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Expectation about what's right and wrong. And it maybe it just doesn't match what you need, you need right now and

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:59.070

iPhone: Um, he has this little basketball court that he likes to knock over

318
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.390
iPhone: And so I think that's why he was trying to do.

319
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.530
iPhone: But then like came back and

320
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.140

321
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

322
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know, he recovered from that quite quite quickly.

323
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.580
iPhone: Baby

324
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, so he was in this big distress, and he found out you were right there. You, you said, oh, you know, everything's okay and you took care of him and he recovered.

325
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like that.

326
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.190

iPhone: That's, that's usually

329
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.690
iPhone: How it happens like

330
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:43.890
iPhone: That's why I don't understand why his dad can't do that. Like if he's crying. He'll just let him crying. And that's something that's something that we do fight about

331
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.520
Yeah.

332
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:46.170
iPhone: You know,

333
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:47.520
iPhone: And

334
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.040
iPhone: I wish I could talk about these things with him, but

335
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.780
iPhone: Like

336
00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.010
iPhone: I

337
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to change to know more, you know, he knows where

338
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be all he has to get right now.

339
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me more about how you see that you're beginning to grow.

340
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.770

341
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.310

iPhone: Like I calm myself down

345
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:58.080
iPhone: And then I think about being like, the other day I went to the store and

346
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.470
iPhone: The lady was really rude to me.

347

348
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.960
iPhone: When normally I would react and I would say something

349
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.880
iPhone: And just things like that or knowing

350
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:26.880

iPhone: And she kind of just has a really bad pattern of being promiscuous, and she's transgender

357
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.590
iPhone: And

358
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:27.540

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Time with me and you just you. Are you remembering the things we did

397
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And what we could do is when you meet. I mean, obviously, if you have the ability to it is harder to do the more intensive psychotherapy.

398
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we can. Great. If we can't might be kind of like today where we're just sort of

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:27.720
Looking

403
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.830

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.350
iPhone: That's scary.

408
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.460
iPhone: We don't have to add a flashover me like

409
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: A stick with may 18 and just notice that feeling that just happened that flashlight. Wait a minute.

410
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.330

411
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't add up so delicious.

412
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.990

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:59.850
iPhone: Yeah, I'm gonna talk to his dad and I'm the time that you know what this is something very important for me. And we need to figure out, you know, when you figure it out. And he has to help me because, you know, why should I figure it out by myself.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.170
So,

423
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:08.250
