00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.170
Dominique Pozo: Having a big backup in a

15
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.370
Dominique Pozo: In the virtual clinic.

16
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.570
Martin Price: Yeah, I think there's some new people in their training them and you know it's kind of like on the job training and

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.320
Okay.

18
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.110
Martin Price: It's just taken a little bit longer than usual.

19
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.160
Hmm.

20
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.310
Dominique Pozo: Ok well how's it going

21
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
Martin Price: Pretty well i i think we talked like last Thursday or something and

22
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.990
Martin Price: You know, had a really good ski day on Saturday, and that

23
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.060
Martin Price: A guy that

24
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.240
Martin Price: Will take me down this

25
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:22.140
Martin Price: Kind of the shoots in the mountains. I've been looking for a long time trying to find somebody to do that with, you know, I was we were talking about trying to make male friends and everything and

26
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.530
Yeah.

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.500
Martin Price: I have one good friend named George he's gay. And sometimes it's a little awkward, but

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.610
Martin Price: Like we go to the dog park every day and take the dogs out and everything and

29
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
Martin Price: He like takes care of my house when I'm back in Wisconsin and all that. Uh huh.

30
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.580
Martin Price: But I was thinking about it and it's just I realize it's

31
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.220
Martin Price: Hard for me to, I mean, so should the code things that with the stuff I like to do like bike riding or

32
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.940
Martin Price: Skiing or climbing and stuff like that. It's

33
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.650
Martin Price: I guess I need to check for clubs or something like that, you know,

34
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.400
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

35
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.730
Martin Price: ride bikes Saturday mornings, or something like that.

36
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.770
Martin Price: Because again, that into I'm not really into like football or, you know, watching football, stuff like that.

37
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.640
Dominique Pozo: Right, so just finding like minded.

38
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.250
Dominique Pozo: Friends.

39
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.050
Martin Price: They're there. It's just like you can meet him by happenstance just

40
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.430
Martin Price: You know, because you start talking to him up on the hill and stuff like that.

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.200
Martin Price: I almost went over to the shoots, but I just, I didn't. It's kind of dangerous. You're supposed to do it with somebody else around

42
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.310
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

43
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.110
Martin Price: So that was good and

44
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.750
Martin Price: I'm you know i'm still

45
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.460
Martin Price: Trying to intervene on my negative thoughts, kind of like

46
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.070
Martin Price: I guess more gently and not just like

47
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.990
Martin Price: dive straight into a prayer or something like that, because the prayers are

48
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.180
Martin Price: You know,

49
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.550
Martin Price: They really weren't working. So it seems like it's more about

50
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.990
Martin Price: Just entertaining intervene Jeff playing catch yourself, you know,

51
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.320
Martin Price: But yeah

52
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.270
Martin Price: Yeah, this morning I was kind of going through it again and

53
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.630
Martin Price: It slowly went away.

54
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:47.250
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. So what do you find, like what is like, can you talk me through what you do when there's negative start thoughts start coming up. What does it look like internally in your mind, like, what, what do you, what do you do with that.

55
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.170
Martin Price: Well, you know, I'm definitely aware of it and

56
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.270
Martin Price: I try and like get into work or trying to

57
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.230
Martin Price: Think of other things, or stay busy, you know,

58
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.220
Dominique Pozo: So you're kind of distracting. That's one.

59
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.150
That's one. Yeah.

60
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.650
Martin Price: I know they say that that's like not going to solve it. But I don't know what else to do. You know, it's only thing that works.

61
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:32.820
Dominique Pozo: Well, I, it is a coping mechanism, it's not the only one. And I wouldn't recommend distracting all the time, or these things get put in the shadows and they'll come out sideways.

62
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:42.240
Dominique Pozo: Some other time yet it is a coping skill, I, I just, okay, is that the only thing you're doing right now distraction.

63
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.650
Martin Price: Or just go about my day, you know, and just kind of like

64
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:04.950
Martin Price: Try and get into just doing little things for myself, like, you know, I made a really good steak dinner last night that was. It was really delicious. You know, and I really got into it.

65
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.380
Martin Price: But

66
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.550
Martin Price: The days can kind of drag on, you know, and

67
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.020
Martin Price: I don't know what really helps me is being around people.

68
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.740
Martin Price: Uh huh.

69
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.610
Mm hmm.

70
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:32.520
Martin Price: I don't really have anybody. I can just call like until my name is really bad place because I mean George's heard it from me so many times. I'm sure he's like

71
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.990
You know,

72
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.960
Martin Price: He just

73
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.970
Martin Price: I don't know.

74
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.070
Martin Price: I don't know how to deal with it, I guess.

75
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.800
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think, I think it would be useful to keep practicing and kind of flexing the muscle of turning towards

76
00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:03.900
Dominique Pozo: Rather than away from it you know that's there's different there's different ways to deal and sometimes turning away is helpful. So you can function for sure yet. I think what I

77
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:16.230
Dominique Pozo: am curious to see is how if you do start turning towards it, how it might transform and that's some of like the empty chair work that we've done where, say, the voice starts to come up

78
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:25.350
Dominique Pozo: Then you say, oh, okay, here you are again. Okay. Here you are. I'm gonna hook you i'm going to not, I'm not going to put you in a box. And I'm not going to push you away.

79
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.480
Dominique Pozo: Or turn away. I'm going to hook you and I'm going to sit with you and I'm going to be with you. It's like

80
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.030
Dominique Pozo: It's like a little kid who's crying you know there's a lot of things you could do. You could shut him in a room and walk away.

81
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:47.970
Dominique Pozo: You could, you know, just walk away and say, you know, you need to deal with yourself. I'm busy. Or you can turn towards the child and be like, Okay, let's sit down and talk to me. Tell me what's going on, you know,

82
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.210
Martin Price: Um,

83
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.900
Martin Price: Yeah, it's just I told you about it last time. It's just this real grim kinda

84
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.100
Martin Price: You know, like you just like

85
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.840
Martin Price: It every stupid thing imaginable, and

86
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.200
Martin Price: And you know I all I really want to do is just like

87
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.110
Martin Price: Work and try and

88
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.170
Martin Price: Dig myself out of this hole.

89
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.950
Martin Price: And you know the

90
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.730
Martin Price: Then it's like, well, it's never going to get any better if you keep taking this buprenorphine and

91
00:07:47.010 --> 00:08:01.830
Martin Price: And then I'm like, what am I going to hold on to my job, you know, if I have to, like, take two, two weeks or a month off and it's like the only thing you can do is taper and I'm somewhat successful tapering but you know

92
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.310
Martin Price: Get down, and then it'll creep back up and then

93
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.830
Martin Price: You know, the general trend is down, but I just didn't realize it was going to take this long, you know,

94
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.670
Martin Price: You can't just stop taking it over the course of a week and yeah yeah

95
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:38.340
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think we've definitely be done a an open dialogue with your with this part, you know, there's been we've identified okay it's connected to your dad. You know, there's a voice of your father in there from long ago and

96
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:50.910
Dominique Pozo: As far as I've witnessed this part, you know, wants to look out for you and make sure you don't get yourself in a familiar situation that's not fulfilling or generative for you.

97
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.920
Dominique Pozo: So,

98
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.730
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering, I'm wondering, what do you, what do you think

99
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:10.950
Dominique Pozo: Are you afraid if you really engage with this negative voice are you afraid of something, they're like, What are you afraid of

100
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.680
Martin Price: Like just kind of falling into the abyss. You know, I'm losing

101
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.260
Martin Price: My motivation. You know, like just giving up.

102
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.120
I mean,

103
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:36.120
Martin Price: I'm literally doing everything I can only thing I'm doing wrong right now is taking the beep an orphan. I mean, everything else. I'm doing, you know, to the best of my ability, and trying to

104
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.950
Martin Price: You know, rebuild my foundation, so to speak, and

105
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.150
Dominique Pozo: You know,

106
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:48.870
Dominique Pozo: I'm just going to reflect when I hear you say the only thing you're doing wrong is the people morphine and this must be a really

107
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:59.520
Dominique Pozo: This must be like, it must feel like a big split and yourself like, you know, doing something every day and telling yourself it's wrong.

108
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.880
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. I haven't been able to

109
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.360
Martin Price: Just accepted.

110
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:21.450
Martin Price: It, you know, I woke up this morning and I was in pain and hobbling around and then I was like, well, you do this to yourself because you exercise too hard or you go ski and stuff like that and

111
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.440
Martin Price: If you didn't do that, then you wouldn't be in pain, and you wouldn't have this phony justification to take it, you know.

112
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.530
Martin Price: I don't know that that is a lifestyle. I really like to live. But, um,

113
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.160
Martin Price: Yeah, you're right, it is, it just creates a split

114
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:59.700
Dominique Pozo: And I, I'm hearing again like party wants to go enjoy life and and do what you love and then it keeps you bound to taking the Suboxone at this point or the people north, excuse me, and

115
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:14.520
Dominique Pozo: I mean I'm just wondering how does it feel to hear this statement at the moment. Just, just let it in and see what what happens for you when I say this, you know, for now.

116
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:23.850
Dominique Pozo: You do need to take the buprenorphine to do the things that bring you joy and those things that bring you joy are really important for your well being.

117
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:32.610
Dominique Pozo: So until you're tapered off completely. This is a part of being able to engage, because if you don't take it you probably get really sick.

118
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.420
Martin Price: What happened last time was a

119
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:49.260
Martin Price: Lot of anxiety for sleeplessness, but then I got. And this was like a couple months later I just started getting really fatigued and

120
00:11:52.410 --> 00:12:00.750
Martin Price: Sick. Basically, it was a lot of congestion and I don't know if it was like the time a year, or what but

121
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:09.960
Martin Price: I was just like a rack and that was like two months later, you know, two or three months later and

122
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.400
Martin Price: So it's like I'm kind of scared.

123
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.680
Martin Price: Mm hmm. You know, like, Well, what's going to happen this time and

124
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.940
Martin Price: I mean one thing they offer is like a

125
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:35.730
Martin Price: The Treatment Center offers a taper while you're there, which might, which is the only thing I haven't really tried you know

126
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.110
Martin Price: It's like so hard getting down like from four to three milligrams. It's like, oh my god, you know,

127
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.950
Dominique Pozo: Well, what kind of support.

128
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:59.820
Dominique Pozo: Do you believe you need to actually do that. And do you think you could do it through the kind of program you're in now. Do you think you need to go into a treatment center for that.

129
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.920
Martin Price: If I want to get it over with.

130
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.660
Martin Price: You know, if not then it just seems like it's gonna like

131
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:20.040
Martin Price: I'd like to go back to Wisconsin and be back and be down to say three or 2.5 or even to, you know,

132
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.760
Dominique Pozo: What, what do you imagine that they offer there that will help you do that.

133
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.340
Martin Price: Well, no, I

134
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.860
Martin Price: In Wisconsin or

135
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.000
Dominique Pozo: Another treatment.

136
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.230
Dominique Pozo: To get you

137
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.490
To help you tapers

138
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.660
Martin Price: Because you're in kind of a lockdown. You know, you can't get anymore. And they'll give you

139
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.670
Martin Price: The amount

140
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.670
Martin Price: You know the right amount to taper with

141
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.960
Martin Price: Over like the course of a week or something or 10 days.

142
00:13:52.830 --> 00:14:03.150
Dominique Pozo: Would you be willing to talk to one of the doctors about this because that sounds awfully fast to me and I'm not a doctor. So I, I don't. This isn't my scope of practice to even really comment on

143
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.070
Martin Price: Although I can do about it.

144
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:23.700
Dominique Pozo: I would, because for me. I get some red flags like okay that sounds very quick, from what I've witnessed in the last four years of working with bright heart health, and what concerns me is that by dropping so quickly, is it really sustainable, you know, is it going to really not.

145
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.360
Martin Price: Touch it. I was thinking to. It's like, are you just going to go right back to it or

146
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.820
Martin Price: Or will it say help you get down to say one or two a day, you know,

147
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.400
Martin Price: That was kind of my whole

148
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.440
Martin Price: I don't know, or the taper that I'm doing. I just have to like give myself more credit. I mean, I've cut back

149
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.920
Martin Price: Substantially and it's like

150
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.380
Martin Price: It's not easy.

151
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.280
Dominique Pozo: I imagine. And I, I'm wondering if you

152
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:03.360
Dominique Pozo: You know, if it makes sense to maybe draw it out longer than a week to get down to, you know, to go from

153
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.970
Dominique Pozo: Whatever however you want.

154
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.790
Martin Price: To whatever

155
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:19.920
Dominique Pozo: So 3.6 to, to, to, you know, come up with a really solid plan and I'm happy to be a part of that with Dr. Kendall and you have you know what

156
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:26.550
Dominique Pozo: What physiologically she really believes would be helpful for you and enduring and then

157
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:40.230
Dominique Pozo: Psychologically, you know what, we can come up with, you know, maybe you attend to group meetings. A week or maybe we do to individual and one group or or something and or there's more support in the community. Maybe join a men circle.

158
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:48.210
Dominique Pozo: You know, something that you're getting a lot of because that's in the end. That is what helps with the tapering is having the support

159
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:56.040
Martin Price: Yeah, and being around people for me like being alone in my household is pretty much. That's like the worst.

160
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:02.910
Martin Price: I have. I've always, you know, I just much rather be at work, you know,

161
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:09.450
Martin Price: Because I just noticed when I'm around people. It's like, I forget about you know

162
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:18.660
Martin Price: The voice kind of disappears. And I just, you know, it helps me engage my mind.

163
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.670
Martin Price: In in something else in my own thoughts.

164
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:24.750
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

165
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:48.000
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. And this is how you know you're you're longing to taper while being in this pandemic hearing that you, you know, being around people really helps you, you know, it sounds like you're maybe more of an extrovert. So this time of being alone in isolation really amplifies and is maybe

166
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.450
Dominique Pozo: Adjective agitating this tapering process.

167
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.600
Martin Price: Yeah, I think that's true. It's, um,

168
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.130
Martin Price: Yeah, you know, I'm hoping I can go back that they'll let us back around the end of the month.

169
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.430
Martin Price: And

170
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.090
Martin Price: I could go back and find the meet this April, girl.

171
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.900
Dominique Pozo: How's that going just to switch gears for a moment.

172
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:22.620
Martin Price: Lots of text back and forth about our days and stuff like that. She's just been really nice.

173
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:35.310
Martin Price: You know, just like she wants to hang out. She we both kind of have a problem, children, I guess you'd say she's got a son who's like 23 that

174
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:46.050
Martin Price: lives with her and, you know, they tend to find a lot and I share my problems with my daughter, who has schizophrenia and

175
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.610
Martin Price: So we connect there and she's also really into hiking in the outdoors and all that kind of stuff. So

176
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.720
Dominique Pozo: That's great.

177
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.520
Martin Price: What I'd really like to do is go sailing on Lake Michigan because she lives in Milwaukee.

178
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.780
Martin Price: Which is wrong.

179
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.440
Dominique Pozo: Oh, that sounds really fun. Well, maybe.

180
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:04.920
Martin Price: That can be

181
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.970
Dominique Pozo: Your first date.

182
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.280
Martin Price: Oh, yeah. And you know, it's like something to look forward to. Whereas here, I'm just like,

183
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.530
Martin Price: You know,

184
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.080
Martin Price: It's just me and myself, you know, trying to

185
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:26.070
Martin Price: motivate myself through the day. I mean, I know I have to work and that

186
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.650
Martin Price: That's my biggest fear is that, you know, lose my job.

187
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.610
Martin Price: So as the guy said spirits now fear is not a spiritual value.

188
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.030
Dominique Pozo: So that

189
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.260
Martin Price: My counselor. He's got all kinds of stuff like that to say

190
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.310
Dominique Pozo: What do you think about that. What, what do you think about that phrase.

191
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.660
I'm

192
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.940
Martin Price: I'm in a lot of fear and I think I kind of use the buprenorphine to cope

193
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:15.990
Martin Price: Because it does settle me down, that's for sure. I'll try and read as long as I can in the morning like till nine or 10 you know before I take it and

194
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.100
Martin Price: It just kind of

195
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.470
Martin Price: Helps me settle down.

196
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.950
Dominique Pozo: So what I'm thinking is we need to work on more coping skills.

197
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.790
Dominique Pozo: We need to work on more ways that you can self soothe yourself.

198
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.370
Dominique Pozo: To self sooth, so that

199
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.510
Dominique Pozo: You can start to let go of the people morphine and kind of loosen the grip of because it sounds like it's a bit of a crutch right now.

200
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.740
Martin Price: Oh sure, yeah.

201
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.240
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so

202
00:19:49.980 --> 00:20:01.410
Dominique Pozo: What do you think in the next week because it's we're on Monday. So we've got a whole week to, you know, to, you can practice this throughout the week. What, what skills do you have that you maybe you're not using

203
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.520
Martin Price: Meditating and

204
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.560
Martin Price: But I'm not really following through on that.

205
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.930
Martin Price: I've been doing one exercise I you know I do get out at least once a day and go to the dog park with George

206
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.150
Martin Price: Like there's online na meetings.

207
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.430
Martin Price: But you know, I personally just don't think they're very accepting of the whole medically assisted treatment idea, you know, at least not the ones

208
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.470
Martin Price: You know what, I wonder that I think we talked about this, I'm wonder if there's some online.

209
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.260
Martin Price: Because I went to some of the podcast websites that you were talking about.

210
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:51.690
Martin Price: It.

211
00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:04.170
Martin Price: I was thinking of something more recovery oriented like what I mean, just a few that I listened to. They were just talking kind of about current topics and stuff like that.

212
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.650
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want something more related to recovery. I got it. Yeah.

213
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:15.300
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll find out there's, I know there's one patient on the in the Wednesday group that

214
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:25.860
Dominique Pozo: She has a great website and I can't remember Cy podcast site. I can't remember off the top of my head what it's called but I'll ask her. They'll send her an email after this, and then I'll email it to you.

215
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.220
Martin Price: Okay, I know, Kimmy had some too but

216
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.940
Martin Price: She's a singer and a while.

217
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:40.530
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Thank you for reminding me. I'm going to take make a little note here kami moved to Vermont. Gosh.

218
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.550
Martin Price: She moved her

219
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.970
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, she's not in the group anymore. Unfortunately,

220
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.510
Dominique Pozo: But that's great because I need to send her an email and then I can ask her about, you know, any resources that

221
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.830
Martin Price: She's mentioning group.

222
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.490
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

223
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.360
All right.

224
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.630
Dominique Pozo: So,

225
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:07.860
Dominique Pozo: Okay so meditating and more support but support that you feel comfortable and safe to share what you're doing to

226
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:17.280
Martin Price: Yeah. So I mean, to me, like maybe I could look up you know Suboxone recovery groups online or something.

227
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.620
Dominique Pozo: That's good. Are you making a list of things.

228
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.970
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, great.

229
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.100
Martin Price: Um, you know, similar to our groups, but

230
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.450
Martin Price: You know, maybe a group of people who are like

231
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.620
Martin Price: Trying to taper to and that are

232
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.860
Martin Price: Sharing ways that they get it.

233
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:54.690
Dominique Pozo: I think that's great. I think especially because you keep naming that you're you know you you really long for more connection and you're getting

234
00:22:55.170 --> 00:23:07.440
Dominique Pozo: Being able to get that connection and be able to talk openly about your process. And I think one, it may normalize what you're going through a little more and to inspire you, you know, inspire you, like, okay, these people

235
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.000
Martin Price: You know, somebody else did it.

236
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.020
Martin Price: knows it.

237
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.520
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

238
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:20.190
Martin Price: Because I don't. I mean, I don't really in our groups. They're just talking about their days and stuff like that. It's not as much about

239
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.760
Martin Price: I know there's a person or two. I think it was Internet was trying to taper.

240
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.550
Martin Price: And that's, yeah, that's what I'd like to get around.

241
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.040
Martin Price: We it's funny. We've talked about like having an NA group here in Santa Fe that

242
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.130
Martin Price: Like call it the medically assisted treatment group or something.

243
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.640
Yeah.

244
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.370
Martin Price: ever really

245
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:56.730
Martin Price: This is just here. It's not that progressive of a fellowship, you know, isn't a lot of tolerance towards

246
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.140
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

247
00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.130
You know,

248
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:09.480
Martin Price: So there's that. And then you're saying like report recovery podcast.

249
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:13.740
Dominique Pozo: Yep.

250
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.020
Dominique Pozo: Oh, you know, it was a good one. Russell Brand he

251
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.910
Martin Price: Has one called under the skin.

252
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.210
Dominique Pozo: And his, his. Do you know Russell Brand

253
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.700
Martin Price: Or whatever.

254
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.040
Dominique Pozo: Dude. Yeah, yeah.

255
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:40.740
Dominique Pozo: He was actually he was a perfect yeah he's hilarious and he's kind of brilliant. He was hardcore heroin addict for a long time.

256
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:55.770
Dominique Pozo: And then he sobered himself up and he's, he's a brilliant man he's really astute and he's kind of can be a little kind of crass and and maybe raunchy sometimes, but he's he's I think he's another great resource.

257
00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:04.770
Dominique Pozo: For good idea and you know he has with his podcast under the skin. I think he has Collins and people can ask him questions.

258
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:15.780
Dominique Pozo: I would really check him out, because maybe you know maybe you have a question that you can put out to him and he might give you a really, you know, intelligent and informed answer because he's been through it, you know.

259
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.520
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

260
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.790
Martin Price: Under the Skin

261
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:21.870
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

262
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.460
Dominique Pozo: And I think he's spells skin sky, and I think

263
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:49.380
Dominique Pozo: So, okay, those are a few things. And what do you think, what would a reasonable doable goal be for the next week that you can really meet or or maybe three goals from from what you've written down. What are three steps and actions you can take this week to do something different.

264
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.250
Martin Price: Well, definitely. I like him so

265
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.500
Martin Price: I'm writing. Okay.

266
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.520
Martin Price: Mean, I've got group tomorrow night, and then

267
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.910
Martin Price: That personality test Lee.

268
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.930
Dominique Pozo: Oh. Uh huh.

269
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.110
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

270
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.820
Martin Price: That's good. I'm keeping

271
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.030
Dominique Pozo: You've got some activities.

272
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:11.910
Dominique Pozo: Well, you mentioned meditation. What could you realistically commit to if you're not, are you, are you taking the time to do that. Or it's just more of a concept of what you maybe want to, or should do.

273
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:19.020
Martin Price: I was trying to do it right when I woke up like I'd wake up early, like at five or 530 and I was trying to

274
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:27.840
Martin Price: Like meditate them, but I kept falling back asleep and and then the alarm to go off and it was time to go, you know, to get up.

275
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.490
Martin Price: So,

276
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.790
Martin Price: I don't know when a good time. I mean, they say one of the best times to do it is to start your day, you know,

277
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:39.990
Yeah.

278
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.160
Martin Price: You know, I kind of do repetitive pairs. When I go to bed, but

279
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.140
Martin Price: I don't know if they're having much of an effect or not.

280
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.080
Dominique Pozo: Well, it doesn't sound like it's harming you so it could be something to keep

281
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.890
Yeah.

282
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.280
Martin Price: I mean, I could also see my counselor, the spiritual counselor guy.

283
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.040
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Yeah. That's support for you.

284
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.910
Martin Price: Or trying to stick it out. One thing I could do is like

285
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.400
Martin Price: Do a zoom

286
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.410
Martin Price: In a meeting only with the group back in Janesville

287
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.650
Martin Price: Instead, because that's going back to anyway.

288
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.490
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

289
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.220
Dominique Pozo: I think what you're doing is great, you know, getting some concrete.

290
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:21.090
Dominique Pozo: Direction, and then you can choose, you can choose what directions. You want to go in, but just, you know, not being so open ended around, you know, like, why aren't things changing or what's in my way. It's like, no, you're actually going to take some action here some some ways.

291
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.530
Martin Price: That always feels good.

292
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.190
Yeah.

293
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.960
Martin Price: Okay, so it was the Russell Brand brand.

294
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:45.660
Martin Price: Group meeting tomorrow night. Start day with meditation. See, Phil, the spiritual counselor in Janesville in a meeting in a

295
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.200
Martin Price: Good.

296
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:58.170
Dominique Pozo: Good, yeah, that's, I don't, I don't want to encourage overwhelm either where you're like, oh, there's so much to do. I'm not going to do any of it.

297
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.370
Yeah.

298
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:01.170
Martin Price: I

299
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.820
Martin Price: One thing that's not happening is that I'm not

300
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:14.670
Martin Price: It's weird. I'm not really worrying about work that's for sure obsess about that. I just am able to like detach from that but easily

301
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.230
Dominique Pozo: But that's great that's

302
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.030
One less stress.

303
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.750
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. There's a lot going on there.

304
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:25.980
Martin Price: And I have been exercising.

305
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:43.830
Dominique Pozo: That sounds good. That sounds good to everything else seems pretty heady so it sounds nice to balance it out with somebody you know some movement and just getting into your body a little more

306
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.110
Martin Price: Yeah, I just kind of have to keep it.

307
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:56.100
Martin Price: Kind of brief, you know, so that I could get back to work or so like today, I did a write a bike ride up to just a few miles and then

308
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.360
Martin Price: Like ran a mile or a mile and a half tonight.

309
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.640
Martin Price: So that's always it helps me go to sleep.

310
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.420
Dominique Pozo: Great. Yeah.

311
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.780
Dominique Pozo: Good on so many levels.

312
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:14.550
Martin Price: So,

313
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.100
Dominique Pozo: Go ahead.

314
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.860
Martin Price: Well, none of the bright heart meetings are like

315
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.380
Martin Price: Are they oriented towards tapering they have any

316
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.680
Martin Price: meetings that are oriented towards tapering

317
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:36.660
Dominique Pozo: No, I mean, we talked about it in meetings. And I'm wondering if you want to I can talk to the doctors, but if you want to jump in on Don's meeting.

318
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:50.580
Dominique Pozo: Dr. A brielle who I work with on Wednesdays at 130 she would be a really good one to get to talk to about tapering because she really in the past has encouraged people to taper.

319
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:55.080
Martin Price: Yeah I know Dr candela's much more easy going about it, you know.

320
00:31:55.110 --> 00:32:01.440
Dominique Pozo: She is so I think she'd be great resource. And I think Don might help kind of stimulate it a little more

321
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.920
Martin Price: As she she's kind of a whip cracker.

322
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:15.690
Dominique Pozo: She can be she can. She's definitely mellowed out because a lot of people weren't enjoying that. And it wasn't actually supporting their process. It was feeling very stressful for them.

323
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:16.710
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

324
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.450
Martin Price: I remember with Jody, and all that.

325
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.060
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so I think

326
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:32.550
Dominique Pozo: She's shifted a bit, and she she has a lot of information around it, too. So you know if that's something you want to do. I, I'll say it's okay, I can check in with her. But if you wanted to come

327
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:42.180
Dominique Pozo: To a meeting and you know it's a good conversation for the whole group to have. So I would definitely if you come, bring it up and say, Hey, here's where I'm at, with the tapering I'm having

328
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:56.100
Dominique Pozo: You know my fears my concerns my doubts. Can you, can we talk about it, and it'd be great to, you know, dialogue with the group because there might actually be someone in the group. Who's, who's tapered more than you have. And they can talk to you about it.

329
00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.780
Martin Price: Okay, or I can bring it up tomorrow night to writer.

330
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.830
Dominique Pozo: For sure. Yeah.

331
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:02.970
Martin Price: The taboo subject.

332
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:13.350
Dominique Pozo: No, it's actually really important one, and it's encouraged and I don't think that the patients, talk about it enough, you know, and speak to the fears and concerns and then

333
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:20.370
Dominique Pozo: The other group members. I'm sure will probably say I have the same ones and maybe some will have some insight, something to share.

334
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.890
Martin Price: Like I said, I knew that or an internet talks about it and

335
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:34.530
Martin Price: Like I said there was that one girl that she was taking like a half every other day or something. It was pretty amazing.

336
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.490
Martin Price: Program along, long time.

337
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.310
Dominique Pozo: Maybe, maybe, I don't know.

338
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.070
Martin Price: That was, you know, that's kind of inspirational for me to see that.

339
00:33:47.550 --> 00:34:00.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. And one thing I'll just share that I've witnessed is that's taken years you know it's been it's been a process. And I think she's doing so well because she didn't rush it. She didn't try to just, like, you know, get it over with. And

340
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:12.990
Dominique Pozo: Because I think, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, and if this doesn't resonate just throw it out really take it with a grain of salt. Although what I am perceiving is that

341
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:26.610
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering if you know your desire to just, you know, go to a treatment facility help have them help you taper and get down quick and then be done. It's actually, I think it's skipping over

342
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:33.360
Dominique Pozo: You know, a lot of the things that if another crisis or challenge comes up in life you know

343
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.690
Dominique Pozo: Hopefully you're, you're going to be building skills on how to deal with it over time and not just like

344
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:50.700
Dominique Pozo: Try to wrap it up really quick and then get through it. It's like, well, actually this is a process and it takes time and it takes a lot of, you know, moving through difficult things and unwinding and

345
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.580
Dominique Pozo: Does that do you

346
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.680
Martin Price: Like yeah, I'm very

347
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.560
Martin Price: Like results oriented or whatever.

348
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.180
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's the sense of

349
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.290
Things.

350
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.980
Martin Price: Yeah, last time I did it.

351
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:12.630
Martin Price: It wasn't enduring, you know, and I went to na meetings and stuff like that. I and I worked on my steps, but

352
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.920
Martin Price: I just remember feeling so lousy and sick that uh

353
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.380
Martin Price: I finally

354
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.560
Martin Price: Took some cough syrup. But coding in it you know because I've

355
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.880
Martin Price: gone to the doctor and

356
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.290
Martin Price: Then it just kind of start it all up. Again, you know,

357
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:31.920
Yeah.

358
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.150
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think that that's my

359
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:46.620
Dominique Pozo: It's not a huge concern, but something I'm aware of is that the seems like it's a fractal of, you know, a pattern in your life.

360
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.970
Martin Price: That is

361
00:35:48.420 --> 00:36:01.380
Dominique Pozo: You know, and if you can really address this this particular story and the pattern that it would, it may serve you moving forward to not, you know, to not keep a certain pattern of that.

362
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:11.430
Dominique Pozo: That, in a sense, like it's almost like it binds you to a certain way of being, or you're, you're like captive to the pattern.

363
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:12.570
Yeah.

364
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.340
Martin Price: I know exactly what you mean. It's kind of like tour of the band aid and

365
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:21.690
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

366
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:35.730
Dominique Pozo: And I mean I'm just gonna reflect back like you've done really good honest work the time that we've been working together. And I've seen improvements and shifts, you know, and I

367
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:44.310
Dominique Pozo: I think maybe it's harder for you because you're just in it and you're you're going through it every day. But I've noticed some shifts so i i think that

368
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:57.360
Dominique Pozo: If anything, I see it as an opportunity like wow it's it's not going to happen in one week but I I believe in you to break the pattern and and i'm i really hope that it will just serve you moving forward.

369
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:03.630
Martin Price: Yeah, and not just, I don't know how I could fit in.

370
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.890
Martin Price: Like, first of all, the treatment centers so constantly and the other part of it is that

371
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.990
Martin Price: You know, I've been around me a lot. And so

372
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:27.810
Martin Price: It's just, I've heard lessons I've heard it a lot, you know, I'm not being condescending. I'm just saying that it's like saying I

373
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.330
Martin Price: You know, I've been through the steps and had been

374
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.900
Martin Price: To probably 1000 meetings and

375
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.970
Martin Price: Their answer would be, well just quit using and keep coming back, you know,

376
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:49.890
Martin Price: It's really just didn't quite work for me last time. I don't know if like

377
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.640
Martin Price: I know part of it last time was

378
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:59.370
Martin Price: Trying to live with my daughter and deal with her. That was like one of the most difficult things I've ever done.

379
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.150
Martin Price: It was like

380
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.290
Is

381
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.380
Martin Price: You know, at least for a year.

382
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.020
Martin Price: Yeah.

383
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.850
Martin Price: Okay, well, I'll try not to get so

384
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:21.240
Martin Price: Anxious and, you know, wanting to make it all happen. Now, you know,

385
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.840
Martin Price: Even though I'd like to

386
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.310
Dominique Pozo: I just had this thought to

387
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.880
Dominique Pozo: What what

388
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:43.050
Dominique Pozo: When you were young, like a little like a child. And maybe you would have a tantrum about things, who was there.

389
00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:49.590
Dominique Pozo: Was any. Was there any adult there to help kind of soothe you and calm you down.

390
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:55.380
Martin Price: Yeah, I just didn't work that way in our household. It just wasn't like that.

391
00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:02.520
Martin Price: It was be like I throw a tantrum and my brother like

392
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.010
Martin Price: You know, call me a baby and tell me to shut up or whatever.

393
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:13.740
Martin Price: And it was because my dad was so rough on him. You know, so he took it out on me.

394
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:22.710
Martin Price: And there's just, you know, I'd forgotten about all that for a long time. But then when you get into kind of low periods in your life where things are difficult than

395
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.710
Martin Price: That's like me.

396
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.190
Martin Price: And you really meet yourself.

397
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.010
Dominique Pozo: Well,

398
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.940
Martin Price: It could be awesome for all the stuff I've been ignoring or something.

399
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.140
Dominique Pozo: Totally, yeah, it's, it's, it's, you can't deny it.

400
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:49.650
Martin Price: Just have a good job and a lot of money saved and and a wife and you know i'll be happy.

401
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.250
Martin Price: I've got a good job that's

402
00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.560
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah you got, you know, one of those is boxes is checked at the moment.

403
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:15.270
Dominique Pozo: I think that's why I'm really encouraging you to turn towards the discomfort, rather than away from it because it's not going to go away if you don't tend to it and i mean you know that

404
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.430
Martin Price: I just don't know what to do.

405
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:29.010
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think you're exploring it. I think you're in a process of exploration and learning how to move with it and it's not totally clear yet and

406
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.580
Dominique Pozo: That's what I see and

407
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:41.100
Dominique Pozo: You know, throw it out. If it doesn't, again, if it doesn't like land for you yet. I just as you are.

408
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:52.680
Dominique Pozo: Well, also, when you said like I just want it now and I just want it to happen. I just went now i i really i like saw a young little young boy. And I think nobody

409
00:40:53.010 --> 00:41:03.450
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering if anybody modeled for you or gave you the the experience the felt sense of, hey, this is how we calm ourselves down when we get anxious

410
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:10.590
Dominique Pozo: When things aren't going our way when we want something that's not happening. This is the way to calm yourself down. It's going to whatever you know

411
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:28.230
Dominique Pozo: And maybe you didn't. You didn't get the modeling because your dad. It sounds like from what I hear you know he was a ranger and he would just, you know, erupt and have his, his adult tantrum, which didn't really give you a good example of how to how to self regulate

412
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.060
Martin Price: Was always like, I would just try and be the opposite, which is like

413
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.980
Martin Price: You know bottling things up inside, you know,

414
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.840
Dominique Pozo: And have no needs.

415
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.510
Dominique Pozo: Or at least pretend like you don't have any needs.

416
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.510
Martin Price: Yeah. Exactly. That's exactly what I do.

417
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:49.320
Yeah.

418
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.490
Dominique Pozo: And that's just not human. We all have needs.

419
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.460
Martin Price: Right, but I'm afraid to express them. Yeah.

420
00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:09.540
Dominique Pozo: Well, you're I think you're doing great in our sessions i mean i i really i i hear your honesty and your genuine and you know not afraid to say what's really going on for you. I hear that

421
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:21.510
Dominique Pozo: I think a lot. I'm just going to put this out as another possibility of something to work on this week is to

422
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:33.420
Dominique Pozo: If you're starting to feel anxious really think back to that little boy. And just imagine it's the little boy that's anxious and if you are going to talk to the little boy. What would you say to suit him or calmed him down.

423
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.780
Martin Price: Like it's all gonna work out.

424
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.060
Martin Price: Don't worry, and

425
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:47.130
Dominique Pozo: And and what do you need. Should we go for a walk. What would, what would help you to take a deep breath right now, you know,

426
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.820
Martin Price: Yeah, my go to is always been exercise, you know,

427
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.550
Martin Price: That's like one of my big coping things for anxiety.

428
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:09.390
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and that's, I think it's, it can be healthy, unless it gets out of balance and it's it kind of starts to deny what's actually happening because you're checking out, you know,

429
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.100
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

430
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.380
Martin Price: That's been my pattern.

431
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:18.060
Dominique Pozo: Well, this is great, you know, it's really shining a light on the pattern.

432
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:26.460
Martin Price: Yeah, my second wife, she was very much about like no conflict, no anger. She didn't

433
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:34.170
Martin Price: She didn't like conflict or anger at all. You know, she wanted everything to be smooth and light and

434
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.570
Martin Price: You know, towards the end, like the therapists are telling me how

435
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.330
Martin Price: You have to be able to

436
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:57.270
Martin Price: express your problems with her behavior, you know, to, it's like, and it was weird because when I did when I did that she just got really upset.

437
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.420
Martin Price: You know, it was like

438
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.350
Martin Price: So I was always the one to apologize.

439
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.920
Martin Price: Just a big apologiser

440
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:14.790
Martin Price: So I have been learning. Yeah, over the last few years, like you're not always wrong and

441
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.380
Martin Price: And to be real. This is like the whole

442
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:27.120
Martin Price: You know, like I've been trying to rent a house in Janesville, and these scammers are just popping up all over the place with

443
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:35.220
Martin Price: They find homes for sale. And then they get on Craigslist and say that they're the owner and they try and run them.

444
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:37.500
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

445
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:47.160
Martin Price: Yeah, they get you to send them like 1300 dollars as the rat in the damage deposit and and they weren't even, you know,

446
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.350
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah, this

447
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.330
Martin Price: One guy. He's like, I'm Stephen Kramer and it sounded like he was literally

448
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.620
Martin Price: Just off the boat from Honduras or something. I mean his

449
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.250
Martin Price: He could barely speak English, you know,

450
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.510
Martin Price: He's trying to convince me that he Stephen Kramer

451
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.350
Martin Price: Crazy.

452
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.210
Martin Price: They're out there you know

453
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:23.100
Martin Price: Yeah. So yeah, I'm learning, especially in that last relationship with Michelle. It's just like I have to learn to

454
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:31.620
Martin Price: Not be so generous and trusting and just, you know, take care of myself, focus on taking care of myself.

455
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:49.830
Dominique Pozo: I think a big thing to to just keep remembering to is that your needs matter. You know, I think that's a really powerful statement for all of us. I mean, this is not just personal to you know, Marty. This is across the board, you know,

456
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.410
Dominique Pozo: To just keep remembering and believing that our needs met your needs matter.

457
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.860
Martin Price: Yeah, because, like, you know, I see my tendency with April to just be like,

458
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:13.980
Martin Price: You know you're having a hard time, you know, it sounds like you're doing the best you can and you know I'm always in this kind of consoling mode and

459
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.190
Martin Price: Is a very problems with their son and everything.

460
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.520
Martin Price: That's just kind of my natural inclination, I guess.

461
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:39.090
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's take a moment. We've got a few more minutes left in the session. Let's just take a moment if you're willing to close your eyes and just have some self connection.

462
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.340
Dominique Pozo: And

463
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.690
Dominique Pozo: Just connect to your breath for a moment that breath moving

464
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:51.750
Dominique Pozo: Through your body

465
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:11.790
Dominique Pozo: And feeling your, your, the root of your pelvis on connected to that chair.

466
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:24.510
Dominique Pozo: Feeling the ground beneath you holding you supporting you and as you exhale, just you know how much more deeply. Can you relax.

467
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.360
Dominique Pozo: Towards the ground.

468
00:47:49.740 --> 00:48:01.560
Dominique Pozo: Just without any judgment on it, just take a moment to, you know, what are you, what are you feeling right now. What's most present. If you check into your status.

469
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:33.870
Dominique Pozo: Know you did a lot of work today really like just processing, you know, looking at things. And if you feel like going to bed. I'm gonna encourage you to take a nap and let your psyche process. You know what we've talked about because you did a lot today.

470
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:35.850
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.
