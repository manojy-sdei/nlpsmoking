00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm okay what's happening.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.120
Cricket Icon: Just say mall just trying to get out of this apartment.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.880
Cricket Icon: That's been really, really, really busy.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's the latest update

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:56.790
Cricket Icon: The managers here. Give me a hard time to give me the paperwork to move to the other permit complex that I got so I'm like in the verge of losing that other apartment she expects me to move out to not being in order to get that people or so. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I should expect you to move out first, before she gives you the paperwork.

11
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.420
Cricket Icon: Yeah.

12
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:17.790
Cricket Icon: She told me to two stories which sounded like lies, for she told me that she's not able to give me the ledger showing that I owe their balance and and

13
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:30.330
Cricket Icon: Because they their management change and you need to switch the system is a switch from Wesley to matrix, I guess they're going to they

14
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:40.620
Cricket Icon: Don't make no and she said that it's going to take a while for to 200 apartments to update and she's also not able to give you wait until it's finished updating

15
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:52.140
Cricket Icon: An inch told me they told me, but if you were to move out within the next three to seven days, I would be able to print that out view. It's like, what

16
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They don't Nancy, do

17
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, why can't you do it now.

18
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.920
Cricket Icon: Well, you just finished saying that you don't know when when when this isn't going to finish updating and then you can print it out until it up the

19
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.570
Cricket Icon: So she's just she's giving me a hard time like my attorney out of y'all. She pretty much there. There's nothing she could do about it. She tried

20
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:33.600
Cricket Icon: She tried to stick with the manager and the manager told me to speak to her attorney. She, she didn't want it to her at all. And now she's treating me even worse because she knows that I have an attorney and it's discrimination, but nobody else. No, no one else sees it me

21
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.310
Cricket Icon: That's just crazy and

22
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will the new landlord.

23
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try to call the this landlord to get the information

24
00:02:45.690 --> 00:03:00.510
Cricket Icon: Well, she said that there is nothing she can call for that she needs to send she needs to give me the ledger herself or fax it to them, but she does not want to do that.

25
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.250
Cricket Icon: And then

26
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.980
Cricket Icon: With this Court situation. She's taking a chance. Take me to core and

27
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:23.940
Cricket Icon: I don't understand why because the other manager from the other apartments of the I want to move to told me, Well, I'm a manager. So I know all this works like she's all you paid everything off. Right. And I said, Yes, I was only only $300 behind

28
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:39.840
Cricket Icon: I mean I had, you know, if I were to show them my checks up from that month they would understand why that my hours fell back and up here like maybe 200 and $201 in February in February.

29
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.790
Cricket Icon: And then, and I didn't make no other check. Besides that, check.

30
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.440
Cricket Icon: Yeah, anyway.

31
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.280
Cricket Icon: So anyways, um,

32
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.840
Cricket Icon: So, oh gosh, I'm so stressed out.

33
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.680
Cricket Icon: So anyway, the, the manager.

34
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:10.680
Cricket Icon: From about Maria. She told me that she thought if you paid everything off and you don't know anything. She said,

35
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:24.540
Cricket Icon: All she has to do is fill out a dismissal form and send it to the judge and just dismiss this case. And just as long as you're out by the 30th, like she asked, because I put on my 30 day notice and

36
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:34.350
Cricket Icon: Then she should just let you go free me like it's like she's holding on to you and I told her I know I feel like she's like obsessed with me for some reason.

37
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:47.070
Cricket Icon: Like she like wants to know where I'm moving she she that keeps making it a point like have to have the apartments Fax me and maybe maybe we'll maybe I'll be able to practice and something that maybe

38
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:59.730
Cricket Icon: What do you mean, maybe it's either you can or you can, yeah, then go through all all that and then you just want to find out where I'm going to move it and say, you never received it.

39
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:13.710
Cricket Icon: And then you start messing with my life over there and start talking saying this, not about me trying to like put me wrong when you know that I've been living here eight years and I've done nothing wrong.

40
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:23.790
Cricket Icon: Nothing right I fall behind on my rent for fun in February and March, but that's the dynamic had just just hit

41
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.210
Rd

42
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:32.520
Cricket Icon: Hours dropped and just everything started getting crazy about crazier and crazier as, as we are now.

43
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.040
Cricket Icon: So, um,

44
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:47.880
Cricket Icon: I mean, I don't know, I just, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I just, I'm just so nervous for my kids, you know, I can't be in the streets of three kids so she told me, Oh, baby.

45
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you on your own head, there's nothing they can do.

46
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.640
Cricket Icon: I want section A

47
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.980
Cricket Icon: I believe HUD is a whole different program I God is they help you buy a house.

48
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Section eight. You can't Section eight can't help you with this stuff because it's been such a struggle.

49
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:34.560
Cricket Icon: Whoa, yeah. My coordinator, Karen. She said she's gonna make a call to to where I'm going to move to the store later and she's going to talk to them and see if they'll let me move in and then and then once I move in don't show get the get the dismissal and the ledger after I moved out.

50
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

Cricket Icon: It's like I've been so so so positive.

65
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:54.930

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:12.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I can see, though, I can see it on your face the frustration, the anxiety, you know,

70
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you just got to, you know, hope that

71
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That Section eight can help get or convince the southern landlord to let you move in. You know what I mean.

72
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you right now you know as well as I do your faith is being tested. Everything is being tested right now. And if you could keep that inside your head and say this is a test. This is a test and I'm going to pass.

73
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.560

74
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.410
Cricket Icon: You know, and I'm not. That's exactly exactly what I'm doing. I'm just

75
00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:03.480
Cricket Icon: It's like, I know it's like, I feel, I feel like she's trying to break me, you know, because she sees me as such a positive person. I think it bothers her

76
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:13.830
Cricket Icon: You know, because no matter how mean she has to be no matter what she does to me. I'm still I'm still respectful.

77
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:30.510
Cricket Icon: Because I'm not that I just thought that kind of person. I don't want somebody mean to me. I'm not, I'm not going to, you know, bite back. I'm just going to be like, Okay, if that's the way you feel. Then, you know, so be it. But I'm not gonna

78
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.470

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.920
Cricket Icon: I don't know who's trying to call. I'm sorry. I'll get to them after I meet with you, um,

81
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.950
Cricket Icon: But yeah, I just

82
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:22.740
Cricket Icon: I am I, that's, that's the first thing I thought is, you know, my faith is being tested right now and I'm not gonna, I'm not going to give up hope. I'm not going to give up my positive you know staying positive. I'm not going to give up my happiness.

83
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

84
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.140
Cricket Icon: Because she might pull that away from me, take it away from me.

85
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because then she wins. Yeah, don't let her, don't let her

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

87
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:49.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I know is that that somehow this is going to work out and it might not work out the way that you hoped that it would, but somehow this is going to be surfaced and

88
00:10:50.940 --> 00:11:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things are going to be okay. You've been such a good head space, you've been doing the next right thing for such a long time that it cannot. You know what I mean and ruin have, you know, you have your higher power Rosa, that is backing you 100%

Cricket Icon: You know,

93
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No matter what

Cricket Icon: Be like aggressive towards her so that she could have a reason demo and tell like the other managers well

97
00:11:51.750 --> 00:12:02.730
Cricket Icon: You know, like she told me off, and she doesn't. She doesn't respect and, you know, like, blah, blah, blah. She snapped back at me, and she told me this and she told me that I'm going to give her that that power.

98
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.560
Cricket Icon: I'm not, no matter how

99
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.390

Cricket Icon: You know all this senior head. It makes sense. So we'll just keep it that way, like I talked to her like that. And she gets she gets mad like she's like peers. They shoot, I can hear it. I can hear it through her voice, even though I don't see her face.

104

107
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:09.840
Cricket Icon: If you're going to have the other apartments and me something, then maybe I could send them something back that could help you Rosa.

108
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:23.880
Cricket Icon: But I don't know, other than that I can do anything for you okay dosa so if you end up on the streets with your kids. That's your problem rosov there's other places. There's the S bit off the estimate on thought shelter.

Cricket Icon: And she started naming all kinds of list of shelters. I'm gonna

110
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:43.320
Cricket Icon: I'm like, You know what, whatever, like I pray for you. That's all I can do is pray for you because you you I didn't tell her this but I was thinking this, I was thinking, you know, like, I know you're trying to break me right now.

Cricket Icon: I know you want me to snap back them off. Oh, I mean, all I think in my head is I pray for you. They really do hope that God helps you find a better place in your heart.

Cricket Icon: She doesn't want to give me the name. She don't want to give me the name. She says she tells me that the owners want me out. But you can't prove it.

117
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:35.640
Cricket Icon: I asked. I told her cat you if the owners specifically wanted me out for for two months of rent $130 each each month.

118
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.490
Cricket Icon: I mean,

119
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:48.960
Cricket Icon: I figured that they would have wrote me a letter themselves, you know, stating, you know, we were the owners of Tuscany, you know,

120
00:14:49.500 --> 00:15:02.970
Cricket Icon: We are asking that that to leave our premises do today is due to that. But no, she she just keeps on saying that it's the owners. I want me out that that she can give me. No, no. Another their information.

121
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:18.630
Cricket Icon: That there's no way that I can contact them. She said that she can even contact them that she has to speak to the manager and only her manager can contact them. She thought she says I have a manager tutorial saw that I need to answer to

122
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.610
Cricket Icon: And it's like,

123

128
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:59.820
Cricket Icon: And if her manager, Doug. No, she's telling her things bad things about me that are not true.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:17.130
Cricket Icon: Yeah, because if she doesn't get her managers number that obviously

132
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:24.540
Cricket Icon: Obviously, she's telling her manager things about me that are not true, and she doesn't want me to find out about it.

133
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What city. Do you live in.

134
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.730
Cricket Icon: Santa Fe, New Mexico State New Mexico City Santa Fe.

135
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:55.620

136
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:10.320
Cricket Icon: Yeah, whenever I've already. That's when you when you look up Tuscany. That's the first thing that comes up is living peak. So that's the closest thing I've LA, I looked up living PK called the number and they told me that they had nothing to do with Tuscany.

137
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:14.220
Cricket Icon: So,

138
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fast quick are

139
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to see there's gotta be a way that you can get that information.

140
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.930
Cricket Icon: Internet I tried just asking her, just, you know, woman. A woman face to face.

141
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nothing.

142
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does your lawyer know

143
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your lawyer.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:07.440
Cricket Icon: My trainees aware of it, my attorney. Try to get in all the information but Queen. I told her I can speak to you. There's nothing I have to say call my attorney. That's it. She said, and she told her, and

145
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.410
Cricket Icon: She told her. Okay. It was nice talking. Was I talking to you. You have a good day. Bye. And she hung up on my attorney.

146
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So who is her who's the apartment complexes lawyer. I mean, can you

147
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:30.240
Cricket Icon: I don't know. I would have to ask my attorney that I didn't even ask her, just once she told me that she just pretty much told me, like, in other words, I'm sorry. It also I tried everything.

148
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:39.120
Cricket Icon: I can do for you. She doesn't want to speak to me without her attorney president and she said that that it just

149
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.910
Cricket Icon: It will just proceed.

150
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:51.630
Cricket Icon: Things will just it'll just make things worse. She said, If I get in contact with her attorney, they'll turn into a real court case and

151
00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:02.640
Cricket Icon: Mean like lawyers will be involved and all that and it'll just, she said, You'll just make everything proceed longer and longer and

152
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:18.750
Cricket Icon: She said, You'll you will end up in this with your kids. She's also you're better off just just trying to just bargain with her and just trying to just get it to dismiss this just like the way the other manager from from the so they get permits told me to.

153
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:30.900
Cricket Icon: Kind of just to dismiss this and just give you the ledger. That's all you need. That's all you need to move out here. That's all I need. And she does not want to give it to me.

154
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.340
Cricket Icon: And I literally told her over the phone. I told her so.

155
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:44.340
Cricket Icon: If you can't give me any of that. Would you expect me to do move out to my van and pull my stuff outside and then you'll give it to me.

156
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:57.960
Cricket Icon: Will you give it to me that if I push or pull put throw my stuff outside and she's all know dosa know your stuff can be on my property. So no, I would not. I'm sorry. I didn't get some T shirts crying.

157
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:58.860
It's okay.

158
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.370
Cricket Icon: If she said no you care.

159
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:17.010
Cricket Icon: She said, No, you can't. You can't put this stuff on my property. She told me

160
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:27.510
Cricket Icon: She said, You need to move it to a storage or or to a new place you're going to move into if if that's what you want. If you want to

161
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:34.560
Cricket Icon: If you want the ledger and and if you want to get this case to Smith.

162
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:50.910
Cricket Icon: So it's like it's like every option. I try to like bargain with her and just every option I bring up. She comes up with with just say something negative, something

163
00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:08.910
Cricket Icon: Negative. I'm like, I don't know that quitting on I tell her. There's either just know working there. Just know, working with you. There's no bargaining with you. There's, there's just no no talking to you, like, I try to talk to you with respect and and kindness and

164
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.490
Cricket Icon: You just, you just

165
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:18.450
Cricket Icon: You just talk to me with with the opposite. You know, you

166
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:29.550
Cricket Icon: Yeah, me with no respect. You don't want to give me no information which you know you can, which are my rights i mean i i pay rent. So I have

167
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.390
Cricket Icon: My right

168
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:44.520
Cricket Icon: To get them, but the to your manager, I have the right to have a number to the owners, I have that right right IP route. You're just a manager you. It's just, this is just your job.

169
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.360
You do. Right.

170
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.270
Cricket Icon: And and she just starts going all out overall saw

171
00:21:52.440 --> 00:22:03.420
Cricket Icon: That. No, that's not true. That doesn't make any sense. You don't know anything about my job. So they don't speak about don't talk about my job. This is about you and she just tried to flip things around and

172
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:12.870
Cricket Icon: She's just empty just an impossible person. That's it. That's it. That's just the best way to describe her. She's just impossible. She's just impossible.

173
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:24.390
Cricket Icon: To just I can't, I can't get through to her. I can't, I can't make her understand that I have three kids. It's like, I have three kids, you have kids yourself.

174
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:37.110
Cricket Icon: I figured you would at least have a heart and say, yeah, of course, you know, I'll give them what they need so that you could move into that apartment, you have children that you need to put a roof over their head.

175
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But she died.

176
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She doesn't care.

177
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.650
Cricket Icon: To don't don't at all. She told me herself. She said, this ain't my problem. I don't, I don't care. This problem.

178
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.320
Cricket Icon: This is your problem to told me

179
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Has she given you any paperwork, yet at all.

180
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.300
No.

181
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.060
Cricket Icon: Because

182
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you still have your rental agreement.

183
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.650
Cricket Icon: Yes.

184
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the information might be on the rental agreement.

185
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:23.340
Cricket Icon: Yeah, you know what, you're right. I read it, I mean, of course, because I've been living here eight years. So I read it, maybe eight years ago, but

186
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:40.890
Cricket Icon: I honestly don't remember what specifically it states. So after this meeting. I'm going to read that rental agreement. So thank you for reminding me about that because that rental agreement. I'm sure states, a lot of facts and and

187
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like who the owners are

188
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.540
Cricket Icon: Not exactly.

189
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:59.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that there has to be another way around around her so that you can get the information that you need and I if you know honestly I would put in an official complaint.

190
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:12.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, once you're out of there. I would put an official complaint to the company about, you know, this whole scenario because it puts you at such high risk and you have three children.

191
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:26.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it. There's no reason why she can't call the other place and say, hey, we're updating our system. I can't pull it off the computer, but I'm more than willing to verbally give you what you need, or write it out for you, she could do something

192
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know her unwillingness to proceed forward is

193
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is ridiculous and it is, you know, unfair to you and your children.

194
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:59.520
Cricket Icon: The discrimination. She, she's discriminating on me. You don't like me. I don't know if it's because of my race or because how I look or how I dress or how I talk or because she can get me mad. She discriminating discrimination.

195
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She can

196
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You push your buttons.

197
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:03.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

198
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.310
Cricket Icon: To accomplish my yeah

199
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She's asking me

200
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.140
Cricket Icon: For some reason, and I don't know what it is, but she just

201
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:19.110
Cricket Icon: She has never liked me for the past four years that she's been managing this place I've been here eight years. And the first manager for the first four years.

202
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:32.190
Cricket Icon: It was Tessa. She was a great manager, she I mean she helped people out, you know, she was just she was great. She managed the property, the way it was supposed to be.

203
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:41.160
Cricket Icon: You know, to work with the people you know on jujitsu just a good person. She would have never done nothing like this to me never

204
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:58.200
Cricket Icon: In a million years and and i know i know that that she's been waiting for me to fall behind them a rent to do this to me. I knew it. It's like, and then it's like it's like I told you I went and I told her that I had in or in organization.

205
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:12.510
Cricket Icon: That that wanted to pay not just February's rent for me but marches room for me as well too. I told her, and it's a sad thing is up. I talked to her about it already. And she agreed.

206
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:32.010
Cricket Icon: You know, she said, okay, that's fine, but where I messed up. I trust it to tell her the day I had my appointment with the organization which was March 12 and she went march 11 the day before I was going to get the payment for her and took the tour.

207
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.980
Cricket Icon: That just shows me that she she literally did it on purpose.

208
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you know, with the corner virus going on, and everyone's hours being cut. And the way that things have been, you know what I mean, there's a lot of landlords that are are really giving grace periods, because of it. And it's a shame that you know that she's so

209
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Against helping somebody you know

210
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I would definitely you know look at your rental agreement, see who the owners are on that, you know, contact them. Let them know you know what it is that you desperately need.

211
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:19.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and that you've been attendant for eight years with no issues you know they you know that's hard to come by.

212
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:27.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good tenants are hard to come by and you've been one for eight years. You know what I mean. And

213
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:35.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would, you know, tell them what stress. This is put under you. I, you know, and that you know this is not okay.

214
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.760
Cricket Icon: Lot of mental anguish.

215
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.570
I'm sorry.

216
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:48.390
Cricket Icon: But it is a mental anguish and it's like my 13 year old understands everything that's going on.

217
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

218
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.250
Cricket Icon: So, it kills me inside because

219
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.080
Cricket Icon: She's

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.230
Cricket Icon: She's, she's like, you know, like Monique, what are we going to do

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:37.260
Cricket Icon: I just I just, I just don't know anymore. I'm just leaving it in God's hands.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's not fair to you and it's not fair to your daughter. You know, it's just not fair.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:03.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

242
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:12.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would look, again, I would look. And here's another thing is that you have stood up for yourself to this landlord, and then I like that. They like to have that control.

243

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And tell you what you're going to do.

244

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get the owner's name call them, ask them for that paperwork. Let them know how

252
00:30:53.310 --> 00:31:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know uncooperative this person has been and you don't have to say anything bad. You don't have to say anything bad about her other than, you know, this is what you need, you're desperate for it. It's the only way that you can, you know, move, could they possibly get that for you.

253
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,
