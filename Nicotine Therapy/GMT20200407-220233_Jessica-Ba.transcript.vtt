Patricia Naranjo: Out.

189
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Real life experiences that make you have worried for your granddaughter.

190
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.220
Patricia Naranjo: Anything bad anything bad you know

191
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of the things that I want you to prepare for

192
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: going there because

193
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:22.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, we spent a lot of time working together on the soul concerned being that relationship with your daughter and communication. So, this time around.

194
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:30.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The wise thing would be to already put things in place so that the dynamic can be different.

195
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But the dynamic to be different. You have to present different

196
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:43.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in the past. I remember you told me you were pasa, you didn't say much when your daughter.

197
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would do it just didn't want to upset her buddy up in pasa

198
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.870
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

199
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It just allowed for to keep coming and really didn't stop it.

200
00:19:53.580 --> 00:20:00.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It just continued. Um, so this time around. What could be done differently.

201
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.520
Patricia Naranjo: I think I would want to talk to her. I asked her, you know,

202
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.710
Patricia Naranjo: This time around different for us.

203
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

204
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.850
Patricia Naranjo: Anger.

205
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.410
You know what

206
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.560
Patricia Naranjo: To make it better.

207
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.070
Patricia Naranjo: Or what can I do, you know, it takes two people.

208
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:46.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm. Definitely. I agree. Patricia want to start before you even get there. And next time we talked you guys have been talking every day start developing that so when you get there and you know you want your daughter to see a different Patricia

209
00:20:47.550 --> 00:21:01.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Patricia that was there months ago was broken was the press was passable and carried so much guilt that she thought she deserved to be someone's punching bag.

210
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now,

211
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:17.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Russia is getting stronger. So when I hear you saying it's a plan. I just want to focus on getting stronger. My hope is it's not just physical strength but emotional strength as well.

212
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:20.940
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

213
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:28.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the way to develop that emotional spring and have to dig deep to find that own self respect for yourself.

214
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:39.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To remind yourself that even when you gotta get angry or upset that you don't deserve to be disrespected

215
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:53.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That that's going to be your communication, right. So I'm not saying that you go there. Like, I'm the boss. And this is, but I'm saying that you go there.

216
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With confidence.

217
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:15.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the shrink that you so desperately want, but whenever you talk about the strength. I hear it more in physical capacity with your leg. But again, my hope is that you yearn for that same type of strength emotionally

218
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.120
Patricia Naranjo: We have

219
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:26.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Honestly, take the emotional strain. Um, and mentality to get to the physical strength that you want.

220
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.290
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

221
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:36.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Think about the people that that exercise and go to the gym. The strong winds that you physically see the muscles.

222
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:45.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is because you see them pushing themselves in the gym and see them picking up the heavier weights, you know, they're challenging themselves.

223
00:22:45.660 --> 00:23:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So then the outward can show the work in the muscles in the strength and so work on pushing yourself challenging yourself motivate yourself so the outside strength that your daughter sees. It's only because Patricia has done the work within to get to the strength

224
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Understand what I'm saying.

225
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.540
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

226
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.070
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

227
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.460
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah, so like some days I guess when I feel down, I

228
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.870
Patricia Naranjo: Get up and go go walk around the block.

229
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:37.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Go for a walk around the block, but then also in the physical aspect, every time you do something to make yourself physically stronger.

230
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want you to ask, why are your brain to think how can I make myself mentally stronger emotionally stronger. So maybe in those walks you know you're doing those affirmations. We talked about your, your replaying all the successes and the small victories.

231
00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.440
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

232
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:10.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And your community. Okay, so when you speak with your daughter. Don't just allow it to be surface level you want to work out. Now you can see when you get there in the month.

233
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:18.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You guys are already in a good place. You don't want to go there and then try to figure it out. That's just going to be frustrating.

234
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.460
Patricia Naranjo: Right, okay.

235
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:25.710
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

236
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that next conversation look like with your daughter.

237
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:31.770
All right.

238
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me, what would you say in the next conversation.

239
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.970
Patricia Naranjo: To say well you know I'm

240
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:48.180
Patricia Naranjo: I'm mainly concerned about your you know how anybody get and, you know,

241
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.760
Patricia Naranjo: And I'm

242
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:56.370
Patricia Naranjo: Not standing up, you know, I don't have anybody that way.

243
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.040
Patricia Naranjo: To help you to anchor.

244
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:20.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What I found helpful Patricia in communicating is I feel fill in the blank. I understand. Fill in the blank. I need fill in the blank.

245
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:30.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So something like so. So conversation like this, based on what you share with me with your daughter will be something like this. For example, what's your daughter's name again.

246
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Amber.

247
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Amber.

248
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I feel

249
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:40.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hopeful

250
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About moving back in with you.

251
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:53.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand. Last time I was there. We had some challenges, but this time around I need us to communicate better

252
00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's the I feel

253
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:20.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fill in the blank and whichever feeling is applicable for you. I understand because you want her to see that you're considering her in this communication and then telling her what you need at the end because you never really communicated what she needed from your daughter.

254
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:25.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Since everything that she needed. And that's how that you build up.

255
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.450
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

256
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, okay. You remember that the I feel

257
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:43.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand, and I need. And when you just you structure your communication in that way. One, it gives you a structure so that you don't get off track.

258
00:26:43.830 --> 00:27:01.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you can just be very clear. You don't have to go on and on and on. You can just be very clear. Um, and like I said, it also allows for the other person to see what you observed from them in the relationship as well. So it doesn't seem like you're just coming in saying

259
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.650
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

260
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:06.210
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

261
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I do see that you met with them and meet for individual sessions so on.

262
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.280
Patricia Naranjo: Oh yeah, she did.

263
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.260
Patricia Naranjo: Yeah.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.120
Patricia Naranjo: Document care.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.220
Patricia Naranjo: Call

266
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Again, yeah. The treatment plan. Okay, so I'm not sure which one is going to be a therapist.

267
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm either way.

268
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:43.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want a session if you're going to continue on with Dominique, make sure you reach out to her. So that, okay, get the support you need. This time around, Patricia

269
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:54.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm hopeful that you will take advantage of the therapy that's available to you because like I said, working on the emotional strength is most important.

270
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.400
Patricia Naranjo: Okay.

271
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have any questions for me.

272
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:12.900

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You were meeting with Dominic. But yeah, just reach out to me. And when I do the sessions. I would love to continue the work that we did in the past so that we can continue working on some communication techniques with doing your daughter.

274
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.570
Patricia Naranjo: Okay, that sounds really good.
