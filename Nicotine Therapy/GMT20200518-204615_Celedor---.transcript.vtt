00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.040
Galaxy A20: When I was like 15 or 16

197

200
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.040
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yes. Awesome. It's something that you kind of put in the back of your mind.

201
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.590
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I'm glad we're having a conversation. Do you know the benefits of smoke of not smoking.

202
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.580
Oh, yeah.

203
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.350
Galaxy A20: I mean, health, big time.

204
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.660
Galaxy A20: All kinds of stuff. So

205
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:15.510
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Oh, you're right. Definitely. Definitely. I know my Panda. Okay, so one of the things that kind of jump out when I'm looking at the benefits is not smoking, many, many of people that smoke cigarettes lose about 1010 years of their life. Yeah, that's a big chunk of time.

206
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:27.900
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: The very motivating thing about when you stop smoking the minutes. The benefits can add up in minutes. Within about 30 minutes is believe that your blood pressure, heart rate can go back to normal.

207
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:45.990
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: If you stop smoking for about what is it about 48 hours, your risk of heart attack and decrease. I've had patients tell me when they start smoking for a couple of days they notice that there's smell comes back, they start writing and it tastes like I didn't know food tastes like this.

208
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.670
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: But one of the biggest things I've had a lot of patients say is that

209
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.420
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: They felt younger. So we do know that smoking.

210
00:17:54.510 --> 00:18:01.050
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Break it ages you rapidly. A lot of my papers, people who look older in their state of Asian is not you, you still

211
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:18.300
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You have a very youthful look but it does have a tendency to ages. It also has the tendency for the warriors, is that fight infection. They may not be as hard to fight off infections. A lot of my smokers do with a lot more respiratory infections. Okay. Yeah.

212
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.750
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So, but one of the main things is that

213
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:29.040
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: When you finally stopped smoking, you feel younger because you're going up to heal. Are you going up the stairs and you're not shorter breath and the

214
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:39.450
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Third stare, and I've had a lot of patients to say, Look, I can keep up with my key is and keep a migraine key is now. And so the patients out of best advocates actually

215
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.100
Galaxy A20: But yeah, but yeah.

216
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.770
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah. Have you tried any nicotine products.

217
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.580
Galaxy A20: Know I stopped for like five days. But then I started smoking again.

218
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:56.850
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So now, one of the things that people tell me that smoking is one of the hardest things to stop that nicotine is the cravenness intense

219
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.780
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: But they have products where you can get the thing that you crave, which is the nicotine, but not get all the other things then increase your risk of cancer.

220
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.460
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So,

221
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.740
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: They do have lots of nicotine products, you have a patches. So do you have a primary care doctor

222
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.810
Galaxy A20: Uh, yeah, they just, they just gave me one, but I'm not sure what is this

223
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:23.880
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so you can talk to them about a patch. You put it on your shoulder don't sleep with it. You have some of the worst things in your life or her

224
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.190
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So you put the patch on that gives you like a steady your nicotine that you're going to be using for the day.

225
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:40.230
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And then if you have a craving instead or reach a photo cigarette. Some people like having that gun because they're doing something with their mouth. So you chew gum and stay at all you the laws and juror or the inhaler.

226
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.910
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And so

227
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:58.680
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: It's the combined treatment. It actually works better for a lot of patients. Okay. Were you getting the nicotine and not having the withdrawals, but you're cutting back or and stopping decrease your risk for getting those those products that cause cancer. Okay.

228
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:12.330
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So we definitely want you to think about that. And whenever you see me, we'll, we'll always revisit that because that's just something we focus on here, bright heart health. We want to encourage you to stop. Okay. Right.

229
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.780
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And so you've overcome a lot. So that's just one little, little plant that seed and we'll just keep water right
