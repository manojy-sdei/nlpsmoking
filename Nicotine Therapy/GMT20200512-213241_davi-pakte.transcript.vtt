OK.

55
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.160

56
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.860
Grant Schmitke: Turkey I but it was with medication, but there was on I was they had me on Suboxone but

57
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.150
Grant Schmitke: They take it. They tapered me from three strips a day, which was perfect, all the way down to zero strips the day I left you know

58
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.710
Grant Schmitke: And I relapsed within 24 hours of leaving

59
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.670
davi pakter: Yeah.

60
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.450
davi pakter: You know,

61
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.580
Grant Schmitke: It was kind of a joke. You know, I mean, I paid $30,000 to go to this rehab and they didn't even send me with anything for aftercare. You know, like

62
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.850
Grant Schmitke: It made no sense to me. But

63
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.150
davi pakter: Okay, so when you were taking this Suboxone we did it help you

64
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.370
Grant Schmitke: Oh yeah, I love it.

65
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.730
davi pakter: Okay, so you've taken it before.

66
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.140
davi pakter: Other times, I mean,

67
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.630
davi pakter: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Is that what you do buy it on the street or how did you have you gotten

68
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.010
Grant Schmitke: I buy it on the street.

69
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.670
davi pakter: Okay, so you use that with in conjunction with the heroin.

70
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.860
Grant Schmitke: No, no, I buy I buy this a box in and hold on to them for like when I run out of heroin or when I don't have money or I can't connect. You know what I mean.

71
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.470
Grant Schmitke: Just for emergencies, a stack up like 20 of them, you know, and just have them for emergency situations.

72
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:38.280
Grant Schmitke: Okay, and it, you know, and once I'm once I'm on this a box in I never want to come off of them, you know, and I'm always run out. I don't have you more. I can't get no more. Whatever the reason is, like, I'm just not gonna go back to the heroin.

73
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.590
davi pakter: Gotcha. All right, well,

74
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.610
davi pakter: You, you don't have to worry about that anymore.

75
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.600
davi pakter: Well, we'll make sure that you have enough Suboxone let me go through a little bit of your history here.

76
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.280
davi pakter: Do you have any other medical problems, besides the heroin.

77
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.180
Grant Schmitke: I got severe anxiety disorder like

78
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.030
Grant Schmitke: Like a severe anxiety like public anxiety. You know, like I'm

79
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.890
Grant Schmitke: Like fear of being around people and and being in public places and stuff.

80
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.000
Okay.

81
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.360
Grant Schmitke: And depression. But other than that, I don't have any really anything else.

82
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.410
Okay.

83
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.140
davi pakter: Have you ever seen a therapist before

84
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.300
Grant Schmitke: Yeah, I have.

85
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.920
Was it helpful.

86
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.830
Grant Schmitke: Yeah, but I was really young one scene one

87
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.700
Okay.

88
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.890
davi pakter: Do you use any other substances.

89
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.950
davi pakter: Yeah, methamphetamine. Okay.

90
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.950
davi pakter: Is that pretty much daily as well. Yeah, okay.

91
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.590
davi pakter: So,

92
00:05:48.330 --> 00:06:00.390
davi pakter: A couple things about our program one it's going to include therapy therapy. So we're going to get you in with a therapist, and it's also in groups.

93
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.370
davi pakter: So,

94
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.680
davi pakter: That means that after today will be meeting in groups, there'll be other people dealing with similar issues and

95
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:25.800
davi pakter: will manage your, your refills, and also support you with regard to your recovery in in the group. So it'll be same as this. But there'll be more people on the screen.

96
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.390
davi pakter: And we'll have a therapist that helps me to facilitate the group.

97
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.650
davi pakter: So let's see. The other thing is that as long as you're using stimulants.

98
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.070
davi pakter: It means that I can only prescribe a shorter amount of

99
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.160
Grant Schmitke: I'll stop. I'll stop using the stimulants, as soon as I get as when I stopped heroin. I stopped the steaming I stopped everything

100
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.720
davi pakter: Okay. All right, good.

101
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.980
Grant Schmitke: Only use I only use that because it's just given to me when I get like a bag. You know what I mean.

102
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.210
davi pakter: Okay.

103
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.320
davi pakter: Just comes with it.

104
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.570
Grant Schmitke: I just, it's nothing to me like I'm not addicted to it or nothing, really. You know what I mean. I just spoke with it because I have it.

105
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.570
davi pakter: Got it. Okay, um,

106
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.060
davi pakter: Alright, so, so good. So then it should be a

107
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:24.390
davi pakter: Be a moot point in that, but just so you know, as long as the Europeans come back with method. And then we can only give you a shorter amount at a time.

108
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:32.130
davi pakter: Meaning you have to keep going back to the pharmacy. We won't cut you off. But we just want to make you make sure you're more engaged in the care.

109
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.080
davi pakter: So,

110
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.970
davi pakter: Let me go back a little bit. Sorry, I'm jumping around a little bit back to your medical history so

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.870
Grant Schmitke: Actually thought that somebody pointed to me.

321
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.050
Grant Schmitke: Because for my liver and my kidneys to shut off at the same time, like that is super rare, you know,

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.240
davi pakter: Yeah, and I

323
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.010
Grant Schmitke: And I mean, and I barely made it there. So yeah, I got lucky there.

324
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.840
davi pakter: For sure.

325
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.450
davi pakter: Okay, um,

326
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.030
davi pakter: Let's see, what else do I need to review with you.

327
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.340
davi pakter: Is there anything else I need to know about you to to be the best possible doctor

328
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:38.910
Grant Schmitke: Oh man, I'm pretty open person and honest, you know, I mean, and I don't, I don't really hide anything. I speak my mind and what you know.

329
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.750
davi pakter: Okay, if

330
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:49.680
Grant Schmitke: I'm just, I'm going to be so honest. You know what I mean like if I think I'm like bullshitting you or whatever. But that's just how I am. And if you don't like me luck. You know, that's how I that's how I always have been.

331
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:59.400
Grant Schmitke: I mean I'm just like, I don't hide my addiction from anybody you know I mean I'll tell I'll tell the my neighbor was once in yeah I do look like you know

332
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.680
Grant Schmitke: I'm pretty honest about it. I

333
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.960
Grant Schmitke: Don't if I think there's something to tell you. I tell you,

334
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:04.980
davi pakter: Yeah.

335
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.110
Grant Schmitke: We as you get to know me.

336
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.780
davi pakter: I appreciate your honesty and I think one reminder is that

337
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:26.940
davi pakter: You know, you're doing it. You're doing the heroin, like you said, you have, you have a lot of insight into it in that you're using it to escape some feelings that are too hard to feel and

338
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:38.340
davi pakter: So the, the Suboxone will help get you off the heroin, but it won't heal that wound and that trauma and that's going to take

339
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:57.090
davi pakter: A lot of work, perhaps, maybe it's, you know, some people it's easier than others, but, you know, as you mentioned, you've been through a lot. And that's where the therapy comes in, you know, the rehab. The, the groups like working on yourself. For some people, spirituality is important.

340
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.030
davi pakter: You know, to, to

341
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:07.110
davi pakter: Be able to face though that pain without needing to use a substance.

342
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:16.140
davi pakter: So that's what I encourage you to to work on definitely keep up the exercise good diet, you know,

343
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:25.410
davi pakter: Whatever it is that helps you to manage your stress. That's what what you need to put energy into right now.

344
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:33.810
davi pakter: And the like the medication is just a one piece of it. It's not the end all you know the rest

345
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.860
davi pakter: Is about

346
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:49.020
davi pakter: You know, stepping up to doing the work and engaging support from other areas, but you have a lot going for you. I think, you know, you're, you're in decent shape. You have your, your partner you know you got your dad support and

347
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:54.720

350
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:17.700
davi pakter: Once you start showing up and showing that you're you're committed and you're going to follow through. Then we can extend it to extend the amount of medicine out

351
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:18.900
Grant Schmitke: For sure.

352
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:28.470
davi pakter: Okay, I think that's, that's about all I have for today. I'll they will contact you.

353
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.770
davi pakter: To set up a therapy appointment and we need to check your, your urine.

354
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:45.540
davi pakter: As soon as your urine is come back without the math in it with just what supposed to be in there, then again we can, if I can extend the prescription out to a month.
