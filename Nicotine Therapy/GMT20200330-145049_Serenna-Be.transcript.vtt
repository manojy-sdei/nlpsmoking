00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.940
Kennerh Blaine: Okay.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.270
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, and I went to quest this morning.

16
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.250
Kennerh Blaine: Uh huh. And they did not have an order for me. So the, the lady that I just got off with

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.320
Kennerh Blaine: The beginning, lady. She said she was going to

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.150
Serenna Beers: End the virtual clinic order.

19
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.960
Okay.

20
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.580
Kennerh Blaine: Yes.

21
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.970
Kennerh Blaine: What show was this for a medical tests.

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.540
Kennerh Blaine: Were yeah

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.550
Kennerh Blaine: I, I don't know. It just said I needed.

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.740
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, yeah. The doctor when I first met her, and then in the email I got from her and said, I need to do a blood test in the urine test.

25
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.450
Serenna Beers: Okay, well, I will look into that. I'll follow up just in case.

26
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.610
Serenna Beers: Because once you and I meet to for our bio psychosocial then what I would like to do is have a standing weekly appointment with you where you and I, we

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.020
Serenna Beers: We go to

28
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.410
Serenna Beers: Counseling one to one, because a group is good, but also one one to one is good as well.

29
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:12.510
Serenna Beers: All right, well, let's see if I can get going on this so I can get you started. And and get you going on the rest of your day and I really do hope you have just a wonderful time and you leave all the stress behind you.

30
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.600
Kennerh Blaine: You know we are

31
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:26.430
Serenna Beers: So good. Alright, so we'll just get to it. How about why don't you tell me what brought you to bright heart health, and why now.

32
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.070
Kennerh Blaine: I'm trying to get my phone.

33
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.770
Kennerh Blaine: Volumes off. Okay. Um, what brought me to bright heart.

34
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.080
Kennerh Blaine: As

35
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:53.370
Kennerh Blaine: Well, actually, what got me looking for a facility that a doctor because I'd went into a detox.

36
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.000
Kennerh Blaine: February 29 98 a week.

37
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.280
Kennerh Blaine: And then leaving. They started me on Suboxone and leaving there.

38
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:21.480
Kennerh Blaine: They said my county should follow up with it. And so anyways we we did they have a pilot program. They're trying to start, but it's not up and running. And so I ended up over in the hospital.

39
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.590
Kennerh Blaine: With with girls real bad ones and then also come to find out. I had a

40
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
Kennerh Blaine: My potassium was through the roof.

41
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.820
Kennerh Blaine: And so I spent a week in the hospital and

42
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:47.250
Kennerh Blaine: And I met a gentleman by the name of Jake Miller and his job is c'est Sep

43
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.300
Kennerh Blaine: His job is to

44
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.990
Kennerh Blaine: Determine whether or not substance.

45
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.210
Kennerh Blaine: Coordinator.

46
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:16.110
Kennerh Blaine: And so he had been working with the doctor and then lo that was able to prescribe the Suboxone and in that meantime my case manager was looking into other options and then Braveheart came up

47
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:27.660
Kennerh Blaine: And so then my wife helped me get in and answer the questions and go from there. Because I can do this virtual stuff.

48
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.250
Kennerh Blaine: And right now I

49
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.530
Kennerh Blaine: Real emergency. I don't really want to go to a doctor.

50
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.250
Yeah.

51
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.420
Kennerh Blaine: So,

52
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.990
Kennerh Blaine: So here we are. So my first was, you know, I had my first group. Dr.

53
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.120
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

54
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.170
Serenna Beers: So you've been with us for what just just about a couple of weeks now. Right.

55
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.780
Kennerh Blaine: Correct.

56
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.470
Okay.

57
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:18.270
Serenna Beers: Well, tell me your story with substances and I mean like when were you first exposed how how had it progressed and then when, when was it the worst for you. Were you were you realize, wow, I am in trouble here and I probably need some help.

58
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.310
Kennerh Blaine: Um, well. My story starts at a very, very early age.

59
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:38.370
Kennerh Blaine: Of course, we're always allowed to sip, you know, Mom and Dad's beer. And then also, you know, TV, he did rum.

60
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.920
Kennerh Blaine: When you're teasing. So, and then

61
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.800
Kennerh Blaine: My dad was a lifer in the Navy through Korean

62
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.830
Kennerh Blaine: And so when my

63
00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.290
Kennerh Blaine: About half of my early childhood. My father was over fight in war, and so

64
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.560
Kennerh Blaine: I'm

65
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.630
Kennerh Blaine: In my parents got in a huge real bad fight when I was six.

66
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.530
Kennerh Blaine: And we went live with some family, friends and

67
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.380
Kennerh Blaine: The father over there used to take me

68
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.310
Kennerh Blaine: On motorcycle rallies.

69
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:51.390
Kennerh Blaine: Patches rallies and his son did not like that. And he hated me for it. So he would molest me that went on for six years until we moved out of Southern California. And so I started smoking pot.

70
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.670
Kennerh Blaine: At six

71
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.110
Kennerh Blaine: As he would, he would give it to me to find it. Call me down and

72
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.770
Kennerh Blaine: Then at nine his older brother came back from Vietnam.

73
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:21.120
Kennerh Blaine: And was addicted to heroin and so I told him I wanted to try it. So I did, and I fell in love with it and so

74
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.650
Serenna Beers: I shot heroin.

75
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.700
Serenna Beers: At age 12

76
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.470
Kennerh Blaine: Years.

77
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.270
Serenna Beers: Nine. Okay, at age nine, wow. Goodness sakes. Now do you go by Kenny or Kenneth

78
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.630
Kennerh Blaine: I go by, Jenny.

79
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:51.570
Serenna Beers: Okay, I just wanted to call you by what you like to be called the, you know, I didn't know if Kenneth was formal. Okay. Wow. I was just gonna say, Kenny. That's, that's an awfully young age. God bless you, and you did this for 20 years

80
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.150
Kennerh Blaine: You

81
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.860
Kennerh Blaine: Can July 24 1989 um

82
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:05.550
Kennerh Blaine: I went into cash Creek and woodland your house out in the country.

83
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.460
Kennerh Blaine: And

84
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.930
Kennerh Blaine: I haven't touched heroin or alcohol.

85
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:26.940
Kennerh Blaine: Since that day in 2001 I hurt my back in May and destroyed T three, four and five vertebrae. And so then

86
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.340
Kennerh Blaine: Started on

87
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.210
Kennerh Blaine: Norco and soma.

88
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.770
Kennerh Blaine: And I did real good with it for, you know, a couple of years.

89
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.930
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. And I'm

90
00:08:43.980 --> 00:09:02.220
Kennerh Blaine: Because I was getting chiropractor and massages and acupuncture and physical therapy, all that was being supplied by Workman's Comp and they stopped supplying it they said they was not going to

91
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.460
Kennerh Blaine: Pay for any more that stuff.

92
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.080
Serenna Beers: And so they

93
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.640
Kennerh Blaine: Just went

94
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.530
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah.

95
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.260
Kennerh Blaine: All they would pay for his direct

96
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.740
Kennerh Blaine: And so

97
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.470
Kennerh Blaine: It went

98
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.500
Kennerh Blaine: And no other relief, other than the drugs.

99
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.780
Serenna Beers: So,

100
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.880
Kennerh Blaine: I

101
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.910
Kennerh Blaine: Got in that cycle of

102
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:47.100
Kennerh Blaine: The more I do, the more I hurt and more I hurt. The more I take the more I take the more I do because drugs are masking the pain and that whole virtual cycle.

103
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.350
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. And

104
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.440
Kennerh Blaine: I tried to detox off opiates, a couple of times.

105
00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.850
Serenna Beers: By myself.

106
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.180
Kennerh Blaine: And that just. That was horrible.

107
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.430
Kennerh Blaine: The amount of Norco I was taking was

108
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.290
Kennerh Blaine: What a way off the charts.

109
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.060
Serenna Beers: What do you remember what it was that you were in

110
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.160
Serenna Beers: jesting on a daily basis.

111
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:38.820
Kennerh Blaine: Ah, well I was doing I was getting 112 pills from my doctor for a month and I am it go through those in a week. And then I had found some other sources.

112
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.570
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

113
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:46.050
Kennerh Blaine: And I always get 120 and 250 and

114
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.740
Kennerh Blaine: The last time.

115
00:10:52.230 --> 00:11:07.500
Kennerh Blaine: I was sinking into a horrible depression. So yeah, I see a counselor here and Glenn County. Her name is Gabby and I also have a case manager, whose name is john

116
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.570
Kennerh Blaine: And I've been talking to Gabby for a little while about the medication.

117
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.910
Kennerh Blaine: I'm right in the middle of remodeling, my parents house.

118
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.250
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. And so I was really overdoing it.

119
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.190
Kennerh Blaine: And show me in that cycle, you know,

120
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:36.120
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, I just started taking handfuls of them I was taking 10 at a time.

121
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.580
Kennerh Blaine: And then

122
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.500
Kennerh Blaine: It got extremely bad

123
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.440
Kennerh Blaine: And so

124
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.470
Kennerh Blaine: I needed to do something.

125
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.750
Kennerh Blaine: And so

126
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.090
Kennerh Blaine: With

127
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.950
Kennerh Blaine: My case managers help. We found a valley Recovery Center in Sacramento.

128
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.800
Kennerh Blaine: And I went there for five days for detox.

129
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.260
Serenna Beers: I'm familiar with, with them. Okay.

130
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.550
Serenna Beers: Um, so since then.

131
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.570
Huh.

132
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.790
Kennerh Blaine: I haven't been taken any of the Norco I I've been on Suboxone

133
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:34.080
Kennerh Blaine: And that really helps with the cravings and it even helps with the pain.

134
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.610
So, sir.

135
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:44.550
Serenna Beers: Um, have you received any type of education on exactly what Suboxone does inside of your body or anything like like that.

136
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:55.710
Kennerh Blaine: No, not really. I Greg a couple little you know things online.

137
00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:06.420
Serenna Beers: Sir, good. As long as they're a are there a credible source and and I can't really go into that with you because I'm not a doctor. I mean, you know, I'm

138
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:14.550
Serenna Beers: A therapist and and I understand, but I also don't want to operate outside my scope, but I think it would really

139
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:24.450
Serenna Beers: Right behoove you to, you know, understand, I mean it. It does work for pain as well as it does help with cravings.

140
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:39.780
Serenna Beers: And so that would just, you know, be be great because, as you know, knowledge is power, so the more that you understand why it works. The more your brain will tell it, it's that much more effective. It's kind of like this little mind game that we play with our own self.

141
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:59.340
Serenna Beers: More we believe it sure that it works. So, so I'm just, I just wanted to throw that out there. You, you mentioned chronic pain. What was there a precipitating event where the chronic pain started or was it the chronic pain associated with long term use of the opiates.

142
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:06.510
Kennerh Blaine: No. Well, um, I injured my back and I'm

143
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.990
Kennerh Blaine: May of 2001

144
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.860
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, I worked for damn accounting public works.

145
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.880
And

146
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.820
Kennerh Blaine: We were packed in the road and we come around a corner and there was a house on fire and so

147
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:40.440
Kennerh Blaine: We stop there and there is literally every mentally retarded guy that would come to the front door and then run back into the house. I couldn't cope team out the door.

148
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.780
Kennerh Blaine: So about the third time, and the flames are just become any minutes

149
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:56.340
Kennerh Blaine: I just knocked him out and did a fireman carry over my over my shoulders and as we were going

150
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.200
Kennerh Blaine: off the porch. They had car seats on their for

151
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:14.490
Kennerh Blaine: Their front porch lounge chairs and that was melting and I hit part of that and lost my balance and I threw him off and

152
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:21.840

Kennerh Blaine: And Glenn County. Just wanted to shipping back to Washington state and Washington State said that they weren't going to get enough. And then, so I threw a fit.

309
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:43.710
Kennerh Blaine: Absolutely through fit to make them punishing. I mean, and so several times since then, I have tried to reconnect. I've tried to put that past, try not to think about

310
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.190
Kennerh Blaine: You know what he had done.

311
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:51.720
Kennerh Blaine: Mm hmm. And every time it is just doesn't

312
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.930
Kennerh Blaine: Doesn't work out.

313
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.730
Kennerh Blaine: And he as last time.

314
00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:05.850
Kennerh Blaine: He was all pissed off at me because the vehicle. I gave them broke down. Well, I bought them.

315
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.900
Kennerh Blaine: AAA insurance before they left

316
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.140
Kennerh Blaine: And then when it broke down.

317
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.290
Kennerh Blaine: I rented them a U Haul

318
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.150
Kennerh Blaine: So they could

319
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.170
Kennerh Blaine: Get back home and get what stuff they had in that

320
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.240
Kennerh Blaine: You know, and the pickup.

321
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:31.920
Kennerh Blaine: And so anyways. He called one day and he just started read me the riot act and

322
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:42.540
Kennerh Blaine: I just laid into him. And so, Ben. He told me that the wrong Blaine died that I should have died, instead of my brother.

323
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:44.970
Kennerh Blaine: And

324
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.400
Kennerh Blaine: I was no longer

325
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.770
Kennerh Blaine: His dad.

326
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.000
Kennerh Blaine: So that's fine.

327
00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:00.570
Kennerh Blaine: I'm okay with that. And I said, Do not try to contact your grandparents.

328
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.550
Kennerh Blaine: Because I've put a block on now.

329
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.220
Kennerh Blaine: And so

330
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:19.530
Kennerh Blaine: That was a year ago he keeps trying to go through my wife to get me to get you know reconnected with me and I'm

331
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.880
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, I'm just, I'm just done.

332
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.040
Kennerh Blaine: So,

333
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.560
Kennerh Blaine: Wow, that sounds in in

334
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.790
Kennerh Blaine: Both my parents.

335
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.260
Painful

336
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:45.120
Kennerh Blaine: You know, it was the first several times. I was more mad. This last time didn't really hurt.

337
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.050
Mm hmm.

338
00:31:50.490 --> 00:32:09.090
Kennerh Blaine: Because he had been coming out here for, I don't know, six or seven months on the pretense to help me with my mom. We were caring for my mom and. Well the truth is he was coming down here and buying pot and sending it back to Wisconsin making a fortune.

339
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.140
Ah,

340
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.700
Kennerh Blaine: So,

341
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.020
Oh boy.

342
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.030
Serenna Beers: That's another

343
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.270
Kennerh Blaine: Another irritate

344
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.410
But

345
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.120
Kennerh Blaine: And then

346
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.850
Serenna Beers: What about

347
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.370

351
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:10.650
Kennerh Blaine: Well, I get Social Security and I get uppers and that equals right at $2,000

352
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:20.430
Kennerh Blaine: My wife doesn't happen in. Come on, three years ago. She had a biopsy taken off her breasts. And when they did that it

353
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:26.010
Kennerh Blaine: Clipped a nerve in her right arm and she can't hardly move in.

354
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.100
Kennerh Blaine: So we get by.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.740
Kennerh Blaine: And I have, I take care of all my parents bills.

356
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:53.730
Kennerh Blaine: And so the plan is when we get my mom and dad's house down hopefully within the next month or so. Then we're going to move to close. So, and then fix my house up and my house should be worth some around 350 400,000
