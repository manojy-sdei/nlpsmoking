19
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty late. That gets into like the other half of my life.

20
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm hoping someone kind of

21
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So you really can't take a lunch break. They won't like it take a lunch to spend an hour because those

22
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.510
Michelle Lucero: I only get a 35 minute lunch. There you go.

23
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.800
Right.

24
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Bite spider bites. Okay, well, we'll stick with this. Hopefully that, what am I gonna wait so long to change the schedule.

25
00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:00.810
Michelle Lucero: Well, because a lot of people have left, and they're hiring new people. So they're using me as the trainer for the French

26
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.090
Michelle Lucero: They want me to have

27
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:19.080
Michelle Lucero: Experience in the back. So on my schedule when they send it, and it says like 7723 I'll be in the back, but any other times that are like 1230 days 30 or 10 to six, eight to four. Those are rush hour.

28
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.840
Michelle Lucero: And we have this new girl. Well, I know she's not gonna work out because she's so lazy.

29
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:42.690
Michelle Lucero: And the boss actually called me this morning. And he's like, how did Rachel, do this weekend and I was like, oh my god, she didn't do anything. And he's like, yeah, I was looking at the cameras. It didn't

30
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.130
Michelle Lucero: Get anything

31
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.450
Michelle Lucero: He just wants to stand it or register and just like cheap things up all she has to do funny.

32
00:06:52.170 --> 00:07:06.270
Michelle Lucero: NO WORK BECAUSE SHE KNOWS I'M NOT A manager. She's not listening to me. I'm like, oh, there's wraps. If you want to put clothes away. I shouldn't say if you want to, because of course she doesn't want to. I should say there's rats. Let's put clothes away.

33
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not your job to be the boss. If you don't want to take it on you know such your job, the boss people around, it's just probably going to cause conflict so

34
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:22.860
Michelle Lucero: Yeah. Plus, I also don't like that they're having me train her because I'm fairly new myself.

35
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.110
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, people are tripping.

36
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh well.

37
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:32.220
Michelle Lucero: It's because I think honestly women it's because I'm a pushover because

38
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:42.120
Michelle Lucero: Oh really, I don't know how to say no. Yeah, because people get paid for that, like the lead, they get paid to train people do you do

39
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to push back to want to be assertive.

40
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I

41
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:55.020
Michelle Lucero: Would love to. I just don't, especially at work. I've never known how I feel like our just do it. Michelle, you're getting paid for it.

42
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's, let's take a look at your goals and see if maybe we could spend some time around that. Let's see how best to spend, spend, THIS HOUR, SO I'M MAKING I'm making a little note that would be sort of working on

43
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Both that's a sort of communication, where you say your yes as you say your nose. Your you're setting good limits and

44
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get into that, but I really want to check on other areas also and make sure

45
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: An emotional level at home with your children with family.

46
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Noel just the whole deal. Like, how are we, how's the emotional landscape for you.

47
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:44.040
Michelle Lucero: Oh, so, um, I've been taking the medication that Dr. Dawn gave me

48
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. The Wellbutrin

49
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:51.810
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, okay, well it's generic. I'm pretty sure, right, doesn't matter like yeah

50
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: propre on or something.

51
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.770
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, yeah. Anyways, um, I'm getting along with everyone.

52
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.760
Michelle Lucero: I've been really emotional

53
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:17.550
Michelle Lucero: And not like I mean just stupid things make me cry. But I mean, I've kind of always been like that, but only around my period, but it's not around my period like I had my period of over two weeks ago.

54
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.330
Michelle Lucero: About I just been very late.

55
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.680
Michelle Lucero: For my nephew's birthday party. I cried singing Happy Birthday to him.

56
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.510
Michelle Lucero: My

57
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.590
Michelle Lucero: Emotional

58
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember what you were thinking, do you remember what you were thinking

59
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.070
Michelle Lucero: I'm

60
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.510
Michelle Lucero: Thinking. Oh well.

61
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.510
Michelle Lucero: I was thinking like, I'm just glad he's still here because he's still using

62
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

63
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.090
Michelle Lucero: Why, oh, maybe that's why

64
00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I sometimes I take for granted that people already know that oftentimes if we're not talking about a threat response from the amygdala oftentimes a thought causes the emotion.

65
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.630
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

66
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When you start thinking, Oh my gosh, she could be dead or this could be my children or what if it happens to them. Those thoughts.

67
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Are connected to fear, sadness, and so then you're crying people forget or they don't know that that's the case. So you change thinking but it ended of itself, what, there's something wrong with that. That means you have appreciate its place.

68
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:38.820
You know,

69
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.930
Michelle Lucero: I just get so embarrassed.

70
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.220
Michelle Lucero: Yes.

71
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh we you get embarrassed over everything.

72
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.080
Michelle Lucero: I do

73
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.920
Michelle Lucero: I do that.

74
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Register. It's like

75
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how about we work on Aerosmith, which is also tied to. I'm going to put a sort of and embarrassed over here.

76
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.700
Michelle Lucero: Because again, right. So,

77
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. That's part of being human. That means you are a loving, caring person about him, but the embarrassment that speaks to there's something flawed about me what was

78
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.170
Michelle Lucero: Wrong with crying. It means you care for right

79
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.170
Michelle Lucero: silliness.

80
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, so we have that we have increased

81
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotional sort of emoting

82
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And how many cigarettes. Let me jump down here. I want to stop. Oh, this is really old funny. You're not gonna believe how all this goal is, I want to be smoke free in seven days when we first met

83
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.490
Wow.

84
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now remember, I could down so much

85
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But it was also like, I wonder if it was a miss judgment of goal setting skills, you know, as if to say, well, if I say it will then it will be true, it doesn't

86
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Work that easy.

87
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Quitting smoking. Sometimes it's, you know, is harder than you know quitting crack

88
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: very addictive substance.

89
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So how many cigarettes. Have you noticed it's gone down since you're taking on the appropriate on

90
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:50.550
Michelle Lucero: Um, it's gone down a lot because when I started working. I remember telling you like I was smoking a whole packet date starting working but I met work for eight hours. So that's just at home, smoking or on my lunch. So I bought a pack of cigarettes. On Saturday, and I still have 2467

91
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.510
Michelle Lucero: That was Saturday. Today's Tuesday.

92
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Calculate how many cigarettes. You're smoking a day for me. Make it easy on me.

93
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.510
Michelle Lucero: So,

94
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.620
Michelle Lucero: That is

95
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.880
Michelle Lucero: Divided by 313 divided by three.

96
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so felt three four day

97
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.290
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, okay.

98
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and

99
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you are you doing the technique of seeing if you can stay busy for 90 seconds.

100
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.770
Michelle Lucero: That that remains right that

101
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, is it really works because then it ends up happening is you like. All I have to do is get through 90 seconds okay I'm gonna go draw a picture. I'm gonna go

102
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: wash my face go put base makeup. I'm going to go curl my hair. And I'm going to go drive some dishes. If you can get through 90 seconds. You've probably forgotten about the cigarette. You just started doing this other activity.

103
00:13:51.510 --> 00:14:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's neat than an hour passes. So try that add that to your okay I'm thinking of using real quick and you go do some knitting get 90 seconds under your belt that 90 will probably turn into an hour.

104
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.650
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, or two.

105
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can add that piece to it. Alright, so let me see in here. How much of what's going on.

106
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: For example, around sleep around enjoying your life being in this home with Anthony. So how much sleep. Are you getting where's this the symptoms of depression at these days.

107
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.020
Michelle Lucero: I'm

108
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.840
Michelle Lucero: I'm getting good sleep.

109
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:50.640
Michelle Lucero: Maybe too much like I come home just so tired. I eat. And I'll start watching something on Netflix and just crash.

110
00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:02.730
Michelle Lucero: Okay so early like last night I got off at 830 so I went to bed, probably around 930 and I woke up at five without an alarm.

111
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Know Seroquel correct

112
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.980

113
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.270
Michelle Lucero: The medication. The new medication that my Suboxone

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been taking

115
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The Wellbutrin for is it for two weeks or a week and a half.

116
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.010
Michelle Lucero: Now, not even a week Thursday will be week okay

117
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Most medications kick into gear after a month. I don't remember this one, how quickly it acts like I i know the antidepressants.

118
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a while. I don't know about this guy.

119
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.150
Michelle Lucero: She said that it would um

120
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:42.300
Michelle Lucero: It could make me start feeling different in a week. But just to keep her updated.

121
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.140
Okay.

122
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your self esteem doing

123
00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.790
Michelle Lucero: Um, I feel pretty good.

124
00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:13.140
Michelle Lucero: I've been ensure that I get up and get ready like and be there for work. You know, like as me, not like the lazy me and not wanting to take a shower. I've been making myself through that because I noticed when I don't, I feel horrible about myself all day.

125
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:24.510
Michelle Lucero: So I've been doing that, I am proud of myself because I've seen you. I already have $350 saved.

126
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:38.010
Michelle Lucero: And I've never been able to save money. But just knowing what I'm saving it for it, it's easier for me to put it there and not touch it. So, and

127
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Say again. What you're saving it for

128
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.520
Michelle Lucero: I'm saving that for when I get my own place.

129
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can have a deposit

130
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.040
Michelle Lucero: And first and last one thing. Okay.

131
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's exciting. So you found the motivation. Okay.

132
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.550
Michelle Lucero: Yeah. Neat.

133
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:14.010
Michelle Lucero: And I don't I don't try to talk myself into spending yet. I've noticed, but I think it's because it has a deeper meaning them that for me like it's my security to tell myself, you will be added here when baby.

134
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, you're, you're making it happen. That's exciting. So do you see the connection between I'm making my own money and I'm saving and then when there's a disagreement.

135
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or Anthony as acting out. Do you see that you feel differently around his behavior is that starting to feel less threatening or no, it still feels just awful.

136
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:48.060
Michelle Lucero: No. Um. Well, for one, we haven't really been fighting at all. Lately, like our fights are over stupid things. And I think it's just

137
00:17:48.630 --> 00:18:04.260
Michelle Lucero: I honestly think it's because we're so used to fighting and now that I'm paying bills and taking care of business. He has nothing to bitch about so he complains about a stupidest things so it doesn't bother me.

138
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:18.600
Michelle Lucero: It will in this in the minute that were arguing it bothers me. But I don't let it linger and like upset me for the whole day. I just get over it quicker. I guess you could say now. Like it doesn't

139
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.610
Michelle Lucero: Bother me and I tell him that like why don't why are you even mad right

140
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:37.560
Michelle Lucero: I don't get it. Okay, but it pisses him off because he sees that he's not getting to me like I think he's trying to get to me right

141
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Your choice here. But if you don't want to poke the bear.

142
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just quietly, have your own quiet inner defiance that what a moron. Right. We know we

143
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Can do that inside like la but inside

144
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.800
Yeah.

145
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:08.700
Michelle Lucero: Right, because I noticed when I do say it out loud. It gives him more fire to cut back at me, or to make it worse because I'm just pissing him off.

146
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me give you some phrases

147
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That are neutral.

148
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Anthony. I don't have a right to change your opinion.

149
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine someone saying that to you.

150
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna say yes you do try and change my opinion. No, you won't say that

151
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It was he, it'll be like yeah

152
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You put water on the fire.

153
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Anthony. I really get now that I don't have a right to change your mind. Notice that

154
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. I don't have a right to change your mind isn't saying, I agree with you.

155
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't say you're right.

156
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What it's saying is

157
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Inside your quiet rebellion inside the resist all inside is your a book.

158
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't be bothered with minutes wasted.

159
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I'm going to say out loud is things like that or if there is some truth to what he's saying. You can say this

160
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony

161
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're saying is important.

162
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll see how much of that is true for me.

163
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Can understand. You didn't say I agree and take it online. Those two phrases are so broad, you can use them with your boss.

164
00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: co worker that gives you says you're you're terrible at does that well sure don't have the right to change your mind.

165
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or hmm

166
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see how much of that is true for me.

167
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: give that some thought. You see,

168
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not here's what it's not doing

169
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't give more content. If you argue bath. No. Remember yesterday when I did content. Content content item A through Z. Oh, yummy. That is gasoline for an Anthony for a poor employee that's looking for an argument. So you can spar scar scar scar scar going back and forth.

170
00:21:44.400 --> 00:22:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't give it to him. There's nothing to do with those he can say, yeah, you give that some thought. I will. And then you repeat it. You don't change, don't, don't give new content. I will. Anthony and thank you for bringing that to my attention. I'll see how much really sticks for me.

171
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see how much is true for me how much I

172
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You decide how much of what someone saying is true for you.

173
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.130
Yeah.

174
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an odd way of speaking, but the goal is to neutralize

175
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Don't give ammunition. Well, think about what you said, I'll take some time and think about that.

176
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The people in your life right now, especially Anthony are not going to be prepared with that kind of response. They're going to be surprised.

177
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.360
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

178
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.060
Michelle Lucero: This

179
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is gonna be like

180
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.220
Restroom.

181
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:41.550
Michelle Lucero: Now, and

182
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I'll try again.

183
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll try passive aggressive and then and then he'll try mind reading and then he'll try projection and you keep

184
00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: With the neutral. You don't delve in to content. He's got nothing to play with. It's got nothing to cut down

185
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this you're continuing to talk about and make this point. It sounds really important to you. I'll give it some thought. Yeah, it's still really important to you. It's still on your mind. See, I've said nothing.

186
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Words are coming out of my mouth. And I've said

187
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I've said nothing.

188
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand. Yeah, yeah. You have power. You just haven't quite been

189
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Capitalizing on now. You decide. You decide how much energy you want to put into it. If you want to poke the bear you miss having an argument with him, then get into content, have a good time.

190
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:51.480
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, that never turns out good. I just end up more. I just end up angry. So I hate it. I don't like even engaging honestly

191
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's the underlying is not engaging completely disengaging

192
00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a, that's a powerful tool. It just morning and my little contact as possible as few questions we

193
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Can possibly do it on your own.

194
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it. Yeah.

195
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.780
Michelle Lucero: That's what I'm doing that work more than here at home is just just engaging like

196
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:32.040
Michelle Lucero: And I noticed the week I've been doing it with the one leave that like hates me now because his best friend got fired over it. Um, he, he has been been such an ass with me and like I have to call him up to do build checks, like if I get a

197
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.750
Michelle Lucero: A manager has to check the bill to make sure it's not counterfeit.

198
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

199
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:48.420
Michelle Lucero: And I keep calling them a manager, but he's not a manager. He's a store week so anyways. He's I have to call him up. So I'll call him up and he's like, what

200
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:49.710
Michelle Lucero: What do you need

201
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.600
Michelle Lucero: And I just hand him the bill. Like, I won't say anything.

202
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.370
Michelle Lucero: Or he'll come or I'll say, I need a drop

203
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:17.520
Michelle Lucero: And then that's it I count out the money and hand it to him he hands it back to me. I don't even say thank you because I don't know if that's petty or whatever. But I just, I'm like, I don't want to give him any interaction, because he's not even worth me getting upset over. Okay, I've

204
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:26.190
Michelle Lucero: Been doing a lot of things to get me upset, but I haven't been letting him like I asked him for a stupid.

205
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:34.710
Michelle Lucero: What is it called a bill marker, like, you know, you check the bills with that one marker and if it's counterfeit.

206
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:45.480
Michelle Lucero: Right. Well, I told him I needed a Bill marker, and he's like, oh, I'm surprised you don't already have one. Like if I'm lying and just trying to login to get me shit. And I was like, well, I don't

207
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. That's it. Well, I don't

208
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:55.710
Michelle Lucero: So then he comes back and I had customers in my line. And I was helping a customer and he ruined that me

209
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What a turd.

210
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.810
Michelle Lucero: Oh, he's an ass.

211
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.440
Michelle Lucero: And I was

212
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:13.890
Michelle Lucero: Because then hit my arm. And I was like, I just looked at him and the customer in front of me was like, oh my god, I guess I turned red like a tomato.

213
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:25.440
Michelle Lucero: But I just got so mad that he threw it at me and like I was making up things in my head. Oh, he thinks I'm a dog. He's gonna throw things at me. Oh my.

214
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.650
Michelle Lucero: Know what after that.

215
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:38.970
Michelle Lucero: I think he saw how upset. It made me like I got so mad. I probably even gave him a dirty look but after that he's all my he was nice to me after that.

216
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. Interesting.

217
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:48.870
Michelle Lucero: But I don't know. I was like, I don't know, it might be because like he's already been warned. Like you're on your last straw, dude.

218
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.960
Michelle Lucero: So he's like, should I just threw that out of her and and customers thought

219
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's the one that look like an idiot, you don't need to be right. It's behavior. Well you gotta get got quite an Armani there, Joe.

220
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.730
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

221
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever think about playing baseball

222
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.400
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I told him that

223
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.900
Michelle Lucero: Right, but

224
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But you get there.

225
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:15.450
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

226
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you're still other people's behaviors, you're taking it on as a judgment about you and evaluate about you eventually you're going to get in the habit of these little tricks and you'll have that distance and you'll stay calm. You'll be able to crack a joke and

227
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys quite a pitcher. Hmm.

228
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

229
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the backup career plan or baseball's is going, I don't know.

230
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But thankfully the pen fast right we can joke when we are not in this perceived threat space. Okay, great. Let's, let's go to, um,

231
00:27:49.260 --> 00:28:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me, is these other things we've talked about gotten enough attention. Do you want to talk about maybe getting promoted to a lead. Are you a key like you hold a key to the store, things like that.

232
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:11.730
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I have a key to the store. Um, I have a key to the registers. Um, but I, I'm not interested in being the lead or

233
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

234
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So then, do you want to be. Is your assertive, because I wrote it down right

235
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how to say no, I don't know if I'm a pushover.

236
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrote down the word assertive and embarrassed. It's about being asked to do what things that you're not getting paid for that what

237
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.230
Michelle Lucero: Oh, okay. Well, for one, training period.

238
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:45.750
Michelle Lucero: I've already trained her on like the registers. I trained her on the floor trainer in the back. I trained her since she got there, everything

239
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you know that that's a paid tasks task.

240
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:56.550
Michelle Lucero: Because every I'm in the, what is it called the break room.

241
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:04.560
Michelle Lucero: Uh huh. There's a job description for every position there. Okay. And while I'm eating lunch. I just read those.

242
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.720
Michelle Lucero: Have fun. So

243
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.320
Michelle Lucero: I know, while I have nothing else to do.

244
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:23.370
Michelle Lucero: I just wanna. I don't want to listen to my YouTube because the break rooms right there by the warehouse and everyone here, but so the leads are supposed to be the ones training the new hires.

245
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.570
Michelle Lucero: And I'm just a cashier

246
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:40.230
Michelle Lucero: And the cat shares job is just to, you know, work their own George and put out merchandise as needed and keep those for looking good. It's not a dream at all.

247
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's the one that told you to train this woman.

248
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.430
Michelle Lucero: The store manager Ernie. He's like the

249
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.900
Michelle Lucero: He's our score manager. Okay. Yeah, and

250
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Ernie is friends with your PO

251
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:54.450
Right.

252
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.410
Michelle Lucero: Best friends. Yes. Oh.

253
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Really what what do you want to do. Do you want this setting to be a place where you practice assertiveness, is it worth it to you, or is it a better investment is only you know Michelle I you know I don't know you know where the better investment is

254
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe later on, you do want to be elite.

255
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we look at why you don't want to be a lead. I mean, I don't know, but it's I really resent that I could not say no if that's what that spaces, then we can talk about ways that you can say your know what do you

256
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.540
Michelle Lucero: I wish, I wish I could learn ways to say no and not just in my job like

257
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:51.600
Michelle Lucero: My niece just asked me to watch Laila tomorrow and she's the infant she's three months or so I'll be able to do nothing, because she's like 24 seven like you have to be with her all the time.

258
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you say to

259
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:54.540
Michelle Lucero: Find this and

260
00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:02.610
Michelle Lucero: She just asked, Are you off tomorrow. And I said, Yes. And she said, can you want Laila.

261
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:14.850
Michelle Lucero: And I thought about it and I was like, thinking of all the things I have to do that I'm supposed to do, Wednesday, and I'm like, um, I guess I could squeeze everything into Tuesday.

262
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:33.960
Michelle Lucero: But that's like going to be impossible. I can't. There's no way I could do everything in one day. Okay, but I already said yes. So now I feel stuck. And it's the day before. I doubt, she'll be able to find someone else like I'm just, I get so mad at myself because I do this all the time when

263
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you do. Yeah. And you recognize that and we'll keep it will keep working on it that I have no problem with that.

264
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.670
Michelle Lucero: But then in the minute. I'm like, Oh, I should say no.

265
00:31:45.090 --> 00:32:02.070
Michelle Lucero: But then, like, Oh, I feel so bad for her because that's the daughter of my nephew that keep screwing up and like the moms doing it on her own. So like anytime I can help. I want to help, but then I put myself in these situations to where I'm like,

266
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.710

279
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I just as value for the following reasons.

280
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.080
Michelle Lucero: Because I need rest.

281
00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:04.020
Michelle Lucero: Okay. And because I have a list of things I need to do that. I plan to do on my days off.

282
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what I mean.

283
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:20.160
Michelle Lucero: Like, I need a wash all the bedding in the house. Okay. Need to do laundry and neither clean my room. I need to wash the neither shampoo the carpet in my room.

284
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:34.530
Michelle Lucero: Like all these things all week. I don't have time for. I put on a list to do on my days off. And I know it's probably not going to get all done, but at least I want to try, but I can't.

285
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dovetail and sister.

286
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.370
Michelle Lucero: I'm trying to talk myself into it but

287
00:33:41.460 --> 00:34:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but we're doing something else. Let me just share the list. I need rest. So I value myself because this body needs rest okay and you have a preference for bedding that's clean laundry carpet that's clean, you have a task of things that you want to address. Okay.

288
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: you value your values for cleanliness, I guess we could count that one as that.

289
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What else do you value about you.

290
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:18.480
Michelle Lucero: I have no idea.

291
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is a sad little less girl.

292
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Met your self esteem.

293
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: From zero to 10 what number do you put it at

294
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.210
Michelle Lucero: Myself as esteem is low. I know that.

295
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me hear what it is. Cuz I'm like, where's this. What number is it up.

296
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:39.690
Michelle Lucero: Like a three.

297
00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:40.860
That

298
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it is no mystery that you're saying yes

299
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're still Acquainting Your value with what you do for others say that to me.

300
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:56.580
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I totally am

301
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about it, put it in your own words and see if you want to keep living that so let me hear it. I'm going to keep sacrificing probable, Tony. That's what's going to do. What's your plan.

302
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.690
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I just

303
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.800
Michelle Lucero: I don't know how to put it. But yeah, I do that, hopefully.

304
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You learn that as a little girl.

305
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:22.950
Okay.

306
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to need to really find out in real time.

307
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Did these people love you and care for you because of all your service.

308
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you never get to really find out

309
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This goes back to, I want to make friends and I want to be liked and I, it goes way back to all that. But ultimately, it's this this slowly level three.

310
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:02.280
Michelle Lucero: And not only that, just just filling needed

311
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:04.920
Michelle Lucero: You know,

312
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I do the same thing.

313
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:20.040
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, like they need me. And that makes me feel better about myself just waiting for them, even though, in the long run. It's proving myself over

314
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So it won't come the healing won't come from us analyzing it like this where we go oh well it's logical to do is going to come from that stuff we were doing before where you feel it and you work through it from that reprocessing.

315
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We've given ourselves only about 20 minutes

316
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

317
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what we can do to have some

318
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Some intervention here.

319
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say I am

Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to teach me

324
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Although you don't know

325
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to teach it, and by teaching you may decide. I don't want to be a hypocrite.

326
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I better do this to

327
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Either live it. If I'm going to model this for my daughter. It's just, I'm just mentioning your daughter just because she's female. We could do it for your son to okay yeah

328
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I come to you on Michaela and I say,

329
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, I have so many friends, but my gosh I get none of my homework done. Everybody's like keeping me up like until two and three in the morning and everybody's coming over to my house and got all their problems and dumping it on me and like I'm everybody's like therapist but um

330
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I guess I'll have to just all drop out of school, I guess. I mean, my friends need me so

331
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.590
Michelle Lucero: I'm

332
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.050
Michelle Lucero: That is a horrible idea.

333
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: They need, what are you talking about

334
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Friends in the most important thing they need me. And that's it.

335
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:32.850
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I know you need you. You're almost done with school you're doing so good dropping out now would be like the worst mistake in the world, your friends.

336
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.830
Michelle Lucero: You can give them advice, but you can't stop your life for them.

337
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:45.390
Michelle Lucero: Like it's fine with them advice, but they need to live their own lives and you need to live your

338
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, then they'll like catch an attitude and start gossiping and spread and crap about me and I can't deal. I'm just gonna just gonna

339
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't deal with the drama. I'm just going to help them. In fact, I want someone to say this weekend over

340
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: got kicked out. And she's staying with us.

341
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.080
Michelle Lucero: I even know what

342
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.720
Michelle Lucero: What

343
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were. You did. You said don't stop your life.

344
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:21.840
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, like that's the worst thing you could do. You're doing good.

345
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm a helper. I'm a good friend. That is my life.

346
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.020
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, look at me.

347
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to me.

348
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.350
Michelle Lucero: You need to be there for you.

349
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that mean, I don't even know to me, Mom.

350
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:54.690
Michelle Lucero: You can't give up on what you're doing because your friends need you, you need to remember that you come first. You could give them advice and help them in that way, but you can't stop your life for them.

351
00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not school is like this weird thing that like, from what I can tell, has nothing to do with earning a paycheck, like I don't even get it, but I'm going to have to have these friends and they have my back.

352
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:15.720
Michelle Lucero: No, because if they were your friends. They wouldn't even let you drop out because they know how good you're doing and you're like three months away from graduating

353
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:27.570
Michelle Lucero: So just remember like if they were your friends, they, they would be on board with you to stay in school.

354
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:34.680
Michelle Lucero: And remember, high school friends aren't always friends forever. And that's okay.

355
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what's forever.

356
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.270
Michelle Lucero: till you're 30

357
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:47.250
Michelle Lucero: Half the none of the girls that I was friends with a nice girl and my friends with. Now, none of them.

358
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:50.940
Michelle Lucero: Actually my enemy from high school is now my best friend's

359
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, how do you say no, I don't understand. How do you do it on

360
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:57.390
Michelle Lucero: Hold on, let me call when

361
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're funny.

362
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we, this is how old this this topic is um you know that list of fancy ways of saying no. I wonder how many times you've copied that that poster at

363
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Least twice. They're still good. They're good for no. Well, they're good for your boss. They're good for Ernie they're good for Anthony, they're good for everybody.

364
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have that to give right now, but I'll call you later. If I get these these things done, I'll let you know if something changes.

365
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:47.070
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, and I just found that list. It was in my Google Chrome like because I screenshot it, I need to refresh that and put it like as my screensaver.

366
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.180
screensaver.

367
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you need like a temporary henna tattoo.

368
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: By matching T shirts for my son for Anthony, I'd be like, I want

369
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You to

370
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Teacher for a month. And when you talk to me. I'm going to look at your chest.

371
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm like, yeah.

372
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.200
That

373
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.640
Michelle Lucero: That's a good idea. Just have the whole family wear those shirts.

374
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

375
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So. So on one hand you put in motion that's on you. But again, you did it.

376
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is on you you if you change the plans you run the risk of pulling the wrong out. She counted on that you want to be. I'm assuming a reliable person that you're not yeses have value that time you watch you gave

377
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: More than you had to give much if instead on that call. You know what, you know, people are going to call you.

378
00:42:53.940 --> 00:43:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The calling ask for something a lot of people in your life are asking. Okay, so you see the call coming in or whatever and you say okay

379
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta get ready. What am I going to do if someone asked for something. Okay, I'm gonna say

380
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel so honored that you would ask me, you know how much I love hanging out with why unless she's such a cutie patootie. Um,

381
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Today's I got a lot going on. I'll call you if you want. If you want last minute stuff if you can't find someone else I might be able to. But I'll call you in about three o'clock. If I'm free. I can offer a little bit of time. Will that work for you.

382
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to be prepared. You notice your little notes.

383
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:43.110
Mm hmm.

384
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.210
They need to be out

385
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you really believe that your only value comes

386
00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because you do for others.

387
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't want to even want to make this change.

388
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:09.240
Michelle Lucero: You really think doesn't work like that. But I do feel like I do like even at work. I'm like,

389
00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:13.830
Michelle Lucero: They're asking me to do this stuff because

390
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:24.390
Michelle Lucero: Like, that's how I see my value or like, I don't know how to put it. But yeah, totally.

391
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.180
Michelle Lucero: I right after I do it. I'm like, shit. I should have said no.

392
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now tell me, tell me what you would be doing. So we have a finite amount of energy. We have energy we have time. We don't have all the energy in the world. We don't have all the time in the world.

393
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to decide whether you have 20 minutes six hours to give my point is you give what you have to give watch without resentment.

394
00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I have 20 minutes to give without resentment. I'm not going to give six hours. I don't have that to give, I might end up being resentful. I'll give what I have to give generously with nothing in return. That's what you give

395
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're being able to go back to the self, we're looking at this low self esteem. This numbers of three.

396
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're having a hard time saying I have value intrinsic value more with and I know out here because of your upbringing, because that wasn't

397
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How you were raised, because you weren't told over and over again. You're not your performance. You're not what you do for me. You're born enough you're born beautiful, perfect just the way you are. You don't have to do a thing for me.

398
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'll teach you how to be a socialized person, pull that segment years well clear

399
00:45:52.050 --> 00:46:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So, psychologically, I can see those pieces. But what do you do, what do you do with it. It means be show you're going to be a little uncomfortable with doing some behavioral experiments. But if you do these if you're interested in doing them and pretty low threat environments at this job.

400
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be respected, this woman knows the value

401
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Of her time this woman knows the value of her resources. She respects herself. Watch. She can be trusted.

402
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knew the value in itself self can be a message to others.

403
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That we are trustworthy.

404
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting dynamic I'm trustworthy, because I know what I'm capable of doing. I know my resource. I know what I have to give

405
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I know who I am. You know what I stand for. I know what I will not tolerate

406
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working on that.

407
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think, well, I need to know that first, then I'll say my know

408
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: May not go that direction, it might be you develop it through rehearsal. Yeah, it's like the 10th time this week I

409
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it with Anthony was like

410
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds really important. I'll give some thought to what you're sharing and then you did it again and then you did it again and then all of a sudden you're like hey wait a minute.

411
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel pretty confident. It's called

412
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Called an aqua finale or something. It doesn't mean one thing has to come before the other you you can build the self esteem by rehearsing these skills, Michelle. What do you believe that you were born with. It's not contingent on something you do

413
00:47:54.870 --> 00:48:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: First, start with your daughter or your son. What were they born with, did they have to serve you in order to be valued and loved by you.

414
00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Know why why

415
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.250
Michelle Lucero: Because they love them unconditionally.

416
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You are loved unconditionally to you just didn't get that message enough when you were coming up, you know that.

417
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconditionally. Michelle unconditionally conditionally means I've got to keep doing and doing and sacrificing and I've got to feel needed in order to be loved. That is not true.

418
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to be quiet. You have to refuel rest, do your hobbies, enjoy your life.

419
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But where are you getting that unconditional love from not from Anthony from who

420
00:48:53.550 --> 00:49:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, well, there's been this relationship, you're gonna have to sacrifice to her. So you keep reinforcing that pattern with her, you know,

421
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Tammy gives you a little bit. I think because she wants to kind of go this way in that way. And she's still like, I love you girl.

422
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you get a little bit from hurting

423
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.930
Michelle Lucero: And Stefan's totally he loves me unconditionally. I know.

424
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.910
Michelle Lucero: I don't have to do anything.

425
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.650
Michelle Lucero: McCabe, on the other hand, she's a little different, but my son, definitely.

426
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So you let that in you taught him what that is.

427
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's teaching you let that in

428
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We are not whether we perform this or that, if we were then, look how much is at stake if I make a mistake.

429
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If I let someone down

430
00:49:50.970 --> 00:50:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be depressed and really mad at myself. I'll be intolerant of it. But if I can see my value comes from something other than my being needed or performing

431
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tolerate making a mistake.

432
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're at work and someone throws a pen at you and that's only a metaphor, although not really, but it is can be right. Look what it is, it's

433
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone throwing anything that you someone hurling an accusation an insult and a judgment that pen is a metaphor. People will continue to do it for

434
00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Their reasons. It doesn't mean

435
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. No way, I'm not answering that door. Think we got got some preaching going on and happening.

436
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see, do you see what I'm trying to say. Right. People will become an issue with their story meaning their opinion their judgment.

437
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And soon as you see it, you're going to register caring about other people's opinions first because you've been doing it for so long, but you just go back inside yourself and you say, Well, what do I actually think I'm working hard.

438
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm standing here in front of a customer. I know what's up. I'm feeling pretty. Oh, I'm good.

439
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.180
goofball.

440
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You go into the self, you go to, I'm okay. What do I like about myself right now. Is there any big you know I want good you go back to you, you go back to your own opinion of this moment not staying out here what someone else thinks of you.

441
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're probably for a while going to need to go out into Estefan has have a hard time I would make it sound like Gloria Estefan I'll

442
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Never

443
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.310
Stefan.

444
00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Stefan Stefan still

445
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.330
Michelle Lucero: Like it's

446
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be years before I get it. So,

447
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry about that.

448
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:04.080
Michelle Lucero: Well, you leave them on, but we don't come on

449
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's why. So okay, so you may be doing that for a while because you're not in the habit of how to cultivate it on your own. So you go outside. You like

450
00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What would I want for my son to believe in himself. What do I want to encourage and nurture in him self confidence. He's not just how much he weighs. He's not just

451
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, whether these group of friends like him. He's still lovable and adorable and charming, a wonderful intrinsically his value is not determined on the number of friends. He has you know that

452
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you got to put it inside yourself and you go, I, I want that for my son. I want my son to have that freedom.

453
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So that he can choose the people he wants to spend time with and not just having a group of friends that are kind of turkeys and they don't respect him and appreciate him. I can do that for myself too. I want it for my son, I can do that for myself.

454
00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want this for myself myself that over and over. This is what I want for my son. Oh, I want this for myself. I'm teaching it. I'm learning and myself. We're doing this together for a while that might be the case. So this three gets up to a 789 and 10

455
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So at work.

456
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If I say, oh boy, um, will you go ahead and finish training Sarah bell on the cash register today. What do you say,

457
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:35.130
Michelle Lucero: I'm still kind of getting used to it myself.

458
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:37.140
Michelle Lucero: Can you ask Jackie.

459
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.610
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. Does that sound like an asshole.

460
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it sounds really sweet. And it's really sweet and they say, well, but you were training yesterday.

461
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what

462
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.510
Michelle Lucero: I go ahead

463
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk time so I say no. But you're trying to train her yesterday. What's the difference

464
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:16.170
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, but she had a lot more questions than I had answers. So I think it would be better if Jackie trained her cuz I really don't know a lot. Yeah, yeah.

465
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I would fit perfect and I would feel more comfortable.

466
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone else trained right you setting that boundary. You do not sound like an ass you don't

467
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're you

468
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a very sweet way of communicating. You don't have to worry about.

469
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.180
That

470
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:44.490
Michelle Lucero: I feel like when they asked me that they're trusting me so I need to do it because them them trusting me to do it.

471
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:47.940
Michelle Lucero: Do you know what I mean.

472
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the old way of

473
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.470
Michelle Lucero: Oh, that's so you

474
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.000
Michelle Lucero: Get them to trust me.

475
00:54:54.390 --> 00:55:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no. The differences we say it we name it, we say, Ooh, that feels good. You're trusting me with this. You see that I'm already learning. I already learned these things, thank you. I feel complimented

476
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it I name it. I say it out loud, what's going on when you guys are trusted me without I feel so honored. Thank you.

477
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not quite ready to train someone else I probably need a little while and not a little confused because I thought that was the leads responsibility, but I do feel really like you guys are trusting me in that feels so good.

478
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see what I did.

479
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I named it now. You know what's going on. I named it

480
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't need. Notice that word need came up earlier.

481
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Name it

482
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You need it. You're my puppet when you need me.

483
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I control you.

484
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get that

485
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.960
Yeah.

486
00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Kelly.

487
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.350
Anthony

488
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.030
Ernie

489
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: When you need need need need when you can't cultivate that inner trust in the self you need it from them to need you to trust now.

490
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta start here. You've got to be able to do all that inside feels good, like, Ooh, I like it. It can be a compliment. It's the cherry on top, but it is not the flower.

491
00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The baking soda. The sugar. No, that comes from within compliments feel awesome but meeting them need need need need need need need

492
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: They own you.

493
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Usually see it.

494
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's hard to see it in the moment and I know that

495
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:55.440
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I mean, I could see it now, of course, but then I'm like,

496
00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:06.540
Michelle Lucero: It's so hard for me to say no because then I feel like I'm being an ass or like, that's rude. Just say yes. What is it gonna hurt.

497
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:13.980
Michelle Lucero: Well then, afterwards, I am. I feel like, damn, they just took advantage of me and I totally let them.

498
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it does hurt.

499
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:16.770
Michelle Lucero: But yeah

500
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're waiting for them to stop hurting you, people won't

501
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.140
Michelle Lucero: You have to set the boundary. Yeah.

502
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.010
Michelle Lucero: So,

503
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing you do to remember all this fancy talk, take a breath.

504
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking about that offer Ernie

505
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel really confident. See I breathe and then the blood red blood gets to my brain. I gotta jump out and I got to meet with this client I breeze. And then I remember the fancy stuff. Okay.

506
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Give what you have to give. And then you won't you won't feel taken advantage of.

507
00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I can do it. I think I could do it, maybe for about 10 minutes or I can do it, just on this part of the register, but the rest of it. I'm kind of uncomfortable.

508
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can ask Betty Joe to do it. That'd be great. And I think that's part of like her lead responsibility. Anyway, I still kind of need a review, blah, blah, blah. You don't sound big

509
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Not to me.

510
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. All right. We'll keep working on it.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh yeah, I see you've got me on this picture here, we'll go back to this. Okay. So good morning. Yes, I kind of got it. But I was meeting with someone just now. I think you're saying, You gotta jump out of here pretty quickly.

534
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So speaking of jumping. I

535
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.160
Shaun w: Don't know what in 40 minutes ago. I gotta leave it like 940

536
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So these sessions are minimum of 45 minutes. So speaking of jumping out early you left group yesterday and I didn't get to hear from you. What's going on.

537
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:35.580
Shaun w: Is I had to go in time ran out. It was already. It was already 10 o'clock, so I left.

538
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's talk about some group etiquette that will work better.

539
01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:41.130
Shaun w: For the

540
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we can make some changes, leaving

541
01:01:46.380 --> 01:02:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So sometimes when people do is they'll say, Hey, I'm, I'm going to have to leave right on on the spot because the commitment is only for that hour and that's fair. I tried to be careful. But it's we're human, so we kind of talk, but you can say, can I be one of the people that shares first

542
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Can I kind of go first or I can you see it.

543
01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:08.580
Yeah.

544
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's go back because I haven't signed that note from yesterday. Um, what did you write for growth mindset that seemed like some more difficult steps for you which which seemed kind of challenging of those

545
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.910
Shaun w: Secondly, yeah.

546
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: How did your sentence say

547
01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:08.430
Shaun w: One was find a good job first to get closer to God. Three become friends board new friends five not now seats workout seven start to care more

548
01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't keep up with that I have

549
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Two number three which you started, which is family. What did what was the sentence.

550
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.490
Shaun w: become friends.

551
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:25.080
With family.

552
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.000
Shaun w: Yeah, I guess so. I guess that's what I put number three.

553
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we just start

554
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.530
Shaun w: I found me don't really know me. I've been gone so long. So there. I'm getting to know them.

555
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that now that's a valuable endeavor. So becoming friends get to know me, you get to know them. So part of the reason why I phrased it this way, my step forward is to capture the first step.

556
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you accomplish that, what's one of the first steps you can take

557
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:07.020
Shaun w: What comes to becoming friend.

558
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.780
Shaun w: Is getting it on

559
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.260
Shaun w: Talking to them.

560
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we talking about which we're talking about your, your children are other people who were talking about your role.

561
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:27.780
Shaun w: Models me

562
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example.

563
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it'd be different for each person. We're not going to talk exactly the same way with everyone. Right. It's more nuanced.

564
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.180
Shaun w: By talking to me, kicking back into North

565
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you already started talking to them.

566
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.910
Shaun w: Yeah, talk to everybody.

567
01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's back up. You said one step, I need to do is I need to start talking to them, but you're already talking to them.

568
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:17.970
Shaun w: Are you getting all i put become friends. What I'd be put

569
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.510
Shaun w: Because

570
01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Now, now we're getting a little bit more precise.

571
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know you've taught

572
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sean doesn't trust easily

573
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.930
Shaun w: Yeah, right.

574
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's because we're blood relatives doesn't mean I'm going to trust you. Right. It doesn't

575
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.400
Shaun w: Automatically oh

576
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.780
Shaun w: It is not

577
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: earn it.

578
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right over time we see people take something precious to us.

579
01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is our vulnerable stuff and we put it out there like this.

580
01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And we see how people treat it.

581
01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Not forever. Little bit we test the water right

582
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.040
We just put it out there like

583
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You've done it with me to test you test me don't you re put a little bit out there. See what I do see if I just

587
01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think of. That's why I'm asking you to kind of pick one person if developing friendship might be different for different people who do you interest who kinda you think I might start with a cousin or will you thinking

588
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:48.330
Shaun w: About my son.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What gets in the way, is he's busy and he's hard to get ahold of am I hearing you correctly.

626
01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Of developing closeness one will go to maybe what's going on for you. What's he say or do. That seems like it's hard to connect or be friends, let's say,

627
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:09.840
Shaun w: You just talk to me. He talks to me is, we're friends.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know the difference. My questions are never intending to be insulting. I just literally don't know um

636
01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know the difference between a closed and a closed ended question and an open ended question.

637
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.160
Shaun w: Though

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:51.090

He

640
01:10:53.190 --> 01:11:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A closed ended, which means your responses will be yes or no, that's a closed ended, which means it's not a

641
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.150
Shaun w: Converse, be a short answer.

642
01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.350

679
01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you were just in dad role and dad doesn't get offended dad does compassion dad does unconditional love dad does analysis dad looks at daughter wonder what's going on with her huh

680
01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But the button. I'm going to hold that for just a while. It'll give it back to you can get offended later disrespected, if you want. Put the button right up front.

683
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what not, not now.

684
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:58.230
Shaun w: The buttons. Not that was why they followed us, you know, and I will reply slappers you know i mean you know you talking to you like that.

Hey, Sean.

686
01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not dad behavior, though.

687
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad.

688
01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.470
Shaun w: Dad, growing up, if we

689
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:16.650
Shaun w: Said, anything like that to my grandma somebody we got slapped

690
01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You fell in love with that slap

691
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:25.530
Shaun w: Me feel know there's love there's discipline. There's discipline to go

692
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:26.610
Shaun w: We gotta

693
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: earn it. First, let me, let me try and do my job. See how it works out you entertain me humor me

694
01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know me.

695
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we can cut me down and I'm fine with that. Here we go, let's say I'm the one

696
01:15:44.790 --> 01:16:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's going to get offended and disrespected, but not you. Not this time. First we're going to connect with daughter, we're going to establish this unconditional love stuff. We're going to earn this trust. I'm there for you. You're here for me, we love each other and then

697
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we discipline. Let's say that the order flipped where your order might be. You got to respect me now. And then I'll show you unconditional love. Let's just say

698
01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this therapist just got this weird way of looking at the world that we flipped the script and went the other way around.

699
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you decided to hear for intent and her fear and her concern behind her anger and we address the anger later.

700
01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gets just, just let me just try it.

701
01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine what your daughter is feeling underneath her anger.

702
01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't that button still over there.

703
01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.910
Shaun w: I don't know. I don't know what the problem is.

704
01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, watch. Who knows what our problem is

705
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter

706
01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So here's comes an open ended question.

707
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, Asia, the way you're you're talking to me is a little distracting and we can talk about that later.

708
01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's going on underneath that. Is it the years of me not being around. Are you uncertain about how to connect with me. I'm confused too. I'm scared to I know for sure. I know I love you. And although I may not know how to connect with you. I know I want to

709
01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:42.450
Shaun w: Colleges, I think, I think she hold it against me because I you guys started I got hooked on math and I jumped up and I left my wife, my kids I just left them and I just

710
01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:45.060
Shaun w: went on with my life.

711
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so that

712
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:54.840
Shaun w: We own the house. We were married. We own the house for seven years, we did good allies money that I got hooked up to shine.

713
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's brilliant. That you can sit with

714
01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That mean you see how that's a different space you create a different space you're able to share that with me, but you're not the one that hurt me. You didn't let me down. I'm not stuck with abandonment.

715
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I

716
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter, I might be like, I would call you a mother fucker right because of what she did, but I'm not going to talk about what you did, because that's, that's, that's my vulnerability and you might

717
01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.660
Shaun w: She has daddy issues. No.

718
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.700
Shaun w: Issues.

719
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Mother or issues or daddy issues which

720
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You can label it and poo poo it. But you do know, and so it's in there. Hey data. It's a little hard to get

721
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To to know you, what we're calling each other names, but I want to tell you something, and you take it like this motherfucker part, you've got like

722
01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it off to the side and you hear what's underneath it. You know what it is. Are you suspect. And so you check in with her. I'm wondering if all that anger. I'm hearing has to do with

723
01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How I let you down addiction had the best to me and and I left out or whatever your truth is I wonder if you would be earning that kind of trust with her and developing that relationship where you could stop kind of name calling and hanging up on each other. That kind of silliness.

724
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying, that's another way to go about it.

725
01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want it to.

726
01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:36.690
Shaun w: Hold it a Korean car this weekend was the sound words where you can be like Arnold Schwarzenegger. You can be all kinds of different people, you could talk to people on the bone.

730
01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:53.940
Shaun w: Me.

Shaun w: Control my grandma and

732
01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's an app.

733
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:11.910
Shaun w: Yeah, it's an ethical sound words and you can talk to people and you can be Dr. Phil and all you do is click other scenes when they say something you just click on something like that and you say something back to 20

734
01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh I like I could do a whole like therapy session on that.

735
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.040
Shaun w: Yes. SOUND boards are great.

736
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:23.940
Shaun w: You know, and it's where you can

737
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:25.440
Shaun w: Talk to people like hello

738
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:26.310
Yeah.

739
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So it might be a nice little armor for you to be able to say something, but in a in a kooky kind of fun way in a playful way that might be in between these for you, you know, to eat.

740
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:47.340
Shaun w: I can hear you. Let me, let me get my, I can hear you. Good. Let me get my son to blow my nose. I can hear you. Oh, okay.

741

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take some time.

745
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And once you share with me. What's coming up for you as we've we've delved a little bit into this notion of of developing a friendship with data.

746
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What's making you think about

747
01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.640
Shaun w: I just wanted to have a good life be somebody

748
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.040
Yeah.

749
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:38.670
Shaun w: Sometimes I thought if I stayed away, maybe because I would ruin their life by balls around like coming around with drugs and stuff. So if I stayed away, it would be better off. I mean,

750
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: She

751
01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.140

No.

753
01:21:54.150 --> 01:22:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Story. If you don't tell us what story to us if we don't know your intent, most likely will blame ourselves that we are unlovable, and you've abandoned me because I'm bad or something wrong with me.

754
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.240
Shaun w: Does that make sense that that people might do that. Yeah.

755
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I would want to know your intent.

756
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:22.710
Shaun w: Maybe we should get older.

757
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And how old is she,

758
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: She's 15. Oh, I do not agree it's not okay.

759
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.350
Shaun w: She's still young, can I

760
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I tell you something. This, this young woman is calling you.

Gwenevere Abriel: And leaving us messages.

762
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.800

763
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:51.570
Shaun w: I told turn

764
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there's showing this change story in her head.

765
01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Change the story. What do you think she can understand this or is this about your fear which is it you don't think a 15 year old can understand that.

766
01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.860
Shaun w: Oh,

767
01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember when you're doing it 15

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.890
Shaun w: I was locked go for a drive by shooting when I was 15

769
01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You think a 15 year old can't understand hearing their dad say I was using. And I thought, maybe if I stayed away. You'd be better off. You think she can't hear that

770
01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:32.400
Shaun w: Yeah.

771
01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude, that means years of her not having to think she's broken unlovable would want to catch it as quick as we can and undo it in for Karen and healing.

772
01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:55.800
Shaun w: She called me about her boyfriend, the other day, and she was trying to tell me and I turning on you're stuck on stupid deja vu is decent you gotta just descent back and don't be with him, they be together like two years burger.

773
01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:00.570
Shaun w: And I don't like eating anyway. She's too young. And then I turned on and

774
01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:13.290
Shaun w: I tried to talk to her about but I'm being straightforward. I'm not sitting here trying to sugarcoat anything so I toward a tour of the way I felt about him. What should she do, and then she hung up on me all mad because of course he was stuck on stupid with this guy.

775
01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't remember being a 15 year old boy.

776
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all about hormones and what's attractive and come on

777
01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's

778

784
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.920
So,

785
01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you. Daisy has reached out to you.

786
01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you're giving advice and we know it's consistent with your personality to shoot people. Straight right. You just, you're a straight shooter. You tell exactly as it is.

787
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:17.130
Shaun w: But I tried to be

788
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's a way to be honest and kind

789
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:32.100
Shaun w: I just think this world is getting to where everybody's trying to be too politically correct about everything when people can't even see what they feel really no marks. You want to try to people, please everybody.

790
01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:41.640
Shaun w: You know i mean i'm not i don't care to people pleasing by if somebody asked me a question a while my my input and I'm going to tell them the truth. You don't see it. And if they don't like it. They don't ask me.

791
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you think you don't try and look particular way sometimes maybe you give an answer.

792
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:56.940
Shaun w: Sometimes everybody does sometimes, but still I try not to. I try to be straightforward. Sure.

793
01:25:56.970 --> 01:25:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Me too.

794
01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm honest, too.

795
01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm careful

796
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How I say it.

797
01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take effort and your daughter is worth it.

798
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're worth it to

799
01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Attending to your ship.

800
01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.910

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.720
Shaun w: Yeah, build a relationship. First, yeah.

802
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I I don't give advice. I can't tell people how to live their life. I just throw different ideas. If any of it appeals to go for it. If not, Pitch it. Forget it ever happen but

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:49.920
Shaun w: There aren't good

804

Shaun w: You're a good counselor i've been i've you're good, sir.

805
01:26:56.790 --> 01:27:02.550
Shaun w: I think you're really, you do a really good job, your job. No, no, I hope.

806
01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope people feel that they're getting new ways of approaching their thoughts and feelings and live site. I hope people feel empowered. I hope that's happening. I, I feel like I'm a witness to it every day. I feel privileged to be a part of it.

807
01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I think your, your honesty is going to serve you very well because you're not only honest with others, right, there's moments you set just today with some shadow side of you you named it, you said it out loud. I was really brave.

808
01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not an easy thing to do.

809
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:52.440

Gwenevere Abriel: Connection improves his sense of unconditional love close up trust that

812
01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: My dad won't judge me won't call me stupid. I can come to him with my concerns with the ugly side of her the stuff that she's embarrassed about.

813
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because I can go to my dad and he can hear me, won't tell me what to do right away. He'll sit with it.

814
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a delicate balance right. He did you do want to know kind of how I was thinking as a 15 year old these guys out that that you want to hear it or what you know. You want to learn the hard way how you want to do.

815
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This yes

816
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:46.380
Shaun w: That's basically what I told her door so you want to hear how i what i think this one I think. Yeah. I said, these are the more you treat a guy. Good. The more he's gonna dis you

817
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:52.770
Shaun w: Said, most of the time, is it when you treat a guy bad he wants you more. It seems like everybody wants what they can't have, you know, I mean,

818
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: On some level, at at it as a team.

819
01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:11.490
Shaun w: That, that can be a team that's like that like that. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz when I was younger, I was I was it seemed like the more I guess the girls and they wanted to be with me more. It was weird, you know,

820
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you teach Deja about how she needs to maybe

821
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.430
Respect herself and love herself.

822
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:30.180
Shaun w: What could I tell her I started out in this prison. He was the word of the day when she was younger. She should be all self respect that I was right.

823
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:40.260
Shaun w: That's the word of the day as well. You gotta respect yourself. I saw you didn't he did you need to watch your mom and act like your mom was Obama's it really good lady, and I said, You need to be like your mom.

824
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.030
Shaun w: Turned out so off respects.

825
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: She said an age right now. Sean It's called individuation, it's fine. We can share some are attributes of our parents, but we also

826
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right as from about 1213 1415 1617 1819 we need to know existentially that we can go out into the world and live on our own. So we pet we test limits.

827
01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We find out who we are. Can I, can I handle situations on my own. That's part of her developmental stage and she's right on time for it if she's starting to test limits.

828
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:28.590
Shaun w: She and I also think that a women mature faster. So she's, she's 15 years old women or girls are more mature, you know, I mean,

829
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a grasp on language we oftentimes can we can have almost like this web of understanding of complex

830
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: connections between things a little quicker. Our brains are a little different than than men's to where our grasp on language, we can catch words for things and connections in complex systems, a little faster. It's true. Doesn't mean you guys can't. But yes.

831
01:30:55.290 --> 01:31:01.170
Shaun w: I read in the artists deduction and said that the two highest IQ is ever reporters to women.

832
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.960
Shaun w: Who is like us in the world every important was to women. Yeah, we've

833
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Got something to offer it's it's a nice balance but appreciating right oh appreciate yourself. I love that.

834
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.890
Shaun w: Word why ball.

835
01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:21.870
Shaun w: By ball advice is to get mad because I always tell them, I'll tell you, women only have rights because men allow it.

836
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:26.010
Shaun w: And they're all watch our juvenile and wizard.

837
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.810
Shaun w: I think you guys only have rights because we allow it.

838
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you guys do have the muscles. So you're

839
01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the many, many centuries, that's the case. Yes.

840
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.210
Shaun w: That's how you guys have learned to use your brains. Yeah.

841
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

842
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A counter argument might be, you're, you're

843
01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're intimidated by our intellect and our ability to

844
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:51.000
Shaun w: Add

845
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.310
Shaun w: Some of these words, these words you're bumping out

846
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey hey hey we're sparring. So maybe

847
01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's using your, your brawn against a female because we can reproduce and you are amazed at this miracle and that

848
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And maybe, maybe you are actually threatened by this miracle. I don't know. And so maybe controlling us might be might be the safest way to

849
01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.000
Shaun w: Control, don't I believe

850
01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:32.130
Shaun w: Yeah, I believe, a man is only as good as his woman. That's what I believe. I believe that if you have a no good woman. You're going to be no good.

851
01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:45.660
Shaun w: So you need to have a good strong woman. If you're a woman is a good strong woman that your life is going to be good. It's all depends on who you're with I've noticed that every friend. I've had when he has a good woman their life's good would have a bad woman there likes bad

852
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:49.140
Shaun w: You know, I mean, so it seems like it's more on to the woman.

853
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:53.100
Shaun w: And just hard to find them nowadays because they're

854
01:32:54.270 --> 01:33:02.460
Shaun w: They're not really out there no more like these young girls like it's crazy like that people like these young girls don't have what I'm noticing like married at 21 year old. I don't have

855
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:14.250
Shaun w: Like they don't even have no morals, like they don't care. Like they'll sleep around and don't even care like back in the day, people cared. They do things like that women didn't, you know, I mean it nowadays it's bad, but they really don't care anymore.

856
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:20.370
Shaun w: It's gonna be different for you to have a daughter to right that's kind of coming of her sexual

857
01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Age. She's

858
01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A special person. And now, reflecting back to your own

859
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:38.400
Shaun w: Yeah, I tell her I saw these are please don't be some little sleds you want me to hang up on you know as long as you're seeing these are pleased on please respect yourself, don't, don't be some some dirty girl.

861
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.090
Shaun w: She gets mad. She said that I don't do drugs.

862
01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:54.780

01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:02.520
Shaun w: I love everything about it. Remember why. No, but like, like a little attitude, a

865
01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:06.300

870
01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's also on time. It's both.

871
01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's big right at this age. They care more about their peer group than they do their parents. That's part of the individuation so if we educate them and say that's on time but don't forget your family values are going to steer you

872
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it means you hold on to your values and you bounce it off of desisted feel right for me. I don't want to do it. My friends are doing, but the pressure Asia is strong to be just like your friends, but in the end.
