10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, some of the 11 all the 11. That's it. No dirty diapers dirty diapers.

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.630
Donna Jochimsen: That's right.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.860
Donna Jochimsen: Good, I'm good. A little bit sleepy, excuse me, my, I don't have any makeup. I'm not even sure I brush my hair that's

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.910
Okay.

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. Eight o'clock. Certainly.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.520
Donna Jochimsen: Well, not usually the I've been taking Seroquel

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:19.800
Donna Jochimsen: And does it help me sleep better, and it's getting harder for me to get up earlier, but I got, I did it. I got up. I'm here at all together here, but I am here.

17
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. Right.

18
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, at least you here. So tell me about your book.

19
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:42.900
Donna Jochimsen: Tell me about my book. Okay. Well, it's been a little bit more difficult for me to to work in my book that the the the chapter about words is really long and

20
00:01:44.250 --> 00:02:02.670
Donna Jochimsen: It's a little bit complicated, not complicated, but it's a lot to think about. There's a lot of exercises in it. The first few chapters were fairly straightforward and pretty easy. But this one's a little bit, a little bit harder, you know,

21
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:14.520
Donna Jochimsen: See, let me see if I can explain it. The fact that you can use different words for the same thing, but they might

22
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.340
Donna Jochimsen: mean something. Yeah. Right. You know,

23
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:29.190
Donna Jochimsen: It's just, it's, it's a little bit more difficult taking me a little bit more time, but I'm really, I really still enjoying it. I'm learning so much

24
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.640
Donna Jochimsen: From it

25
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wrote was the first two chapters about

26
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.450
Donna Jochimsen: The first two chapters were basically well. The first one was an introduction. The second one was about

27
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:53.040
Donna Jochimsen: Every everybody saw everybody stuff every human suffers your, you know, like, you're not alone all human

28
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.180
Donna Jochimsen: Suffer

29
00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:07.920
Donna Jochimsen: They go through suffering and you know and and how we get through that suffering means means a lot is basically what the second chapter, was it

30
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:22.650
Donna Jochimsen: There was a list of all the things that you think make you suffer like I put my bipolar my my my my issues with my mother, you know, things like that, but

31
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:39.690
Donna Jochimsen: Things that stick with you that that cause you suffering, you know and and that part was easier for me to do, then, then the associations with words because it's not

32
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:54.030
Donna Jochimsen: It's not just as simple as words matter, although they do, but I think he's trying to explain that that because we're human only humans.

33
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.710
Donna Jochimsen: Use words and logic and and try and and that kind of thing. Animals down

34
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:24.150
Donna Jochimsen: And that because we do. It's one of our greatest assets because it helps us figure out problems and learn new things. It's also one of our biggest enemies because our words and our thoughts. Keep us trapped in where we're at.

35
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.210
Donna Jochimsen: Right and so affect how an effect how we see it, you know.

36
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow yeah pretty powerful. It's true. You know, definitely.

37
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, more to be sharper than knives.

38
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.980
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, they can and we use them on ourselves more than other people use it on us.

39
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hat is 100% true

40
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, in a they call that the shitty committee, right.

41
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.840
Donna Jochimsen: Yep. Yeah.

42
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.070
It's

43
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.870
Donna Jochimsen: It's I'm learning different ways of thinking of

44
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.340
Donna Jochimsen: Things you know yeah

45
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:17.850
Donna Jochimsen: I've always done that a little bit like when my husband died my my kids just expected me to fall apart, you know, after 42 years of being married and

46
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:28.620
Donna Jochimsen: And I don't know right from the very start. I knew it was I knew how horrible it was going to be. I knew it. But my attitude was you know what

47
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:43.050
Donna Jochimsen: I am going to look at this as a new opportunity you know and and I've tried to do that over the last few years, I've tried to see it as an opportunity for for growth.

48
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know yeah yeah definitely making changes and doing what you need to do for Donna

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:02.220
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, which was which really helped me get out of stay out of the OH, WOE IS ME, then you know

52
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, it's like

Donna Jochimsen: Make a new life, you know,

55
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, when we realized that we have voices and that we can choose to do things differently. And when we can choose to go wherever we want to go where we can you know be in develop whoever we want to be. It's pretty amazing.

56
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.270
Donna Jochimsen: You know, it isn't.

57
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.290
Donna Jochimsen: Especially as a as a heroin addict. I was really tied up with the

58
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.390
Donna Jochimsen: You know, nothing's ever going to change. This is just the way it is. I have to just accept this.

59
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.900
Donna Jochimsen: I really got stuck in that I'm not seeing any way out.

60
00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:09.300
Donna Jochimsen: So, you know, for me to for me to decide that my husband step was sad, but also the best opportunity I ever had was, was really a big thing.

61
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.070
Yeah.

62
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:24.690

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:37.260
Donna Jochimsen: My dad has been so easy. He has forgotten that he ever lived somewhere else he's happy at my brother's he's so happy.

65
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.830
Donna Jochimsen: I don't. All I am very, very much. Now, because of the coven thing I'm worried about him, but

66
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:56.370
Donna Jochimsen: When I talked to him on the phone. Of course, he still has been and that is so happy. And he wasn't happy when he was at home. He was not

67
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.990
Donna Jochimsen: You know, he was depressed. He was. Yeah, he was depressed. So that's what it was.

72
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:46.140
Donna Jochimsen: It was my responsibility to take care of him, but I was doing it from a distance. I was going over to three times a day, you know, and it wasn't the same as having as living with people. It wasn't

73
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes a difference.

74
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.420
Donna Jochimsen: It does is dementias. He actually even better. You know, because he

75
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:06.030

76
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, which makes it easier to get, you know, do the things that you want to do for you to

77
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

78

Donna Jochimsen: Yeah yeah

79
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.720
Donna Jochimsen: Because the things slowed me down a little bit. I've already miss my trip to Oregon twice.

80
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:29.880
Donna Jochimsen: But we're still planning on it as soon as we're traveling restrictions, you know, let up a little bit.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As important you know where else is it that you want to go.

84
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:52.560
Donna Jochimsen: You know, I don't know, I've never, I've always been content with my family and just being here. So I really don't know. I need to get out and around and see where else it is. I might

85
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:52.770
Like

86
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

87
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely being able to get out and experience and do things, you know,

88
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's going to be huge. Yep, you know,

89
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:16.080
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, this I was ready to go to this code thing really did but that's all right. It gave me a little more time for self reflection in a little more time for assault work.

90
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:36.450
Donna Jochimsen: You know, and, and I spend a lot of time with my granddaughter's we do zoom, zoom meetings with my granddaughters and and I try to think of them more more than I used to think of myself. I used when my husband verse died, I was pretty wrapped up in my cell.

91
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.810
Donna Jochimsen: You know, and, and it's it's been good for me and then they've Mr grandma.

92
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, and they're the ones that are in Oregon.

93
00:10:48.870 --> 00:11:02.250
Donna Jochimsen: I've got, I have got, let's see two granddaughters and Oregon, and I've got two that live about 25 miles away. And to that little about 40 miles away.

94
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.470
Oh, wow. Yeah.

95
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they're just kind of scattered in a little bit.

96
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:21.990
Donna Jochimsen: A little bit there. They're easy i i go see them way more often, you know, I go to my daughter and Brookings I go to dinner with them and I spend holidays, a lot of holidays with

97
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.320
Donna Jochimsen: My daughter and I UT

98
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:40.350
Donna Jochimsen: That was my most difficult relationship, but we've repaired it so well. She's the one that on her daughter's birthday. I was disappointed that I couldn't go so on April 14

99
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:50.580
Donna Jochimsen: So all of a sudden somebody pulls up and I'm like, What the heck I go out there and there's there's Penelope and Samantha in the car.

100
00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:04.920
Donna Jochimsen: With the windows rolled down and they came, they came here first for Penelope his birthday, so I was able to get her her President saying Happy birthday, and Samantha brought to cupcakes.

101
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.060
Oh,

102
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.790
Donna Jochimsen: blow out candles and sing happy birthday. Yeah, that one's for she's five but don't say for she's now five

103
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:16.950
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, so

104
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.550
Donna Jochimsen: It was important to her, you know,

105
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god, that would be awesome.

106
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:32.220
Donna Jochimsen: I cried when they laughed. I really did. Just, just the fact that I have repaired that relationship so well.

107
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.040
Donna Jochimsen: We've talked. We've talked a lot. She was

108
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:49.320
Donna Jochimsen: She was about 15 maybe I think in 2003 when I went away to the Methadone clinic in Ukiah California

109
00:12:49.890 --> 00:13:04.680
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, and I was. I thought I was doing the right thing. I really did. I needed to go. I needed some kind of help and. And so I went and then 30 days into it. My mom died.

110
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:26.580
Donna Jochimsen: And I wanted to come home, really bad, but my family all said, nope. Nope, you stay where you're at, you're doing what you should be doing, you know, I, I came for the funeral and that kind of thing. But I wasn't there for my mom and my 15 year old daughter.

111
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.240
Donna Jochimsen: Had a lot of resentment to me.

112
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.040
Donna Jochimsen: About that.

113
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:33.810
You know,

114
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:44.880
Donna Jochimsen: She told me she said, you know, Mom, dad has been in and out of my life. But you're my mom. You were supposed to be there for me and she's right.

115
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:55.380
Donna Jochimsen: She's absolutely right. Even if even if my intentions were the best, and I was trying to get better, you know,

116
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.070
Donna Jochimsen: I let her down. Yeah.

117
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:09.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which you know we do even if you were not struggling with addiction. It's still a possibility as as

118
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Parents, we still better children town, you know, I'm not intentionally, for sure.

119
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.560
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

120
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it happens.

121
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.680
Donna Jochimsen: I didn't, I didn't even know that she was that let down until

122
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:31.200
Donna Jochimsen: Well, after her dad died sometime when we were in the car and she told me. But in my mind, I'm thinking

123
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:47.520
Donna Jochimsen: I'm doing I'm doing what I need to do for me and for our family and, you know, so this is the right thing to do, but she didn't see it that way. And as a matter of fact, from that day on, we had

124
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:58.110
Donna Jochimsen: We thought like crazy. She called me a bit every single morning. I would just this she was angry, she really was.

125
00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.770
Yeah.

126
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now.

127
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:12.930
Donna Jochimsen: She's over it now to see also is old enough now she's got kids and she's old enough now to see that. But I did do what I need. It should have been doing and that

128
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.760
Donna Jochimsen: You know, but but it was hard for her. It really was.

129
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love that you guys are building this good relationship now of healing, you know,

130
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:38.790
Donna Jochimsen: Me to really made to the other three we've always been fairly close or at least we could talk about it. You know, if someone was mad at me. They just say I'm just a mom, you know, whatever.

131
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:42.750
Donna Jochimsen: Actions.

132
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

133
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good. I could never

134
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:55.260
Donna Jochimsen: I couldn't figure that out. I'm thinking, what's wrong with this kid, you know, but

135
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.810
Donna Jochimsen: Now, I know.

136
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now you know what's right and the funny part is that they're individuals. So they respond to situations differently.

137
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I think that we forget that.

138
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, totally forget it. The other two will find, why isn't this one fine. And you know what I mean.

139
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But when we individualize them as people.

140
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's different because then you can see

141
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:39.330
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, and she's definitely definitely a different person. She's I would cut classify like other three children is very similar. And she's, she's a firecracker she always has been, like, a little firecracker since the day she was born, you know,

142
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:52.050
Donna Jochimsen: very emotional her emotions. You're just right there. If you make her mad. There is no question about it. You can just watch that anger just roll over her face.

143
00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:07.470
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, but she's also the most loving, caring, kid, but I have to press president. She's completely president, you know, she. She's a, she's a wonderful kid. She's doing great. Now,

144
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.220
Donna Jochimsen: So earning. Yeah, me too.

145
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is just cool, really, really cool.

146
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just story to be told, that's for sure.

147
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.840
Donna Jochimsen: You know, here.

148
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you still going to meetings online and engaging with them.

149
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:33.780
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah I am, I, I've been going to women. Women for recovery about at least once a week, sometimes twice, but at least once a week.

150
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.190
Donna Jochimsen: It's

151
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:43.470
Donna Jochimsen: Going it's going it's going ok i i prefer face to face meetings.

152
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.580
Donna Jochimsen: But

153
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:57.000
Donna Jochimsen: You know, for, for right now, it's, it's a really good thing. And even when I go back to face to face meetings loves I'll continue to go because

154
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:18.720
Donna Jochimsen: I have began to build relationships and they're all great women and and they're all there to support women in any way that they can, if you have a problem. They there's probably 10 level. I'm right there with with some kind of advice or or help for you. You know, so

155
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.110
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

156
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It means a lot.

157
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.820
Donna Jochimsen: It does mean a lot, especially at times when you're stuck home alone. A lot. Yeah.

158
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. When the world opens up and you know we're able to engage with others, a little bit more freely. It's definitely going to feel like a privilege, you know, to me,

159
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.760
Donna Jochimsen: It's probably gonna feel really weird.

160
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just

161
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:52.590
Donna Jochimsen: Being home all the time felt being back out in the world is probably going to feel just a strange for a little while.

162
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I think so too. It'll be good. It'll be exciting.

163
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.590
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, it will be good. I have no doubt about it. It will be good.

164
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what

165
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is there like a questionnaire at the end of each chapter in your book or things that they want you to look at

166
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.570
Donna Jochimsen: It's not so much a questionnaire. There are

167
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:23.970
Donna Jochimsen: Like problem or write things they want you to think about and to work through all through the chapter.

168
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:41.880
Donna Jochimsen: That's one of the things that slowed me down with with the words chapter is it's really long and there's probably almost I'm going to guess between 30 and 40 different exercises in in that section.

169
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:42.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

170
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.440
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, yeah, it's a long one. It's a big one. He definitely wants me to think about that a lot.

171
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.400
Donna Jochimsen: There's a focus on that so

172
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you just kind of brought me back around to in my head words do matter and they do hurt. And we really have to watch

173
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:12.810
Donna Jochimsen: I don't just her. They help encourage they help, they do whatever your intentions are, you know,

174
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, big time. And so how long do you think it'll take you to get through the chapter, how long are you going to give yourself.

175
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:29.070
Donna Jochimsen: I'm getting pretty close. I've been a little bit slow because I've been doing some remodeling in my house. But I'm thinking that

176
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.970
Donna Jochimsen: Maybe by next week, I should be done.

177
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. And then we'll kind of review it a little bit.

178
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.150
Donna Jochimsen: For sure.

179
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:46.590

226
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:59.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, it's great you know when we're building relationships and things are getting good you know within them. And I mean, really, honestly. That's what life's all about, you know,

227
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

228
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:19.170
Donna Jochimsen: For them, and some was that in some ways they had an advantage. I didn't use drugs for like the first 1314 years of their lives or oldest ones lives.

229
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.190
Donna Jochimsen: That made it really hard on him. He wanted to say this mom, you know,

230
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:35.760
Donna Jochimsen: But they all got they all got a really good feel for who mom really is.

231
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:43.920
Donna Jochimsen: So you know they they knew me before I started using and

232
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:53.850
Donna Jochimsen: In some ways, it made it easier for now. At the time, I think it made it harder because I wanted to know, where did my mom go

233
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.720
Well, I happen.

234
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:04.590
Donna Jochimsen: But they remember they all got they got a pretty if they say the first five years is the most important

235
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:16.980
Donna Jochimsen: For a lot of things they got good saw a good solid five years. So I'm sure that that's helped them all become successful and happy people.

236
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:23.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. Very much so. And, you know, even through your addiction, you've taught them.

237
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:29.190
Donna Jochimsen: I did I was there, I was as present as possible which

238
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:40.350
Donna Jochimsen: wasn't always that possible, but I but I tried the best that I did. I was the best mother that I could even at that time. Yeah.

239
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good, you know, and you've got to have some kind of solace on that, you know,

240
00:28:46.320 --> 00:29:00.480
Donna Jochimsen: I do. I have a lot. I never, I've never hit one of my children and they, you know, they always had plenty to eat that close. I went to their things, but I wasn't always present.

241
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

242
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.600
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. Hundred percent present and bad and that I do do know.

243
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:15.780
Donna Jochimsen: And plus, I hope that there. I hoped that there are the things that I needed to go do with them started after I could get well.

244
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:24.750
Donna Jochimsen: We were late for a few things because about that. Yeah, I have. I have guilt. I do.

245
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:44.580
Donna Jochimsen: But you know, I decided to let that go. Because that guilt that I've been packing around all these years, I, I made it. For one thing, I made it worse in my head, then then based out and it was keeping me from

246
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.210
Donna Jochimsen: Having healthy relationships.

247
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

248
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:56.130
Donna Jochimsen: You can't bring your guilt with you can't bring guilt and to be a good mom again, you know,

249
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.030
Yeah.

250
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because then we wind up overcompensating to the point of no good do it's unhealthy on that side of things, do you know so

251
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:20.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Letting it go and realizing that it's in the past and you're doing the best that you can do now and you have these amazing relationships with them now. You know what I mean way outweighs any big huge luggage that you carry around the field.

252
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

253
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.490
Donna Jochimsen: I I made I actually will cover. Here's where words matter.

254
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:35.640
Donna Jochimsen: I convinced myself that even though they weren't holding any of that against me.

255
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:54.720
Donna Jochimsen: I felt like I didn't deserve to spend time with them. I felt like I would let them down again. If I spent time with them, which made me stay distant from them, even after I got clean, you know,

256
00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:11.430
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. And I finally just thought to myself, well, not just that's just really stupid, you know, let it go now. And I hate to say it was that easy, but it almost it pretty much was that easy. Just

257
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.560
Donna Jochimsen: Once you when you're ready.

258
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're ready

259
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:29.430
Donna Jochimsen: When you're ready, you're ready yeah I struggled with that for years. But yeah, one day, it's just like, Oh, now that's really dumb. You're never going to have the relationship that you want and they need if you keep talking guilt around and thinking you don't deserve it.

260
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.420
Donna Jochimsen: And maybe, maybe you don't. But they do.

261
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.700
Donna Jochimsen: So, you know,

262
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you do

263
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.350
Donna Jochimsen: You like yes I do. Yes, I do.

264
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:49.350
Donna Jochimsen: I agree, but at that at when I first started thinking like that my thought was, maybe you don't. But they do. And you're right. I absolutely do.
