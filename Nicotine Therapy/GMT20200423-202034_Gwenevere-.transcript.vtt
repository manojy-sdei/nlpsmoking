26
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.750
Laura Lujan: First of all, second of all, I said like, I'm not trying to be a burden in her life. So there's people like I just told you, like I just told me like my dad.

27
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.590
Laura Lujan: Got all drunk or whatever but technically that's why tree. So, you know, like, but the thing is like she made my Dad. Come at me again like 10 minutes later and totally different, you know,

28
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:53.070
Laura Lujan: Persona because of her like it wasn't like I just talked about that but ever and I will find that all of a sudden when I call me totally maintain dog, so you don't have to come home, you know, I'm like, whoa, what you think it was in the background. I'm like, Okay. Okay, now I get it.

29
00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So, and do you have the perspective, like you get it. How, how good could the dynamics be between your dad and your stepmom I mean really, how good could they be think about

30
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.100
Laura Lujan: It at all whatsoever.

31
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't be good. So this is not about you.

32
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about you. This is about their dynamic

33
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And how pleasant. It is to triangulate as you as the bad guy.

34
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

35
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you're not the bad guy.

36
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:42.000
Laura Lujan: Yeah. And the thing is, like, like even told me she's like all one you will excuse was, well, I'm just worried about, like, what, what does it feel coming over and you're not here. I'm like, Okay.

37
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.390
Laura Lujan: Then you tell him right where I am. And like we should we go from there. And then, you know, I come home, like I'm not a house arrest.

38
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:58.770
Laura Lujan: Like, like if I was on house arrest. That'd be differently. I'm allowed to go, I just have to live there, like, yes, like, like, you know, like the machine was making it seem like I was under house arrest that I could not be watched.

39
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:10.020
Laura Lujan: And I'm like, that's not the case, like I talked to me about. I asked him specifically and, you know, just thinking I, even I even asked him, I said, hey, like, I'm not gonna lie, like, be like, yeah, that

40
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.300
Laura Lujan: You'd like to use all that's, that's fine. I'll keep you from the night still make a routine of it. So let's not

41
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:28.260
Laura Lujan: You know, but the thing is, and I'm not trying to disrespect going to bed early or you know what I mean. Wise. I mean, my dad decided on online 30 and if it's getting later than I thought it was interesting that like at that point.

42
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.190
You

43
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you talking really fast and I missing some of it.

44
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.700
So,

45
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.150
Laura Lujan: Basically the point in that truth, it was trying to say, like, I could not go through. I couldn't go anywhere past like I guess eight

46
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:55.560
Laura Lujan: In case my appeal comes over, or whatever. But what she's not understanding is like my appeal is like, like, like, yeah, I'm supposed to close a loser. Yes, but like

47
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.190
Laura Lujan: Being out past eight doesn't mean I don't live like

48
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.020
Laura Lujan: You know what I mean.

49
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.060
Laura Lujan: I don't know where her like

50
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:13.020
Laura Lujan: Guideline was, I guess I know because I was like her like she would get mad if it was like 730 and beyond. But me might not agree on 930

51
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:29.820
Laura Lujan: But like she gets so if I'm not home like at a reasonable time global and takes it to like this person over like account on white respect actually think I'm disrespecting her at that point, which isn't the case. But like, I'm not gonna like deny that like

52
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.330
Laura Lujan: I don't want to be like, you know what I mean.

53
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, let's hold on, let's not go any further.

54
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just stay right there.

55
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be there. I don't want to care boyfriend doesn't want you there. She probably wants you there.

56
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.210
Laura Lujan: You're born

57
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:07.140
Laura Lujan: Oh my goodness. Like he actually said that maybe she did like maybe she doesn't want you there. Like, like, just like secretly she might like have like a weird, I guess, jealousy thing with me kind of

58
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:18.480
Laura Lujan: Okay, I could, I could see that too because you know with the whole money thing too, because if I'm in the picture that's less money she gets in there and I'm not trying to like about it but that's how it is.

59
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:30.330
Laura Lujan: If I'm if I'm then then my dad's not going to lend her a card as easy because I'm going to put up a front. I'm going to be like, hey, maybe, you know, she just got paid. Like why would you be like

60
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can we squeeze go right there and see, see how that benefits you to put up that front right there. How come you do that part. Is it, is there any. Yeah. How can you do that part.

61
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.230
Laura Lujan: Because she

62
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.010
Laura Lujan: She straight a blind room. She's saying oh yeah I only made X amount of money. I know that much to me. You just home.

63
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.740
Laura Lujan: So instead of

64
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you are

65
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling for him.

66
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.170
Laura Lujan: Yeah, which is weird. I know it's really hard.

67
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.480
Laura Lujan: I don't do that. But I do that financially, because I'm sorry, the only person can take my dad's money.

68
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

69
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.480
Laura Lujan: You know what I mean, like,

70
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on.

71
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't have any judgment about any of it.

72
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the only thing I'm thinking about is whether that's adaptive

73
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's working. That's the only I always read just from, like, is it working for my client.

74
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it not working for my client if it's working. Okay. It's not illegal. It's not hurting life and limb then okay we'll carry on. But so I want to see if it's really as adaptive if you if you are playing

75
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Any kind of game and the game is a. It could be a lot of different things. Some games people play. Are they do.

76
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A power struggle game.

77
00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And if this is one where you're struggling with her on who has the most power with Dad, this could be tricky.

78
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: If she picks up on that and doesn't feel powerful she might try to

79
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: push you down.

80
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.650
Laura Lujan: Right.

81
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want that. And it could be if you're really honest with yourself. You just did it. You said, I want to be the one that's

82
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.920
Using my dad's money.

83
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So it could be that you two are in some kind of struggle and neither one of you are kind of aware of it. So if you at least can see that you're in it.

84
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to you're going to be able to have some movement in there, you're going to have some freedom if you know you're in a power struggle with someone

85
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.520
Or

86
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:49.020
Laura Lujan: It's been faking the whole thing has been live from the beginning. And that's the thing that I don't like, because I was

87
00:08:49.710 --> 00:09:01.950
Laura Lujan: You know, my mom told me. Don't ever like two o'clock, and then you got Teresa and my dad who have this point, I was like five years ago, I just called the cops from my mom. Okay, so my mom was not in my life I'm

88
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.960
Laura Lujan: A CALL THE COPS ON MY MOM IN 2015

89
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:14.610
Laura Lujan: was five years ago. Okay. And like I said she, she had. I guess I'm using the quote unquote

90
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:21.540
Laura Lujan: But I didn't. I wasn't going to call the cops on him. I told Teresa will happen and Teresa said will remain in the costume right now.

91
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:29.460
Laura Lujan: You know, we're going to go meet pop it out of it. Okay. Well, I guess, and we are like I just kind of let it happen. I didn't deny, but like it wasn't my idea to call it.

92
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:39.630
Laura Lujan: I call my dad and my dad will happen. My dad called tree seven and choose to call me like, hey, we're going to call the cops and I'm like okay I guess we are like, okay, like, you know, anyway.

93
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The topic is I don't like lies.

94
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:54.990
Laura Lujan: Right, so I'm going to go with this embarrass me so um they started that whole and. Okay, so then you got Teresa telling the cop like Lauren

95
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:09.750
Laura Lujan: Lauren can be in a zebra environment and be home with me. My fiance. They were not in a hurry and she told the cop right there and then we you know we were talking about my mom and how she views me whatever and she's telling the confidence that they weren't he will make

96
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:22.500
Laura Lujan: And then the copies and I'm like yo, with that. And she's like, well, we got to do that for like, you know, in case for legal reasons. And I was like, so you're lying for legal reasons. But you guys are living two separate better rather than as

97
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:31.020
Laura Lujan: Well, my dad was all for it. My dad was like, hell yeah I mean I got a chance, sweet, like, yeah, like let's get engaged, but I would like us alive. Like, why

98
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:47.010
Laura Lujan: So like, at that point, I felt like I lost my whole battle because then I was different. I was, I was a dependent, but I was awful alive at that point because she made me laugh because she said that thing ready and I, they weren't but I got asked that question. I had to say yes.

99
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.390
To

100
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You are forced to lie.

101
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.370
Laura Lujan: Yeah, and it was like, well, what, like what am I gonna say no, like,

102
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know what the truth, could have been, it would have been

103
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard that.

104
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see how I heard that they are engaged. That is true. I heard

105
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

106
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We could have

107
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: A little game with that one so that you couldn't maintain that sense of

108
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That sense of defiance.

109
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.570
Laura Lujan: What God dude like I never had to do that before and I was great. And the thing is, that was a meeting and salami was the state of New Mexico.

110
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:40.620
Laura Lujan: And I would, and I had to be there for the hearing. Because of that, I got subpoenaed the court, and I asked a question and I worked for me.

111
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So good. So let's back up a little bit. Let's back up to

112
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's

113
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.810
Laura Lujan: That history right

114
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Also I'm

115
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Your every day. You've got to live with something every day. And that's the part you started with today. It was about. There's this thing that's happening ongoing with

116
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Teresa. Okay. Yeah.

117
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I say, is your approach is it getting you what you want.

118
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.180
Laura Lujan: Um,

119
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.480
Laura Lujan: I don't want anything from it but

120
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, it

121
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:33.270
Laura Lujan: Oh yeah, I guess you're right. I do all my dad to not get robbed by her looks like blind and yeah it is.

122
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.950
Laura Lujan: It is

123
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you get, is it that you get

124
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.570
Laura Lujan: How could I

125
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:50.250
Laura Lujan: Not going to get money. I don't get money out of it now because my dad died. My mom would like my dad would give me money. Regardless, like, and it's not that I would get more money if she doesn't get money or whatever.

126
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:59.370
Laura Lujan: But I just don't want my data between was like like he's letting him to be treated like a goal. And the thing in my dad and I'll call my natural like my dad, my dad's

127
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:10.890
Laura Lujan: A lot of things, but he's not a full like he doesn't like you can't do that. Like he he does work. He is about, you know, even though you know thought he does work. He works with the corrals like you know

128
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:17.910
Laura Lujan: And like that alone says a lot for my dad and I don't know if that might not ever but I defend him against her a lot

129
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:25.170
Laura Lujan: Weird, I guess maybe because I feel like she doing what he's doing in reverse, with a little bit

130
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.050
Laura Lujan: Always the hard liquor.

131
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How do we ignore his other failures. How do we ignore the abuse his behavior. How did, how did, how do you

132
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.320
Laura Lujan: Decide I like turn it off like that.

133
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

134
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:42.450
Laura Lujan: I don't know.

135
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I

136
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.060
Laura Lujan: Couldn't tell you I

137
00:13:46.860 --> 00:14:01.290
Laura Lujan: Have to do with like my mom did that you know my, my mom's a gold digger like my mom so that like Teresa, then at that point is, like, in my mind, nobody to my mom and I don't like my mom. Don't get like my, my mom is a gold digger she

138
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.230
Laura Lujan: And I don't live by that, like, I just don't like I don't like it. I don't like guys

139
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:19.200
Laura Lujan: Or girls who died for money. I don't like it takes me. I want a whole nother level of, like, you know, just I don't know and like Teresa's a good person.

140
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:30.630
Laura Lujan: Until you know it comes to the whole she does a thing where she talks about herself so much like she's always like, Oh my God, for me, I'm paying oh my god like

141
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:44.220
Laura Lujan: And it's like if you hear her talk with environment. If you automatically know that she's ability to like she's just like automatically like all for me. Oh my god, I'm in pain on she volunteers, a lot of information. You don't even know about.

142
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:56.970
Laura Lujan: Right off the bat, and you know, I, for the most part, I respect her for that you know whatever fill out. It's not that bad left by the least in my book and rules will believe spot and category or whatever.

143
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.680
Laura Lujan: Teresa hasn't hit me. She hasn't a beautiful she hasn't crossed that line doesn't mean that my mom and my dad up

144
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:08.370
Laura Lujan: Okay, what she what she has taken what was mine. I guess I'm trying to get that kind of

145
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Cake.

146
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But she take my

147
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.370
Money.

148
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.120
Laura Lujan: Okay, she took my dad's money 10 point to where like

149
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:26.460
Laura Lujan: She like I guess I was younger, I was probably like 1314 and I was promised by my dad or whatever that you're going to get me to call it or whatever. Well, she started dating Teresa.

150
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:40.620
Laura Lujan: And he ended up giving the card or whatever. And again, as I kind of, I guess, fuck with me on a whole nother level that I can't explain because like, It's messed up that I would even use that. I'm like, you know,

151
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't have. It's okay. I don't find it.

152
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.670
Laura Lujan: It's okay, fine, you

153
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that part makes perfect sense. You don't ever have to explain it to me. They'll be work that you and I do a little later. We'll do some deeper work out. Okay.

154
00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you don't have to make an excuse for that. That'll make Yeah, don't worry about that part. I'm not judging you. None of that stuff.

155
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're not. You're not.

156
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but remember, what I'm doing is I'm focusing on just current day stuff.

157
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.790
Laura Lujan: I'm trying. Yeah.

158
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, trying to say let's let's be really honest, not about the fact that, how am I even having this relationship at all.

159
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know that you're doing it for the survival reason we can get to the underlying stuff.

160
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: On another day, but just

161
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this part right here which is

162
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it working.

163
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason why I'm saying is it working is because if you keep it up and we don't call a spade a spade, meaning you're trippin. You're trying to have more power than Teresa, it might backfire.

164
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.360
Laura Lujan: Please, please.

165
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.180
Laura Lujan: Please continue.

166
00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if it backfires she could. She has, she's not troubled by lying, whereas you are bothered by lying, she'll be okay now people when I'm around people that are able to like easily and freely.

167
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared because they can just lie.

168
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.540
Laura Lujan: And yeah, it could

169
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.790
Laura Lujan: Oh, I know. Yeah, and that

170
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.650
Laura Lujan: Mid planes. Nurse.

171
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.790
Because you're playing

172
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You're playing

173
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.020
Laura Lujan: Yes he does that a lot. Yeah.

174
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're playing with fire.

175
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.660
Laura Lujan: A couple of times.

176
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say

177
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I am. I'm, I'm trying to

178
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep my power with my dad, which means

179
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Money. He's only got this basically this one thing he's not a good man.

180
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Not a good man, but he does have money he's got the end by fucking god he's going to give you that damn money.

181
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. See

182
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.020
Laura Lujan: Sorry.

183
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. So I remember

184
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.970
Laura Lujan: My mom and me. I swear, is my mom. I mean, but you

185
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it. No, no, no, no, no, no, this is

186
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Not Gold Digger that's not in there. Come back to me come back to the way I just

187
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, felt true like you can at least do that.

188
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

189
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.390
Laura Lujan: Well, I mean, it's more or less like, Well, you're gonna you know you can do everything else.

190
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

191
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't understand what you just said. But let's stay here for a second. Stay right here with whether it's working. You could win, but you might end up going back into jail or a longer session longer probation or they might

192
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Something really negative might happen because she

193
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know her story, but she may not want to give up the power. She has, she's willing to say that she's engaged to someone. I mean, I don't know what she's capable of. But you're playing with fire.

194
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.760
Laura Lujan: Ya know,

195
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If you and I can keep it real, you'll have an outlet, you'll be able to say what you want in here with me.

196
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

197
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.110
Laura Lujan: Not to play with the fire.

198
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you can let it out. You can say weapon.

199
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not gonna have any judgment about it. We can lay it out raw. Okay.

200
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But, um, when it comes to how you navigate this game.

201
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How right how to get this little piece of resource that your dad has which is money.

202
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you mess with Teresa.

203
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: She might really mess with your freedom.

204
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.360
Laura Lujan: I'm glad about that.

205
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How can it, is it worth it to, let's just be honest is

206
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:50.100
Laura Lujan: Anything is kind of like actually told me that that was a thing to think about because she was lucky, but

207
00:19:50.820 --> 00:20:00.240
Laura Lujan: Like I told you earlier he mentioned that maybe she doesn't want you and your dad or whatever. And I was like, I don't think she does. And then he was like, no, she probably trying to be locked up again.

208
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:08.190
Laura Lujan: Like, and I was like, that's a good by. Why would that allow us to do that. And then he's like, I wouldn't do that. Like what, wait.

209
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen if, and I don't know if this is true, because I'm just getting to know your

210
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your data. If it turns out that your boyfriend it Kyle is his name. Yeah.

211
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:24.570
If

212
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If Kyle's hypothesis is true. And I'm kind of thinking the same thing. Kyle is I'm going to be honest with you.

213
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if the hypothesis is true that she's looking for ways to and she may not be willing to do it like she dabbles in it, just a little like

214
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: She's testing it out. Well, you got to be home by this time she's watching and she's saying, well,

215
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder how dad will respond so she dabbles in it a little bit just to see how much leverage. She has she did it around the curfew.

216
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not accurate. There's not as much leverage as she thought, you actually have a lot of rapport with your PO, which is on here, right, which removes leverage for Teresa.

217
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You also don't have to be there 24 seven. You just sleep over there.

218
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You live there. You eat there you hold your clothes there. You spend a big chunk of time there but you live there doesn't. I mean, I don't know what's in writing on what you have to do. I don't know if you actually have a curfew.

219
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.140
Laura Lujan: I don't know.

220
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

221
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.370
Laura Lujan: So, I mean, I'm not going to be disrespectful. I guess I'm not gonna be different for

222
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.180
Laura Lujan: My dad, but anyway.

223
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.580
Laura Lujan: So,

224
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just stay there, it would probably be nice for her to control you. If you had a curfew. Boy, that would be convenient. Why then, she could leverage that. And she could get you to do what she wants you to, but there isn't one.

225
00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't, you can't rub that in our face can't do that because that is going to piss her off.

226
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So if you want to play the game you want to play because we're playing we're playing one anyway. The fact that you're living in this House to begin with is already a game. It's already started. I will live with you, unhealthy, man.

227
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the exchange, you're going to pay for some things

228
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you're, you're going to see it in your life constantly kind of what you did.

229
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the game.

230
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to play it by your rules.

231
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Then don't let don't let this Teresa make the rules up you make them up. You get to set how this goes. Okay.

232
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you all, if he if the hypothesis what Kyle is saying is true and don't mess with her and you're nice. Then you use the skill of sticky sweet you use that one that I saw in the car, what you're capable of because

233
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Your best fans. We talked to each other. We're still open. I saw it.

234
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.790
Laura Lujan: Don't move. Lovely. Yeah.

235
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura. You're not a liar. You're not a liar. You're surviving

236
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.050
Laura Lujan: Trying to

237
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that's not the same thing I want you out of there as soon as possible. So I hope you stay open to other opportunities if it turns out this PO turns out to be an ally and if months from now, or maybe sooner we can shift the residents. I would love him.

238
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think it's you doing doing any good to be staying there but this

239
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.360
Laura Lujan: Guy. We can't just the residence. I actually asked him about that.

240
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:50.370
Laura Lujan: He said that after my after my musical that I could submit another form of like residency and I get it moved back to my, to my house. So that's a good thing because like I said, I don't want to be there. Like, it's just, you know,

241
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I did. So what I didn't hear is, you said something, something, something, something I can apply for a change in residence. What was the something

242
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.540
Laura Lujan: After, after my op is complete.

243
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:12.270
Laura Lujan: So I have to complete I op in order to then I can go back and with my appeal and be like, hey, I want to do my residence, but I have to submit it. It has to be filed for my there's a whole

244
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So how long is is the IoT

245
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:21.900
Laura Lujan: Um, it's a 12 week program. But the problem is, I GOT PULLED OUT OF IT, BECAUSE THE FEDS don't like the Google zoom

246
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:35.910
Laura Lujan: Crap. They don't like it. They're like, No, we paid for evolution group we pay for her to go to evolution group. So we're not going to fund it. So right now I'm in this thinking for Change Program. It was called instead of IP, which is kind of stuff, but at least

247
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: For it.

248
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:44.220
Laura Lujan: Yeah yeah it's it's talking for change. You know, I stopped and thought

249
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, there could be

250
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.340
Laura Lujan: That could be hamamoto like you know I'm a foreigner.

251
00:24:51.720 --> 00:25:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so 12 weeks, can you can you can you play this game. If you knew that you are the one that we're setting the rules on how this that you're not a victim of it, you're setting the rules.

252
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you do it for 12 weeks.

253
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

254
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:22.080
Laura Lujan: I can, I can keep my goal in that, you know, not say that it helps me look one room like, you know, instead of being instead of being the enemy and causing you know her backlash, like you said, Yeah.

255
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.980
Laura Lujan: So I can see that happening. If I start like you know what i mean i

256
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.860
Laura Lujan: Told you that right now.

257
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you to pretend that I'm Theresa. Let's do a little role play and or to really tease out, find out if she her real bedtime.

258
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If it really is about you coming in the room and getting into bed and going to sleep. This disruptive. How would you really find out what the actual time is where she's starting to feel disrespected, how would you, how would you talk to me to try and

259
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:59.070
Laura Lujan: I that's why I live every does always cut them why I did the whole I played that game.

260
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:08.910
Laura Lujan: Right within a room for like a week. The last week I spent every night with her in her bedroom and I ended my Google my

261
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.730
Laura Lujan: My probation officer, call me.

262
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:22.740

Laura Lujan: I did that, I was like, oh my god, I'm so glad that treated home with me. However, although you know what I mean. I did on my results right there.

264
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it.

265
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.540
Laura Lujan: And so that's what

266
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, be just take a second try and figure out why does she care.

267

Gwenevere Abriel: So right, all I've heard, and I don't know yet because you're going to

285
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Fill in the blank. Some people in and of themselves just really like to control this just feels good.

286
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that show up anywhere else where just

287
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.040
Laura Lujan: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

288
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Where else does it show up.

289
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.640
Laura Lujan: My dad a lot

290
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.470
Laura Lujan: And like, and like I said like she'd always like, I'm

291
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:05.430
Laura Lujan: Like whatever I would tell her that I was going to college or whatever I if I don't tell her like

292
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.800
Laura Lujan: Directly that I'm not coming back and I just because my thing is I feel like after report to me.

293
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:21.510
Laura Lujan: Okay, so if I'm going to be gone. I told my dad. Hey, I'm going to how they can get whatever and sometimes I tell her if she's not busy, but if she's on the phone. I'm not going to bother telling you

294
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: An idea. I just

295
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean it's the right idea. But if you let go of the fact that maybe you don't like that she's controlling. Watch this.

296
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said, you know what I'm going to play it. I'm going to get ahead of this and I'm going to do a group chat.

297
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do a group text and every single time. My dad and Theresa will be on the same text and I'm going to say, hey, I'll be home at 8pm I'll let you guys know if I'll be a little late. Is that OK with you guys. Any concerns because now there's no splitting. There's no way to pull

298
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't pull you two apart.

299
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You just communicated the same thing at the same time.

300
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

301
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.440
Laura Lujan: Like that.

302
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.540
Laura Lujan: I didn't think my bed.

303
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good, because

304
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's your pride watch if you're playing the power and control game, then you'll be like this angel. Now, bitch. Nothing. Okay, so if it's that which that's her game she set that one up. But if you're ahead of it, you go

305
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. I got this. You know what, I'm just gonna a message you both the same time guys are both my heroes. You're all powerful, you're so important if you play that like you did by

306
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I need her you already know what to do to get through these 12 weeks now, when

307
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I sure hope you don't give up on your treatment because we're going to have to undo all that phony time

308
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.720
Laura Lujan: Are well yeah well we did. Yeah, we are.

309
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna have to unravel all of that.

310
00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.740
Laura Lujan: But there's some I don't know I don't know I just I just know that he is a problem.

311
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.210
Laura Lujan: Okay, I know and don't let your ego, get in the way.

312
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't let your ego, get in the way.

313
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:09.450
Laura Lujan: I see what you're saying.

314
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.350
Yeah.

315
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see what she is. If it's

316
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.150
Laura Lujan: Just really helps you to the call the cops. That's my only worry. I know.

317
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.580
Laura Lujan: I'm so Kyle, Kyle. Yeah.

318
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.170
Laura Lujan: Because she could look my Dad could be drunk. One night, and if she could

319
00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.150
Laura Lujan: If she calls the cops on your dad. You're going to go to, like, that's all it takes.

320
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.950
Laura Lujan: To mind I got released to the custody of my dad. My dad gets booked.

321
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he abusing her

322
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:48.630
Laura Lujan: No, but that was kind of like I was appointed she thought she told me when that she's like wasn't for you. Like I would have wanted to call the cops on me and I'm like dude, I would argue, but but because of

323
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think she's

324
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about the legit. I think

325
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.340
Laura Lujan: You're trying to say, because I think she's trying to say like I like turn, I guess.

326
00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.520
Laura Lujan: I don't know. Actually, that was

327
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because maybe it was assumption. So it's more like maybe that's the heart. It's like

328
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he hurting you. Does it do kind of feel safer when I'm here. Like when we're hanging out and you can find out what she's actually talking about

329
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.810
Laura Lujan: Because I know like I know her, but like, here's the thing. I know that like

330
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.620
Laura Lujan: She doesn't take

331
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.230
Laura Lujan: What

332
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:30.600
Laura Lujan: I know that whenever he does it. It's not like abusive like I'm going to go pound on you. It's like

333
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:37.380
Laura Lujan: Hey, I'm trying to be friendly with you and I'm going to be a little bit too friendly because we're, you know, asking gauge or because

334
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.860
Laura Lujan: She has like a call center text like I love you. This that every night and she used to respond to every night.

335
00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:51.240
Laura Lujan: And like that conflict with someone's head or whatever they're doing but I'm sorry can't. And that's me. Depending out again because that's

336
00:32:51.720 --> 00:33:07.080
Laura Lujan: Like she's been a mom like she is here. He is a party like I like yeah like he comes to her and makes you feel comfortable or whatever. But she's letting hit like she's inviting you know, to me, a kid and it's popped up the

337
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole thing.

338
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole thing is fun.

339
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have to go crazy. That's the thing that's where the hands on the hips. This the defiance of

340
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm stopped up that's fucked up doll.

341
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.150
Laura Lujan: Don't oversell almost yeah

342
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have to go crazy for it.

343
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:34.620
Laura Lujan: I'm not. And that's why, that's why. Like I have. I'm glad that I'm Kyle look if it wasn't for kind of be like a, like, like you're right, like just come up, like you're, you're good. Bring

344
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:40.320
Laura Lujan: You know what I mean, like he makes me like those, like, you know, it's just, it's more or less like a safe thing to

345
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:51.720
Laura Lujan: Yeah, it was over there. I just, I see like the pills and and then you got Teresa and we like selling stuff or friends. Now at this point, which is and she's like saying it.

346
00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:59.550
Laura Lujan: Will be no social. Tell me about it and stuff in it. I don't want to know that I'm sorry, I don't care. Like, consider

347
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:14.430
Laura Lujan: If you're selling you know sponsorship for whole grain that's illegal or whatever. Go ahead. My guess whatever ruin your life. I don't care if it's not my bike, but I don't like I've like she tells me to like get approval for me, like, because I feel like you said, you know,

348
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.110
Laura Lujan: And I think it's one

349
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to look cool.

350
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.600
Laura Lujan: Kind of, yeah. A little, like, you know what I mean.

351
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:36.660
Laura Lujan: Like, I think that's what it is. She's trying to be like she's trying to like fit in with me. And to me, that's kind of it kind of disrespect me because I'm like, Well, that wasn't cool what I did like that would mean that any I don't want anything cool

352
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

353
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If I was looking at this, this environment that you're in with your dad with Teresa and with you.

354
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:49.530
Know,

355
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I would

356
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Want all three getting help, but

357
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't call it a functional environment. So, but

358
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what happens. Just now you just put normal expectation on Teresa and I wouldn't do that. I would be one.

359
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be like this. I'd be like,

360
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And now crusey is going to look like this in this room, and now it's going to look like this in this room, and then someone's going to manipulate someone else over there someone else is going to do this.

361
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.600
And I wonder alone.

362
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I wonder how long this is going to last. I wonder how you won't go crazy. And if you say two years. Well, this is how you do it. Don't expect people to treat each other in a healthy way. You just sort of finally let go the X Men, let it go.

363
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Look for it in another place.

364
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Look for an

365
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Employee of yours outside look for it elsewhere because I don't think it's going to happen anytime

366
00:35:54.450 --> 00:36:08.820
Laura Lujan: I do, I do too. I like you know my kind of my role like you really like our own level like that's what the one like gets and I think know my dad does get that. That's why he listens to that. I don't mind but you know i mean that's why my dad does get that he knows

367
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:18.180
Laura Lujan: My that knows that he the problem to me and to be honest with you, I know it hurts my dad like that. I do I care not really know but like

368
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.270
Laura Lujan: Like I know it hurts my dad would that he drinks like he doesn't like to him, but he didn't leave it all gone.

369
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.840
Laura Lujan: But I just have no respect for him in that period, but I do

370
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's reflect on a little

371
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking

372
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.050
Laura Lujan: A lot of sharing for being over the place.

373
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine. So, but, but take a look at it just sort of rewind the whole session just sort of take a moment, kind of, do some breathing get centered just sort of watch it go go through, you know, I said, okay, you're welcome to share. I'm going to open up a note, I know this is what Teresa's up to

374
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was this Ness just sort of play it out this little movie strip for yourself in your mind.

375
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And in tune into what you notice about yourself maybe a thought an experience of some kind that felt a little new

376
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It felt a little different for you. See if you can find something that seemed a little different in here today for you, not because I want to hear it. You could even just think it not tell me, what did you notice it was just a little bit different about you today.

377
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.390
Laura Lujan: How I kind of don't like as I like.

378
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.900
Laura Lujan: See my dad is a problem for

379
00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.760
Laura Lujan: Me. Okay.

380
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

381
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So when
