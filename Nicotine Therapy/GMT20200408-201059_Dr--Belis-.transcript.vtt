19
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: How did you first get started on this opioid situation and and all that.

20
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Please young or

21
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: What was going

22
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.010
NUU A7L: Up and it actually started from a surgery.

23
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
NUU A7L: And got years back and but

24
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: When was it. Do you remember how old you were

25
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.760
NUU A7L: Guy. It was a, I want to say 2005 2006 because

26
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:40.110
NUU A7L: I've always been a allergic to Tylenol coding, coding three are just basic coding. So I've never, I've never liked you know any kind of pills.

27
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.430
NUU A7L: And the doctor told me he goes, No, this is different to hold your at the hydro code. Code own it's you're not allergic to it and

28
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.760
NUU A7L: And that's taking it for pain. You know, I was going through a lot of pain, but then you get hooked onto them and you don't

29
00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:03.000
NUU A7L: You don't do a the doctor just doesn't give you a right assessment, you know, to kind of wean you off because either they give it to you or they just cut you right off, you know, and so

30
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:18.330
NUU A7L: You, you got to go find it somewhere else. You know, you're still in either a lot of pain or you just, you can't seem to get back to normal. You know, back to normal as being high. So I went through that, for God pie six years or so.

31
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, bye.

32
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.600
NUU A7L: And then my quit.

33
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thousand 12 you quit.

34
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.010
NUU A7L: Yeah. Yeah, right. Actually right before I got my right before I got married in 2013 and moved to Texas. I got married.

35
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:51.120
NUU A7L: moved to Texas doing really well started a business tree and landscape in my ex wife had a she had a restaurant, and we had a tragic electrical fire just out of nowhere more houses caught on fire and and and burnt down

36
00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:03.240
NUU A7L: And it really affected me her and three kids to as well. All of us. And so I found myself, you know, we're working through emotions and trying to get through it and

37
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:22.440
NUU A7L: Then we divorced, five months later, unfortunately, and so then there was another downhill loop for me. And so I I moved back here to California. When I moved back to California is when I relapsed and in that it's about a year that was December of 2018 so

38
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Move back

39
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.140
NUU A7L: Yeah.

40
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god, what a story and how many children do you guys have

41
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:41.670
NUU A7L: Biologically, we, we don't have any when they're all her children. There were stepchildren mind. But yeah, so there was three of them, but yeah.

42
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.800
NUU A7L: We were together from

43
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:53.370
NUU A7L: We're together since 2011 and we divorced in November of 2018 so I can't really do the math right now but

44
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that's a long time, seven years.

45
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.010
NUU A7L: Yeah, almost a decade, almost a decade. Yeah. So, but

46
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: But she's back there in Texas, you're here in California. Yeah.

47
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:17.370
NUU A7L: Yeah, she has her family in Texas and my family's here in California. And so I decided to move back and try to get some family support.

48
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.830
NUU A7L: But not getting that

49
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:32.310
NUU A7L: So that kind of, you know, threw me on a world when as well to now I'm dealing with family neglecting and not not doing what they say they're going to do and

50
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.910
NUU A7L: And then my ex wife, and then just not even over the house fire. Yeah, I mean, literally, I was a year later I found myself still in shock like

51
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:50.820
NUU A7L: I can't. I cannot believe this is um some homeless. You know, like, Wow, all my stuff that worked so hard for you know if

52
00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:08.670
NUU A7L: We had a beautiful ranch houses four bedroom ranch house there in Texas at five acres and cows and chickens. You know, we had the whole farm and ranch and you know the whole family country live in and you know we got that along like peas in a pod, you know, and that fire just

53
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.150
NUU A7L: Man it that triggered something

54
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, that's so tragic. I'm so sorry. Wow, Richard.

55
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a lot.

56
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

57
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the

58
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:32.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thing is, I think it would be important for you. Moving forward to connect with one of our therapists, so you're assigned to therapists.

59
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.560
NUU A7L: Yeah yeah yeah yeah

60
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I think you should meet with her individually.

61
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:53.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: And just try to work through some of this stuff that you know is still still there in the background because that's, that's pretty tragic and that's that's a huge back to back loss after loss. Right. One thing trigger and another thing and

62
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you coming out here and then the disappointments with that and stuff like that, you know,

63
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:14.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because that's that's. Those are big burdens to be carrying around and and that's what we're here for. So I think it'll help you long term if you do that. So yeah, I encourage you to connect with your therapist. So, for sure.

64
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then

65
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, thanks for sharing all that would be so then when you move back here, December.

66
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:30.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: You said did you pretty much resume your oxycodone or hydrocodone habit.

67
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.380
No.

68
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.190
NUU A7L: I, I get a prescription of of

69
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:44.400
NUU A7L: Biking in right now because I've got a fractured collarbone. I'm actually supposed to go into surgery here soon. I talked with my surgeon on Friday. So I get ups but

70
00:07:45.870 --> 00:08:00.930
NUU A7L: Pills, really, they don't they don't treat me anymore. I can, I can have my pocket for three or four days and not take one of them, you know, but then, but the heroin is what I'm you know I got on to the, you know,

71
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.100
And

72
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.690
NUU A7L: And that's

73
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:13.470
NUU A7L: Yeah, that's, that's the, that's a tough one to quit you know at that and and while it started with methamphetamines and then it moved from methods better means to

74
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.070
NUU A7L: Heroin and then now doing both, you know,

75
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.350
NUU A7L: Yeah, but it's like, All right, this is, this has got to this has got it in here soon.

76
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

77
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.110
NUU A7L: So,

78
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: The math and the heroin, are you injecting them.

79
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:49.440
NUU A7L: I was, I was. And actually, I stopped almost four weeks now i don't i don't count the the day you know the desktop. But I want to say almost four weeks now, but I did, I did start for a little bit. I never thought I would I would you know. And then, of course, but no not not anymore.

80
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.670
NUU A7L: As what that mean

81
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.470
NUU A7L: That is net. And now I can't say never. Again, you never say never. I've learned that one in life.

82
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.560
NUU A7L: Yeah. For now, no. Yeah.

83
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:04.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you stopped injecting about four weeks ago, but are you smoking it snorting it. What are you doing,

84
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.090
NUU A7L: Smoking it

85
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.740
NUU A7L: Okay, yeah.

86
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: So okay, so you're smoking.

87
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: heroin and meth.

88
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.150
NUU A7L: And snorting intense Norton math.

89
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: And snorting okay so you Smoke the heroin and you snort the meth. Got it.

90
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:29.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. Okay, obviously. Yes, injecting is the most dangerous.

91
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Infection wise and all that. So yeah. If you can not do that ever. That would be amazing.

92
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:44.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: But even better than any of that is like getting you out of this rut. In the first place, and just stopping the madness right starting

93
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:51.870
NUU A7L: That yeah I have to ask to start somewhere, you know, and I figured that would be the most

94
00:09:53.070 --> 00:10:09.420
NUU A7L: You know, that'd be the best area to start at, you know, to be happy, you know, and hopefully because like I was even finding myself getting anxious for the meeting like because I haven't used and like two days, you know, I'm like, all right, we heard

95
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's been two days.

96
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.540
NUU A7L: Almost two days. Yeah, it was, it was the day before yesterday.

97
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.970
NUU A7L: I can't remember if it was in the morning or the afternoon, but either way it was. Yeah.

98
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, you, you're in withdrawal. Now you think

99
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.610
NUU A7L: I'm slow, you know,

100
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:48.090
NUU A7L: Slightly, that's the thing is is I don't know if it's maybe I just don't use I don't use as much as everybody else because I really don't use much. I mean, it doesn't take much for me to use I have kind of a high energy personality as it is. Anyways, but

101
00:10:50.280 --> 00:11:05.160
NUU A7L: But after three days, three or four, then I just like whoa okay this is I can feel lethargic and and you know the diarrhea, and then you're just feeling like you know like it's humid and and

102
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:12.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: It would probably hit you. But those symptoms would hit you probably in another day. You think you said three or four days.

103
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.370
NUU A7L: Okay that like

104
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.770
NUU A7L: Like waking up tomorrow morning. I would feel like like a wet dog. Yeah, I'd feel bad.

105
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:26.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so. So for you, it's more probably in a start tomorrow. Okay, gotcha. Um,

106
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:36.780
NUU A7L: If not, not tonight Bianchi i've been i've been actually medicating with marijuana for like the last three hours and so that that helps to, you know, I mean it.

107
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:49.350
NUU A7L: It's my take my mind off of it and then relaxes me as well and then went to my mind is off of it and I'm relaxed. I'm not so anxious and once I'm anxious and it's triggered than, you know, it's time to go, you know,

108
00:11:50.550 --> 00:12:03.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, okay, and then getting back to the Viking. Um, so it's going to be important for you. I mean, you have a fractured color brown bone and you're saying, you're going to have surgery. When is the surgery.

109
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:15.960
NUU A7L: I'm not. I'm not. I don't have a surgery date yet I still I have Friday is my day that I go and talk with my surgeon for the first time I've been through my primary doctor but

110
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:26.100
NUU A7L: I've been running through a stupid loop with the orthopedic that supposed to do the surgery and then the doctor that was at the ER that I seen

111
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:34.500
NUU A7L: They have my insurance has it that the doctor if the ER was going to perform the surgery on me, but he's just a physician and so I had to go through all this.

112
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:42.780
NUU A7L: And so actually been now six or seven weeks since I enjoyed it. And so I need to hurry up. But so Friday I finally got

113
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:59.460
NUU A7L: The surgeon to pick up my file. I'm going to get with them. I take them my my X rays, and he looks over him and he's going to go from whether we do surgery. Next week, or we do surgery in two days or, you know, but either way it's it's going to be surgery. So this is the

114
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Which side is

115
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.300
NUU A7L: My left side. This is the third time that I've

116
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.400
NUU A7L: Fractured it and I shattered at once and fractured it to other times.

117
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:18.240
NUU A7L: Yeah. And this is pretty bad. I mean it's, yeah, it's all that off. It's really off and it's very painful, very painful to

118
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:30.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so here's the deal with the surgery and the Viking and and stuff. So moving forward, what I want to do for you is induce you start you on buprenorphine.

119
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:38.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay we for northeast, have you have you been on it before, right, because I see that you've got a prescription right in March, end of March.

120
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.170
NUU A7L: It's a, it's a generic for Suboxone or something like that.

121
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, what

122
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.200
NUU A7L: Yeah yeah yeah

123
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:54.180
NUU A7L: What about okay that a wall. What do you think about. I'm just here. We think about methadone. I've taken methadone. In the past, before

124
00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:02.730
NUU A7L: But it was to take it pretty much, you know, to get high. I mean, be honest with you, bye bye methadone. Yeah, I have it.

125
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.530
NUU A7L: You know,

126
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.660
NUU A7L: So that's when I was taken.

127
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:07.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, okay.

128
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:08.640
NUU A7L: Um,

129
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, so so

130
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: The option you have options.

131
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:23.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: The two like best options would be methadone maintenance or buprenorphine or Suboxone otherwise known as Suboxone maintenance either one.

132
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:39.120
NUU A7L: Right. Yeah. Well, yeah. Because the reason I was asking to is because the Suboxone made me more nauseous, but I haven't taken methadone in and over six years. So you know i don't i don't know what it's going to do to me.

133
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

134
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: So here's the deal.

135
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:52.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: To let you know methadone is not something I can prescribe. It's not something a doctor can prescribe for you for opioid use disorder.

136
00:14:52.500 --> 00:15:02.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Methadone for opioid use disorder, you need to go to a clinic methadone clinic and you go every morning you check in at like five or six and that's how it works.

137
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:10.770
NUU A7L: Well, then maybe on on the prescription because it said to a day, taking two of those boxes today now.

138
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.600
NUU A7L: To be honest with you, that was a little much. I mean, it did the trick for the seven actually for like

139
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:29.400
NUU A7L: 14 days is what it was because I only take one and even one was, I mean not overly power, but I remember, I'd take you and God dang that I was, I might as well. When done term heroin, but then

140
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: It was too much for you as adults. So yeah, having the right dose is important.

141
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: And and

142
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:37.920
NUU A7L: So,

143
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:45.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: And the nausea piece may have come because it was too high of a dose, you know, um,

144
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.410
NUU A7L: Well, I think.

145
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.630
NUU A7L: The two honestly

146
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sorry, it was because it was too. Yeah.

147
00:15:52.680 --> 00:16:09.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: So in terms of maintenance. Yes. So buprenorphine would be the treatment of choice. Then the other option, like I said, is to go to a local, you have to find a methadone clinic near you and register and you just go every day for dosing. That's how that works. This

148
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: This gives you more freedom. Yeah.

149
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:20.070
NUU A7L: You know, now if there was like some kind of like counting classes or something like that. Like, while you went to the clinic that was beneficial.

150
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:28.830
NUU A7L: Then I might think about it. But if it's just to go stand in line to get you know your fixed for the day. I might as well just go two blocks down the street and go, you know what I mean.

151
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:40.080
NUU A7L: And so i mean i just i i'm so honest that it's it's disgusting sometimes but I figured what the doctor, especially you know you've wanted me to be absolutely just

152
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Blowing up. Yeah, no, we want you to be honest.

153
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I want something that is going to work for you. So

154
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:55.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: We could do this, we can try adjusting the dose. So it's not causing you that nausea and it's

155
00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:05.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's sufficient to hold your cravings for heroin and other opioid it just should, you should feel normal. You shouldn't be feeling. Hi, you shouldn't be feeling altered.

156
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:14.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: You should feel pretty normal in terms of pain. Now that you have. You're talking about the collarbone. It should also have

157
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Some pain. So it's not

158
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:23.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: We're not giving into for pain management. Right, exactly. But it's, it should have a side.

159
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Effect of helping with pain because it's a partial opioid

160
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:47.970
NUU A7L: Thing I get 20 lichens and I've only gotten two strips and last seven weeks so and honestly I didn't even I probably maybe took 15 of those in the last seven weeks so yeah a little, a little pain management would be awesome as well. Definitely.

161
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so what

162
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: So what I will need you to do is

163
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:54.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Money.

164
00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:15.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: You need to. I mean, it's complicated because of your pain situation, but basically you need to stick to buprenorphine and that's it. No, I couldn't. No other stuff. You can't be filling more, um, we, we just don't want to be mixing things around because they're all opioids. Right.

165
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so

166
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:29.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can use the buprenorphine and adjust the dose. If you're paying is getting worse. We can up it by. In fact, there's two milligrams instead of eight minute what you are given was eight milligrams tabs.

167
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:39.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: I can give you a milligram tabs and see if we can spread it out throughout the day in little doses to see if it'll cover pain and also not causing as much nausea.

168
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: I will take

169
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:47.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe two in the morning to at noon to before bed and see if that kind of covers you all day.

170
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.980
NUU A7L: And then, and then maybe some nausea pills. Just, just in case you know

171
00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:01.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I can do that. I can give you some nausea pills, just in case. And then we can do these baby baby doses three times a day.

172
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.310
Yeah.

173
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.030
NUU A7L: Yeah, that sounds that actually sounds really smart.

174
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, let's

175
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: We try that and you stay away from the Viking you don't do heroin. You don't do math.

176
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:26.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: In terms of your Friday appointment with the surgeon. You can tell him on Friday. Hey, you know, once you guys decide what's going on. You can tell them, Hey, I just got established on buprenorphine.

177
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: For my opioid problem.

178
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:39.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: I just want to be transparent about it. You know, I don't want to. I'm not interested in getting on Vika. Then again, or things like that. I'm going to use the morphine for pain control.

179
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:50.160
NUU A7L: Yeah, like right after the surgery for sure. You know, like it in for the pain of right after the surgery but then pain management. No, absolutely not. It'd be too much.

180
00:19:50.310 --> 00:20:10.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. And so, so the way we handle that usually is that you continue your buprenorphine before the surgery you continue it. And then after surgery. If you need on top of the buprenorphine. If you need more pain control, you can try taking the Viking and on top, it may work.

181
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:17.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: But it may not. And what we usually do is increase your buprenorphine dose.

182
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.370
NUU A7L: The blocker. I forgot.

183
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.040
NUU A7L: It's not a blocker, per se. It's just stronger on the receptor.

184
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's harder.

185
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: For it to come off and give it room for the Viking in

186
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:40.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so it's not a full block, but it's it's kind of like it stays on there. It's more stubborn so

187
00:20:40.830 --> 00:21:00.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: So so pain control after surgery. That's why the surgeon needs to know. Oh, you're on buprenorphine okay and needing to tell me since I'm prescribing you the buprenorphine. I need to give you extra buprenorphine perhaps after the surgery so that you can cover your breakthrough pain. Okay.

188
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.990
NUU A7L: All right, yeah. That sounds, that sounds like a good idea. I'm sure the surgeon would like that as well, too. So

189
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:17.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that you're like hey look, I'm just being transparent right now. I'm taking two milligrams breakfast, lunch, dinner after surgery. I might bump it up with my other provider.

190
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: She said that I could add

191
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:40.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just temporarily I could try to add like a Percocet, or or Vika and after surgery to see if it's really bad if I need to, but better on sleep better for you just to keep things clean and clear is for us to use buprenorphine as your pain management after surgery. Much better because

192
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it just gets kind of confusing.

193
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.200
NUU A7L: Yeah, yeah. Well, no, I totally agree with you i think i think that's

194
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.130
NUU A7L: Okay, really good.

195
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you get it, you kind of understand the, the science of it now.

196
00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:06.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so once we get on buprenorphine we stay on buprenorphine. You don't take any extra lichen or anything. If you have pain breakthrough pain and you're like, I need something on top of this.

197
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:18.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Then we, you and I talk and we increase the Butte, we add another two milligrams, or something like that to help you. Okay. All right. Okay, good. You think you can do that.

198
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:33.720
NUU A7L: Oh, yeah. Yeah, most definitely. Now, what, what kind of connection. Do we have no I have to make appointments. Every time that I want to not. I mean, I felt like I'll be blowing you up or but like when you're wanting me to get older you or I'm needing, you know, I mean, how is it

199
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

200
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:51.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: So will you and I will meet in a group setting for refills. And just like, Hey, how are you doing, and also in the group, you'll have a therapist that runs the rest of the group to talk about recovery themes. You know, like, okay, how to stay sober, whatever.

201
00:22:52.470 --> 00:23:02.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that group with me to refill your meds and just do a quick touching base is going to happen weekly um can you do 4pm on Fridays.

202
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.310
NUU A7L: Whatever is easiest for you, girl.

203
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:06.330
NUU A7L: Yeah.

204
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.110
NUU A7L: I don't got a job right now. And so, yeah.

205
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.700
NUU A7L: So we would like nine is your surgeon appointment on Friday.

206
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.910
NUU A7L: Friday at 910 in the morning am

207
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:25.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay so great. So actually, if you, if you don't mind. Come meet me at 4pm that day.

208
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you can tell me how the surgery appointment went

209
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.030
NUU A7L: Okay. All right.

210
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:40.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, like what you guys decide, you know, did you decide on a date with what did he say did you tell them about hey I'm on buprenorphine. Just so you know, and I'm going to work with the provider about my pain control.

211
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.190
NUU A7L: And then you see what did he say what he says about that.

212
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: He says, just, you know, just letting him know like, Hey, I'm Mike, she says.

213
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.920
NUU A7L: You can tell her what I have a lot. I'm going to go with you. I mean, I'm going to go with you because we've already agreed with that and

214
00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:07.380
NUU A7L: And it. That's what I want to do I sound that way better idea like you're saying mixing medications. I mean, that's what I got to get off medication. I'm just gonna be as worse off, you know,

215
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:22.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and and over the years we've studied we've started seeing a lot of patterns with people that are on Suboxone so I've treated. A lot of people over the years with Suboxone long term, right. They've been on it for years. Sometimes for months, sometimes for years.

216
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And they need surgery. Sometimes

217
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:37.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: And we've done different things like sometimes we say, okay, let's stop the Suboxone maybe four or five days before surgery so that your receptors are open for the Viking in or whatever you need, and

218
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:44.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Get back on after you're done, maybe two weeks after surgery after you're done with your pain control, then we get you back on. But that's always been a hassle.

219
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:58.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Always been problematic much better results when people stay on the view. And then after surgery, increase the dose if they need to, for a little bit until their pain goes back

220
00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.380
Down.

221
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:00.300
NUU A7L: Yeah.

222
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.070
NUU A7L: In your work.

223
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: This is better.

224
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:20.070
NUU A7L: You know, we're talking like a week of severe, severe pain and a person should not be in severe, severe pain more than seven days, you know it if he is then or that person is in his doctor screwed up something though he's not doing something right. You know, but

225
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.320
NUU A7L: Yeah, definitely.

226
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:29.280
NUU A7L: Alright, sounds good. Now, man. I've always wanted. What about what about

227
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.730
NUU A7L: Gosh, depression, anxiety, yeah.

228
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:42.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, depression and anxiety for sure. So we, we want you to

229
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feel the best you can. And I think that sometimes when you're in a certain place in your life in a certain rut.

230
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:56.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, antidepressants can be super helpful. They also help with anxiety.

231
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:05.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: And we don't have to be on them forever. They could be a temporary thing until you get through a patch, but

232
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: If I were you.

233
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:16.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's up to you if you want to get started now. And you're like, You know what, I think I'm going to need all the help and just give it to me. We can get you started. Yeah.

234
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.250
NUU A7L: Whoa, it's really been on my mind like you know

235
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.910
NUU A7L: And that's why medical marijuana. Yeah, I mean, but

236
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, okay.

237
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:26.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

238
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, that's okay. So yeah, so why don't we do that. So have you ever been on any any

239
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: anything's any medication for depression or anything.

240
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.810
NUU A7L: I'm not not prescription wise but yeah I've taken it in the past, you know,

241
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.710
NUU A7L: Yeah, I mean, actually, I take, I take it before I got married when I was

242
00:26:50.220 --> 00:27:04.710
NUU A7L: I was very, very anxious of just getting ready to get married, and it wasn't sure if I should or shouldn't. My mom was telling me not to and whole family what I was going through, like, you know, total almost breakdown stage. And so it got me through it, you know, but

243
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.640
Hey,

244
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:07.410
NUU A7L: What's that

245
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: What were you taking

246
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:15.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Xanax Xanax, I see. Yes, Annex um so

NUU A7L: Really

270
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.010

NUU A7L: Just one. Yeah.

274
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think

275
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think we should do that.

276
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's an SSRI which means it helps increase your serotonin levels over time.

277
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so those are. That's what what helps depression. Okay.

278
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: And the good news.

279
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: It also helps anxiety. So

280
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: It can help both things.

281
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.060

287
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.240

288
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:39.930

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do um

291
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:54.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's, it's called fluoxetine and people usually tolerate it. Well, it's usually fine you can take it in the morning with your food with

NUU A7L: And

294
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:04.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just let's go from there. There's a rare side effect called serotonin syndrome where people get really
