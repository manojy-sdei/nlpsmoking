12
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:41.610
Kelley Briscar: She because she claimed to me as a dependent that cancels me out that money to check the desperate. We use right now and I

Magalie Marcellus: The check things. How did you find out

22
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.560

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.280
Kelley Briscar: Mean, nobody but myself set

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.140
Kelley Briscar: Right.

26
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.660
Kelley Briscar: Never safety. She's claiming that she where she told me about this, I would have remembered something like this, I would not

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.690
Kelley Briscar: Get you know I mean I would have been like okay well what am I going to get out.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.390
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, so I definitely would have heard that that

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.580
Kelley Briscar: Conversation with my mother about money.

31
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.520
Kelley Briscar: If you don't forget in house. It's not easy to do it. Oh.

32
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:30.270
Kelley Briscar: And I tried to approach the subject, probably you have a cheat completely overreacted she was two minutes. Sounds, you know, like I would be on for a whole and demanding, you know, stuff on her. And of course, my father is

33
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:38.010
Kelley Briscar: In the, you know, paying attention to what's going on. So do you think I'm talking my mother, like, you know, or you know what I'm saying.

34
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:45.780
Kelley Briscar: So then I saw him screaming happening in background, you know, when I'm not even doing anything. I couldn't you know

35
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:53.760
Kelley Briscar: I don't know what was up with my mother these last couple days. But, I mean, I haven't developed to get full sentences out and she

36
00:08:54.150 --> 00:09:10.890
Kelley Briscar: You know overreacting and and making it look like give me know I'm just been horrible to her or something and it wasn't the case at all. I tried very hard. I've been trying very hard for a while now to be a good daughter to her, you know,

37
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:18.750
Kelley Briscar: And and then I get credit for it. You know, I'm not in the wrong. I didn't do it.

38
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.600
Magalie Marcellus: No, no, sort of a non

39
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.440
Magalie Marcellus: That should have. You should have had a conversation

40
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.420
Magalie Marcellus: From the

41
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.550
Magalie Marcellus: From the point that she was allowing you know if she was using your information.

42
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:49.260
Kelley Briscar: Like we'll touch on. Now if you know they said, Of course they ended up saying that they would give to the 1200 hours and they're going to get it anyways that you know for for claiming among I know what else you know

43
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.000
Kelley Briscar: And

Kelley Briscar: And relations with it. Oh, well, we're right now, we're only going to give you 500 and then when we get on with it up the rest. Well, desktop that really helped me to put the plans I have for it.

45
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:10.710
Kelley Briscar: I needed a majority of it says, I was going to fail for two weeks on the road so I didn't have to worry about it for a little

46
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.070
While

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.840
Kelley Briscar: Right away.

Kelley Briscar: I can't do that with with five you know 500

49
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.170
Magalie Marcellus: So what's the reason behind it, why she can give you whatever that

50
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.010
Magalie Marcellus: spoke to you.

51
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.010
Magalie Marcellus: She's still getting

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.720
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, I know.

54
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.450
Magalie Marcellus: You, your question.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:52.500
Kelley Briscar: Just like she doesn't understand that mines know You owe it all to be shouldn't be the way you want to do it.

57
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.510
Magalie Marcellus: Right. All right.

58
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.120

59
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.910
Magalie Marcellus: in one lump sum. So you just take whatever that was to you and give you the other question.

60
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.640
Kelley Briscar: But it's not complicated for them or they've got plenty recovery. They're not hurting

61
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.840
You know it.

62
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.040
Kelley Briscar: Is not even for them to go.

63
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.400
Kelley Briscar: Take that out it, give it to me. You know, I mean,

64
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.870
Magalie Marcellus: Especially when

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.730
Magalie Marcellus: You say, Carlos has a

66
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.380

Magalie Marcellus: Hours. So

69
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.670
Kelley Briscar: Yeah. Well, now they're back up to what they were before. Same

70
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.480
Kelley Briscar: Guy. Okay.

71
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.350
Magalie Marcellus: But that kind of

72
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.070
Kelley Briscar: You know, maybe a little difficulty last, you know,

73
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.750
Magalie Marcellus: Couple weeks you might to catch up or whatever else that you you were struggling with

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.450
Magalie Marcellus: That

76
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:58.020
Kelley Briscar: When I bring up to her, you know, situation at the moment we don't have much you know about it right now. And I thought, well, that's not that's not my problem. You know,

77
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.360
Kelley Briscar: Me.

78
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.470
Kelley Briscar: I didn't know

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.940
Kelley Briscar: My mouth. I mean,

80
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.780
Kelley Briscar: It hurts more than anything, really, you know, the way I spoke to get, you know, easily just regarded and treated

81
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:22.800
Kelley Briscar: You know, and but and there's my brothers who can you know as me some through how constantly and he's the ones babies baby and and you know she didn't know

Kelley Briscar: So, I mean, she ended up spending $500 with Carla home and and novel didn't even tell me

86
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:55.260
Kelley Briscar: When I did something like this is my fault or something. No, this is not my doing I would much rather than dealing with the government and dealing with her. Trust me, I

87
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.250
Mean

88
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.750
Kelley Briscar: Anything they've ever had to do with money to become completely, you know, different person.

89
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:05.220
Kelley Briscar: It's

90
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:14.460
Magalie Marcellus: It's unfortunate, because again, she knows your situation and how there was be helpful for you guys. So for her not to recognize

91
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:15.960
Kelley Briscar: You know how

92
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.250

Yeah.

94
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:29.310
Kelley Briscar: And now, it means I don't have to deal with her to get the rest of the damn money, you know,

95
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.150
Kelley Briscar: At this point, I'm just so hurt and aggregated that I really would rather just

Kelley Briscar: For a little while, you know, not like completely blow offering my dad and my mother tie

97

99
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.630
Kelley Briscar: Will now be having to southern much to worry about it. That's

100
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:15.270
Kelley Briscar: When it comes to be wrong, but I could be a possibility is not being perfect and being that

101
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.560
Magalie Marcellus: Just

102
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:24.180
Kelley Briscar: Like it she just gave it all to me at all. The one I wasn't, I wasn't able to do. I hadn't had to do it.

103
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:39.540
Kelley Briscar: Which, you know, would have been in IT OFF ME NOT HAVING TO WORRY, he, you know, but that was a neat, you know it for other things, you know, like the weather but

104
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:40.890
Kelley Briscar: Not

105
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.080
Kelley Briscar: The not only today.

106
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.190
Kelley Briscar: But like I gotta deal with her again.

107
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.150
Kelley Briscar: Instead of just being able to be like, you know,

108
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.350
Magalie Marcellus: Get some money and take a space have this be

109
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.580
Magalie Marcellus: Well, um,

110
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:02.040
Magalie Marcellus: No. Okay. So, but right now she's nine, you don't know any idea when she's gonna give you

111
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:09.720
Kelley Briscar: Know, Jesus said when they get what you know they're there, whatever that I run

Magalie Marcellus: OK.

116
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.560
Magalie Marcellus: So now that's

117
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.090
Magalie Marcellus: Why I'm confused because I don't know if she's getting a refund from her regular taxes.

118
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.980
Kelley Briscar: But

119
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.560
Magalie Marcellus: She isn't gaining back and you

Kelley Briscar: Because again, you know,

124
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:54.540
Kelley Briscar: Really if I did that happen, I would be completely oblivious.

125
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.120
Magalie Marcellus: And you wouldn't know. Yeah.

126
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:57.990

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.060
Kelley Briscar: That was the only way. No.

156
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:19.680

What techniques.

161
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.720
Kelley Briscar: I was thinking out

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.610
Kelley Briscar: To, you know,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.800
Kelley Briscar: Provide group of an older picture.

164
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.310
Kelley Briscar: And I think the most

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:56.250
Kelley Briscar: And then it dawned on me. You know, when we did you know hey Ash and then advice.

Kelley Briscar: That

168
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.260
Kelley Briscar: Is all

169
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.670
Okay that dad again.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.540
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, yeah.

171
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.990
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, if you want you can turn on the video for a little bit.

172
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.310
Magalie Marcellus: Because it's kind of coming

173
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.490
In

174
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.800
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, so

175
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:39.750
Magalie Marcellus: Right. So, so what you say this. Your stepfather was upset because of the way you are talking to your mom. Oh, wow.

176
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.280
Kelley Briscar: Yeah.

177
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.380
Kelley Briscar: He thought I was

178
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.440
Kelley Briscar: You know, being deterred.

179
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.550
Kelley Briscar: Me who are yelling at her or, you know, the

180
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.470
Kelley Briscar: Perfect situation.

181
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:58.170
Kelley Briscar: And the way she was acting. You know, I really honestly

182
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.440
Kelley Briscar: Wanted. I was not i'm not going for.

183
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.000
Kelley Briscar: The end of the conversation.

184
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.930
But that was

185
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.030
Kelley Briscar: Directed towards him, because I can hear him yelling in the background.

186
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:09.840
And

187
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.000
Magalie Marcellus: So he was getting involved in the conversation.

188
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:23.160
Kelley Briscar: Yeah yeah you know that all just enough binary and color is nothing that they're not willing when all this

189
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:38.280
Kelley Briscar: Like, I think I'm not even I wasn't able to get through a full sentence with a mother. But how the hell am I sitting here being ungrateful or whatever it is you're, you know, you're saying, I mean like

190
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:54.540
Kelley Briscar: Like, like I told her, in a way, the problem because she doing. She's like a drama for us. And, you know, seems like you to play the part like you know being mistreated or something and

191
00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.320
Kelley Briscar: That causes the issues then whereas you know with him. And it's like I wasn't doing that at all.

192
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.340
I did not

193
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.030
Kelley Briscar: Know it just like whatever they could think with a lot of things like that that is what it is.

194
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.850
Kelley Briscar: Not letting me

195
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.460
Kelley Briscar: Know I just

196
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:15.420
Want

197
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.390
Kelley Briscar: To add a deal with a

198
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:35.160
Magalie Marcellus: Wide. Well, you can still keep your distance we certainly can. But then, from time to time to check in and when she's at the remaining funds available and not just Carlos talk to her at all.

199
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.330
No.

200
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.430
Kelley Briscar: No know with my stepfather be surprised if

201
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.070
Kelley Briscar: You know,

202
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.820
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, yeah. Monday when we have it.

203
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.440
Kelley Briscar: So,

204
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.720
Kelley Briscar: They kind of have fun. Chef, you know,

205
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:59.850
Kelley Briscar: He really doesn't have much interest in the Civil War each other's knowledge is the issue.

206
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.110
It's just it really

207
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.300
Kelley Briscar: You know,

208
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.250
Magalie Marcellus: So we interact with that.

209
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:11.160
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, yeah, maybe no. Yes, yes. And that maybe can reason with and

210
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.190
Magalie Marcellus: Because of the friendship with Carlos.

211
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.470
Maybe that could be

212
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.970
Magalie Marcellus: A way.

213
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.300
Magalie Marcellus: Where the if he thinks that what your mom did is OK then, you know, maybe

214
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.850
Kelley Briscar: You when you

215
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.770
Magalie Marcellus: Said that

216
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:32.400
Yes.

217
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:41.910
Kelley Briscar: It's not like it's a surprise to him. I'm sure that you know their, their capital.

218
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:45.360
Magalie Marcellus: Angel join

219
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.470
Magalie Marcellus: Can stuff.

220
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:46.890
Yeah.

221
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:57.000
Magalie Marcellus: Well, again, he might I don't know what your mom told me your mom did tell him that you okay with it. So that could be another

222
00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.700
Magalie Marcellus: Reason why he felt that

223
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:10.080
Magalie Marcellus: It was okay but regardless, the right thing for her to do, especially with your timing issues. It's hard to give you your question, then you know you start over.

224
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:17.520
Magalie Marcellus: From the area, then the, the next year, she knows not to use your information because you should be able to

225
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.970
Magalie Marcellus: Claim for yourself if you need to have that

226
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.530
Kelley Briscar: Right.

227
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.930
Magalie Marcellus: You again it's it's surprising how you find out about it.

228
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.740
Magalie Marcellus: Because it sounds like

229
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.830
Magalie Marcellus: It's been online. I wonder how why you're why they even mentioned something

230
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.630
Kelley Briscar: Like that. My brother, like I said, it was a fun one, like fun.

231
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.800
Magalie Marcellus: And because

232
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:52.800
Kelley Briscar: His sons, if they knew that when they were younger. She's quite bad. And with this money coming. They just wanted to make

233
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.650
Kelley Briscar: You know why and

234
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:05.250
Kelley Briscar: Whenever if you're if you're playing, then you can you don't have money in

235
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:05.850
Magalie Marcellus: My age.

236
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.280
Magalie Marcellus: Dependent or somebody else.

237
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:17.520
Kelley Briscar: Yes. Yeah, so, you know, they were just making sure that they, you know, claim and then mentioned, but you should be about you and I

238
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:24.000
Kelley Briscar: Know when you do that has been helped me really in in years and years and years.

239
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.090
Kelley Briscar: And then when I get on Fox or

240
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.540
Kelley Briscar: A lot. Yeah, I was.

241
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.250
Kelley Briscar: Happy

242
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.200
Kelley Briscar: At all.

243
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:46.260
Magalie Marcellus: And why any have every right to be upset because you know that was in the writing part to do so. Did he cry. Many of your kids.

244
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.080
Kelley Briscar: No, no, no, no.

245
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.180
Kelley Briscar: Go there.

246
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.580
Magalie Marcellus: No cuz I know at some point you guys were in the same house or

247
00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.760
Kelley Briscar: So ago, long time ago.

248
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.040
Kelley Briscar: Oh, yeah.

249
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:15.090
Kelley Briscar: She's doing with them for me. Of course she kept on. Yeah, she said so. Matter of attitude about it, you know, she asked questions to this seminar is and

250
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:26.970
Kelley Briscar: I can kitty so that they're going in and out of pocket for there's no, like how they're getting money back from me. But what what other, you know, first of all, even if

251
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:35.400
Kelley Briscar: That's not my fault or problem. You know, you wouldn't be in the situation if you hadn't done but you did, you know, like

252
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:48.330
Kelley Briscar: I did make it out to be the one that you know the bad daughter, that's, you know, talking this no issue for my for stressed out, you know, mother will join the father who is the

253
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:49.950
Kelley Briscar: Chief

254
00:25:51.180 --> 00:26:07.620
Magalie Marcellus: Wearing what she's make she's the head so defense that, you know, which is helping us so she's entitled to that, but it's not okay. And again, you know if if for whatever reason she thought that you knew you know which is

255
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.340
Magalie Marcellus: Which is, you know, kind of, you know,

256
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:21.330
Magalie Marcellus: Rare for her for all that time that you didn't know about it, but you still approach it in a way that you guys can work it out. Then he doesn't get with that extent.

257
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.730
Kelley Briscar: Know if

258
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.400
Kelley Briscar: You're on it and control on it's just controlled when I finally died, you know, maybe

259
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:40.620
Kelley Briscar: That and then it's not what you know, the floor is what they choose to give me for now. You know, so they still have to throw over that part of it and make

260
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.660
Kelley Briscar: It so I gotta go. See, you have to keep

261
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:59.880
Kelley Briscar: Asking on with it. Yes. I absolutely hate this. I hate being in this position. I hate having to deal with. So when it comes to this, I make a point. I gotta be pretty just for for something to go to my mother for Monday. That's how much I hate dealing. So when it comes to anything.

262
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.690
Magalie Marcellus: That funny.

263
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:11.880
Kelley Briscar: Oh, it's like it's not over for me because I'm not about $700, you know, just go out the window. We could use that to death, you know,

264
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:22.380
Kelley Briscar: Like I can be like all the hats. You know, it's just, it's too important. You know, so it's like ever done having to

265
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:34.740
Kelley Briscar: Continue to deal with it. You know when to take it take us to me at one time. And I mean, Sydney you're going on about it, it's gonna change anything. I know that, you know, I know. Calm down. I mean, I just happened.

266
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.350
Magalie Marcellus: Today, you know, I mean, so it was

267
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.340
Magalie Marcellus: Shocking because you nobody anticipated that so

268
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.030
Magalie Marcellus: You know your reaction is

269
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.450
Normal

270
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:00.360
Magalie Marcellus: The thing is, is you know what I'm hoping that she realized that she was in the wrong and that she may make it right by giving you your portion and then you guys can

271
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:20.550
Magalie Marcellus: Take your space and we regroup and get back together. Because like you said she. This is a HER. SHE PLAYS VICTIM. So anytime. If something doesn't go her way she's gonna make it seem that somebody's blaming her for whatever happened.

272
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.540
Magalie Marcellus: So, but in the knowledge you know this is the way she is you just

273
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.830
Magalie Marcellus: Got yourself in your interaction with

274
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:37.620
Magalie Marcellus: Now what does she help you with that you feel that you need to keep contact with that she he or she provides some transportation. Correct.

275
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.940
Kelley Briscar: Like the scripture sometime like that, but mostly I keep contact with my mom.

276
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.530
Magalie Marcellus: You know, and okay

277
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:51.120
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, yeah. And you just checking in with them, making sure yeah

278
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.070

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.650
Kelley Briscar: No, and I worry about or I know that a lot on their plate with my brother and

281
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.310
Kelley Briscar: So,

282
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.750
Magalie Marcellus: Well, but this is still fresh in so Fred so you know when it settle down and everybody

283
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:22.170
Magalie Marcellus: Cool up eventually. You know, maybe you guys can even have a conversation in a in a calm way when nobody's getting defensive, anything like that.

284
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.630
Magalie Marcellus: But for now, you know,

285
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.280

288
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.240
