14
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:45.240
Wendi Romero: Um, well, I guess, a few years back. You know, I had you know some wrecks and stuff. And, um, anyway. And I was on antidepressants and

15
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.140
Wendi Romero: Well, at first I was on some painkillers and

16
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.970
Wendi Romero: And I could never find one that you know would agree with me and then

17
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.410
Wendi Romero: Oh,

18
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.830
Wendi Romero: I can't remember what it was called

19
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:11.220
Wendi Romero: Oh, it's like a Laura tab or something like that. Anyway, and I got I you know I got kind of hooked on that a little bit in so I had a friend that told me about this a box and program and

20
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:21.480
Wendi Romero: All the great things that did for her life. And so anyway, I started that way and been on it for about, about how long about four years, five years.

21
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.540
Wendi Romero: Yeah, maybe a little bit longer.

22
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.170
Wendi Romero: Yeah.

23
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.840
Chris Alliman MD: So when, when did you get started taking the lorry tabs or the other short acting opiates.

24
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.330
Wendi Romero: Um, let's see, it was, it was way back and

25
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.430
Chris Alliman MD: What do I say, Give me, give me an idea of

26
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.540
Wendi Romero: Like 10 years

27
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.440
Okay.

28
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.610
Chris Alliman MD: And it was because of the car accident.

29
00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:00.120
Wendi Romero: Yeah, oh yeah, it was because of that. And I had a Sciatic Nerve pain from it. I had some discs that were had like seven dish that were messed up in my back. And anyway, so

30
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.980
Wendi Romero: Long story with that.

31
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.900
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, okay.

32
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:13.080
Wendi Romero: And yeah, and I've been, like I said, I've been on Suboxone for well I say about six, seven years. I was on painkillers for about

33
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.340
Wendi Romero: For about, you know, four years prior to that is what I'm trying, I'm trying to I'm trying to remember. Sorry, but yeah.

34
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:36.870
Wendi Romero: And then, and then I and then I tried to wean myself off of that and and that's when I started doing the antidepressants and they had a precedence. Like I was on so many of them. And I know that sounds awful but I'm

35
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.730
Wendi Romero: I probably feel too much. I don't know, but they just helped it but but actually they were hindering the horribly

36
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.170
Wendi Romero: So my mom and

37
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.550
Wendi Romero: You know my dad day and they actually put me in Mission Messiah. It's a Christian based and

38
00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:08.460
Wendi Romero: Like a program. And so I went there for a year, which it was good and it was fine in and I've just been clean ever since. But yeah, that I did get on the Suboxone program. The minute that I got out of

39
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.470
Wendi Romero: That mission Messiah.

40
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.050
Chris Alliman MD: And that was, that was several years ago.

41
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.030
Wendi Romero: Yes, yes.

42
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.880
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, um,

43
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.940
Chris Alliman MD: When was the last time to take Suboxone

44
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:39.240
Wendi Romero: Well, I mean, I have a doctor. But see, the thing is, is my husband and I, we lost our jobs through the chronis bars and so we're moving back to Santa Fe. We're living in Midland Texas right now and we're moving back to Santa Fe. Now I had, I had a doctor. His name is Dr. Peppermint walla

45
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:57.690
Wendi Romero: And and i was going to see if you guys could just get all my records from them because I've been an accurate. I mean, I've been going to him for like six months now. And so then, before that I was going to Dr. Leech, which was in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Okay.

46
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:18.210
Wendi Romero: Or Albuquerque. I'm sorry. And yeah, so. So I have two doctors, you can actually get no records from but I'm still on my soapbox and and I don't want to run out. And so we had to change our insurance and everything. And so that's why we got a doctor to recommend you guys

47
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.130
Wendi Romero: Yeah.

48
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.340
Chris Alliman MD: MUSIC So when do you move back to New Mexico.

49
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.890
Wendi Romero: Well, I'm in the process of doing that right now.

50
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.090
Yeah.

51
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.000
When does it happen.

52
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.340
Wendi Romero: When does it now, like we're moving like we're leaving today are

53
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.210
Chris Alliman MD: You eating today.

54
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.080
Wendi Romero: Yes, sir.

55
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.060
Wendi Romero: Okay, yeah.

56
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:49.230
Wendi Romero: Well, yeah. And we've been living there for about 10 days now. And actually, my husband is taken over his dad's company. So anyway, OK.

57
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.950
Chris Alliman MD: OK.

58
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.700
Wendi Romero: We have a lot more

59
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.920
Chris Alliman MD: The reason is because I am only licensed in New Mexico, so I can't prescribe in

60
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.500
Chris Alliman MD: Texas. So sounds like you're all set.

61
00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.490
Wendi Romero: So I am

62
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.350
Chris Alliman MD: All right, get out. How much, how, how much Suboxone do you take currently

63
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:17.130
Wendi Romero: On the wall. I was taken to a day, and that was on that was beyond the safe side because this is my deal. Okay. Dr. Peppermint wallet. He he he allowed me to get

64
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.670
Wendi Romero: I had another well he was a psychologist and I had another psychologists and I didn't want to

65
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:36.210
Wendi Romero: Interfere with my medicines, but I had Dr line back for Adderall for my for the a DD or ADHD. Okay. And then he also is giving me

66
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:46.080
Wendi Romero: Klonopin now Dr. Peppermint wallet. You know he he would just tell me like he didn't like the mixture of the

67
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.830
Wendi Romero: Of the Klonopin and the Suboxone. So what happened is I stopped taking the Klonopin

68
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.130
Wendi Romero: Because you know he was telling me the interactions that it could have. And I didn't want that to happen. So

69
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.720
Wendi Romero: I didn't want it to be life threatening or anything so so he allowed me to go to him, but just get the Adderall and also

70
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:18.360
Wendi Romero: And then he put me on to Suboxone I was on one and like a quarter, like a one or one and a half or whatever. Before that, but when I got off the colonic and he said he'd give me two

71
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.880
Wendi Romero: For that day. Okay, so I have. So I didn't. So I stopped the Klonopin right and so he put me on to. That's what I've been taking

72
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.670
Chris Alliman MD: How long have you been taking too.

73
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.270
Wendi Romero: Old for about two months.

74
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.270
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And that seems to be working out pretty well.

75
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:49.410
Wendi Romero: Yes, I mean quantity and it's used in such a different way. But I just, I need to get off that because I don't want to take a chance on that happening. Does that make sense so it's working out fine. I guess I mean

76
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.090
Wendi Romero: I would rather do it that way.

77
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.450
Chris Alliman MD: Good. What other medications are you taking currently

Chris Alliman MD: Okay. So as you're making this move. Do you have a psychiatrist or primary care, other people that will be prescribing these other medications for

Chris Alliman MD: Okay, go ahead.

104
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.970
Wendi Romero: If you can take care of both of those. For me, that would be okay too. But I don't know if you know

105
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.420
Chris Alliman MD: I'll just do

106
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.760

109
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.030
Wendi Romero: Yeah I know, it's kind of short notice. I know I'm kind of like a little shaky about that too, but

110
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.270
Wendi Romero: We'll get into that.

111
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:03.900
Okay.

Wendi Romero: Just, just do this dumb. I mean, and yeah, yeah. Well, we had, you know, what are our sister.

120
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.880
Wendi Romero: And my husband's sister. I had a pin and we just when not I just have to be honest with you.

121
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:50.070
Wendi Romero: I mean, it was sounds so ridiculous and I tell my husband's like oh my gosh, I have to tell this doctor that because it ends up being in my urine. I don't want to, you know, I don't want any misunderstandings, like, but I don't do it all the time.

122
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.660
Chris Alliman MD: Right, right.

123
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.690
Chris Alliman MD: Good to know. What about family history. Are there any illnesses that run through the family.

124
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:58.470
No.

125
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.790
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, diabetes, high blood pressure, cannon.

126
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:10.620
Wendi Romero: And no, no, my dad. My dad had some heart problems, he had sense in his heart.

127
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:19.170
Wendi Romero: Um, but I think that was just from probably high blood pressure, stress, you know, he yeah

128
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.810
Wendi Romero: He was a pretty high strung man. Yes.

129
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.730
Wendi Romero: Very successful though.

130
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.820
Chris Alliman MD: When you were taking the Lord tab. How much were you taking. Did you ever overdose.

131
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:39.060
Wendi Romero: No, no, no, what I was talking about. I'd say seven to eight. Sometimes a day.

132
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:53.130
Wendi Romero: I know that sounds so awful. But it's like it was never enough. I never could get like enough relief or but then you know it would hit me and our, our like it wouldn't because I was in pain.

133
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.260
Wendi Romero: And and the weird thing is is

134
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:05.400
Wendi Romero: Like you know after the mission, you know, Messiah. I mean, it was like I said it was a lot of Bible studies and reading and stuff like that, which was really great. But

135
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:14.310
Wendi Romero: A lot of it. I felt like was just in my mind, you know and and then and I was just in a lot of oppression.

136
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:20.460
Wendi Romero: And so i don't i don't think that I was able to really feel the effects of the medication.

137
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:35.640
Wendi Romero: And I'm so strong willed that I think that I wasn't really thinking it was working. And so I got out. That's why it takes don't meanie and. Um, but yeah, I can't believe I didn't like honestly overdose, honestly. Yeah.

138
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.490
Wendi Romero: I'm very thankful I didn't

139
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.960
Chris Alliman MD: What was your reason for wanting to get off the Lord tab and onto Suboxone

140
00:12:42.990 --> 00:13:00.240
Wendi Romero: Because it was because it was. I knew it was wrong. I mean, I just, you know, it was wrong. I mean, I was, I was always afraid of, like, if I ran out like i would i mean i just i knew too many people to go get from or

141
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:14.100
Wendi Romero: And there was no way out like there was just no way out. Like, I mean it was right there. Like it was too much of a temptation, where I mean it would even be offered, I would go into doctors, it'd be offered to me, basically. So

142
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:28.200
Wendi Romero: I just, I mean, I thought it's too easy, and it was to wrong. I mean it was just too wrong, like I just, if I got into a wreck or an accident ended up hurting somebody else. I just was that that would be my life, you know, I just

143
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.700
Wendi Romero: Do it right

144
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:43.260
Chris Alliman MD: And obviously, you're married and sounds like you're moving from Texas to Santa Fe, is what I heard any work at getting a primary care and Psychiatry's to went up there. So that sounds good. Are there any kids with you.

145
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.690
Wendi Romero: Know that they're graduated, they're gone, they're gone to college. Yay.

146
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.430
Chris Alliman MD: Any grandkids.

147
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.690
Wendi Romero: No, not yet.

148
00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:07.560
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. The reason I ask, and this will be for the future. Hopefully it won't be an issue later on. But the residue from Suboxone it gets on your fingers. It's around your mouth. That's in the packet is enough to kill little kids if they like Liggett

149
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.460
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, serious. Yep.

150
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:17.700
Chris Alliman MD: The overdose on it. So that's why we always send in the nasal spray the narcan nasal spray

151
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.770
Chris Alliman MD: Right, so you'll have that I'm going to send that in. I don't think you'll need it but

152
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.330
Chris Alliman MD: I want you to have that available.

153
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:34.230
Chris Alliman MD: Now what wash your hands really well. When you're done using the Suboxone rinse out your mouth wash your mouth and the packets get thrown away outside, not in the house.

154
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.030
Wendi Romero: Okay, okay.

155
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.280
Chris Alliman MD: Now again, I know you don't have little kids around and that's fine. This is just information for the

156
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.660
Wendi Romero: What about animals.

157
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.400
Wendi Romero: What about animals.

158
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.840
Chris Alliman MD: That's a good question. I can't answer that one. I would imagine it's not good for them either.

159
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.320
Wendi Romero: Yeah. Okay. All right. I was just curious because we do have dogs. Okay, good.

160
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.910
Wendi Romero: All right, why

161
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:55.980
Wendi Romero: Are you in the home sleep.

162
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:05.280
Wendi Romero: And no well Dr line back when, when was the coronavirus I've been able to see him, and I have to do it over the phone, but

163
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:15.450
Wendi Romero: It's just a telephone call because I've been. I've been going to him for so long. I talked to his wife and which is the secretary and then I'll be transferred to his aid is

164
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.230
Wendi Romero: His name is Justin, but anyway.

165
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.670
Wendi Romero: Though it's kind of the counseling, they'll ask how I'm doing and

166
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:24.390
Chris Alliman MD: And

167
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.260
Wendi Romero: What's going on. Yeah.

168
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:41.340
Chris Alliman MD: So part of our programs. So you're aware, is that we do weekly video chats like this, but with a group. So there's like five to 10 other people that are on Suboxone I'm there and the therapist is there and we have a group meeting once a week.

169
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.330
Wendi Romero: Okay, cool.

170
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:51.000

172
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.150
Chris Alliman MD: Two meetings each week that happened by zoom and they're both about an hour long so

173
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:01.110
Chris Alliman MD: Those are both of those are required by the program. They're not really option.

174
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.640
Wendi Romero: Okay, that's fine.

175
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.200
Wendi Romero: That's good, that's fine.

196
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.360
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, these are kind of yes or no questions.

197
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.320
Chris Alliman MD: And we're going to think I want you to think back to the time when you were taking the Lord tab.

198
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.360
Chris Alliman MD: This is where we're at with that.

199
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.410
Chris Alliman MD: If you need me to repeat the questions or if you need me to rephrase them. I certainly can.

200
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.250
Okay.

201
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:31.860
Chris Alliman MD: So when taking the Lord tab, was it taken in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than you intended

202
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.820
Wendi Romero: Okay, ask again.

203
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.140
Wendi Romero: Yeah.

204
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.110
Chris Alliman MD: When you get i think that i think it's yes but okay.

205
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.680
Chris Alliman MD: Did you take it longer or take more than you thought you would have to

206
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.460
Wendi Romero: Oh, yeah.

207
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:53.550
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, when taking the Lord tab. Was there a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control its use.

208
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.710
Wendi Romero: Where their desires to cut down

209
00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.280
Your

210
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:02.940
Wendi Romero: Of course,

211
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:13.830
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Sounds good. Did you have to spend a great deal of time trying to get the Lord tab to use the Lord cat or to recover from the Lord tab.

212
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.620
Wendi Romero: Did it take a lot of time.

213
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.510
Wendi Romero: Mm hmm.

214
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.680
Wendi Romero: We got

215
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.620

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.000
Wendi Romero: Oh, yeah, yeah.

217
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.930
Wendi Romero: Oh gosh, yeah.

218
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:34.230
Chris Alliman MD: Did the Lord tab use result in failure to fulfill your roles at home, at school or at work.

219
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.060
Wendi Romero: Oh, yeah. Oh, yes.

220
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:44.280

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.060
Wendi Romero: Mm hmm.

222
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:54.090
Chris Alliman MD: Did you have to give up important social, occupational or recreational activities because of the Lord tab.

223
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.060
Wendi Romero: That's hard to answer, not, not, not really.

224
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.630
Wendi Romero: Let

225
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:01.890
It was one that

226
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:08.100
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue to use the Lord tab in situations that were physically hazardous like driving

227

Wendi Romero: While yes yeah I mean yeah

228
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:21.690
Chris Alliman MD: Have you continue to use this, or did you continue to use despite knowing it could cause physical or psychological problems.

229
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:31.590
Chris Alliman MD: Did you notice tolerance which would be marked by an need for increasing amounts of Lord tab.

230
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.580
Wendi Romero: Okay, ask the question one more time.

231
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.180
Chris Alliman MD: Right. So there's going to be two questions that are very similar.

232
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.320
Wendi Romero: I know, I know.

233
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.800
Chris Alliman MD: The first one is when taking the Lord tab. Did you notice that to get relief you needed to take more

234
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.480
Wendi Romero: Yes, yes, yes.

235
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:54.990
Chris Alliman MD: And the second one is, if you continue to take it. Did you notice it didn't quite work as well as it

Wendi Romero: No good.

321
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.730
Chris Alliman MD: All right.

322
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.340
Wendi Romero: Thank you for that appreciate. Yes.

323
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.180
Chris Alliman MD: All right.

324
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:37.140
Chris Alliman MD: Now for the fun part. We get to do the vitals and the physical exam, which is obviously difficult to do through the computer.

325
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.400
Chris Alliman MD: But I've been watching you, and you've been breathing normally. So I'm going to put a normal respiration rate of 18 down

326
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.740
Chris Alliman MD: What is your, what is your height.

327
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:48.690
Wendi Romero: Five three

328
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.460
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and what is your way.

329
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.880
Wendi Romero: I'm about 125

330
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:58.680
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and we're going to check your pulse. Do you know how to find your posts.

331
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:12.450
Chris Alliman MD: Yes. Good. So I'm going to, you're going to find your pulse and I'm going to tie in for six seconds you count the number of pulses. And then at the end, when I tell you to stop. You can tell me how many pulses, you got

332
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.860
Wendi Romero: Got it. All right.

333
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.280
Chris Alliman MD: Ready, set, go.

334
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:23.820
Chris Alliman MD: Stop.

335
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:31.110
Chris Alliman MD: Very good. So we take times 10 and that gives us a pulse rate of 100

336
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.430
Wendi Romero: Is that great.

337
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.440
Chris Alliman MD: The other thing I need you to do is on camera. Stand up and push on

338
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.000
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good. Any pain as you push

339
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.940
Chris Alliman MD: Good. All right. Thank you.

340
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:53.550
Chris Alliman MD: So that's about it for the physical exam, that's about all we can do other than me just watching you.

341
00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:07.620
Chris Alliman MD: All right. So the next step is kind of figuring out what's going to work out for you. First of all, I've got an email listed for you as Wendy Murdoch at GMAIL. COM

342
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.300
Wendi Romero: Yes, sir. Good.

343
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.460
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm going to send you some information.

344
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.740
Chris Alliman MD: And that's going to be the information about group times and who to contact and all of that stuff.

345
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.720
Chris Alliman MD: And we're going to work through that now. Okay. Okay.

346
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:25.350
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so first the Suboxone you said you were taking the eight tues two films a day.

347
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:26.850
Wendi Romero: Yes, sir.

348
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.190
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so I'm going to get that sent in

349
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.080
Wendi Romero: Okay, perfect.

350
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.340
Chris Alliman MD: I'm also going to send in the nasal spray the narcan nasal spray

351
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.950
Chris Alliman MD: Go ahead.

352
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.990
Wendi Romero: And what is that, again, if in case

353
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.520
Wendi Romero: In case a kid or child gets a hold of it or any of that.

354
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:50.400
Chris Alliman MD: In case anybody overdoses. In case anybody if there's a problem for anybody know

355
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.140
Wendi Romero: You can overdose on Suboxone

356
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.950
Wendi Romero: No. Oh, got it. Thanks. So, but a child.

357
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:08.100
Chris Alliman MD: A child good yes and adult isn't going to, but a child good person, I suppose, if a person has never had. If a person's never used Suboxone or never used opiates in the past.

358
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.860
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, they could overdose on

359
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.140
Wendi Romero: Oh, OK. OK, gotcha.

360
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.870
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, no. Part of it is also legal we are required in the state of New Mexico to send in the nasal spray

361
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:19.620
Okay.

362
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:28.140
Chris Alliman MD: If for some reason you use the nasal spray call 911 also because there's nasal sprays temporary

363
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.720
Wendi Romero: Gotcha, gotcha. Okay.

364
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.100
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so we need to figure out a good group time for you.

365
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.510
Wendi Romero: Okay. Yeah, I know.

366
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.710
Chris Alliman MD: Do you have any schedule at this point.

367
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.330
Wendi Romero: Right now I don't

368
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.180
Wendi Romero: Nights are really good for me though.

369
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:46.470
Okay.

370
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:47.940
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

371
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.230
Chris Alliman MD: Let me see. I have a 730 in the evening group on Wednesday.

372
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:56.610
Wendi Romero: Book

373
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:04.230
Wendi Romero: It's right there. Yeah, Wednesdays at seven. You said 737 30 on Wednesday, every Wednesday. Right.

374
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.580
Wendi Romero: Yep. Okay.

375
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.480
Yeah.

376
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.170
Chris Alliman MD: So the way this works out is that

377
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.790
Chris Alliman MD: It happens on zoom and you have to get the zoom room number

378
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.770
Chris Alliman MD: Oh, we get into the group.

379
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.360
Wendi Romero: Okay, so how do I do that.

380
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:27.840
Chris Alliman MD: It changes every week. It's never the same. So the way to do it. You know, you called into the virtual clinic today you, same thing.

381
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.550
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, into the virtual clinic and they will give you a zoom room number

382
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:42.480
Chris Alliman MD: Gotcha now calling calling the virtual clinic is like going to the doctor's office or calling the doctor's office. There's always online and there's always paperwork to do

383
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.160
Wendi Romero: Okay. Oh, OK.

384
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.470
Chris Alliman MD: So don't wait till five minutes before group to call in, because you're not going to get into group.

385
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.530
Wendi Romero: Wow. So I got a call in like, what, like 30 minutes

386
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.010
Wendi Romero: 30

387
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.240
Chris Alliman MD: Is general yeah

388
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.670
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, we're getting busier and busier

389
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.050
Chris Alliman MD: So,

390
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.450
Chris Alliman MD: 30 minutes to an hour is a good idea.

391
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.810
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, yeah, we can get through that paperwork.

392
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:21.300
Wendi Romero: And listen, and also want to let you know I haven't, I haven't because I was in another car accident recent like I was actually pronounced dead, but I'm alive, but no. And I have an operation, maybe come in for my eye because I went through the windshield.

393
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:40.500
Wendi Romero: And mess my eye up and so they might have a an appointment today but there and they may have to reopen it just open it more okay to get some I had to have an outlet or whatever. But so if that happens, it'll be an in and out session. Okay, but I'm going to need like

394
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:51.330
Wendi Romero: I don't need any pain medicine because it's not hurting. I don't need anything at all. So, but I want to let you know that in case they

395
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:59.040
Wendi Romero: I don't know what they'll do I don't even know if I'll even take the offer, because it's healing. Anyway, and it's fine, but

396
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.100
Wendi Romero: Just in case something happens like that. I would just want to be honest and let you know what what is happening.

397
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.900
Wendi Romero: Because I have an appointment today.

398
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.510
Wendi Romero: Okay and but and I probably won't

399
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:15.810
Wendi Romero: Be sent to another plastic surgeon. I probably won't take it. I'm not. I don't think I'm that bang anyway.

400
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.320
So,

401
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.230
Wendi Romero: Yeah, but just to let you know in case

402
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.470
Wendi Romero: I'll be talking to you before I do any of that.

403
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.360
Wendi Romero: So you'll know what's going on. Okay.

404
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.560
Chris Alliman MD: That sounds good.

405
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.030
Wendi Romero: Okay.

406
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:40.560
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm now in terms of the therapist will have to work that out a little bit but therapist that I work with on Wednesdays is not currently taking new patients. I don't think I'll have to double check with her a little bit. She might be

407
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.440
Chris Alliman MD: We'll see what's happening with that.

408
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.300
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, cool. Um, but yeah, we'll be able to get all of that worked out. No.

409
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:55.560
Chris Alliman MD: Would see. Today is Monday, you're moving like today or tomorrow. You've got all that going, yeah.

410
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.030
Wendi Romero: Yeah, we'll be there like

411
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.890
Wendi Romero: To not around to, I think,

412
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.990
Wendi Romero: Two in the morning actually celebrate tomorrow.

413
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.790
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Will, would you be able to attend group on this Wednesday in two days.

414
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.520
Chris Alliman MD: We have the internet and be all set up to do

415
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.070
Wendi Romero: Yeah, well, oh yeah. Well, that sounds good.

416
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:26.130
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm, I'm going to send you. What we do during the first month is generally to prescriptions each week, you get one from group to go to your therapy appointment. And then when you attend therapy they let me know and I send in another one to get you back to group.

417
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:32.370
Chris Alliman MD: What we've discovered is that if we don't do this, people don't go to therapy right

418
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:40.890
Chris Alliman MD: But after the first month as they discover the benefits of therapy, then we're able to space out the prescriptions.

419
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:41.760
Wendi Romero: I understand.

420
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:50.640
Chris Alliman MD: Now, generally, our approach is that Suboxone helps out with the symptoms to keep a person from withdrawing right

421
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.830
Chris Alliman MD: But therapy helps with the mental aspect of everything that's going on.

422
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.170
Wendi Romero: And it's very important, very important. Yeah.

423
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:10.350
Chris Alliman MD: Something else. Once we get you kind of stabilized with our group, and you're you're in this our system and working well. One of the things we can talk about is getting you connected with our pain management person Tracy Jackson.

424
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.700
Chris Alliman MD: You can see her on TED Talks. She did a very good thing on TED Talks. If you choose to look that up.

425
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.130
Wendi Romero: What does it take to Ed.

426
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:26.520
Wendi Romero: To Me ask you, like, I don't want to be on pain management. I want to be on anything. Yeah.

427
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:31.770
Chris Alliman MD: And that's what she does, she works with the mind, not, not the medication end of things.

428
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.820
Wendi Romero: Oh, good. Oh, great. I'll do that. I'll do I love to do that.

429
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.240
Chris Alliman MD: I'm going to make a note of that. It'll be a few weeks down the road, but

430
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.640
Chris Alliman MD: I think that would be a good option for you to help

431
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.050
Wendi Romero: Me too. Okay.

432
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:48.270
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Good. All right. I think we got it taken care of, does so.

433
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.180
Wendi Romero: It does. It's wonderful.

434
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.770
Chris Alliman MD: Any questions, Wendy.

435
00:31:54.270 --> 00:32:00.450
Chris Alliman MD: And I do have one question I need to check in on. I need to make sure I have your pharmacy that you want me to send this to

436
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:06.330
Wendi Romero: Um, what about one in this one. It's real. It's real serious road.

437
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.360
Chris Alliman MD: Let me, let me get into your

438
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.940
Chris Alliman MD: chart here and make sure that's what we have.

439
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:12.960
