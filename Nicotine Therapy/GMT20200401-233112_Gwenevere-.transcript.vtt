00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect timing, because all start a note. While you do that and I'll let them know that you're on your way also.

9
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome. Okay, I'll see you, you can text me like, Oh, I'll take it forever or maybe you'll come right back, but you can stay with me. I'll be staying in here, but I also have my phone. Okay.

Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, perfect. Thank you.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my goodness. That was pretty picture.

13
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I love that Photoshop and get rid of all the problems.

14
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.180
Lyndsey Lorett: I hope, right.

15
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I should have been wondering how you're doing. So I saw that little text. I was like, wait, what

16
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.200
Yeah.

17
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Our

18
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.690
Lyndsey Lorett: power went out my none of our phones charged, but specifically mine with the alarm.

19
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, right.

20
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So, no big deal.

21
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't strike me as someone who's this is going to be like a whole habitual thing, so I'm not worried about it. Okay, we're here today.

22
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Missing appointments, it bothers me so much.

23
00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I get it. You know what we, we've got to leave room for for life, getting in the way. You know, sometimes I'll say, I'll say, well, I'll be there, God willing

24
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Universe lets me

25
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's right but God willing, is so much snappier versus universe willing. You know what I mean.

26
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I

27
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like that, just to make it easy. I

28
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Get it. Yeah, okay.

29
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Your favorite color to wear white

30
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It. You know why Dr brielle has warned wife for years. That's all she ever wears. And I was like, that's just ridiculous. And now I do it.

31
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.080
Lyndsey Lorett: I think it's beautiful. I love it.

32
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I have other colors. I love black free. It's such a great, but you know what I end up putting this on it so i don't know i think i don't know my so easy to get dressed in the morning. Everything matches.

33
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, but do you come home at the end of the day, clean, is the question.

34
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I come home plate. Well, I never leave my home.

35
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.470
Oh,

36
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So a home office.

37
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.420
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I get it now. Very nice. Yeah.

38
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, I do. It seems like a cheerful kind of happy color.

39
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.240
Yes.

40
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Makes me look like a tan. It does, but

41
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh well, I should have been thinking about you and wondering what it was like to have talked with me, and then

42
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Have gone back to that house. What was that like

43
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

44
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:45.510
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I can. I couldn't. I can't tell ya, I'm just doing things, you know, like, I'm just going along. Alright.

45
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were in what I would call crisis yesterday.

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Was I

47
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, he was

48
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.510
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

49
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: He reached out for help and you got it.

50
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.590
Yeah.

51
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe this man thinking more like on Monday. You were in crisis, I would say.

52
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Monday I was in crisis. Yes, there we go. Because Sunday, Sunday is when we watched the home videos.

53
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: meatloaf and crazy videos.

54
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.860
Lyndsey Lorett: I remember meatloaf and home videos. Yeah.

55
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You did remember you're remembering right now.

56
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.160
Lyndsey Lorett: I do, I am starting to write things down.

57
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:58.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Which I normally don't take the time to do, but I feel like when I feel like I can't stand up for myself, I need to write it down. When I can't remember certain things I need to write it down and maybe rereading will trigger something in my head.

58
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to tell me about today to remember a little bit about today.

59
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.910
Yes.

60
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, so when when I got up.

61
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

62
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.690
Lyndsey Lorett: And I don't even remember what happened. I don't know, just this um

63
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:37.770
Lyndsey Lorett: We're really getting tired of each other and for families to already have a weird dynamic. It's just each day is just like

64
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.190
Lyndsey Lorett: Like nails across the chalkboard.

65
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, and we all have to deal with each other's moods and um

66
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.940
Lyndsey Lorett: And so I kind of just kept to myself today because yesterday I got yelled at for something. I couldn't control.

67
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.240
Lyndsey Lorett: And I didn't really want to engage and be around them today.

68
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Was this yelling from from Lori.

69
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.740
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

70
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:23.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Because we did group. And then I had a problem with my prescription and I was there for several hours, um,

71
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.420
Lyndsey Lorett: I came home and got yelled at.

72
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't remember what it was.

73
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.600
Lyndsey Lorett: That I was that I was gone.

74
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, yeah.

75
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it that you were gone, or they were worried or that you didn't tell them, you'd be gone that long are you are borrowing the car.

76
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they expect dinner. Like, what were the young about

77
00:06:48.660 --> 00:07:04.800
Lyndsey Lorett: They were mad that I was gone for five hours and they they said that I didn't communicate with them, where I was, which isn't true and I pulled it up and show my proof that I had texted and called

78
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.020
Lyndsey Lorett: And

79
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.090
Lyndsey Lorett: Their response was, Well, we didn't get we didn't receive that

80
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The device. I'm assuming you're using your phone.

81
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.920
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

82
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Your any chance that you could set me down.

83
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh yes, you like to be sat down. Haha.

84
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, just a second.

85
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Plastic okay

86
00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So is there ever any justification for being yelled at that you

87
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Are deserving of being yelled at. Is there ever a good justification for that.

88
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:21.150
Lyndsey Lorett: No know I'm a, I'm a pretty approachable person. And so if if you don't choose to tell me how you're feeling and I'm not a mind reader. I don't know that these things bother you.

89
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.230
Lyndsey Lorett: And so apparently being gone by others.

90
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

91
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So, hmm.

92
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, well you may not remember that's okay. We did some work we did some really powerful stuff. But it just may not have been remembered you were in so much distress. It wouldn't surprise me that some of this stuff didn't stick

93
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.120
Lyndsey Lorett: That about breathing.

94
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.760
Lyndsey Lorett: In a relaxed state. No, I remembered. That's why I didn't react, though.

95
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:04.890
Lyndsey Lorett: I would have yelled back I breathe my way through it. I have a couple of times, because it was a little ridiculous because I couldn't control it.

96
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.510
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, and then that was it. Yeah.

97
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little like a sigh like half like that.

98
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.740
Yes.

99
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, beautiful. I can't control it. You did the breathing were able to remember. I can't control. I can't control. And so if we rehearse it even more today. We say, I can't control.

100
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Nor do I have a right to change this woman's opinion.

101
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I

102
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Should Say that again.

103
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't control, nor do I have a right to change this woman's opinion there you is it works both ways. Mm hmm. So that that can calm the resentment down

104
00:09:51.090 --> 00:10:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a right to change this woman's opinion. What I don't like is the delivery that I don't like the delivery is unsettling. And it is a bit violent. The yelling, don't you think

105
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.100
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

106
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. Mm hmm. If you're not a yeller. You're quite approachable. Her delivery is problematic.

107
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:12.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

108
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a right to change Lori. I don't have a right to change your opinion, but you're yelling at me. It doesn't work for me. So I'll talk to you a little later. And off you go.

109
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:31.710
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow, that would, that is really well put exactly how I would like to put it actually

110
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll get there but it starts with that breath because you ever and I always call it like the fancy talk, I'll say, well, we'll do some fancy things in here, and it'll all be forgotten, because

111
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But eventually, eventually, it does get remember it does

112
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.110
Lyndsey Lorett: You forgotten it needs to be practiced and used

113
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did the breathing.

114
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.570
I did.

115
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic, and you want to

116
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.070
Lyndsey Lorett: Do you think that's why I remembered

117
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we practiced it. Is that what you're thinking.

118
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.510
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I actually use the breathing.

119
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, definitely. That means that you were in a Connor body, the blood got to your brain, where you could think to yourself,

120
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't control this woman's behavior. I can't control the situation.

121
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So why am I going to yell back argue back it's pointless. I can't change. So all I'm doing is taking I'm taking what you were already doing which already came naturally to them and adding a little bit more to it.

122
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Might dial down any resentment or anger that you may have about her behavior.

123
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.920
Lyndsey Lorett: is boring.

124
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Chill, you are, the easier it'll be able to remember the fancy talk

125
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And write the little, little tricks about how to

126
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Use boundaries, how to set limits how to basically say no gracefully.

127
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.230
Lyndsey Lorett: I love that. Okay.

128
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, so it's hmm So someone's coming after you with their opinion. That's what, that's what I was saying, if we can do the breath.

129
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're still yelling, remember

130
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:17.940
We say

131
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I will give some consideration to how much of that is true for me. The yelling doesn't work for me. I'll come back a little later.

132
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.580
That's it, you're done.

133
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.510
Lyndsey Lorett: But I envision in my head that just blowing up.

134
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: No way. It isn't a thing is blowing up know there's, you know,

135
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the it, it blows up. What do you mean it.

136
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll either blow up.

137
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, blow up.

138
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

139
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You mean by it helped me understand what's it, it will blow up.

140
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.660
Lyndsey Lorett: It's kind of like a

141
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:11.490
Lyndsey Lorett: domino effect because if I reply and I upset her. Then I upset. Tom and then drew gets involved and he just makes everything worse.

142
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so argue with me. I want you to come back with. Let's see how long it lasts can

143
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You can give me your worst. Don't worry about it.

144
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Can pull in a Tom, you can pull in a Drew, but let's shoot, but really listen to what I'm saying, and see what would happen. So

145
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Come at me with a lorry spiel. Come at me with your best criticism of my being away for five hours.

146
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, that I'm Lori and I'm going to tell you why. Okay.

147
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then Tom and then drew you just have it have it domino

148
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so I, I would say.

149
00:13:54.510 --> 00:14:07.320
Lyndsey Lorett: You really threw off our schedule being gone for five hours. You didn't commute to communicate with us where you were. We didn't know what time you would be home and it really just

150
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:15.930
Lyndsey Lorett: affected our day in a negative way. And with the coronavirus going on. You don't need to be out anywhere, period.

151
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, I've really upset. Everyone in the house with my being gone for five hours. Mm hmm.

152
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, do I have to reply to that.

153
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well just think about it. I'm you.

154
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

155
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it domino after what I just

156
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:43.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Said, as you really have upset, us being gone five hours drew Drew is here probably and going to get into it and

157
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:52.200
Lyndsey Lorett: You just, you need to be home with us. You don't need to be out running around.

158
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'd like me to just stay home and not be running around.

159
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Yeah, I can see how important this is to you. I really can

160
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.040
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know what she would say to that.

161
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, where's the domino keep it going. If you said there's going to be a domino and keep it going.

162
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:13.590
Well,

163
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.740
Lyndsey Lorett: The. Okay, so our conversation would end your ears and eyes.

164
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.640
Lyndsey Lorett: And then as soon as I left the room.

165
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.020
Lyndsey Lorett: As soon as I left the room, there would be arguing about what just took place.

166
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What would she say about what I said, What would she say to true or to Tom

167
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:43.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Drew would yell at her probably and say, Why are you being like this to her. You don't need to make her mad.

168
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.620
Lyndsey Lorett: You've got to stop doing this.

169
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I want to know how it sounded when Lori talked about what I just said. I want to hear what does she say about what I said.

170
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.690
Lyndsey Lorett: I can never really understand, word for word. It's just like high pitch.

171
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Words that I can't make out all the time.

172
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

173
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what did I say I know we're getting asked all the characters. We're just going to come back to one of your therapist. I was pretending to be you.

174
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you

175
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, what did you hear me say

176
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.560
Lyndsey Lorett: I heard you say that you were sorry

177
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say I'm sorry absolutely did not

178
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I did not.

179
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:51.570
Lyndsey Lorett: You started with something for being gone for five hours. Oh, I see me being gone. Sorry. See, not sorry I see me being gone for five hours is really important to you.

180
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Maya.

181
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Not bad, not bad. But notice how you felt that I had apologized. Notice that you felt it even though I didn't say I'm sorry I

182
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Felt it. I did.

183
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say it.

184
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.440
You didn't

185
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Why do I feel like you said, sorry.

186
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm showing empathy because I didn't defend myself and all I did was show active listening. And I said, in addition, this is really important to you and I'm going to really give it's really think about what you're saying.

187
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But I did not apologize. I didn't do anything. Pocket apologize.

188
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But you felt it.

189
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.290
Lyndsey Lorett: I did, yeah. I still do.

190
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's recorded. I can always double check myself maybe I accidentally did but it's very, very, it's a very specific thing and apology. So I'm quite precise about it.

191
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:48.600
Lyndsey Lorett: I

192
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If I say this, I'm sorry. You feel that way people are going to feel condescended to and that's going to piss them off. So I don't say it very often, unless it's an actual apology.

193
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It seems like a word game but

194
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important because in those moments I want to really both hold on to myself. I didn't do anything wrong.

195
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Right, that's how I

196
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.400
Will you didn't

197
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You are also in a commune t. So, it had an impact.

198
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They both exist. They exist at the same time, how we navigate that. How do we do it gracefully. How do I not let go of my truth.

199
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And still see

200
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone else that's empathy and that's all I did is I listened to you. I listened. I changed my you already have the tongue part down pat, you have a great tone of voice. Very sweet, very caring

201
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That needs to change around that.

202
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just about how to not let go in here. You, you got a right

203
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

204
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're bothered by the fact that someone would find fault with you just live in your life. And so you're kind of still caught in that I haven't done anything wrong.

205
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:19.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I like in high school, like I was getting in trouble for going to a friend's out. No.

206
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't do anything wrong. And the difference between you and I, is well, huge, right. I'm not in it. I'm not in the in the thick of it, but I don't think automatically

207
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something wrong with me. I've done something wrong. I don't go there. I really try to listen. I was listening really listening to your words like what's your concern like really truly not preparing my response just

208
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.360
Lyndsey Lorett: How do you just listen and not prepare a response because you're gonna have to respond when they're done.

209
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, watch, let's say,

210
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say there's this shield and even though people will come at you with anger.

211
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing's going to actually penetrate they're going to come at you with names accusations and demands.

212
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Names accusations and demands.

213
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That come at you with those

214
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but it doesn't get through. There's this little like shield. Maybe it's like a balloon or you can picture, some kind of transparent barrier that you can still be looking at them and you can still hear them. But that stuff doesn't touch you.

215
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.820
Lyndsey Lorett: So you're like,

216
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead, you can see, ah, they're afraid of something

217
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And so instead I tune into that and that means if they're afraid.

218
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need to be angry if they're afraid they must be threatened by me. Well, I don't need to pop up. I'm fine. I was only on for I was taking care of business. In fact, I was darn near super inconvenience. I wish someone would listen to me.

219
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Right, yeah.

220
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a different mindset is I'm going to see past as if swiping right. I'm just going to see past the anger and I'm going to try to tap into their concern, they're worried about something they're afraid of something

221
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where I meet them. I meet them there. And that's what this shield can do. It's like

222
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm listening, see my face I'm listening to them. Uh huh.

223
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah I was I was gone for five hours. I didn't tell anybody. You guys didn't know didn't know. Now I'm not waiting to contradict it with my little phone. I've got the facts on my side.

224
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter because guess what she's gonna go and tell a lie in the other room. Anyway, what difference does it make whether you got your fancy facts. Doesn't matter.

225
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.610
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

226
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me go complain to Tom and drew. Yes.

227
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, what difference does it make you might as well have a peaceful moment with with Lori.

228
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you differently. That's the only thing we really have control over. So you put up the shield and like I'm over here.

229
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.870
Breathing.

230
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing my breathing.

231
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.210
Lyndsey Lorett: But now, my heart is pounding.

232
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.660
Lyndsey Lorett: Pounding right now when you just said that because I feel like they're trying to take that away from me.

233
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.080
Yeah.

234
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.080
They can't. I can't.

235
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you can have peace anytime you want. It will shift this perceived threat and then we shifted, we say, well, this if I don't look at her as a threat. I

236
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: defend myself. Obviously, I know I was communicating. I have my text. So, something else is going on. She's like picking a fight with me, it seems like I wonder what's

237
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Lori's afraid of them. It really listened to her coronavirus and okay you you almost seem okay so she seems like she's worried about me.

238
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, worried about the family like I might those hours I might bring something back. All right, she's scared of something on listening.

239
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I don't have the time in that moment to go through each one of her rant details.

240
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. I don't have time. So what I do is I do a carte blanche statement of

241
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It really does seem like I've upset you guys so very much by being gone five hours. I'm going to really think about. And you mentioned something about don't do it again. I'm going to give that

242
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: give that some thought and I'll see how much of that is true for me, you know, you said that it was insensitive on I'm going to go spend some time thinking about that.

243
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.830
Lyndsey Lorett: That was that's very well said yes.

244
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I did not apologize.

245
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:46.680
Lyndsey Lorett: Know,

246
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What I said was

247
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the truckload that you just delivered. I will go take a toothpick and I will go, I will go see how much is true for me.

248
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.140
Lyndsey Lorett: It sounds much nicer. The way you said it.

249
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So in my own little quiet defiance. I'm still flipping people to burn. Okay.

250
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Good inside. I'm still quite version of myself.

251
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I say is something else.

252
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's the fancy talk no way you're going to remember that fancy stuff if you aren't in a relaxed body.

253
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right won't remember. None of us will I don't, I can't remember all this stuff either final stage chill.

254
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:36.660
Lyndsey Lorett: I see.

255
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So those little phrases like I imagine that was hard for the whole family. Me being away and you not, not knowing where I was.

256
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they'll say, yeah, yeah, it was really hard.

257
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you don't say anything you don't defend yourself.

258
00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. And then she doesn't have anything to fight against it's just air. There's nothing to

259
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.530
Lyndsey Lorett: That's what, that's what I thought it was trying to

260
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Second, watch what happened you brought up content.

261
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:15.630
Lyndsey Lorett: This is not

262
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: On text was content. You just gave for something to hold on to argue about

263
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.700
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

264
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't give anybody any content they have nothing they can fight with me with what did I just say try and try and try and grab ahold of something you're going to fight with me.

265
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.580
Lyndsey Lorett: About what you just said your response.

266
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so when I said

267
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I being gone for five hours really upset you guys

268
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.110
Lyndsey Lorett: There's not really anything you can come back with against that.

269
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So how will it follow up. You said it will be a domino effect and it will blow up. How's it going to go down. If I say that if I just use empathy.

270
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just

271
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Setting that boundary or not even setting a boundary just not

272
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Giving it giving it over.

273
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Make her mad. That's

274
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but what will she do

275
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'll be her. I'm going to do it again. You know her better. Let's do it. Give me your worst you backed away again. Gimme gimme gimme your best stuff.

276
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You're living it every day. Here we go.

277
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, here we go, here we go.

278
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.550
Lyndsey Lorett: You know what my heart.

279
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.630
Lyndsey Lorett: My heart is pounding.

280
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Give me just a

281
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Second to calm down.

282
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm with you, girl. Nice to meet you.

283
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice belly breath.

284
00:26:52.980 --> 00:27:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, few the back of your seat pressing up against your back. Feel the warmth of the seat of under your bottom and your legs feel it. You may not have noticed it for the last few seconds. Pay attention. Notice that the temperature of your arms. It's just a little different.

285
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And under your feel the texture of maybe a little bit of the t shirt on the forum.

286
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you feel your hair on the back of your neck attention there.

287
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice how your fingers feel as you touch them with your right hand.

288
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Can you see me doing that.

289
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.550
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, okay.

290
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.700
Lyndsey Lorett: It's a calming thing.

291
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and that is that, and you already have it naturally you're regulating yourself. It's beautiful. Okay.

292
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Ok I had heard

293
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.130
Lyndsey Lorett: OK, so I'm going back to pretend mode.

294
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're Lori and I say to you after your original you came in May was your critique.

295
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: My day

296
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and say,

297
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Laurie that I really upset. It sounds like everybody in the house of my being gone and you guys didn't know where I was for five hours, you guys. Sounds like you're worried around sort of the issue with the coronavirus

298
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:19.530
Lyndsey Lorett: Ah,

299
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.110
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know, like

300
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:43.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Some of the random his stuff comes out, we'd be talking about one thing. Okay. All right. I'm making excuses. Um, yes you are endangering the family by being out and ah we feel like if you cared. You wouldn't be out

301
00:28:46.830 --> 00:29:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys. Oh, I can see why that would be so upsetting. I'm acting as if like, I don't care. All that time that I was away. Yeah, I could see why that would be so upsetting. I could see that that makes a lot of sense. It does.

302
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.440
Lyndsey Lorett: I think that's what what I replied with, actually.

303
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:15.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, we're having the conversation. Okay, keep going. I told them I made a lot of sense. Um,

304
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:28.830
Lyndsey Lorett: And you through Oliver's routine off for the whole day and it just messed everything up. Oh.

305
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Dear. It certainly wasn't my intention. I certainly didn't mean to. How did I throw it off. Tell me, I want to know. So, so I understand more. What did I do tell me

306
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:50.070
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, you were gone from the house for five hours. Who do you think was watching Oliver for those five hours. Who do you think was changing his diaper for those five hours.

307
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, were you when you watching him to do do some of that.

308
00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I hadn't the whole time.

309
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you so much for your help. I'm so grateful to you.

310
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And to your parents and everyone in this House, so grateful. Thank you so very much.

311
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.690
Lyndsey Lorett: That would throw her off a little bit.

312
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.220
Lyndsey Lorett: That response.

313
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:17.760
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't

314
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what. But the truth is I don't know what I would do with you. I don't know what I would have done these last five hours. I'm so grateful that you are here for Ali.

315
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you Lori so much

316
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:38.790
Lyndsey Lorett: When I say thank you for things though she tends to think I'm being smart alec he

317
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's because it might sound like this. And thank you for that.

318
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's different than the way I was doing it.

319
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.170
Lyndsey Lorett: It's true.

320
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be kind of snippy snooty, we can get come across that way in our sorry I mean our, our gratitude can feel flip it.

321
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And get it.

322
00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.080
And

323
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

324
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.110
Lyndsey Lorett: So I need to finesse that a little

325
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To actually believe it in the moment.

326
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.760
Lyndsey Lorett: I have to believe what I'm saying.

327
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I was telling you about the truckload

328
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You only believe it good to goodness pencil.

329
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.180
Yes.

330
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so I need to find the one thing

331
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.850
Lyndsey Lorett: grain of truth. Yes, to what they're saying.

332
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It will change the course of the conversation will change your tone of voice, there won't be any of, well, I'm showing you gratitude. I thank you all the time and I pay you guys I do all these other things I show my gratitude and all these other ways right away I pitch pitch.

333
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that will ignite.

334
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:53.880
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

335
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That's different than

336
00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I literally am grateful because I don't know what I might even be crying at this point.

337
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Those five hours were so hard. I am so grateful to Lori what I just went through without you guys here. I don't know how I would have done it.

338
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's real those five hours suck you text me once, I bet you were having

339
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Big

340
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: They stopped.

341
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.020
Lyndsey Lorett: And the pharmacist yelled at me.

342
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh,

343
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. People trippin telling you so

344
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Is it overheating.

345
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:34.530
Oh,

346
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: cool air for a minute.

347
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.490
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm going to turn the air on right now.

348
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.940
Lyndsey Lorett: About two minutes.

349
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:04.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

350
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. How we doing

351
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.070
Lyndsey Lorett: There we go.

352
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

353
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:21.510
Okay, yeah.

354
00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: These are things when I went and I got my master's degree. I never thought I would have to problem solve.

355
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.040
Lyndsey Lorett: The phone overheating that where do people normally do this at

356
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, some people are in their car, some people

357
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They are they'll have to go outside because they don't really want their family to hear some people

358
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: In their office at work. Some people are fortunate enough that they can some of them jump in the bathroom, if you can believe it.

359
00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of them have enough privacy that they can pull off in their bedroom, they can kind of have privacy.

360
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people are in their car.

361
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Then the one the only place I know I have privacy here. Okay.

362
00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So the downside is you're missing out on some of the really effective techniques. So we'll do this for a while, but then I'm going to be like begging you.

363
00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To for you not we can keep doing the the cognitive behavioral stuff, but you won't get you won't get possibly the kind of trauma resolution that I think you're seeking

364
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, they my in laws would like me to do it in the house.

365
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.870
Lyndsey Lorett: With the computer.

366
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear everything

367
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, and

368
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.190
Lyndsey Lorett: I just keep saying it the HIPAA violation. Oh, I know what to say.

369
00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's fine. So, so other ways that people can pull this off they go to a library. They go to Starbucks. Now, right now, our whole life is upside down and now it's just like, okay, all bets are off. So it might be something like

370
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's good Wi Fi somewhere you're out. Let's say I'm going to say something, then you'd problem solve, but it's like a park. Now of course we need Wi Fi and park at the same time, but you can picture that

371
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be outside of a particular building where you're seated. You want to be able to feel safe feel that it's private. But you also really need to have good connection.

372
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.090
So,

373
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the things that I might invite you to do, assuming that you know you can move around a little bit would require standing

374
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.050
Mm hmm.

375
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving from one part of the screen, maybe a chair here maybe a chair there. So there's movement involved for some of the work that I do and this is the stuff that sticks, though, so

376
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, all right, we'll work it.

377
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be today. So we'll stick until, until you know we kind of both come to terms and we say, well, I wonder if we need to do some of this little deeper work.

378
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Because right now. What you're talking about is immediate.

379
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Perceived it's just this barrage of negativity. It's coming out. You just coming out. You coming out to you. So I want you to be able to to have skills to meet that distress in a way that you feel good about so we can do this for as long as you need.

380
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.190
Lyndsey Lorett: I appreciate that.

381
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.530
Lyndsey Lorett: I also feel like I have so many deeper issue.

382
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:52.680
Lyndsey Lorett: Then just my response to all of this. Um, and it kind of sucks that I have to do that first.

383
00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what if it doesn't, what if this gives you time to have confidence. What if it's building confidence about how you're going to meet difficult, challenging relationships difficult communication.

384
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then we have that history built in.

385
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you and I maybe pull up a memory of some kind. And then if it gets distressing. I can remind you, and I can say you've done difficult things before

386
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember that. And you go, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know. Maybe that'll be the order of things.

388
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.590
Lyndsey Lorett: All right. That doesn't sound so bad.

389
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't find any problem with the order I really don't. Because right now it you you can

390
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So we wait a little while. That's okay. Now let me ask you something.

391
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just check in. How many hours of sleep. Are you getting

392
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Each night it varies

393
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:25.260
Lyndsey Lorett: I tend, a recent issue is falling asleep. Okay. And I'll close my eyes and then 20 minutes later when I haven't fallen asleep. I checked the phone and I'll do this for hours. Check the phone.

394
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.020
Lyndsey Lorett: To. But for the time

395
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.080
Lyndsey Lorett: See if anyone's talking

396
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a text I get how now how

397
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.130
Lyndsey Lorett: Ya know,

398
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got it. So 20 minutes time is it, how long have I been trying to sleep. Let me see.

399
00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me try again.

400
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Then you look again. Yes. Okay.

401
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And what have you tried to do to go back to

402
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:10.020
Lyndsey Lorett: When it's when it's like two in the morning and I haven't gone to sleep. Yet I will turn off. Don't laugh at me, Dr. Pimple Popper.

403
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:18.930
Lyndsey Lorett: On YouTube. I don't know why it just clears everything out of my head a watch it for five minutes and then I'm asleep.

404
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Watch that

405
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:23.970
Lyndsey Lorett: It's disgusting.

406
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes. But you know what, how often do you get to feel disgusted.

407
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: How often do you feel disgusted.

408
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Every day when I change my wound

409
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting.

410
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other time.

411
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Know like disgusted with my with me.

412
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: With anything I found

413
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.710
Lyndsey Lorett: Yet, okay, yet on a real note. Yes.

414
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Anytime I'm cleaning or I don't

415
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:41.580
Lyndsey Lorett: They don't really wash their dishes. So I'll go to post something when I finally do get ready to eat. Um, I'll pull out a dish and it'll be dirty and I just lose my appetite all know or while we're eating together as a family, and they both choke on me like where they throw up.

416
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:49.560
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I'm in the middle of eating and I can't finish because I'm just so disgusted. Actually, yeah.

417
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.910
Lyndsey Lorett: But I felt like I feel like that's really mean.

418
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: All to be disgusted.

419
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Whoa.

420
00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:03.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Why so high class, you can't eat off a dirty plate and like

421
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, no, no. So discussed is one of our core emotions. It's one of the ones we don't have any we don't have any control over that one.

422
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Who. That's true.

423
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's right.

424
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:16.740
Okay.

425
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We can mess around with with jealousy, a little bit or like okay I can probably put some cognitive reframing on some of it. I can manage. But this one in your face goes like this. Like that.

426
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, that's when you know you're disgusted that's that's instinctual.

427
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Is it

428
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.960
Yeah.

429
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:49.680
Lyndsey Lorett: So my fiance. I would never let him do the dishes, because the same damn thing. And now I get why

430
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're disgusted with yourself.

431
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.590
Lyndsey Lorett: With my wounds. Yes.

432
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.300
Lyndsey Lorett: It's like a brain popping out of mice down and air.

433
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be like, like an alien movie or something, huh.

434
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.430
Lyndsey Lorett: It's gross.

435
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Up.

436
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.140
Lyndsey Lorett: It smells.

437
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:38.940
Lyndsey Lorett: Like all the fluid that comes out and mixes with all the stuff I'm using to soak it up and it creates a smell boy. Yeah.

438
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So every day. How many minutes do you have to sit with that that disgusting feeling

439
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Howdy about 30 minutes

440
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Five minutes with Mr. Popper, and you're asleep.

441
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, okay. What does that mean,

442
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna I'm gonna, I want to think about it. I don't know. We'll go on this journey together.

443
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:23.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, because I don't know why watching this explode just makes me not think about anything.

444
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think there's probably a correlation between the two. So you've got some, I mean the pop psychology would be there's some sort of discharge. There's an undoing. Uh huh.

445
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why we have compulsive behaviors is an undoing that happens when you see it something maybe gets validated something gets. I don't have to continue with some charged thought or there's something that gets probably released by being able to watch that.

446
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So until I come up with something else. That's my hypothesis.

447
00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.210
Lyndsey Lorett: I'll stick with that, if you just read, though, you better let me know.

448
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to tell you to stop. I mean, if it's worth it puts you to sleep. Why on earth do you wait till five two in the morning. Why on earth are we not doing it at nine o'clock at night to get us newsy

449
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Because in my mind, I would like to lay down and go right to sleep.

450
00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know what

451
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: These is tough times because right outside the door or some disgusting dishes. So what if we did it on purpose. Well, I wanted curious to know if we were like, okay, I want

452
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To get this done with I'm going to watch this for five minutes. I won't watch it for any less. This is on purpose is an intervention.

453
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So no minutes. Okay, I've got a 64 seconds so discussing really want to turn off. Nobody watch it for five minutes and then you turn it off.

454
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, instead do it at when's your bedtime. When do you kind of

455
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.390
Lyndsey Lorett: Want at nine. Yeah.

456
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What time you getting up in the morning. I see how many hours you're getting there. If you actually went to sleep at nine.

457
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:11.280
Lyndsey Lorett: So, um, I get up between, like, eight, nine.

458
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.220
So let's see, that's

459
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:26.850
Lyndsey Lorett: 123456 know if I really went to sleep at nine I probably couldn't sleep past seven six or seven

460
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:27.570
Okay.

461
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. OK, cool.

462
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see what happens. We'll do a little experiment and you can Google your way all the way through it. I can't believe she's making me do this disgusting thing.

463
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Marty doing it.

464
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: In the morning. Also, what happens

465
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

466
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting in a little ritual now all the other sleep hygiene parts have to be there. No screen time an hour before bed. Don't go drink a big glass of water. I mean, unless your doctor tells you right do all the sleep hygiene stuff bed is only for snoozing and and

467
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. No screen time

468
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, let's see what happens.

469
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, except those five minutes.

470
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:05.520
Right.

471
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.100
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so it says every night.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens.

Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so moving into next week and your group day is Tuesday, so we won't make it on Tuesday. That's, that's for sure. I already have something I already have a 7am

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, brave technical and please do not give them ammunition no content to not give them anything to argue about

489
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All you say is it sounds so important. I'm going to go now. For me, my way. Here's my be too intense. You can't get away with this, but I would say, let me see how much of that is true for me.

490
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where I hold on to myself I don't take the whole truckload that's my food.

491
00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:56.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

492
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to have to find a phrase that doesn't Ignite them.

493
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.730
Lyndsey Lorett: But slowly pulling onto your truth, you're gonna have to

494
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Find a phrase that works for them. It doesn't piss them off.

495
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.180
Right.

496
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.200
