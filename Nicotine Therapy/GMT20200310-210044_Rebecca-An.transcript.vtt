50
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I you just have a feeling that you know what you're doing and you're going to go in there and you're going to rock it.

51
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.780
Pixel 3a: No, I hope.

52
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

53
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.620
Pixel 3a: You. Well, I know I just get nervous because I feel like they have such high expectations for me that I feel like, what if I don't measure up to what they're

54
00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:08.880
Pixel 3a: Thinking, I am i guess i don't know because I've been in the business for a long time. So in the first interview they were telling me, like, Oh, we have to start you have started daytime which I haven't worked a time in years because that's like, you know what beginners start. Yeah.

55
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:19.500

Pixel 3a: Like I don't want everybody to hate me to, you know, going in there going to be like, hey, she's brand new. Why is she working nights, you know,

58
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe overthinking it. I don't know.

59
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that you probably are a little bit and you know I get this, the

60
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stress of it a new jobs always stressful but

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're a team player.

62
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I just, you know, have a feeling that you're going to go in there, they're going to be comfortable with you and that you're going to do a great job and

63
00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have this huge amount of experience to that you get to bring to the table where I'm sure there are people there that it's the first time doing it. And you know what I mean, they could probably learn some things from you.

64
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.010
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

65
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:18.750
Pixel 3a: You know, yeah, just, I don't know, just scary because this is more of a, like a fine dining, you know, like, super like it has, if I had a Cromer I was in my mind, I'm like, What the hell is a drummer, he

66
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:32.580
Pixel 3a: Was like, Oh no, I'm sorry. At this time, I don't have fun. You know, like totally made it looked like I knew what it was. And so they're like, okay, we'll provide you with one but also out of Google, you know, like, what's it from her.

67
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is the Promo

68
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:45.990
Pixel 3a: I guess like you. It's a tool that you use to between entrees to scrape the crumbs off of the table like this is like one of those kind of dining places like I've never been eaten at one of those kind of places.

69
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.210
Pixel 3a: Little work. You know, so I'm like, oh my god.

70
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.100
Pixel 3a: Like, what if I just got myself into something more than I can chew. You know,

71
00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:07.950
Pixel 3a: But then they're like, like I went to orientation and the owner, happened to be there and I introduced myself. And he's like, Oh, you're going to work out real right. And I said, Yeah. And then he was like, oh, I heard a lot about you and he was like all happy. And I'm like, oh my god.

72
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.240
Pixel 3a: Like

73
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.080
Pixel 3a: You know,

74
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.880
Pixel 3a: But that's what makes me worried like, what if they're

75
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.250
Pixel 3a: Expecting. I don't know.

76
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.790
Pixel 3a: You know, I was just ready to go in there and just work lunches.

77
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.850
Pixel 3a: Like a whole

78
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.700
Pixel 3a: So I don't know. So I'm a little nervous that I don't meet their expectations, you know,

79
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:36.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think that I think that it's unfounded. I really do. You know, and one great thing is the adaptability.

80
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working in in the in that field.

81
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And working at different places, you know that you have to go in and kind of watch how that place does things

82
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:51.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And pick up on what they do and you pick it up and you implement it in your in your schedule and you do it.

83
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, it just, you're gonna you're gonna rock it.

84
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.720
Pixel 3a: I hope

85
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:11.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just got to know that right now you're in a vulnerable spot your emotions are all over the place. So you got to take deep breaths and you know tell yourself. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this, you know,

86
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.530
Pixel 3a: I think that's what like

87
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:24.660
Pixel 3a: What it is it's like I'm just all over the place, like you said, like I feel like I haven't had time yet just sit back and be like, oh, what just happened, you know,

88
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

89
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.370
Pixel 3a: I should have been really gave myself some more time before I wanted to work.

90
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.450
Pixel 3a: But I've never not work. I've never not had a draw. So it was scary. You know, I'm a single mom, essentially.

91
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

92
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.420
Pixel 3a: You know, I have to pay my bills still

93
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.160
Pixel 3a: Mm hmm. So

94
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's the kind of messed up part about being a single parent is that you don't get

95
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.520
The

96
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The appropriate amount of time to be able to process through. You have to do it in bits and pieces.

97
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When your schedule allows

98
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.930
Exactly.

99
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are times when it's going to come out in in ways or in situations where you don't want them to. You just have to be very self aware

100
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know that that's what's going on and just really, you know, kind of work it one day at a time. You might go in there and find out that the people you're working with are cool and you know what I mean. And

101
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just

102
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't know.

103
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.380
Pixel 3a: Yeah, I've heard a lot of amazing things about this place. I have a friend who works at one of their restaurants they have three

104
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.030
Pixel 3a: And

105
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.630
Pixel 3a: She just raves about it. That's what made me apply. I actually applied at her place because they have

106
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.830
Pixel 3a: You know, levels of like the fine dining

107
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.220
Pixel 3a: So I wanted to go where she's at which is like medium, you know,

108
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.850
Pixel 3a: And I wanted to go there and then they sent me to this place. Smells like

109
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.900
Pixel 3a: Oh my god like

110
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.520
Pixel 3a: I didn't even want to go there.

111
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.260
Pixel 3a: They're like, Oh, no, we have, we think you're perfect match for this place.

112
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.120
Pixel 3a: And so I was like okay and then I went there. Oh my god.

113
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:20.460
Pixel 3a: Like scary, but I mean, at the same time. It's like when my husband says, choose a failure. This is what you are this what you do like your when you and my daughter said it best to, she said, Mom, because she works with me. She goes, You you make

114
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:27.060
Pixel 3a: The last restart you worked at which you know that jobs because you made everybody feel like you they are in fine dining

115
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:39.300
Pixel 3a: You know, the way I wash you with customers, compared to everyone else, like you make them feel more like at home and fine dining, you know, more like a richer place. She said, and I was like oh really, she was. Yeah.

116
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.620
Pixel 3a: I was

117
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.650
Pixel 3a: Cool. And it's like we are way different than everybody else. They're like, oh, let me feel good because you're coming from her because we've

118
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.040
Pixel 3a: We've had been distancing. She's been distancing yourself for a while.

119
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.800
Pixel 3a: So, that was nice to hear from ya.

120
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why she been distancing herself.

121
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.950
Pixel 3a: I don't know, she's going through

122
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:15.360
Pixel 3a: I don't know. We used to be like so close like best friends and I used to cry like it's been happening for about a year. So I'm at the point where I'm just accepting it. It is what it is, but always be here for her. She needs me.

123
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:15.900
You know,

124
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.440
Pixel 3a: But it was hurtful because we were so close I Have you ever watched grey gardens that will be

125
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:34.920
Pixel 3a: Oh, okay. It's a movie with that about Jackie Onassis his cousin Drew Barrymore stars in it and it's just about like this mother daughter relationship that just cat. They're just

126
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.080
Pixel 3a: Always together.

127
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

128
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:48.450
Pixel 3a: But it's kind of creepy, the way it is, kind of, if you watch the movie. It's kind of sad and but it be so we joke around and say grey gardens meeting. It's going to be always be you against the world.

129
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.600
Pixel 3a: And I mean, she was like 17 and she would still sleep in my bed. You know, like we were that close.

130
00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:03.420
Pixel 3a: Yeah. And then I'm now. I then one day we're watching the movie and she just, you could just tell she was like horrified and like afraid.

131
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:15.900
Pixel 3a: I don't know, like she thought that was really going to be us. And she started like distancing herself slowly. It was weird. I don't know. So it just makes me feel like she's embarrassed of me.

132
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.800
Pixel 3a: You know, I don't know, it's weird.

133
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.150

137
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.930
Pixel 3a: Right. Yeah, no, I understand that.

138
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:45.480
Pixel 3a: And everybody told me it was coming, but I never. They were like, oh wait till junior high, you're high came, it didn't happen. Wait dies school, high school k, we were still in also. It just came as a shock.

139
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

140
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.000
Pixel 3a: You know, she started. She has a really

141
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.340
Pixel 3a: A relationship and I don't her girlfriend, she's, she's by

142
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.020
Pixel 3a: Our girlfriend.

143
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:04.710
Pixel 3a: I don't think she doesn't like me, they're more of like a Richie family. Yes. Yeah. I think my daughter is like embarrassed of us.

144
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.900
Pixel 3a: So I don't know.

145
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, my hope is that someday. She'll get to the point

146
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.660
Where

147
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It will make a difference because her family is your family. No. If ands, or buts.

148
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and they'll be moments in her life when she'll realize that that the one person that was there for her where you was you

149
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:36.990
Pixel 3a: You know, yeah, yeah. I had a little talk with me was to the point we weren't weren't speaking at all like she will speak to me and then she'll be nice. And then when her girlfriends around. She's okay you know

150
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:48.540
Pixel 3a: Or withdrawn. So it's like okay, but she HER CAR BROKE DOWN. So she needed help, of course, that was there for her. I would never deny my child, you know, they're

151
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:59.460
Pixel 3a: Being all the time. So I think I just told her, I said, you know, you have us here like we're here where your support system like I didn't have a support system. I just had to do it on my own. She has one

152
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:11.940
Pixel 3a: You know, and so I was like you just stopped distancing yourself from us because we're here. So she thanked me because you know I got her helping her out with her car, and I've noticed, she's starting to be more

153
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.590
Pixel 3a: Nice.

154
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice.

155
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:23.190
Pixel 3a: To be more nice like before, like she won't even she's never caused the baby Araya she always goes the baby.

156
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.060
Yeah.

157
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.760
Pixel 3a: I wonder, too, if it might have been like

158
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:39.780
Pixel 3a: Because I had another daughter and her whole time growing up, I always used to say, Oh, why do I love you so much. I pug eater, and then I'd be out okay she would say, because I'm your first and only daughter, you know, that was her

159
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.100
Pixel 3a: Yeah, saying that was are saying to each other so that I had a daughter.

160
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.230
Pixel 3a: Another one.

161
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.000
Pixel 3a: And so I don't know that might have been

162
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.530
Pixel 3a: I remember when I had to tell her I was pregnant. It was like I was a teenager telling my mom.

163
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is at the park. Yeah. She was like, Oh, we're gonna we're happy because I sat there crying.

164
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:08.670
Pixel 3a: I have to talk to you and she was like all afraid, like, Oh my God, are you dying. Mom, you know, and I was just like, I'm pregnant. She sent me all crazy, like what

165
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how did she get along with your daughter with your baby.

166
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.850
She doesn't

167
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:24.150
Pixel 3a: Like nothing but lately, since I have been helping her with a car. She took my daughter to her room to see her cat.

168
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:30.450
Pixel 3a: And so that was like oh my god you know your to do is just goes to the baby.

169
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.330
Pixel 3a: She got her birthday present stuff, but I don't know. She doesn't really like interact with her.

170
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.170
Yeah.

171
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I got all

172
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.130
Pixel 3a: And it hurts my feelings.

173
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:41.730
Yeah.

174
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable. Definitely. Well, you got to remember the age gap to

175
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.330
Pixel 3a: We are, you know,

176
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.910
Pixel 3a: And I do know that she's has so much on our plate. She's doing 22 units of school right now that's

177
00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:01.860
Pixel 3a: Like unheard of. That's a lot. Yeah, so that's I've given her space. I know you know she's trying to get into Berkeley, so

178
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that's cool.

179
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:11.610
Pixel 3a: You know she's very smart, she's going to be a doctor psychology of all things, too. And I'm like, Oh my God, you would think.

180
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.410
Pixel 3a: You know,

181
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.300
Pixel 3a: As we all be in my life. Right. Like, and she's going into psychology, like she know what she's doing. You know,

182
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's great because when you go through some of the courses and some of the materials and you write your papers you do start self reflecting

183
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.440
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

184
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean you do start seeing things you know that you're reading about and that you're working on within yourself. And it's kind of amazing because it's like this big, huge pattern of growth that happens.

185
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, in order, I mean,

186
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just takes time.

187
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:57.390
Pixel 3a: Yeah, just, I just want my baby back. I know it'll never be the same, though. That's what hurts, because we were like we were just like randomly, like, oh,

188
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:14.730
Pixel 3a: I don't know, we'd make fun of for everything was funny. We'd love to tell me everything, everything. And now, like nothing, absolutely nothing like well and we went to her therapy class one day or her therapy session, she invited me to go one day.

189
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:30.300
Pixel 3a: Mm hmm. And it was like, No, like she was making up or not making up because that's how she feels but like I don't can explain like she thought I had a problem with her and her girlfriend, I guess, but

190
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.310
Pixel 3a: I have no no they never I've always known since she was little.

191
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:42.510
Pixel 3a: Yeah, you know, I've always known. It wasn't a big deal. I don't care. You know, my whole family's gay. You know, that's like, whatever.

192
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:52.980
Pixel 3a: And I used to be like on their anniversary, give them my card to go out to dinner to a nice place. You know, I've always embracing so I don't know why she thought that that's what's so weird.

193
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You guys didn't talk about it in depth in therapy.

194
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.530
Pixel 3a: No, she

195
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:08.730
Pixel 3a: Know, she just the therapist was like see your mom has no problem with her. She's happy for you have some happy for her. She's happy. I'm happy, you know,

196
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:21.300
Pixel 3a: I thought was odd. I was like, wait, you thought I wasn't happy for you and your relationship like that's it's really weird. So I've always embraced in a high give her hugs and but that girl just doesn't like me.

197
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.430
Pixel 3a: You know, I don't know why.

198
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.410
Pixel 3a: No.

199
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you don't know what she's actually putting in your daughter's head.

200
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.780
Pixel 3a: Yes, there's something though.

201
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:39.180
Pixel 3a: And like she doesn't want me. She doesn't like Richard and she doesn't want us together, but she doesn't want us working out our relationship which

202
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.410
Pixel 3a: Like I said, beaten, psychology, you would think that for my daughter sick our baby that we would work it out, you know, she doesn't want to go to counseling.

203
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.820
Pixel 3a: just weird. I don't know.

204
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.640
Pixel 3a: Hmm.

205
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And she's never brought up any issues where she doesn't want you and your partner together.

206
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:06.210
Pixel 3a: No, that's what I thought of that more. Did you ever make you feel uncomfortable as ever done anything because I in a split second would be

207
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:12.300
Pixel 3a: Done, you know, and she know and I was like, well then, what is wrong because you just mean to me.

208
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:30.720
Pixel 3a: But how it's all started because my she's she was the baby, my best friend. So she was spoiled, we'd have to do nothing. So when he moved in. He started implementing chores and her chores for sit through all the kitchen trash that my five year old can do that.

209
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:39.270
Pixel 3a: You would be so she didn't want to do it. And then we would, you know, keep on her about doing it, she would get mad at us.

210
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.730
Pixel 3a: And so then she took it on him like he's the one God forbid is making me do these tours.

211
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.310
Pixel 3a: Throwing the trash.

212
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

213
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.400
Pixel 3a: It's like, that's crazy to me.

214
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.200
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

215
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.210
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

216
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.260
Pixel 3a: But it was a fact is that we were making her do it you know

217
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.210
Pixel 3a: So she was mad.

218
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.660
Pixel 3a: So it's just crazy.

219
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's gonna take a little while for her to be able to grow up in and understand it. You know what I mean.

220
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. And there's that whole piece of jealousy. Now she's not number one anymore.

221
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you know i mean

222
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:23.310
Pixel 3a: Yeah, I think that had to choose just twisting in her head, making it more than what it is you know

223
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:32.790
Pixel 3a: Yeah, cuz he's my number one like it was, she was, she was my I know I shouldn't have favorites but you know she was my daughter. We were so close.

224
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.310
Pixel 3a: Anyway,

225
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.500
Pixel 3a: Maybe we'll be able to

226
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:47.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It will, and maybe you know later on when she's grown up a mouth and understands a little bit that you know you guys will get back to the place where it'll be a different relationship that

227
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.480
Pixel 3a: It'll never be the same.

228
00:19:50.610 --> 00:20:06.330
Pixel 3a: That's her. She told my son that her fear is that when she moves out that we're never going to speak again like ever like not have any relationship at all. And I'm like, why would she think that like she's the one that's pulling away from me, you know,

229
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:06.660
Yeah.

230
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.450
Pixel 3a: No.

231
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kids, they don't come with books.

232
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.050
Pixel 3a: I know

233
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:27.030
Pixel 3a: It's funny because I couldn't wait for my kids to grow up because I thought all you know that was a young mom and I was like, oh my god, this is a lot of work. I couldn't wait for them to be independent and grown up and it seems like it's more work.

234
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.500
Pixel 3a: Yeah, older they get

235
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.320
Pixel 3a: Better when they were being nice.

236
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

237
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: newsflash when they turn 18 days. It's like, that's not the end of it.

238
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.030
Pixel 3a: So,

239
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.900
It's not

240
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.540
Pixel 3a: Anyway,

241
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.680
Definitely

242
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.000
Pixel 3a: So,

243
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How is everything going with you and your partner.

244
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:58.380
Pixel 3a: No, no, he's here. I hope I don't want. That's why I'm in the garage. I just feel like he's just so grumpy and negative all the time, you know,

245
00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.790
Pixel 3a: And it's like, I can't

246
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:08.160
Pixel 3a: I just, I'm just not happy. I want to make it work, because I love them and I want to make it for my daughter, but it's like

247
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.620
Pixel 3a: So negative and even my sister called me because we had my daughter's birthday.

248
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:30.480
Pixel 3a: And she said, You know, I just need to tell you this, don't hate me and I said what she goes, he just looked so miserable like every little thing that you know you were all happy, try to make it happy and you know he was just so down and he has a lot of CDs and stuff. So like

249
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.930
Pixel 3a: If it's too noisy with kids, he is or he's like a grumpy old man.

250
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:43.770
Pixel 3a: He's just grumpy all the time is always negative. And then when I'm trying to talk about something going on with me, he twists it to bring it to him.

251
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:53.220
Pixel 3a: You know, like, I'm just, can I have, can I talk about something with me. You know, like for instance I was talking about this work. This new job.

252
00:21:54.180 --> 00:22:01.020
Pixel 3a: And I was just like concerned, like, oh, I'm going to be working the night that I was what I was trying to tell you, like how first supposed to be lunch and

253
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:11.430
Pixel 3a: And then he was like, Oh, well that's not gonna work out for me that's gonna be hard for me because I work early in the morning and have to take your analysis like I didn't even get to finish my story and you already bring it back to yourself.

254
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.920
Pixel 3a: You know it's sad.

255
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.750
Pixel 3a: Because I just want someone I can like how I can talk to you. I would feel like.

256
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.930
Pixel 3a: I can talk to him like that. He's my partner.

257
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. Yeah, it's

258
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.100
Pixel 3a: With everything

259
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hence why you guys are separated right now.

260
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.500
Pixel 3a: Yes, exactly. And then he wants to move in already

261
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.320
Pixel 3a: And I'm like, but it's like

262
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.350
Pixel 3a: It'll just be back to the same because he hasn't done no effort to change nothing

263
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:55.050
Pixel 3a: You know, not even counseling and he said he was going to do counseling on himself or something has to be within you. You know what I mean like you need it. Like I'm taking steps I've got myself sober, I

264
00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:04.590
Pixel 3a: I'm having therapy. You know, I'm doing what I need to do. And he's not doing anything. If anything, you sometimes tries to hinder it by offering me drink. Oh, you didn't

265
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.610
Pixel 3a: Have a drink, you know,

266
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.640
Pixel 3a: Yeah, I'm like, no, that's not

267
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.400

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Only been four weeks.

406
00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.150
Pixel 3a: Yeah, now that I think about it like that.

407
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.030
Pixel 3a: Maybe after six weeks then call

408
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.490
Pixel 3a: Well, there's nobody to call

409
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Us know when to call you got me.

410
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:22.110
Pixel 3a: Here, I don't know. So there's that. Then the filing the grievance like it's like I feel like I want to do it. But then I like what if they laughed me out of there. Like what do you can't, you know, because California is at will.

411
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.900
Pixel 3a: Employment so

412
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.060
Pixel 3a: Just don't want to

413
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.080
Pixel 3a: Call and file some new they tell me like

414
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.440
Pixel 3a: You're out of luck, you know,

415
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you feel about doing that. I mean, is it something that you really want to do and pursue or is it something that you just hurt and

416
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not sure if you want to do it.

417
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.400
Pixel 3a: I think my her is at the point is

418
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.450
Pixel 3a: I'm just, I'm pushing that away. I guess I'm blocking that out because it was so hurtful.

419
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:04.620
Pixel 3a: Mm hmm. Like, it was really, really hurtful. Now, maybe I am angry. Maybe I'm just angry. I don't know. I don't feel angry. I just feel like

420
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:17.490
Pixel 3a: Everybody like that, you know, like she's and she's always afraid of getting sued because of how she always treats people so just sometimes just want her to like learned her lesson or something like you can't treat people like that.

421
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.000
Pixel 3a: But that is the same time, I feel like

422
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.920
Pixel 3a: It's bringing too much anxiety to me. I don't know what to do.

423
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think I say that you that you table it and

424
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't want to take on more than then you can handle right now.

425
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.200
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

426
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just kind of want to

427
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, get acclimated in your new job and revisit it in a week.

428
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Give it just give yourself a little bit of time to breathe. Don't make it a priority. Make it something that you're going to

429
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about

430
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's what I was

431
00:36:53.790 --> 00:37:04.200
Pixel 3a: I was thinking I was like, you know, we bet you just forget about it and just move on with my life and you know it is what it is. It's not that it happened, but it you know life goes on.

432
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:12.330
Pixel 3a: But then at the same breath of like kicking myself. What if I could, like, you know, get something from her something not to sound all you know like a buddy.

433
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:19.530
Pixel 3a: Hear anything but like he, this will be that would help me to, you know, but I think you're right. I'm just going to

434
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:27.420
Pixel 3a: Stop. Think about that. So I think about it, almost every day because everybody's telling me you know to do it.

435
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

436
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you file a complaint with with the state.

437
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They really based off of

438
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The facts. Yeah, you know, and so when you when you win. And if you do decide to do it. You just got to make sure that you have the facts down

439
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:51.930
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

440
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you talk from a factual basis and not an emotional state.

441
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:55.710
Right, yeah.

442
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:06.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, they'll tell you on the phone, whether or not they can do anything or if they'll do anything. And then what they'll do is they'll ask for a response from her.

443
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and then evaluate you know the whole thing.

444
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:10.710
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

445
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To see what it was. What happened or why or whatever but

446
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, really, you've got enough on your plate right now to worry about.

447
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:19.620
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

448
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

449
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.150
Pixel 3a: I would just

450
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:38.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Put that aside, I would pray about it. Think about it. And, you know, in a week, revisit it and see if you still feel the same or, you know, if you want to pursue it or not, and then go, you know, do it. But, you know, especially right now with your grief and loss and everything.

451
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're experiencing.

452
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dont pile more on your plate than what you need.

453
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.010
Pixel 3a: That's what I

454
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:44.730
Mean

455
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: get acclimated in your new job. Get, get comfortable with what you're getting ready to do and it's my understanding, I could be wrong but fine dining

456
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You should be making some some pretty good tips.

457
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.990
Pixel 3a: There, how that's what they're saying.

458
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:14.700
Pixel 3a: But I made really good tips, where I worked. I mean, I would bring home I would work. Maybe like from four to eight 830 and I would make that easily two to $400 while I was

459
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working

460
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.370
Pixel 3a: You know, I mean, it was easy. Now this one is gonna be hard.

461
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.460
Pixel 3a: You know, seems like it right now but i bet you when you get in there and you start doing it, you'll see

462
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I was so worried. I

463
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, really is. Yeah.

464
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:41.130
Pixel 3a: And like I said my friend says that this company is amazing to work for. And they've been so nice. Like, I'm like shocked Mattel everybody is there because I went from one

465
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.950
Pixel 3a: Person who got to walk on eggshells all the time to

466
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:53.340
Pixel 3a: These people who seem to have your back. You know, like they want, you know, if anything, have you come here, you know, if you ever felt comfortable. I have a manager, you know, they're really

467
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:54.960
Pixel 3a: About their

468
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.260
Pixel 3a: Workers teams. Anyway, you know,

469
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is really kind of how it's supposed to be.

470
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.960
Pixel 3a: Yeah I know I'm not used to that.

471
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.080
Pixel 3a: Yeah. When you I

472
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:14.640
Pixel 3a: Mean, yeah, that's the thing they set their some really I think I'm just nervous that I won't meet their expectations but

473
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that over it.

474
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that if you weren't in this vulnerable state, you know,

475
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.080
Pixel 3a: You would know.

476
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.040
Pixel 3a: And you would do.

477
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but because you are in this sort of vulnerable state right now.

478
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Brief that's probably why but

479
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about

480
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think about your reputation because I know that in the restaurant business, your Reputation. Reputation is huge.

481
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.210
Pixel 3a: Yeah. You know, I think that's why they have such high expectations, you know,

482
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.160
Pixel 3a: So yeah, no, I know, but like, it's

483
00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:10.980
Pixel 3a: Like when I went to the interview, like I was on the phone with the mortuary people right like right in the car, trying to get my mom flown here, you know, and then I went in there and had to be, you know, so I know I could do it, you know, because I mean how can you go from that to

484
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:11.790
Yeah.

485
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:13.890
Pixel 3a: Yes.

486
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:20.610
Pixel 3a: And I did it. I know I can. But it's just, it's just a lot just going on you know like

487
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.230
Pixel 3a: Eating

488
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.880
Pixel 3a: But yesterday. Yeah, I finally had my day yesterday where I just stayed home all day. I told you last week I was going to do that.

489
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:37.140
Pixel 3a: Yes, I did it. I stayed in my pajamas. I didn't even take a shower shower, I took what today but

490
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:46.830
Pixel 3a: Hey I just stayed in I think I did take a shot. I stayed in my pajamas, the whole day and but then again, it's like Araya you know she was. She's a lot

491
00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:54.360
Pixel 3a: So whenever when I go do something at least that keeps her occupied. But since I did it. I stayed home. She was just on me all

492
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.710
So,

493
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to rest. But you really didn't get to rest.

494
00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.370
Yes.

495
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:01.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

496
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:12.330
Pixel 3a: Know, she did take a nap though for two hours, which he never takes naps. So she took a two hour nap, which is amazing. I got to watch reality show. So really happy.

497
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.480
Pixel 3a: That he woke up, she didn't go to sleep till midnight.

498
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.700
Pixel 3a: Because, because that that

499
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:24.600
Pixel 3a: I gave her a nice lavender bath. I did everything I haven't used essential oil.

500
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:33.480
Pixel 3a: I gave her lavender bubble bath. I gave her the lavender baby lotion man just central oils.

501
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.250
Pixel 3a: That she's taking them till midnight.

502
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.380
Pixel 3a: This little girl. She's very hyper

503
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you gotta have some kind of respite or reprieve

504
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean you have to

505
00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to provide yourself with self care, we can you know you can provide all the care in the world to your babies. But unless you're giving it to yourself to

506
00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.280
I know

507
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.020
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

508
00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.610
Pixel 3a: I will well. Like right now I get to

509
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't have reply. We doggy.

510
00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:09.480
Pixel 3a: Last week she was

511
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about are you what time does she normally go to sleep.

512
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:28.620
Pixel 3a: Well see, when we were when my husband was living here. She had a bedtime at 730 she went to bed at 730 we have a schedule, you know,

513
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:38.880
Pixel 3a: Since he's left. It's just, she just she's been. She has such bad anxiety. Now because her dad left and then I went to Oregon for three days.

514
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:46.290
Pixel 3a: So she had, you know, she's, she's always been around us, because we live together and she'd never been away from us.

515
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:55.020
Pixel 3a: So I think it just freaked her out. So now she's just she doesn't go to sleep, she normally will fall asleep, like 930 or 10

516
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

517
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.130
Pixel 3a: But it varies between nine to 12

518
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.470
Pixel 3a: And no nap.

519
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.210
How's that possible.

520
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.310
Pixel 3a: Is to

521
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The resilient, that's for sure.

522
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:14.190
Pixel 3a: I'm like, I don't understand you have no nap. Like, and you're still up and then she'll wake up at the same time.

523
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What how long has he been out of the house.

524
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.600
Pixel 3a: The day before on Christmas Eve.

525
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:25.590
So,

526
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Three months.

527
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, almost three months.

528
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you try to put her to bed at 730

529
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:44.340
Pixel 3a: Yeah, I was. We all every day 730 I tried to just just flow.

530
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:49.860
Pixel 3a: She just stays awake and then she'll get up and then I get angry. So I have to leave.

531
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I'll get really angry.

532
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.570
Pixel 3a: Like extremely to where I don't want to like

533
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.940
Pixel 3a: Like scream something or screen because I used to scream, a lot. My kids when they were little.

534
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:04.950
Pixel 3a: Mm hmm. Cuz I was just overwhelmed and with her. I don't

535
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.670
Pixel 3a: I've never spanked. I don't believe in spanking my kids. I've never

536
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.540
Pixel 3a: Ever, ever think

537
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.670
Pixel 3a: Not one of my kids, but I used to yell.

538
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.940
Pixel 3a: Like they would get scared, you know,

539
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.180
Pixel 3a: But, uh, with her. I don't. So I have to

540
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.870
Pixel 3a: Leave because I feel like I'm going to

541
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:22.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

542
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.090
It's so frustrating here.

543
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.640
Pixel 3a: You know, so, I believe, and then that's what she gets up and starts playing and

544
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.870
Pixel 3a: Jumping on the bed or whatever. So then I just

545
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:38.340
Pixel 3a: I give up, which I probably shouldn't because then she's winning

546
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:39.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

547
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so yeah.

548
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.620
Pixel 3a: Yeah, that's what it is. She's winning

549
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: two year olds. They're pretty smart.

550
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.240
I know

551
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.500
Pixel 3a: She wins and now she's got this new thing where

552
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.290
Pixel 3a: She starts head butting you

553
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:56.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh out

554
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:10.080
Pixel 3a: I know, but she does that, like if you hold her because she wants to go and read around wild, but sometimes they're like, No, you can't go run around wild, you know, like we're in the stores of they should just like try to head but us

555
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:17.130
Pixel 3a: He let her go like, oh my god, I'm not used to this. I never had my kids were so good.

556
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:29.700
Pixel 3a: Timing they were amazing kids. I mean, everybody's to tell me. God, your kids are so well mannered and I like to think that's because of my parenting. But then, then this one. She's just

557
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.240
Pixel 3a: I don't know if she just bought I spoil her baby because she's my last she's my baby.

558
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.120
Pixel 3a: I don't know, but she's

559
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:46.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, okay. So remember that the gap 18 years right in that 18 years you've changed a

560
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:46.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lot too.

561
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right.

562
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:55.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And so remember that that the patients and the tolerance that you had with your older kids.

563
00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It kind of goes away a little bit with the second round. You know what I mean.

564
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you have to remember that.

565
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The changes that have happened with you as well growing older. Yeah. You know what I mean.

566
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.140
Pixel 3a: It. Yeah, I feel

567
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:11.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of it.

568
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:27.570
Pixel 3a: I was way strict with my first three kids like that's why they, you know, I was scheduling, you know, because everybody's to tell me, Oh, your kids are going to end up gang members are all you know there because I was a teen mom.

569
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:33.810
Pixel 3a: And I refuse to that. Oh, no. These kids are going to be something so I devoted everything to them.

570
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:37.620
Pixel 3a: And I had a structure, you know, like I was very structured with them.

571
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:49.140
Pixel 3a: To wear with a riot. I don't. I'm more like she gets away with everything you know like my poor son my oldest son, he was 16 years old, he had to be home before dark.

572
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.190
16

573
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.900
Pixel 3a: Now, and I'm like, oh my god, I was so mean for mutual you know like

574
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.120
Pixel 3a: He you know like

575
00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.070
Pixel 3a: So,

576
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:09.510
Pixel 3a: Then with her, like, Sure, go ahead. I don't, I need to put that structure into her be. I just don't like to hurt her feelings, because she made

577
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:12.180
Pixel 3a: A baby you know

578
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but you think about it this way. And you know, I totally. I, I get it. I totally get it.

579
00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:26.310
Pixel 3a: And I think it is because I'm older. Like, I don't want I don't have the

580
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:30.030
Pixel 3a: Paint. I don't have, like, I'm just like, just, you know,

581
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

582
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.580
Pixel 3a: Cuz I'm more tired now.

583
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.750
Pixel 3a: For I was young, that I could keep up with them. Yeah, so

584
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

585
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:47.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It happens. And then on top of it. Don't forget that, you know, she also has autism, right.

586
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:53.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is twice as challenging as a child without autism.

587
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that piece to

588
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.740
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

589
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I mean,

590
00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.990
Pixel 3a: It's crazy, because she she. It's what sounds and lights.

591
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.910
Pixel 3a: Next, you get so like you can't go into somewhere like

592
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.850
Pixel 3a: That loud, you know,

593
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.760
Pixel 3a: That's challenging

594
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so it's a double talent.

595
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:15.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

596
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would definitely be easier if she didn't have it. But she does. And so you're you're double challenge there.

597
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On top of being you know 18 years older. So

598
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:28.410
Yeah.

599
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to give yourself.

600
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The breathing room in this too. And this is why you know again having that conversation with your partner and just saying I gotta have I need some meantime

601
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.630
Pixel 3a: I know I have

602
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.680
Pixel 3a: You know, I tell them all the time.

603
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:53.280
Pixel 3a: That his, his answer is, okay, I'll go over, but it's the same, you know,

604
00:49:54.270 --> 00:50:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when he comes over, have you thought about being ready to to leave to go someplace.

605
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:06.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And say, Okay, I'll be back a couple hours you have fun.

606
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:17.520
Pixel 3a: Yeah, yeah. And he would I know he would be fine with that. But I would just how I've been asked. I told him no pay for a hotel for him because he's doing with his parents.

607
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:32.850
Pixel 3a: I was like, I'll pay for a hotel. Just take the baby for one night, you know, so it could have breathing, but he thinks I'm joking. I guess, cuz I'm not like a hotel for me, you know, hotel.

608
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:35.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For one night.

609
00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.230
Pixel 3a: Just one day, just one night.

610
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

611
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:43.530
Pixel 3a: Because it's it's a law. It's a lot. She's always like

612
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe that's the idea.

613
00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:47.550
Now,

614
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:49.560
Pixel 3a: We'll try

615
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

616
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.300
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

617
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One night just one night, get a massage, relax.

618
00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.020
Yeah.

619
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.980
Pixel 3a: I'll see. I'll try again.

620
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, I would. I mean, if I was in your shoes. That's kind of how I would approach it. I would just say, okay, so, you know, I know that you're willing to come over here and sit with her, but this is what I'm going to make plans for me to be able to go be with me for a little bit.

621
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: took care of me 24 hours you come over you be with the baby. I'll know she's safe, then I'll be able to relax a little bit

622
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, just kind of lay out

623
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A game plan for him and say these are my expectations.

624
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you meet them. You know what to do and take it. Just take, even if it's a half a day. You know what I mean, but be able to take some time for you, for you to breathe. Eat arrest. You know what I mean.

625
00:51:48.210 --> 00:52:01.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's important self care is one of the most vital important things. I know. Yes. When you're not taking care of yourself, your, your, your patients is less

626
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For sure. Right.

627
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:07.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah, with a baby, your emotions are crazier.

628
00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's hard to get a handle on them. And so it's a vital part of recovering from trauma grief and loss and in recovery, you know, general, these are like huge pieces that have to be taking care of

629
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your. Number one, you have to be number one. No.

630
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:28.380

643
00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:05.070
Pixel 3a: It was really good. I had a massage with the feet scrub and a facial and I liked it a lot. So I think I want to go get a facial

644
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just something that says, you know, I need to take care of me and that little bit of reprieve helps so much

645
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.040
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

646
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.120

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Richer it's an investment. It's an investment. Right. Yeah, if you think about it in that way. It's an investment.

650
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's an investment into your daughter into your daughter's care into your daughter's future into your future with your daughter, but really it's an investment.

651
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:50.850
Pixel 3a: Yeah, because it's true, like with everything my my patience has been so like a trigger. You know, switch like anything, even with with my husband, like, he'll say something and then I just get so angry because like

652
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.990
Pixel 3a: I just want I don't know, like, listen to me. You know, so I need to work on that.

653
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, having

654
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:02.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Expectations.

655
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For somebody that you have already had experience with it's unable to give you what you need. You know what I mean.

656
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is a setup. That's just a setup you set yourself up for failure.

657
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:30.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you know what I mean taking back any expectations as far as him being able to meet your needs and finding other avenues to be able to get your needs met, such as in therapy or have

658
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:40.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your aunt that went to your mom's with you being able to connect with her and spend time even if it's out to lunch or a cup of coffee, but

659
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.250
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

660
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just something for you to get you time, you know,

661
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.350
Pixel 3a: Yeah, I'll try that. Let's say you have the baby and just run

662
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:57.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just say, I'll be back. You know, I need, I need. I've been telling you and telling you and telling you I need me time, I really need me time

663
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:02.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, and just being able to do it. And I bet you he would be shocked, too.

664
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

665
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it seems to me like at this point he needs a little bit of shock.

666
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:11.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To realize that he's you know that if things don't change.

667
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, that his you know his partner needs needs things and he's got to be able to provide that

668
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

669
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.030
Pixel 3a: Yeah, right.

670
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:33.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you're taking care of yourself. You're taking better care of yourself and you're investing in yourself and you know your

672
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:39.660
Pixel 3a: Know,

673
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happens because you're investing within you, your self esteem gets raised your self worth gets raised, and then he watches that you know what I mean. And he gets to a point where they get to the point where they're like, I don't want to lose that

674
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What does. I need to do. You know what I mean.

675
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And maybe, just maybe,

676
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it might get him motivated to be able to do something, but right now it's like he he probably knows that.

677
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're having a hard time with the baby in that you need him, and it's

678
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:26.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Easier to just confirm. Yeah, it's easier just conform, you know, for you to conform to you know him and deal with the misery. But in reality, you know, the misery is felt all around.

679

Pixel 3a: Be kind of. I know.

690
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:06.180
Pixel 3a: For real. Seriously. So say it always give, give, give, give, give, when am I going to have mine, you know,

691
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:15.840
Pixel 3a: Yeah, that to Richard earlier, the same planet. So I tried to be a good person. I try to do everything right and it's like why do I keep getting shit on sorry about my language. But, you know,

692
00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.100
Pixel 3a: That's how you feel.

693
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:18.720
Pixel 3a: You know, it's like, oh,

694
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you ever heard that saying we teach people how to treat us

695
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:24.810
Yeah.

696
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:26.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So think about that.

697
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:27.960
Yeah.

698
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:41.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In this context of what we're talking about, you know, we can say whatever it is that we need to say, and it probably gets fallen on deaf ears. But when our actions start backing that up.

699
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:44.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, then people realize that we're serious

700
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

701
00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:51.780
Pixel 3a: That's what it is falling on deaf ears, nothing's changing three months.

702
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.210
Pixel 3a: Yeah, exactly the same.

703
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.880
Pixel 3a: So, yeah.

704
00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.010
Pixel 3a: Oh,

705
00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:06.120
Pixel 3a: Yeah. Everything you're saying it's so funny, like my sister was saying the same thing. We've had this whole time. You know, so

706
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you'll know again you'll know when you're ready to have that talk with him to figure out what direction you're going. You'll know when you're ready, but

707
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:22.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't have to be today doesn't have to be tomorrow. It's going to be on your terms.

708
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you're ready.

709
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I would just suggest really start investing a little bit of time into yourself right now.

710
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that you, you know, can figure it out, you're starting a new job tomorrow.

711
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you and you're gonna rock it.

712
00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.860
Pixel 3a: I hope so.

713
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're gonna rock it.

714
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:57.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got that, you know, right now. That's the first and foremost thing that you've got to do without that, you know, and I would just focus on on that and focus on, you know, giving yourself some self care and

715
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go from there.

716
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.970
Pixel 3a: Okay and I'm gonna just table the whole

717
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.490
Pixel 3a: Labor Board thing for now because that's what I feel like is driving me crazy.

718
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.460
Pixel 3a: Because I'm not that way, either, you know,

719
00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:16.860
Pixel 3a: Like I don't I don't like to be vindictive or like to hurt her. You know what I mean. So it's

720
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.360
Pixel 3a: bothering me a lot.

721
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:20.010
To even

722
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:29.700
Pixel 3a: Think about doing that to her, you know, because I like i said i I did love her. You know what I mean. So it's like, I don't want to do that.

723
00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:31.620
Pixel 3a: So,

724
00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then don't

725
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.580
Pixel 3a: Table that for yeah I think I'm just gonna because that's been

726
00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:52.560
Pixel 3a: Giving me like so much anxiety. I can't stop thinking about it, you know, because I've been kind of. I just think the big thing. So I can't sleep because I'm too busy thinking about that, you know, I'm like, Oh, I just don't want to think about it anymore. I just want to go move on and

727
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You ever heard of a

728
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you ever heard of a god box.

729
00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, so I learned this 20 years ago in early recovery where things that you ruminate about things that you are stressed about and ruminate about you write them down.

730
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:28.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You put them in a box like you can go. I went made it a cool little wooden box and I wrote down all of my worries, put them in the box left them alone and committed myself to not thinking about them for 30 days, you can do that with this situation seven days.

731
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:37.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Write it down, put it someplace safe and don't even think about it for seven days every time you find your mind going back to it changes your thought process.

732
01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:38.460
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

733
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know something else, but give yourself a reprieve from the stress that it's called

734
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:50.670
Pixel 3a: Yes, it's causing a lot. Yeah, I think I'm going to do that for sure because it's an EDM BB sick to my stomach.

735
01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you got to get away, get away from it, you've got enough going on right now.

736
01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.920
Pixel 3a: Yes, I know.

737
01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:58.200
Pixel 3a: I'm going to do that.

738
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just give yourself a break with it. Yeah.

739
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:09.360
Pixel 3a: But I think that's what's been bothering me more than what mean everything else. But on top of everything else you know that's been

740
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

741
01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting impacted. Oh.

742
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:13.650
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

743
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of makes everything else, sometimes more heavy

744
01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.870
Pixel 3a: Yeah, for sure. So I'm going to do that.

745
01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: prioritize your worries.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:27.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The last day.

749

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: wish you luck. And I do think that you're going to kill it. And I don't think

751
01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I think that after you're there for a couple days and you get their routine down. I think you're going to do great.

752
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then next week when you and I MEET YOU'RE GOING TO SAY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS all worried about because

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:07.020
Pixel 3a: Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know what I know I'll kill it. I got it, it's just scary.

759
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:08.880

762
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, time to train in each area. I think that's cool.

763
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:32.700
Pixel 3a: I know that side saying this place seems really really good. It's that's just to give you the feel of everybody's job so that way you know you respect everybody's job.

764
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:39.090
Pixel 3a: Which I find like wow, like I've never had a place like that. You know what I mean, like, that's such a

765
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:42.240
Pixel 3a: Great way of having somebody come in.

766
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.820
Pixel 3a: Just a radio like wow

767
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:46.830
Pixel 3a: You know,

768
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:50.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that is what you call it. That's what you call team building

769
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:52.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's how it should be, you know,

770
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.340
Pixel 3a: Yeah, that's what my friend said that they're really good at.

771
01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.560
Pixel 3a: So she was

772
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:03.930
Pixel 3a: Telling me about when her mom passed what they did. And I was just like, oh my god, compared to what happened with buying you know

773
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.270
Pixel 3a: Like, that's amazing. So I'm excited. I'll do good.

774
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You will

775
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.930
Pixel 3a: I'm just going to forget about that listing because that's what's been

776
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.970
Pixel 3a: Eating at me.

777
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:16.590
Pixel 3a: So,

778
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, put it up for a week.

779
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't think about it again. You know, you've got enough on your plate to worry about right now.

780
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay.

781
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:27.270
Pixel 3a: That's actually making me feel better, just thinking about not so good about it.

782
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.020
Yeah.

783
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:29.610
Pixel 3a: You know,

784
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just here's another piece of that realize that that is your decision.

785
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.180
Pixel 3a: Yeah.

786
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you choose not to do it. There's nothing wrong with that.

787
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:48.900
Pixel 3a: Yeah, I think, like, the only thing is with me. I'm like, Oh, she won or, you know, and it's just like, I just got to stop. Who cares. She's not going to be in my life anymore. You know what I mean.

788
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:56.430
Pixel 3a: So who cares if she feels like she won or whatever, you know, because of the long run, she lost a great employee that worked very hard for company.

789
01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that means that she's not the winner.

790
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.490
Pixel 3a: Exactly.

791
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

792
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:08.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you continually treat your employees that way before long. You have no employees and the only

793
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thing that you have is

794
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:14.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bad employees that stay because they can't get work anyplace else

795
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:24.960
Pixel 3a: Yeah, yeah. And that's how it is that the turnaround. There is insane, like the first month I work there was like four or five turnarounds like Why is he such better on here. Now I know

796
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know why.

797
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.150
Pixel 3a: You know, yeah.

798
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:30.780
Pixel 3a: Yeah, so I'm going to be much happier. I'm I know it.

799
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think so too.

800
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay.

801
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:38.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm gonna get you out of here. I already have somebody waiting in my room.

802
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.870
Pixel 3a: Oh, sorry. No.

803
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't be sorry. I'm just next week, I'll be excited to hear about, you know, your first day or your week at work, because you'll have a week under your belt.

804
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

805
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:52.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really work on just putting that other situation aside.

806
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:53.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah, and

807
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get some hours to do some self care.

808
01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.330
Pixel 3a: Okay.

809
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, that's my homework. Okay.

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.260

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hello, how are you

818
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:18.330
Jennífer castro: I'm good, how are you

819
01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good. Sorry about the weight. I was finishing up with another client ran over a little bit.

820
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This won't take very long. It is a we're going to complete a bio psychosocial and the word the actual word of it is a lot longer than what it takes to complete one so

821
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm just going to ask you a series of questions, if that's okay.

822
01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:41.490
Mm hmm.

823
01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so the first question is, what brings you to bright heart and why now.

824
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:53.520
Jennífer castro: Because I'm a heroin addict. My life is going downhill spiraling quickly.

825
01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:06.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, can you give me a little bit of you're using history like what age did you first start using any substances. What was the substance and how did it progress to where you are today.

826
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:19.410
Jennífer castro: Okay. Well, I started using math on and off. Like when I was about 15 my mom was a felt dope. So my boyfriend was my mom's connect dad or whatever, whatever.

827
01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:24.480
Jennífer castro: And he did it. And my mom. My mom gave me

828
01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.450
Jennífer castro: To get me out of her hair. I think

829
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:40.230
Jennífer castro: And I did quit when I got my pregnant with my oldest son, but my second son I used through the whole pregnancy. There's nothing wrong with them. Now, as far as I could tell I mean he's 21 now.

830
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.610
Jennífer castro: And then I didn't use until or I quit using for like six years.

831
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:54.600
Jennífer castro: Like, I think it was 26 to 2032 and then I started using again and I started using black

832
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:58.830

Jennífer castro: Yeah, I don't have a good relationship with my mom at all. So my mom's been clean now for 2020 years maybe longer than that. She's really turned her life around. I'm really proud of her about that, but she's just no mother. She's the hypocrites, you know,

884
