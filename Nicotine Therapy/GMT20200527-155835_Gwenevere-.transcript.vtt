00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: sera Nia

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.759
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.560
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.309
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk about connection for just a second. I'm in

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Outskirts of

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.379
Gwenevere Abriel: A Santa Fe, and I don't have

7
00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have much

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And that what I'm referring to is reception. So I want to show you

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is, this is what this looks like. Do you can you see this not delivered

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So although sometimes I am I can't be sure. I'm receiving messages from you. But this is I just did this morning. So I said hi I received. I can't read it backwards. But something is this text going through now there's see the red. It doesn't go through so

11
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.110
Saraniah Aston: And I

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.740
Told you.

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I also tried to call you.

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: wouldn't go through so there it's it's making it difficult to do the thing that you asked for, which was to acknowledge a message.

15
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I wasn't in Albuquerque dropping someone off at an airport and I real quick texted while I had the ability to do so. And then, of course, I didn't have it.

16
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.850
Saraniah Aston: I

17
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.640
Saraniah Aston: don't really care for any of the reasons, doesn't matter. It's fine.

18
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.430
Saraniah Aston: It is what it is.

19
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, what will you do care about right now, what's important. Let me close this door. So there's no sound.

20
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: As I'm concerned about how you're doing today and want to help if I can

21
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweetie, you can be angry, sad if you know I can take it. You can turn it against me. If you want to leave it. I just want. We've always gotten through them together. We just bring it raw.

22
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we come full circle we get through it, you and I, we do it. We've done it before. We can do it again.

23
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.620
Saraniah Aston: What do you want me to say.

24
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Your truth, honey, whatever it is. I just, I want to be here for you, even if it's anger. I want to be here.

25
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.920
Saraniah Aston: I'm tired.

26
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.900
Saraniah Aston: Really prayer.

27
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

28
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.000
Yeah.

29
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.190
Saraniah Aston: Nothing.

30
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.900
Saraniah Aston: To say so. Just ask me questions and I'll give you answers, whatever you want.

31
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm also on a laptop. So I'm going to do my best to hear your

32
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your what you're saying. I think you said you don't want to say something. You want me to just ask questions.

33
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.260
Saraniah Aston: I said something like that.

34
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. How about this one. Okay. You're doing great.

35
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so many things that have gone on without you and I meeting face to face. I don't even. I don't even know where to start.

36
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like there's so many loose ends.

37
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.450
Saraniah Aston: It's okay. I don't care anymore. Okay, I don't care.

38
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

39
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I care about you.

40
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

41
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't. It feels like a privilege, though.

42
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: To be able to do that to be in your life in some small way.

43
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a question for you.

44
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That statement. I just made.

45
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a part of you that doesn't believe that I care.

46
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. Okay. I had wondered if that might have been at the heart of it.

47
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it goes back to some disconnects over appointments. Do you think that's part of

48
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.330
Saraniah Aston: Where

49
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.880
Saraniah Aston: I think so, yeah.

50
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.840
Okay.

51
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.610
Saraniah Aston: But you know, I was told that, you know, it's all my fault. So, it's fine.

52
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't think things are like that, quite like that.

53
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But I got a sense earlier that you didn't want to go into detail. It's completely up to you. We could dive into talking about mom. But if you don't trust me, you probably won't want to do it.

54
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.820
Saraniah Aston: No, I don't.

55
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. So I feel like I need to earn your trust.

56
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.640
Saraniah Aston: I don't think that's going to happen anymore. I just want to, let's talk about drugs or whatever.

57
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Drugs. They suck and they're awesome at the same time, I don't know.

58
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: They best people lives up so I just we've been able to get through it once I give information. Do you remember any of those moments where once I kind of give another perspective, if we find our way. Do you remember any of those two

59
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.510
Saraniah Aston: Yes, I do.

60
00:05:49.140 --> 00:06:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. I actually think that we could do it again. I believe in it and you could still if you want to do you want it to like right now are you thinking, boy, I really just want a different therapist. I want to work with someone else.

61
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.960
Saraniah Aston: Basically

62
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

63
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, then how about after today, if I give it a fair shake

64
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I can, I can move forward on that. I think we're really good fit.

65
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have to respect that.

66
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.240
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

67
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.440
Okay.

68
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we'll give it will give it a shot. If I could sort of give just a couple different perspectives.

69
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know where it started. But I'm just gonna pick one and then you'll just say, oh, it started long before that, or something like that. Let me see. Now I have. I was flying. There was a near unexpected airplane ride on Monday.

70
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I texted Dr. Solomon and all my client side. Everyone reached them. But that's not where the origin. I think the origin is here. Let's go to May 20

71
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what I'm picturing on May 18 is a Monday. We're in group and

72
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you say in the in the meeting. Oh, I'll see you on Tuesday, which is the 19th

73
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: At I think you said to 10 or I'm not sure what you said no 110 as I'm always it. But I said, Oh, it's not the 19th. It's a weird day. We don't usually meet on a Wednesday. It's on a Wednesday, you said, oh, okay.

74
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.210
Or something.

75
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And and it's at 110 so we confirmed Wednesday at 110

76
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.430
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Okay.

77
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't show up at 110 you showed up it, I think.

78
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.660
Saraniah Aston: I have it written down to 10 so

79
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.550
Saraniah Aston: My dad.

80
00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me what that did to you, like how I how I lost trust because of that. How did, how did that breakdown on what did I

81
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.420
Saraniah Aston: Made me feel it's an absolute piece of shit, actually.

82
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.540
Saraniah Aston: When the girl check me in saying that the reason

83
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.630
Saraniah Aston: Is because I didn't answer.

84
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.810
Saraniah Aston: A text from the night before, confirming my appointment. That's

85
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.190
Saraniah Aston: It's like know

86
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.830
Saraniah Aston: What, how many people are going to talk with my head now.

87
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.470
Saraniah Aston: Apparently with abortion.

88
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.210
Saraniah Aston: Begins with a company

89
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, it sounds like it did, but definitely not my intention. Now you know in my texts. I'm trying to make sure that my day is full. So I have clients that are in it, so I can earn an income right

90
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do it the day before I do a courtesy text. I don't have to do that.

91
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do it for both of us. You benefit from a reminder. Everybody does.

92
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I benefit from knowing the night before, if I need to schedule someone into that slot.

93
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So it worked for everybody.

94
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard anybody say no. Don't send me those reminders everybody seems to like them.

95
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now how whoever this girl is that called you.

96
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not a coordination, whoever it was

97
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.290
Saraniah Aston: Their

98
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: bedside manner and they're

99
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.150
Saraniah Aston: Delivering Filipina chick.

100
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.750
Saraniah Aston: That usually checks me. Nobody knew

101
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.550
Saraniah Aston: But

102
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't, it didn't do a good job.

103
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not why she's wrong.

104
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's misinformation that's literally a misunderstanding. The reason was

105
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You did you showed up an hour late like I already had a fellow scheduled. You see, I'm saying I had nothing to do with that text.

106
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I really wanted to meet with you because, look, we already had stuff like that we needed to process from before that I really wanted to see you.

107
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.120
Saraniah Aston: And we really thought it was up to 10 so

108
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.110
Saraniah Aston: Again, my fault.

109
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a weird thing though certainly so we were in group and this is what I the part I don't get. And this might be because because of tele health

110
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So in grew up and we probably still have the recording. We laugh. We keep him company keeps them. I think for 30 days and I could certainly investigated, if you wanted to. I said, Okay. Oh, I just heard you say the 19th. I'm pretty sure it was something like that. Oh, wait, wait, sir.

111
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's May 20 it's a Wednesday.

112
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You acknowledged it. No, I'm trying to say like you went, Oh, I thought was interesting and I said if at 110

113
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: There was some this sort of this acknowledgement. But here's the problem with me on on my side because I don't want to be insulting to anybody, by saying

114
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you write it down.

115
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it seems so rude to say to somebody, because

116
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:53.970
Saraniah Aston: But what I found was to 10. So that's why I'm saying it's my fault. I'm not, I get it.

117
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But how did I hurt the trust, though. That's the part I don't, I don't know how I failed you.

118
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.020
Saraniah Aston: I'm like, just really trying to get in contact with you and nothing

119
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.790
Saraniah Aston: So, automatically, I assume. Oh blends historic

120
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.320
Saraniah Aston: He doesn't get angry, but is that she is

121
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.460
Saraniah Aston: Because if you weren't she had the decency to say something.

122
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:25.920
Saraniah Aston: Somebody

123
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok so this stay there for a second. That's important because you had asked for something and you were specific about it.

124
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have that I um, I thought I was so I was in session. And I was so deliberate and intentional about doing my say something with you.

125
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.350
Saraniah Aston: But

126
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, it's not over it, sir Nia you're hurting, and I think angry with me.

127
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So I will find it eventually. But what I said was

128
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in session. And then I said, I'm running a group right now. I said, things like that. I texted you back. No, you can see that technology isn't perfect, maybe you didn't receive them.

129
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I said I'm in. I said, I'm in session right now.

130
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I said later I'm in. I mean group, but

131
00:12:50.550 --> 00:13:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh here look city see luck and i'll see you Monday. Take care of Gwen. So that's one and then here's green. This is me. I wrote you back.

132
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We have an appointment at nine. Let me see.

133
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the nine o'clock one. Now, we were going to see each other on May 22

134
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote you

135
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was some content in here that I'm totally blind. I don't know what I again that's look how complicated this is just in talking with someone face to face.

136
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you already know I'm not going to navigate that inside of a text.

137
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to go into because I what I wanted to write as, you know, I don't know what you're referring to.

138
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm sorry. You're hurting. Like, that's not going to work in a text, there's

139
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just doesn't work.

140
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't feel acknowledged and I get that.

141
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Says, I'm in group, we have a 9am individual therapy tomorrow. Can we meet, then this was Thursday.

142
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We're asking to meet

143
00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Lost

144
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much time has passed. It's hard for me to pull out the kind of facts of it.

145
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But you felt very dismissed.

146
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry I let you down.

147
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe, and I really wanted to meet with you that that second time the week. I thought we had a great plan together.

148
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting worse.

149
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.350
Yeah.

150
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

151
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You had some excitement

152
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: About having her backdrop

153
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mannequin in

154
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.100
Saraniah Aston: My business.

155
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: are so good at it.

156
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What can I do

157
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Did someone say you couldn't do it, or I mean you already know you sell things you're good at it.

158
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.810
Saraniah Aston: So,

159
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.600
Saraniah Aston: This is

160
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.530
Saraniah Aston: I give up.

161
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember you and I talked about keeping your eye on the goal.

162
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I on getting your daughter's here. And then along the way.

163
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There's going to be distractions that pull

164
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Your attention away.

165
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But then ultimately

166
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.590
Saraniah Aston: The most of

167
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Us getting hurt.

168
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:10.140
Saraniah Aston: anymore. I don't care anymore.

169
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this one of this, you're feeling kind of hopeless right now.

170
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.630
Saraniah Aston: Of course they do.

171
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is there a thought that is different than when we last met where there was kind of like excitement about hey I've got a plan. I'm going to do these things.

172
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What changed it did mom say something that just pulled the rug out from mom or your dad or your brother.

173
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it me

174
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.070
Saraniah Aston: All the time.

175
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All the time.

176
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.220
Saraniah Aston: And then anybody, anybody

177
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:12.630
Saraniah Aston: Moodle. And then to feel like, Oh, I did something wrong. So that's why I speak English for it. That's exactly how it feels.

178
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, can make some

179
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.500
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, falling apart.

180
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Sardinia. If you only knew

181
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth is inside my mind. I love the idea of being able to see you twice a week, and I wish, I wish you were like, I wish I was a night person or I wish you were a morning person, so that you and I, we could be three times if there was money for it. I want to be here for you.

182
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I just don't know how to do it. Because sometimes it's not made a mistake. So in here, you're not bad or wrong. I forget things too.

183
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes you can't attend sessions like that thing that happened. That's a simple human error.

184
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: A one from and who knows if you heard it through zoom

185
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You just, you just got muted to because someone probably texted, or tried to call you just now.

186
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're muted.

187
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: on my side.

188
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your lady I

189
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I think we've got what it takes, because I want to be here and I think just more when you said I want more services.

190
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I about about every three days. Someone just texted you again.

191
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone wants to get a hold of you.

192
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.920
Saraniah Aston: I got you, I got you. I got

193
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: sarnie I don't look at you, the way you look at you. I don't see you the same way I see you as a woman.

194
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Who wants to get into her strength wants to enjoy her natural talents wants to get her daughter here safe and enjoy being a mama. That's what I see. I am not angry with you. You're my client, I wouldn't be angry with you.

195
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Agree.

196
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I totally get that it seems like it and the punishment piece. Maybe it's a

197
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it the medication that feels like the punishment.

198
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.980
Saraniah Aston: Or it's

199
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything.

200
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.770
Saraniah Aston: Having to deal with the people in the front desk.

201
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.780
published it.

202
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

203
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

204
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.170
Saraniah Aston: And I'm

205
00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.860
Saraniah Aston: Like weeping in front of this woman.

206
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And still, she's not careful about what she says. And it sounds like she may have

207
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Represented if you can see now. It wasn't about the the text confirmation. The night before it was about just a missed appointment. So there was she she didn't communicate it well.

208
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't call you when I'm doing this right like this with someone else because they you know they need the same thing.

209
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right undivided attention. So it's a pickle.

210
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I could have sworn that I called to

211
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:38.850
Saraniah Aston: I'd have to check your

212
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.530
Saraniah Aston: Phone on

213
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.820
Okay.

214
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I don't know what to do.

215
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.610
Saraniah Aston: Maybe there.

216
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you see if you've got some questions for me, like, like the ones you think you're not supposed to ask. Let's see, maybe

217
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you could

218
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Just ask me a real raw question like your core core question.

219
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or say something to me.

220
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, if you think you're going to leave me anyway, then what the heck am I, well let me have it.

221
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Which I'm really going to not let you go, I want to keep you but you insist. I will. I'll do it, but I'm

222
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.660
Saraniah Aston: ever speak to patients just one time.

223
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. I can help. I can help. Here we go. The answer is you. Yes, he will. And this is what it could look like. This is the quickest, easiest way to do this and I forget to mention it because I think I assume everybody knows this, but that's a great one.

224
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, sometimes I'll say, and you can ask for this also. Hey, Dr. Solomon hey clients.

225
00:22:48.210 --> 00:23:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If you guys need a breakout meeting with the doctor, let us know. Now, and he will send you a breakout invitation, you hit accept and you're going to go meet with him in a breakout meeting alone.

226
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay yes then you and then he'll say, Okay, sorry I don't forget. You've got to go back into the meeting. And then you press another button and then boom, then you're back in with the whole group.

227
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes.

228
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you can.

229
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. And people forget that. You know how it is. And they're like, bam, bam, bam. Next person next person.

230
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There's all these things to get to you. Absolutely. And so the key word is. Can I have a breakout meeting with you Dr elements. And yes, the answer is yes. And not only that, certainly if you want to schedule an appointment with him individually.

231
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: For whatever amount of time just say, Hey. Hey Doc, I want to schedule a one on one appointment with you.

232
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.720
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

233
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Do both

234
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel a little better.

235
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.450
Saraniah Aston: No.

236
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I was hoping I'd be a useful piece of information.

237
00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.760
Saraniah Aston: Or it is. I appreciate

238
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there more

239
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.410
Saraniah Aston: It's just that I told my entire family that I give up.

240
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.110
Saraniah Aston: Now I don't want to give up. I don't want to see me.

241
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.920
Saraniah Aston: Try good

242
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.620
Saraniah Aston: Boy, you idiot.

243
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

244
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not an idiot. Just getting back on track know this is hard work.

245
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This opiate is no joke. It's a tough one to kick. I gotta tell you, it wants to hang on tight. This is hard work you're doing. And this stuff that you and I do this is, this is only for

246
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong people to be able to talk directly to me the way you do this takes strength. Not everybody can do this the way you're hanging onto yourself right now.

247
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that. Do you know that strength that it takes you think all your friends could talk directly to the therapist and basically say, I don't want to work with you.

248
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And and let and be direct like that.

249
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's your power.

250
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have what it takes, and I miss you.

251
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I got scared. I was scared. I was so scared. Today, Sonia. I was like,

252
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, she's not going to be here. She's not going to be here. So I'm gonna be here, so I'm checking in a virtual clinic is she there she there she there.

253
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't reach you, of course, right, because I'm thinking, and then I get this thing from you and and like maybe she will reach me. And so then I try. And then, of course, that didn't work. But I was in there asking about you.

254
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so glad you're here.

255
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you're not going to look like a fool. You're not going to look like that.

256
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And remember, it doesn't really matter. They're going to formulate their own opinion of what they think. No, it doesn't matter what you do.

257
00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

258
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: In the end, aren't they just going to make up some story.

259
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's most important what you think of you.

260
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.940
Saraniah Aston: I had an order a sale and I

261
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:25.830
Saraniah Aston: I had this printer and I wouldn't work and my brothers really good with printers and stuff like that. And I'm just sitting there like an hour struggling to get it to work.

262
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:38.280
Saraniah Aston: And my mom told me your brother said he would help. So I go over there and I sit down and I wait for him to help. I don't want to ask. I don't want to ask anything

263
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:55.620
Saraniah Aston: And I was waiting for another hour or so. And he didn't even move and I I confront it. And I asked, What the hell is wrong with it. And he said, No one asked me in the first place if I could help.

264
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:56.670
Saraniah Aston: So,

265
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.160
Saraniah Aston: It was my mom like again.

266
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.300
And

267
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:09.180
Saraniah Aston: But also it's him just can you see that struggling, like, and I'm drying so are

268
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.420
Saraniah Aston: So easy real

269
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.880
Saraniah Aston: But for me it's not

270
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.650
Saraniah Aston: So I can put the order and you

271
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: owe money. No.

272
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

273
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to remind you remind you, we want you to ask us, you're not a burden. We want to hear your questions. Your question just now about the doctor and a breakout meeting.

274
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so reasonable he helped me hey bro. Can you help me with my printer mom said that you were interested in helping and he would look at you sideways and say yeah mom never talked to me about it and then you go, oh,

275
00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my mom up to her gaslighting and or nonsense posture and nonsense. Well, aside from that, you know, her mom is I got my I got my first order and I'm so excited about it. But it really need help with this printer but sitting here trying to solve it.

276
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweetheart, ask us

277
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask us ask your questions are completely reasonable you have not asked one question, not of me not of doctrine. It is reasonable.

278
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean it.

279
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're right. So you hold back from asking what you maybe if you gave yourself permission to ask the world to be there for you and ask for little things. It might have gone

280
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, Hey, do you have time to help me with my printer in the next hour or so but you deprive yourself of that. And then guess what you ended up doing, what the hell you see I'm suffering. Why don't you see then it's that

281
00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But the first one, the one that came naturally to like I'm so frustrated. I wish I knew more about computers and printers, or whatever.

282
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.540
Um,

283
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We like helping. Look, I have a skill set and assuring computers and when it comes to data, those people that know about technology.

284
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: They get to feel smart when we ask them for help, they get to feel smart.

285
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And let them, let them do that. He gets to be of service, you've done plenty for him. He gets to enjoy helping you.

286
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Given that opportunity.

287
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

288
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Was good to help someone and by asking for help. It gives them permission.

289
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They get to enjoy being the helper.

290
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But no, we won't naturally see how stressed, you are. And this is probably the big piece.

291
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know if you'll be able to come and take that in

292
00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It may be really obvious to you how under stress, you are and how much help. And what you need. We on the outside. We don't actually know.

293
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But

294
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I do I'm there for the appointments. I mean, it's pretty rare that I did the thing I did on Monday.

295
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I keep them as best I can.

296
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Really wanted to see you. Because it sounded like we could pull this off twice a week. That's group. I thought it was going to be cool.

297
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you think it's okay for you to ask for help.

298
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.620
Saraniah Aston: To ask my brother through

299
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Anybody, we could go with your brother. Sure.

300
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:48.390
Saraniah Aston: Because I was sitting there in front of him for an hour's Wrigley. And he knew it.

301
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.260
Saraniah Aston: So at that point.

302
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.220
Saraniah Aston: I just

303
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.280
Saraniah Aston: See here that he doesn't want it because he sees

304
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.160
Saraniah Aston: He sees me for a

305
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Short term yet. Listen, honey.

306
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: He is the son of the same mother.

307
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost major go nuts.

308
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: He's the son of the same mother. You think he's not sitting there going like this.

309
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: She can fucking ask me for help. She better just asked me directly. That's one version. We don't know what's going on in his head.

310
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: He going through his own thing like

311
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I'm so sick and tired of people making me guess how they're feeling I'm not

312
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. He could be doing all kinds of who knows what in his head.

313
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That stuff he's working on. It's not intended, just to hurt you and let you down.

314
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know he's struggling

315
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.700
Saraniah Aston: When we're done. I don't want to like

316
00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:58.680
Saraniah Aston: Oh,

317
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just, you're just text him.

318
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

319
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All I'm doing right now is just kind of throwing out

320
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We never really know what's going on in someone's

321
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:13.830
Head.

322
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We do our best. We have this capacity as humans for empathy, but we never we can never really mind read

323
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would have been nice to have been rescued in that moment.

324
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were so

325
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.090
Saraniah Aston: Frustrated with

326
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.510
Saraniah Aston: Me that no one will help me.

327
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.970
Saraniah Aston: Building my entire family is about

328
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.570
Saraniah Aston: Just watching each other, suffer.

329
00:32:53.070 --> 00:33:06.300
Saraniah Aston: And especially my dad, he got in my face. The other day I was having an argument with my mother, and he got about three inches in front of my face. And again, same nasty I the

330
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.040
Saraniah Aston: Kid.

331
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.680
Saraniah Aston: Really and

332
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.860
Saraniah Aston: My mother just was angry at me. So she just last

333
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Year.

334
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.860
Saraniah Aston: I wrote them a letter.

335
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:30.150
Saraniah Aston: About my pain and then I wrote about what I saw my dad. I looked at him.

336
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.450
Saraniah Aston: And now he's completely ignoring me even though

337
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.550
Saraniah Aston: Our family, the way it is. We basically kill each other. And then we get over it on

338
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.640
Saraniah Aston: But for him.

339
00:33:49.320 --> 00:34:10.170
Saraniah Aston: It's like, oh, I would die offending his ego or something. And now he completely ignores me, I yesterday I walked into my I rubbed his shoulders like you daddy. I don't I don't say, Daddy, I did it. And he just completely, completely ignored me I could feel

340
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:18.330
Saraniah Aston: He was just, it was like you grossed out and

341
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.430
Saraniah Aston: He's just a bastard manipulator.

342
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:37.290
Saraniah Aston: And he was taking around for a while and now he's getting off it, and it seems like he's getting a clear back or something like that.

343
00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.250
Saraniah Aston: Is nastiness and started out

344
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:48.810
Saraniah Aston: At

345
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.960
Saraniah Aston: Just done like

346
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

347
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just wish you were surrounded by loving kind people

348
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:10.710
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, me too.

349
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So looking forward to to this idea of you, right, I mean, you've got an order and you know all that was was we didn't double check the printer.

350
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And then family dynamics happened but this has nothing to do with your work. You are a badass when it comes to the selling of these clothes. We just needed a skill set.

351
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Up on you, it's right, it's right there. It's just I swear your thing is like right around the corner.

352
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting this business going, which you're already. It's already was already moving forward. The universe said yes, yes, yes.

353
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, man.

354
00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I was a little voice in your head, and you could remember what would Wednesday I brother right now I

355
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Wish I could be a little voice in your head. It would assure you that it's really truly okay to ask a direct question for help. Hey, can you help me with my

356
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Printer. I just got my

357
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Order and I'm so excited.

358
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: let him answer. He's accountable for his response. Maybe he wants to be a turkey and be passive aggressive and withhold HELP AND GUESS WHAT BUSINESS, BUT YOU COULD class. I wish I was a little voice in your head.

359
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.550
Saraniah Aston: Afraid. As a result, I don't really get worth it.

360
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.090
Saraniah Aston: I feel worthless to

361
00:36:52.140 --> 00:37:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, I couldn't do what you're doing. That is not true. You know exactly what you want to do, you do it and it got done that we are supposed to know there's whole technical fields on how to operate those stupid machines. They've got job titles and they're paid a bunch of money.

362
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not supposed to know everything about everything in this life, maybe we get really good at one or two things. Well, aren't we amazing and rock stars.

363
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: GOOD AT EVERYTHING. That's why we have each other to you've got this this skill set. I've got this skill set will help you do this, do that.

364
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, supposed to be awesome and everything, but your family. Don't you were asking from a family member and guys have this kind of right you want each other to hurt. So then there's this weird thing going on.

365
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.710
Saraniah Aston: Which gotten the way but

366
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not another value.

367
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not you

368
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Just curious, is there anyone else outside brother. Maybe, maybe.

369
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he could still get it together. We available to you if you asked.

370
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Directly to this checks you thought about, but is there anybody else that's kind of like tech savvy.

371
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Knows

372
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.320
Saraniah Aston: My father

373
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

374
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you guys

375
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.620
Saraniah Aston: Only my mom's my mom's here for

376
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:27.600
Saraniah Aston: A good hour on trying to figure it out for me. I'm sitting here wondering where's my brother.

377
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:35.490
Saraniah Aston: But didn't know that she had never asked him for help. She told me that she is like why do that.

378
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.130
Saraniah Aston: Why do you miss I'm being

379
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:39.930
Dynamic

380
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Be drama.

381
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but you have the answer. You don't have to keep asking why it's about accepting. That's what she is and you meet with me. You come in here and we can talk about how that twists to up inside

382
00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can get relief from it and you can go back to knock out your to do list and not letting the craziness saturate to your soul, keeping it at a distance you were, you were right there with it. You had an order of just like I'm so excited.

383
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I

384
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just know

385
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.610
Saraniah Aston: It was like, I wrote my own heart. What I

386
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Did but they heal.

387
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sarah Nia hearts. They do he'll they heal.

388
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You are worth it.

389
00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to text your brother something and no longer having to worry about. Why does the family do this, you already do. He told me what what's your family does. We all want to walk together suffer.

390
00:39:55.350 --> 00:40:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to analyze it anymore. That might not be the Brady Bunch family that you kind of thought it might be, but there it is and

391
00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to change it overnight.

392
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if the reality of the thing is that nobody's going to come

393
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Through my ears are messing with me. Nobody's going to come. This is the hard part to swallow for all of us, by the way, no one's going to come and rescue me

394
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to speak.

395
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It may seem abundantly obvious somebody rescue me. I'm in so much distress somebody

396
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a risk asking

397
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Risk it

398
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.440
Saraniah Aston: Support

399
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh.

400
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're so close.

401
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you do something today that get back back to this.

402
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Printer right there. It's right around the corner.

403
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What

404
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.010
Saraniah Aston: Would you do

405
00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now this would be me. I would get a read a temperature of my brother, I'd be like, Okay. Is he being an asshole right now. Right. I'd be like, get a temperature reading

406
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'd be able to use register that I'd be like, Okay, see being passive aggressive or not. If he's not

407
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be like, hey, listen, I was expecting someone to kind of noticed that I was really upset over the printer. But mom couldn't help and I thought maybe you would notice

408
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I nobody did and how to give up for a second, but I really want this my no one was really close, but I need some help with the printer. Do you have any time today, or you could skip the whole front half

409
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And just say hey, time to look at the printer with me today. And then he'll say yes or no.

410
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you get no do not take it personally. Sometimes the universe says no, we don't sit here and analyze it. We go over too well then I'm calling tech support.

411
00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you need to text me to vent and say I fn brother is a selfish Baba, Baba, though, so

412
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you say it, and then you get back on track. And then we go into problem solving mode, then we call it the tech support. And it might just be that your printers broken and so all y'all are going through all this. And it turns out it's broke

413
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's next plan and maybe it's okay now I need money. I gotta say I gotta get a printer.

414
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:32.250
