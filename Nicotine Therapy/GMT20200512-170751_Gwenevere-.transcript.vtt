1
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.980
Lauren Anderson: Now it's the opposite direction. I don't know why it's doing that is

2
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So bizarre like

3
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.310
Lauren Anderson: Got a mind of a

4
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

5
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I just got to tell you something.

6
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're

7
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be positive, by the way.

8
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I say that just just how brave, you are

9
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know that anybody else is privileged to know what kind of courage it takes to show up here with me again.

10
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I don't know that anybody gets it. But you and I have a tiny little idea of how hard this might be to be here again with me this person. You don't even want to work with and you're here. I am just

11
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: profoundly impressed.

12
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.160
Lauren Anderson: Thank you.

13
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.180
Lauren Anderson: You know, I'm more nervous for the group's than the individual, which is kind of odd. I mean like I feel like I have to do more prepping mentally for the individual

14
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:50.670
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, but as far as actual like anxiety, like I was mentioning yesterday. It's far worse for the group like I get sweaty palms pounding heart.

15
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
Lauren Anderson: The hyperventilating to like when I was speaking yesterday, I was like, by the time I finished. I was like,

16
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.510
Lauren Anderson: You know, like I really needed to catch my breath. I hadn't been, you know, it's really difficult for me and even thinking like before one o'clock.

17
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:20.430
Lauren Anderson: The whole morning, even the whole weekend, kind of, and by Monday morning. It's really so it's a much bigger anxiety for the group, for some reason, even though it's more relaxed and not as personal intense but it's a social thing, I guess.

18
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we, if you're open to it, let's pay attention to that and see if it could feel better. Why don't we play with it a little bit. So, for example, I'm just going to throw some brainstorming ideas out. What if

19
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You knew in in the group itself that you could remember how we do that in in this session before where you were on your kind of come off the screen. What if you knew that you could you could be WAY ON THE OUTSIDE UNTIL YOUR HEART RATE came down

20
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.780
Lauren Anderson: You mean when I'm actually

21
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Speaking, you could. This is, this is what I'm inviting

22
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That when you start to think about, hey, I have to go to group and maybe it's Sunday night or even Saturday, you think, oh no, and the heart rates and there's some anticipation about it. What if you knew that when you log into group. You do. You can literally be off to the side in the video.

23
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.680
Lauren Anderson: Like where they can't see me.

24
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah.

25
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.670
Lauren Anderson: Okay, yeah.

26
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.730
Lauren Anderson: I said I am there and I'm present. I mean, I'm, you know,

27
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

28
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So because I want you to progressively see your heart rate go down. I want to do that experiment with you. It's such a cool thing. We have this thing where you can

29
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Still be there but not be there. It might turn the intensity down so that, let's say you do that for 510 minutes or something. Let's say you're in there. Let's say you see the doc and you go, Hey doc okay and and i say i say Dr Arielle

30
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We're refining it. You'll have to tell me what would be good. And I say, Dr. Gabriel, we're doing, we're doing a little experiment.

31
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll tell me what you want me to say and not want me to say. So I'm just going to throw out one idea which is Hey doc.

32
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Lauren feels sort of this elevated stress response and even thinking about being here in group, she were doing an experiment to see if she can regulate off screen bringing heart rate down

33
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To a point where she can start to come a little closer into the screen and win her heart rate goes down. She's going to experiment.

34
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: With leaning on a little bit more so that she can progressively approximate

35
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what is it is it is it she catches a glimpse of herself or she see someone moving quickly but she's going to do some experimenting and I would say, Hey doc. Are you okay with that. I know she's gonna say yes.

36
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm

37
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.840
Lauren Anderson: Just gonna present like a step by step, trying to acclimate

38
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:08.820
Lauren Anderson: Social without the physical negative physical response. You know what I noticed in group that's kind of cool though that I think it's helped helping me socially, a little bit.

39
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.830
Lauren Anderson: Is

40
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:27.000
Lauren Anderson: The fact that it's video somehow a little bit is helping me not go on and on and on and on and on. And the fact we're waiting and listening to other people's responses. I don't know. It's just even in my own responses. It's helping me

41
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.740
Lauren Anderson: Synthesize it break it.

42
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.250
Lauren Anderson: condense it put in more. You know what I mean.

43
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:56.250
Lauren Anderson: More as much of the nucleus as possible of what I really want to get across. And, and also because we don't have the interrupting kind of feature where, oh, did I commenting. You know that there. I don't know. Just that little tiny added a barriers between everybody, including the mute option.

44
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:06.300
Lauren Anderson: And maybe even how you can change the option of looking where you're only looking at the person who's speaking or you can scan and you can see who all is on there.

45
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:17.370
Lauren Anderson: But both of those things, and also the thing I mentioned prior to mention the mute thing. All of us together. I think already have

46
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.930
Lauren Anderson: The experience of group. Maybe that's why I have extra anxiety about it, but it's

47
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.220
Lauren Anderson: It's already helping train me socially, but a little bit. And I've noticed that outside of group.

48
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. How so, what have you noticed

49
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.190
Lauren Anderson: But a little bit I'm

50
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.260
Lauren Anderson: Stopping I'm

51
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.120
Lauren Anderson: I'm pausing before I speak to think what I really want to say and

52
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:56.010
Lauren Anderson: To some degree, I'm able to shut up. I mean, not really. I'm still it's still a major issue for me anxiety. I just really my mouth just runs like a motor, but I just seen a little bit helping are

53
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.600
Lauren Anderson: Surprisingly, and sometimes I'm actually able to stop.

54
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

55
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.140
Lauren Anderson: Cuz I mean I can go on and on. If I've got a friend over and they're willing your

56
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:25.290
Lauren Anderson: I will go on. I can ramble on and on endlessly where I'm exhausted and can't breathe. I'm even talking about how exhausting Jeffrey the gets up talking. But, you know, but I've noticed it to some degree in some occasions and normally it's zero occasions I always have that, you know,

57
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's

58
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's acknowledge it. So one of one of your goals is I want less social anxiety and

59
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: These see there's some of the little things that make note of just so far.

60
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. I've got on April 16

61
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And this was you were sharing while you were having some emoting so you are having some Crying YOU HAD SAID ONCE emotions start I automatically think about the things I'm sad about

62
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.120
Lauren Anderson: It was something that yeah I know everything. I think it's the feeling of sadness actually getting

63
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.520
Lauren Anderson: In that state maybe

64
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:15.450
Lauren Anderson: It could be a brain thing where it's automatically going to those to the memory bank to long term memory break and triggering those memories because it's the emotion that reminds me of them just like a smell. Can you remind us that

65
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. So, for

66
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.650
Lauren Anderson: Either snowball

67
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: looking outside

68
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And seeing what you're describing what it resembles is the re experiencing of trauma is what it looks like is it says if that same sadness from many, many, many times ago is being all cumulatively felt right in the moment.

69
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of it. Yeah. Instead of it matching

70
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, wait a minute. Nothing's happening with this group right now.

71
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.870
Lauren Anderson: Well, but I think not really things that are I mean it's things that I'm still morning

72
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.210
Lauren Anderson: With it seems I'm reminded that I'm not

73
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.640
Lauren Anderson: Over but things that are still very real and present in the present moment.

74
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.400
Lauren Anderson: Very sad for me it's just then daily life.

75
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:18.150
Lauren Anderson: I you know I really can't even start to think about those things for dwell on a Myrtle, really, you know, easy to go down the spiral that with that. But yeah, it seems, I'm not okay was still not over.

76
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, thank you for clearing that up so it's it's that you're you're having a grief response to expectation relationship or some some piece of

77
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You having to let go and maybe it isn't quite done yet.

78
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

79
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.800
Lauren Anderson: Might be my body trying to

80
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:47.220
Lauren Anderson: Deal with it, actually, when I started to cry that it brings up other things that I'm sad about like it's trying trying to let me work through it through tears. Now, I'm not sure, but

81
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.050
Lauren Anderson: It scared me though, based on my past experience like I told you how, when I start

82
00:09:52.410 --> 00:10:03.570
Lauren Anderson: It's in the past it's been very difficult for me to stop if I really get in that depressed state a cry for literally days on end continually and that's when I finally

83
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:11.460
Lauren Anderson: I I'm so sad and it's it the sadness just gets bigger and bigger, more magnified by then that's I

84
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:24.210
Lauren Anderson: That's when I hurt myself when I caught myself to stop the sadness and its tracks it transfers it from my emotional sadness to a physical pain and it takes it away, so that's that's what scares me about it.

85
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.590
Lauren Anderson: Okay, run away.

86
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:25.890
Can I

87
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I share something

88
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.220
Yeah.

89
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm guessing. But again, what what psychology offers. Is that what might be missing in this recipe that happened before the one that you just referenced, which was I cried for days.

90
00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And you remember you cried for days and it just kept going and going and going, as if there was no end to that sorrow.

91
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What you may have now.

92
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is an opportunity to do it with another. Now I know we've had a disruption and we've you and I'll have to prepare our trust thing, but I know it's there. I know I can still contain

93
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sorrow and your grief. I know I can do it, so I'm not worried about just the me part, but I just want to do some psycho education around how this might be different, which means when you were crying for days.

94
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there no one there.

95
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: To do that with

96
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:55.800
Lauren Anderson: Um, yeah. I mean, there could be or could not it's it happened at my mother's house, you know, she's tried to help me and no boyfriends not so good when they were there usually alone. Yeah.

97
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what's different. One of the reasons why I'm bringing it up is because it's next level suffering to have brief and to feel alone in it.

98
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.990
Lauren Anderson: I don't really want to share it, though, didn't feel anything for

99
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.820
Lauren Anderson: Me. No, it's so

100
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.540
Special

101
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.160
Lauren Anderson: I don't almost don't even want to share the information of the grief because it's

102
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it's

103
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.590
Lauren Anderson: You know,

104
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I do remember when I started with. In the beginning I said first there would need to be repair number I said about trust.

105
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.500
Lauren Anderson: And yeah.

106
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That takes time since I already know it's it's a vulnerable thing for you anyway. And then we had this this event that happened. And so we've got this

107
00:12:42.960 --> 00:13:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Rumor. But I'm patient. I think that it will get there, but I'm just doing some psycho education around, you're not exactly the same person. You don't have exactly the same resources as you did then you are a different person today you

108
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Are chemically biologically cellular Lee, you are different.

109
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.880
Lauren Anderson: And

110
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You, whether it's trusted or not. You didn't have bright heart health, you didn't have a group and you didn't have a therapist, like me, I'm good or bad.

111
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Good or bad um

112
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Who really wants to be here to hold with you, your grief. I know don't want to tell me the story. That's fine. I get it. I'm just doing psychological education around it. Right. And just talking about it. I'm saying in essence.

113
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: There's hope there's hope because it might mean you could really let go and also know you're going to be okay. You won't fall apart.

114
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And that gives some flexibility to it means that I can meet my own grief my own sorrow and be okay. I won't end up cutting

115
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It means I can be my full authentic self. I can be really mad, I can be really sad. I can be really jealous. I could be super happy. I could be all those things, and I won't be consumed by it.

116
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That I can

117
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can meet those feelings and they will pass, but there's something very unique that happens.

118
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: When we do it with a trusted. Notice the trusted other and I got to earn that it it's a different kind of experience. It means I'm not alone. And it does a rewiring to the brain that doing this grief thing on your own just can't do it doesn't do it the same way.

119
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And that may seem really kooky but it has to do with attachment theory, an object relations. It depends on kind of what you've studied or kind of what you're buying is but

120
00:14:54.870 --> 00:15:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If our rupture was interpersonal the repair it has to be interpersonal and it's so weird. Right.

121
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't think so, like, I don't want anybody to know my business. I don't want them to know what's going on, but something magical can happen when we're at our worst and we see in another's eyes that you're going to be okay that they can handle and hold and contain

122
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: The intensity of your emotion and you see it were once in childhood, year after year after year, they couldn't

123
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, that's the psychological explanation of it. So whether it happens or not I'm open

124
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's get into the nitty gritty, a little bit more around this these notes that I wrote, I wrote

125
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: On May six, um,

126
00:15:51.120 --> 00:16:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. Okay, there was right. Will you describe you don't use the word hyper verbal behavioral health has that word. What do you call it when you're talking and you don't find the pause in between thoughts. What do you call it.

127
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.300
Lauren Anderson: And I can't

128
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.320
Lauren Anderson: Stop but

129
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.800
Lauren Anderson: Actually

130
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.080
Lauren Anderson: My mom calls it something that I can never remember what she said. But hyper variable is a pretty good.

131
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.060
Lauren Anderson: Descriptive

132
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:15.810
OK.

133
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That one doesn't offend you, or anything we could use that one comfortably.

134
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.740
Lauren Anderson: No, that's yeah just grabbed a pretty well.

135
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

136
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.690
Lauren Anderson: Well, think about it. If I come. If I think of a more accurate description. I'll let you know. Okay, good.

137
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it does make me think.

138
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That it might be therapeutic to come up with an imaginative way to channel that right you know how you were saying I'll talk when I'm nervous. I'll just keep talking because you're so you're so smart, you have all these words right and you can come up with them for hours, probably

139
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.140
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, once I start if I can

140
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:03.060
Lauren Anderson: keep my mouth shut, and around people and not start it's okay to be silent, but once I start

141
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

142
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.290
Lauren Anderson: So as an anxiety, just like you're saying, yeah.

143
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:08.700
Lauren Anderson: So,

144
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think if we if we just zeroed in on that part, which means really getting to know

145
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How your body feels when certain let's say a few words are flowing. Or maybe you are catching it.

146
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but then there's maybe uncertainty about, well, I don't know how to end it i don't i don't know how to gracefully kind of end. A THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S NOT. I DON'T KNOW idea.

147
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:49.290
Lauren Anderson: Because partly some of my last romantic relationship and probably most of the other ones like. Like I said earlier, kind of find the same

148
00:17:50.340 --> 00:18:03.600
Lauren Anderson: dynamics that I had with my step mom like I'm trying to resolve that relationship, since I couldn't was her or something like keep daddy's emotional, verbal abusers, but the anxiety. Is that worse over the years and I recognize it some

149
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:16.680
Lauren Anderson: Especially with my last boyfriend. He was an alcoholic. He drank like he broke up with me three to four times a week and would never remember he was always blackout drunk and would yell at me for hours.

150
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:29.760
Lauren Anderson: And so basically, the next time it happened, I was not even slightly healed. So, it kept like ripping me deeper, it probably was the worst trauma of all the boyfriends even a erotically we're friends now. But I have no alcohol policy.

151
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.740
Lauren Anderson: We cannot drink here and if he starts drinking at his house. I'm gone. So, um,

152
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.580
Lauren Anderson: So just kind of almost acquaintances very slight friends but

153
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:49.950
Lauren Anderson: We when he would get drunk he would get more and more argumentative and so we'd get in these big arguments and I could never finish the sentence he was cooked forever cutting me off and interrupting me.

154
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:57.060
Lauren Anderson: And I did have the anxiety. Before that, but I've recognized. Since then, how escalated. It's become and

155
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:06.480
Lauren Anderson: I think it's partly this desperation to finish my thought and get my feelings and thoughts across before I get cut off.

156
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:19.620
Lauren Anderson: And I think it's made me a hyper aware of others tendencies, myself included, actually, to interrupt others before they finish a sentence or a thought. It's very common and so like

157
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:32.160
Lauren Anderson: And I do it too. But I think the second someone even seems like they already know what they want to say and are going to speak when I'm not finished with my thought. It gives me that extra anxiety and I start talking faster, trying to get through.

158
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.920
Lauren Anderson: The rest of my thought before they cut me off.

159
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:46.710
Lauren Anderson: And a lot of times they are trying to get in their way. Maybe I'm not done with my please let me finish first, but the anxiety increases. And then I explained this now. So, and I know it's me. I'm not trying to like

160
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay, you're okay.

161
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But

162
00:19:49.530 --> 00:20:00.660
Lauren Anderson: I really think that's where it's coming from at least white white got worse and probably in a nutshell. Its origins. Anyways, was something kind of around that.

163
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think you're onto a good hypothesis there.

164
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:10.320
Lauren Anderson: And maybe also blocking them from speaking a because i i'm afraid of the abuse to

165
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Perhaps what is, um, what if we

166
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we go back a little further and all we do for the rest of today it unless you want to take a different direction. But what if we just truly

167
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, just take what resembles like do you happen to have paper and pen. We do a little experiment we do it. Yeah, just grab a piece of paper. I'm going to do it with you. So I'm going to be drawing and writing things just

168
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.090
Lauren Anderson: Because you

169
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you either vertical or horizontal. It's up to you. I'm doing mine. Like it's landscape. And I just drew a line I just drew a line down.

170
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.560
Lauren Anderson: Can I use the bottom of these pages are, the better. I have a whole page.

171
00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me, let me give the invitation and then you decide also are getting one.

172
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

173
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.050
Lauren Anderson: I'll just start new and then it's a note.

174
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:05.850
Lauren Anderson: Or

175
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to you. Remember, you're going to be informing the next step. So I'm going to. I haven't even said with the invitation is yet.

176
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the messages messages of the body catcher as soon as I invite it try it gets tight. What gets kind of vibrated tension relaxation, maybe TWISTING, TURNING

177
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever comes up, try to catch it as quick as you can. So here comes the invitation. So looking at your page. I'm looking at line.

178
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: On one side, I would like you to draw stepmother and words to describe her what just happened.

179
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.840
Lauren Anderson: You're doing

180
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In your body. I just did the invitation. Want to know if anything came up

181
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To sell me shift or change just in that

182
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:11.610
Lauren Anderson: No, right, my mind is, again, I hope, I hope this is like a project, I can take home for next week we're going to the list. I don't care what the list right now the second but no knowing it or anything.

183
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so now we're halfway done for the invitation. So know where initial of the body, but the mind went to. I hope there's more time for this boy, I have a lot of words like probably have a lot of words, that kind of thing.

184
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.700
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I don't want to for us when it's time to really, you know, keep bad and as I do. Yeah, this and that.

185
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:30.900
Lauren Anderson: Sure yeah I

186
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to

187
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.680
Lauren Anderson: Be thorough, I guess, look.

188
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's on one side.

189
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.120
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

190
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: On the other, I would like you to draw me and descriptions

191
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, did you notice anything

192
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice a stomach turn a tight chest anything in the body just now.

193
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.540
Lauren Anderson: Do you mean draw you or write your name.

194
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the annotations exactly the same as for your stepmother exactly the same.

195
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:14.370
Lauren Anderson: Oh yeah, with this step is like you were just saying, write a list of descriptions and then when you said the other one. Then I rethought the word draw and I thought maybe meant meant it literally

196
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.840
Lauren Anderson: Or no

197
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to start over.

198
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.810
Lauren Anderson: I'm just confused.

199
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Um, well, I've never done it before so I'm I'm on an adventure with you too. I have this want to play with it a little bit with you. I don't have

200
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Any formal sort of expectation. Let's just see where it evolves, the instruction or the invitation is on one side or the other. I don't care which side, I'd like you to draw

201
00:23:45.930 --> 00:24:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A picture of your stepmother and sort of adjectives about her right things to describe her maybe her character personality her behavior just sort of get a sense of her and then on the right. The same thing me

202
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I look like. So it's a drawing, it's, I don't know if you're a stick figure type, go for it.

203
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.050
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I knew I paid for this abstract more for therapy than this.

204
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what it would be. There's no constraints on this. There's this. That's right, that you could do whatever you want to

205
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.910
Lauren Anderson: Make it like a called Project. Let me paint.

206
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.740
Lauren Anderson: Paint.

207
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.780
Lauren Anderson: Oh, I mean,

208
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.860
Lauren Anderson: I mean, look at that. I mean, we could do. Maybe, like, you know, for roar shockers

209
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.760
Lauren Anderson: I mean, I'm looking, I could do your profile pretty well.

210
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:47.670
Lauren Anderson: Like I really tried to actually sketch it through. But as far as like for psychological help. I mean,

211
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.400
Lauren Anderson: I think I need a little more training as an artist.

212
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.020
Lauren Anderson: I don't know, I'm

213
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a breath, take a breath.

214
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.530
Lauren Anderson: I mean you go there alone, very different. Honestly,

215
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.400
Lauren Anderson: Very, very good.

216
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Work is what you said, if I may, for psychological help, I would have to work on my arts

217
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.440
Lauren Anderson: My drawing skills. Yeah.

218
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:32.790
Lauren Anderson: I can't really convey my feelings or even like my subconscious a very accurately with a pencil. Now, if I have paints and time my in my own space. I can more accurately convey my emotional, psychological state on the canvas. Yeah, so there's

219
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: A little a little bit in between that you're saying a lot of important things. Let's, let's marinated what you just said. It's important to me.

220
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I had this flash just now have Lauren

221
00:25:52.650 --> 00:26:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you allowed to make a mistake. Are you allowed that to just be whimsical and spontaneous. Is it okay that it'd be a funky looking

222
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: stick figure

223
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.390
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I mean, if that's what you really want. I'm willing to do it. Sure.

224
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.810
Lauren Anderson: Is that an exercise moon to

225
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:28.560
Lauren Anderson: I am a perfectionist. Yeah, I would say that for sure, but I'm okay, making mistakes. I'm actually extremely silly. I do a lot of very silly things got a whole offshoot of song, the whole separate project that's basically a dark comedy so

226
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I picked on. It's the perfectionist. That's what I just saw. And I it's it's convenient for me that you labeled it because then I didn't have to

227
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.040
Lauren Anderson: Well, I

228
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:50.760
Lauren Anderson: Like that. I mean, it couldn't be a, I guess it could be an obstacle. But in general, it's a it's been very, very good to me through my life, you know, my diligence was studying

229
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:59.280
Lauren Anderson: And practicing the piano. I mean, to really get things polished and ready, you know, concert piano ready

230
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:15.420
Lauren Anderson: It takes six, eight hours of practice. And it's not just practicing for six, eight hours. It's perfect, perfect, practice makes perfect. Because if you just practice and form, bad, bad habits, they're harder to break so you really have to very diligent concentrated

231
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:22.500
Lauren Anderson: Conscious practicing, you have to be very aware of 100% of the time. So yeah, it's, it's a

232
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:34.200
Lauren Anderson: It's a good characteristic in general. But yeah, I'm not, I don't know, it's, it's okay to me for me to make mistakes and I don't really have a problem admitting that to people either

233
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:43.770
Lauren Anderson: Or apologizing, saying, like I said before, I think, in general, I use the. I'm sorry, almost as a filler I end up doing that a lot more than I should. I know that.

234
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.020
Lauren Anderson: But, uh,

235
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.840
Lauren Anderson: But I do admit when I'm wrong, and make mistakes I've made a ton of them. And it's not a

236
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.840
Lauren Anderson: It's it's okay with me, you know, the perfection is in me is that doesn't. It's okay.

237
00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we label.

238
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, if it's not perfectionism, but let's go ahead and do this activity together and what will be in place of perfectionism, in order to accomplish this task just within the time we have.

239
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to draw stepmother, we're going to have some adjectives. We're gonna have some words. Real quick around it. And then on to the right. It'd be nice if it was on one page. So we could juxtapose them and then you'll me and then some adjectives not looking ahead.

240
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To what you think I want

241
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But letting the process unfold as it's happening just free flowing. What do we call this space. If it's not perfectionism. What will you be using in order to make this happen.

242
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.080
Lauren Anderson: Well I don't use perfectionism with everything. It's a nice tool for piano studying

243
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.900
Lauren Anderson: I'm just gonna go with it.

244
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.620
Lauren Anderson: Perfect. So I'm just drawing

245
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna do the go with it.

246
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay if I do my version as in the story. I'm making up in my head about it. So I'm doing the same thing, but it's just

247
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.340
Lauren Anderson: About you, and my stepmom you know

248
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Helping me

249
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And her step mom like what I think might be happening. Can I do it with you while

250
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.630
Lauren Anderson: You're doing. Sure.

251
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feeling about your

252
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Your work what you're doing, you're going with the flow.

253
00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:27.930
Lauren Anderson: Good.

254
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I finished mine.

255
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Time.

256
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.170
Yeah.

257
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.170
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, sure, I guess.

258
00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You can take your time. Take your time.

259
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.070
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

260
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.760
Lauren Anderson: So drill and I just started writing characteristics and I'm

261
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.680
Lauren Anderson: Kind of went nuts.

262
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.640
Lauren Anderson: Um, and then kind of at the end.

263
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:40.200
Lauren Anderson: Really like I was quite done. I kind of was just kind of thinking, Okay, well, that kind of characteristic. And what is that, and this one, you know, going back and forth by written one trying to, you know, compare and contrast. I guess kind of what

264
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.910
Lauren Anderson: Your own in any way I

265
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I do a little guidance.

266
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.200
Lauren Anderson: Sure.

267
00:35:47.040 --> 00:36:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you look at them and and just feel in your body and labeling with an emotion inside. You don't have to tell me, but just be present with it. So the film that's in the body and a label. When you look at one side.

268
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feel around that person.

269
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like to be in its presence to be around those attributes just kind of tuned into that maybe scribble a little something down at the bottom.

270
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Go over to this other image which is your therapist.

271
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of get a sense of how you feel physically

272
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And labeling and emotion to it when you are present with those attributes.

273
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I did the same thing. And I'm curious to see when we

274
00:36:49.650 --> 00:37:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold ourselves if you're willing don't have to, but kind of want to see what we both came up with. But first, get a sense of how it feels to be around these two women.

275
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to show me.

276
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Or do you want to tell me what you drew what you wrote

277
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:42.390
Lauren Anderson: You know, this is like pointing out some. It's a little tricky in my head. You know, it's, I feel fine around my step mom now we're actually great friends I get along with her really well.

278
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.940
Lauren Anderson: The way she treated me

279
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.330
Lauren Anderson: From time she married my dad right before I turned to 12 and

280
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.570
Lauren Anderson: My left to move in with her sister.

281
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:01.710
Lauren Anderson: was awful. And it really set up the pattern for the guys that I was to choose after her.

282
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:11.820
Lauren Anderson: Which is a lot of the stuff that I'm sad about now. But as far as currently around her. It's okay. When I read the attributes that I know exist in her

283
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:21.540
Lauren Anderson: Things I won't say because I don't want to go there with her. It's not worth it. I'm reading all these attributes, I'd not, I would not. I don't want to be around a person like this and this behavior.

284
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:33.330
Lauren Anderson: She's, unfortunately, she's married to my father, so I occasionally go out to eat with them. I see them for holidays and I interact with her and I love her, and we get along really well now.

285
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.070
Lauren Anderson: It is a

286
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.270
Lauren Anderson: Fortunate we can never actually talked about what went on them or it'll just

287
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.510
Lauren Anderson: It'll happen again. It will replay.

288
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.040
Lauren Anderson: You have tried to

289
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:51.030
Lauren Anderson: Talk to her about it before. And she just immediately digresses regresses to abuse yelling up

290
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked you, though.

291
00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.450
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, you were asking about this. I was pointing out something that I saw though that

292
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The characteristics versus how I actually feel

293
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.860
Lauren Anderson: Around the person is different. You

294
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I asked, Are you okay in a different phrase, are you okay with showing me

295
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.630
Lauren Anderson: Now, yeah, we'll see handwriting messy.

296
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Up a little higher. Want to see

297
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.550

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, over to the right about an inch

Lauren Anderson: step mom.

304
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But wait, wait, one more experiment first before. So there's no risk that you think I wrote anything else I want you to see mine.

305
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Before because this was before. So, this is this was mine. So this is. This is Stefan here and she I'm not so this hand is this

306
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But she. This is a bossy finger. This is, I know what's right, gender, and then it's the word is demanding and then it is a quote do what I say and shush. And then over here, this is me. But notice the eyes. Notice the eyes, the eyebrows are the same. Can you kind of tell

307

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: They're angry. And so then, SHE'S BIG you only see a little bit of me and on in a box. Obviously, and then I

309
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.180
Lauren Anderson: Couldn't generate know right the computer screen How funny I

313
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Accountability and rules, I think, well, that's what I wrote in to say what I wrote. And then down here for step mom for feelings. I put my bodies tense and unimportant.

Lauren Anderson: Relaxed inviting friendly presence. So those last starting with the no banks that was at the very end, after you said you had finished and I was kind of thinking, well, what else looking from the thing where is different about them. So I added those two at the end so

330
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like for you to see money.

331
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.210
Lauren Anderson: Oh,

Lauren Anderson: Your take take on us. Yeah. The Vicki describe or i remember when i mean she did all the time was ordered me around and with point her acrylic nail right my face like a

335
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.560
Lauren Anderson: She's yelling at me.

336
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.080
Lauren Anderson: To make my bed one night, for example, screaming at me because I made it that morning.

337
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.540
Lauren Anderson: And then she started screaming at me because my shoes. Ron and take them off at the door.

338
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:59.760
Lauren Anderson: But I was in the middle of making the bad. So I was finishing making the bed and she was screaming at me, I'm told, I told you take off your fucking shoe there. Now you know there

339
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:13.560
Lauren Anderson: But anyways, more than I, but more than that element of doing telling me what to do and everything. The biggest thing. If we were to do like a cloud like staying. She's saying it was making fun. She made fun constantly

340
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:28.800
Lauren Anderson: Feel like the really mean girl at school. The that one girl in the power to maybe in the popular crowd that were mean to everyone like the real pretty but vain bitches. THAT'S THAT WAS HER LIKE TO THE T

341
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.360
Doesn't

342
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at you as you thank you for indulging me in this just look at your two images.

343
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Hey, if because you didn't you really said very, very little negative, you know, pretty much. He said so many nice things on my side check and see if, if, in the face if these two images. Both have bitchy faces, just check and see if they both have it.

344
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:10.020
Lauren Anderson: She has a bitchy face. I mean, she's very beautiful and smiley and friendly, so she doesn't really have a bitchy face.

345
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.810
Lauren Anderson: I mean I'm I don't know.

346
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What about the eyes go into the eyes get a sense of eyes between her big eyes and what it's like sort of to be in my presence. What's that's like to make eye contact.

347
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up. What's your truth.

348
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:40.830
Lauren Anderson: Really

349
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.850
Lauren Anderson: I guess I didn't really understand the exercise.

350
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you don't have to. We're going with the flow right you're analyzing it, but instead because that's my job. You don't have to

351
00:45:53.310 --> 00:46:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You just kind of go with the flow. So when I said just look into the eyes and get a sense of eyes and see if there's a similarity between her eyes and the therapists.

352
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:07.500
Lauren Anderson: New

353
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:13.440
Lauren Anderson: Not in the drawings, not in reality, either. No, no.

354
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How would they get

355
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.340
Lauren Anderson: Holy similarity. I would say is that you're both female and you both have lighter colored hair like

356
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.390
Lauren Anderson: Other than that.

357
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:29.070
Lauren Anderson: And you both have fashion sense, you know, but you're very you're very, very different personality looks body type.

358
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

359
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.920
Lauren Anderson: Okay, very different.

360
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the feeling. So look at the bottom. Now, what, how did your body feels when you were looking at her. What's her name, Vicki.

361
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.040
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

362
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're looking at Vicky, what, what's the felt sense in the body and then the emotion.

363
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:59.640
Lauren Anderson: At this point, it's just it's comical it I'm sad for her because i i don't even know she was really even aware of, like, have all said that everybody could use some therapy.

364
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, could be beneficial to

365
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:01.800
Lauren Anderson: Everybody in the world.

366
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:09.030
Lauren Anderson: And she doesn't need therapy. There's nothing wrong. You know, it's like that type. So it's at the end I really now.

367
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:23.790
Lauren Anderson: Because I love her, and we're friends now. I, when I look at this, it makes me kind of giggle inside because I know her, and I love her and she is all of those things. Geez. But, um, but at the end of the day, I feel sad for SAP for her because

368
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know how to you.

369
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:28.410
Lauren Anderson: Know progress. That's how I feel when I look at that.

370
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.600
Lauren Anderson: I giggle inside and then I feel very

371
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.530
Lauren Anderson: deep sympathy.

372
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:44.970
Lauren Anderson: It's like a grief or sadness that she has not progressed it all in. Though she's still the same psyche level that she was 25 years ago you know 3545 years ago.

373
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:45.810
Lauren Anderson: That you

374
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:47.640
Lauren Anderson: There's nothing wrong with her.

375
00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at her the emotion is sympathy.

376
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Sympathy it's not

377
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.140
Lauren Anderson: Like, I feel sorry for her.

378
00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.120
Lauren Anderson: I feel badly for her sad.

379
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:02.790
Lauren Anderson: Hey. Yeah, it is. It's a pity, I feel very badly for her that she

380
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.880
Lauren Anderson: So vain she think she is so perfect that

381
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:11.460
Lauren Anderson: She'll never there's no progression. She's in the same point that she was years ago so

382
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:29.160
Lauren Anderson: Then I am sad for in a giggle because it's so ironic because her package in her presentation she so friendly and I'm so cool. So pretty Adela da tell it like this. But really, I mean it's at the end. It's the great irony, because she really is the

383
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.110
In

384
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body when you're in the presence of kitty. Just get in tune with that one.

385
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it respond

386
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're around someone that you pity she has not evolved. She just not her package presents. What is that like for you.

387
00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:08.010
Lauren Anderson: Well, I mean, I think you said at the doctors said it how you know we can't really change anyone but ourselves. So I really just come to terms with it over the years.

388
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me rephrase, you have a body you have hands and arms and guts and skin and bones and tendons and viscera.

389
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking at that image when I look at them. I have a response in my body.

390
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Tension up here. I can feel my jaws tight. I'm asking you to tune in were to the self, like you look at Vicki. How does your body feel

391
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:45.480
Lauren Anderson: Like I said, I've come to terms with that my body doesn't. I have no reaction to it. I'm okay with it now really okay with it.

392
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.350
Lauren Anderson: I think probably the more effective.

393
00:49:53.370 --> 00:50:11.040
Lauren Anderson: Things inside me is the dynamic between us, the men that I ended up being attracted to and seeking out after my experience with her has probably done more trauma things that I am not over need to deal with them with her.

394
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:18.330
Lauren Anderson: Somehow, I don't know, just over the years. I really have. It's not just bottled up. It's not repressed I

395
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.830
Lauren Anderson: I have come to terms with that I'm okay with it when I look at her. There's no feelings.

396
00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.530
Lauren Anderson: Of anger and attention and my body.

Gwenevere Abriel: Got we've got two minutes left. Now look at the image of me on the right. I think it's on the right.

399
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body.

400
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's anything that gets activated.

401
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of looking at that image that indeed, it'll be there again, maybe we'll, we'll meet again, I'll be there again, maybe in group to probably

402
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Mike, what happens is the body have a message. So anything gets tight.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.700
Lauren Anderson: Anything from wary of you.

Lauren Anderson: Going to miss trust or distrust this let me not gaining trust. I mean, it's

409
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.700
Lauren Anderson: obvious why extreme of not trust of trust. You know, it's not the exact opposite of that. But

410
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to use your word, then I didn't mean to throw myself and they're all use wary.

417
00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:10.560
Lauren Anderson: pretty skeptical of everything and everyone tonight. I like to actually say, hey, I take, I've got a grain of salt for everything pretty much I've ever taken them just a healthy grain of salt. So yeah, we're yeah

418
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:17.010
Lauren Anderson: I don't know, I'm sure I don't know you. Very well. We don't know each other very well so

Gwenevere Abriel: Yep heart raced So was it when you were actually looking at my real my real image in the video right

423
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:47.730
Lauren Anderson: As you as you were saying, look at my image without this out. But, you know, how does that make you feel. Yes, thinking of that. But, uh,

424
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.360
Lauren Anderson: Uh, not not saying necessarily near defense but as qualifier.

425
00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:16.740
Lauren Anderson: Anyone and everyone that I have relations with that I see on a regular basis. Currently I have the same feelings about if I think about them. Or if I were to do the same. I have that same anxiety or do much with everyone and anyone that's in my regular life interpersonal dynamic

426
00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:18.600
Lauren Anderson: Anxiety.

427
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.080

Lauren Anderson: Mr wariness

429
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:23.940

Gwenevere Abriel: A known for just a little, a little transition and sort of just breathe in my eyes are closed. I'm not staring at you. I know for me I want to have a transition. I want to honor that you did the go with the flow.

433
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You were asked to do something may not have done exactly like this before, kind of going into the unknown, which does ask you to trust me just talk a little bit and you did it.

434
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of. Let's honor that that that happened and I trusted

435
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That that would be okay. And I wouldn't be overly intrusive or that I wouldn't push you away. I had to trust in us that they would be okay that we would, we would have a positive outcome we could be spontaneous.

436
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it would be okay.

437
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you open your eyes will kind of turn our attention to scheduling another appointment. I'm kind of in life that I've already sent a message to Dr. Rob reality we're here already sent that I sent that minutes ago. Um,

438
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.870
