Amanda: Yeah I flush it down the toilet and I feel too bad. So whenever I need the bathroom and all flesh it like

73
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.100
Amanda: She brings us like little one gallon or two gallon bucket. I don't think she ever really flushes it

74
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.340
Amanda: I've been going out and helping her

75
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.010
Amanda: She hasn't asked. I see her, and then

76
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.560
Amanda: She takes you and I offer

77
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:37.650

78
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.670
Amanda: Nobody's gonna say, oh, can I use this, what can I use it, nobody

79
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.630
Amanda: Nobody should have to ask if I have it. I'm going to put it out there.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.680
Amanda: I feel that they work two or three in the morning, the other day.

82
00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is crazy.

83
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.380
Amanda: Everything closes at eight o'clock.

84
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.480
Amanda: Yeah you pack.

85
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.780
Amanda: I know just everything sucks.

86
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.020
Amanda: I don't give you money, you can handle.

87
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I like Amanda I like your attitude about it. I like the fact that you're going out there and you're helping that lady and that you're having compassion for what those guys are going through whether trying to fix your water.

88
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.680
Amanda: Is hard work.

89
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.620
Amanda: This is my

90
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.400
Amanda: hold water is not easy.

91
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is from the lady who talks about communicating in a rude way.

92
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.510
Amanda: That's what I

93
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.540
Amanda: That's what I believe everybody

94
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your, your behaviors are so compassionate, you know,

95
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.890
Amanda: Which I'm really rude.

96
00:07:51.240 --> 00:08:00.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that you can come off. I think prospect if people don't know you, that you can come off to people in that manner about who you are in your heart is somebody

97
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Completely different.

98
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.290
Amanda: Than what people see them.

99
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:11.910
Amanda: So they know me. They don't like that. But that's the problem that I'm having is that come off through really I don't give a shit.

100
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.940
Amanda: You know, let me ask you this, you don't pay my rent you pay my bills. I don't really care.

101
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.000
Amanda: Right. They don't want to be like that like

102
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.600
Amanda: I just

Amanda: I walked in my head down the scroll up just go swimming related

104
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.850

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.450
Amanda: I come to talk to you.

106
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.560
I

107
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.010
Amanda: Mean you didn't say nothing, nothing, you

108
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.400

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.470
Amanda: What do you want me to tell you, or. Let's be friends. You didn't

110
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.210
Amanda: But that's what I'm saying. Like, that's what's your first impression on me. But really, I didn't go to talk to her.

111
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:07.410
Amanda: Right, just died. I knew she was saying there because I see her never introduced this but I literally stay in my house. I take my dog out to

112
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.340
Amanda: Associate with anybody. It's the morning my face.

113
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:11.940
Right.

114
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:22.230
Amanda: I mean, that's you. That's what I'm saying. Like there's no I'm talking to him, whatever. But you're my neighbors for good like my neighbor next door.

115
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.880
Amanda: Their packages were outside and I was like, Well, somebody might see them. So I brought him in

116
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:41.040
Amanda: So then I give them to her and then ever since then. She's got my package. I've never asked if she ever asked me, but and I don't really like to know my neighbors because Oh can I have this little surety of it, then they just don't need other people's problem.

117
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.820

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.710
Amanda: I didn't know that I just knew my sister. The same. My parents are the same.

191
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:40.740
Amanda: Right, I guess, outside of our family. I didn't really. I mean, I knew, other people. And I thought, they just do what they did, because that's their family, but

192
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:48.030
Amanda: You don't hit your parents. You don't disrespect them and I didn't know that I really thought you were born with common sense. I didn't know that.

193
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.850
Amanda: People just

Well,

244
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.080

245
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, we never know. You know, the best thing I think to do is is to live our best life for ourselves be our best

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That we can be

247
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:12.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, be on guard because society is dangerous, but in the same sense. It's like, you know, showing people can passion. There's nothing wrong with that, helping out as you know you're 70 year old neighbor. There's nothing wrong with that.

248
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.400

251
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not about them, you know,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

254
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's one

255
00:20:44.010 --> 00:21:03.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing that I hear from you. I just want to identify that as well, is you do have that baseline. Amanda, you have a great you have great integrity, you have this belief system, you know, that is not bad at all. You know, you're good person.

256
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:13.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Period. No. If ands, or buts. To me, you're a good person. That is what I see and what I hear. When you and I work together. You try everything you possibly can.

257

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To make sure that you meet our meetings, you know, you, you, you just sat and waited for for how many minutes for me to be able to get through with a crisis client so that we could have our individual. You know what I mean.

258
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You could have left and said, I'll reschedule later. Not a big deal, but you didn't you stuck it out and you held true, you know,

259
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.090
Amanda: Because that's what I was taught to do like without your word you're nothing.

260
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.410
It's right

261
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At the end of the day is all we have is our word our integrity and integrity. What is integrity.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.620
Amanda: And I'm related to half the town.

437
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:57.000
Amanda: But nobody ever lost his or her does this and I do because I am from the city or you just doesn't matter where you're from every there's always somebody somewhere.

438
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.370
Amanda: Just. Oh, yeah. That seems to matter what it is.

439
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:00.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's true.

440
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:15.810
Amanda: And I just those old people just get out. They just don't people are really not even doing it. He's going to happen to them anything happen to anybody. What makes you any different than anybody if you have money you're black, you're white. What you don't bother nobody

441
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.770
Amanda: Everybody thinks I'm paranoid and

442
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.070
Amanda: Nothing impairment. It is

443
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.800
Amanda: Maybe it will never happen to me. I don't know.

444
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's try maybe, maybe you're being cautious.

445
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:34.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

446
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's going to help it not happened to you right

447
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:47.520
Amanda: Now I'm going to prevent but those other people never stopped. They're like, Oh, I never thought this would happen to meet you know my case here, I take them here. I do this.

448
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:55.110
Amanda: Why did you ever occurred to you that it would never happen to you way to get what made you any better than anybody those

449
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.740
Are the big

450
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I, I'll tell you why.

451
00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.160
I lived in

452
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I lived in a small town in Oregon right on the coast right little small town everybody you know you pretty much you walk in the grocery store. You knew. Most of the people in there.

453
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it was a tourist town. So in the summertime. It was packed with people right like it went from 20,000 in the wintertime to like 80,000 in the summertime.

454
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Computer, same exact way and I never, I never thought I had teenage kids who were in and out all the time. I never locked my car, or I always liked my car. Excuse me. I never locked my front door and

455
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wound up

456
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting together with this you know this guy that I'm with now. And he's like,

457
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your door was unlocked. Why was your front door unlocked and I was like I don't even have a key to my front door. Why would I lock it. He goes,

458
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:58.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why wouldn't you lock it. Everything that you own, including your life and your children are in this home. Why wouldn't you guard that, why wouldn't you protect it.

459
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:06.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why wouldn't you lock that door. You don't know who's on the other side. You don't know. You know who's coming into town. You don't know what's going on.

460
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:14.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you you live with these blinders on to think the world is a safe place. In reality, it cannot be a safe place all the time.

461
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are people out there that are out there to get whatever it is you've got, whether it be, and I've had like stuff missing from my house and I thought I chalked it up to my kids, his friend. I mean I literally, we're good.

462
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:32.250
Amanda: I forgot to myself through my older there's something missing. I'm like, oh, maybe I get it I maybe i mean if you like myself like that too, but

463
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:34.620
I agree.

464
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:37.080
Amanda: Yeah.

465
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In reality, you know, it's the truth. It lock your doors, lock your car, you know, if you want. You want to keep yourself and you want to be safe, protect yourself.

466
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:53.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in that area. That's why there's locks on the doors and that's why there's lots on the cars and that's why you can unlock your car from the front door, you know,

467
00:37:54.090 --> 00:38:06.120
Amanda: I've never been robbed or nephew my cousins have robbed people i don't know i mean i'm still some stores but I've never brought for people like that work for a living, because it's not for free. What if somebody had came to your house. I've heard people say you get

468
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.600
Amanda: A feel violated when they get rough

469
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.580
Amanda: You know, you never lost your house when you came home and everything was gone. Yeah.

470
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely any security that I felt in that moment would have been completely ripped away and then it would have hit me that I need to lock my door so

471
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:23.730
Amanda: Why does it

472
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.340
Amanda: Have to happen for it to

473
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:32.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Matter you to do it. I don't know, I just think, if I'm thinking about how I thought of things, you know, you just

474
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like tears.

475
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:48.540
Amanda: In your mind, but why you to keep in knowing that it was a tourist town and you as a mother being a kid, my what you might want to protect then you find out that nothing would come. Like, how did you feel like everything was okay. Yeah.

476
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.650
Amanda: You have I do anything.

477
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:58.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, like my door. My door was closed. My kids were in the house. They're Upstairs Downstairs, the front doors in front of you. If anybody tries to come in. I'm going to know it. I have

478
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:59.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Teenage boys.

479
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:04.440
Amanda: You know, what if he fell asleep on the couch or I don't know if the I just

480
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's a lot of what ifs. They could have happened, that's for sure and high

481
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Side right now.

482
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. For the past couple years my doors have been locked my cards locked. I double check things I wear my purse over my shoulder, you know, I'm not so

483
00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:20.850
Amanda: Now are

484
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.110
You feel. I do.

485
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.760
Amanda: Before

486
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do when I think about it. I feel empowered.

487
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To have the

488
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:41.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally that I have the ability to protect myself were back then. I was just living, I don't know, like in a Lala land. Everything's gonna be fine. No one's going to steal for me, everything is perfectly suited. In reality, but even though things came up missing.

489
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:43.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

490
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.700
Amanda: Where I can get different curves, because you've never, I don't know if you've ever been in trouble with the law.

491
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.860
Amanda: Doesn't seem like it but I guess because of where I came from. And I've seen people might

492
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.830
Amanda: Gain that I was mean just everything they were just takes you from people, whoever they want to. And I'm like, that isn't yours, but

493
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:09.060
Amanda: Keep your mouth shut. Do whatever it is. From there, I guess I learned it that way, but also my parents taught me to say, then you never been in trouble. You've never been around that stuff so

494
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.090
Amanda: Why would you protect yourself like yes

495
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and see there's a piece of it. Okay, so I have as a child as a teenager, I was always in trouble with the law, but

496
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:34.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As an adult, I haven't been, I've been fortunate enough to miss that that realm, but I have children that have spent time in prison and that have been on the other side of being, you know, being that seed can be in that scandalous person and be going through all

497
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.390
Amanda: That you're having around it so

498
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.290
Amanda: Yeah, see,

499
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:46.560
Amanda: That's what I don't get it. Somebody who's never really been like around drugs or. Okay. So, yeah, you have a kid in prison, but

500
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.140
Amanda: When they first only from you and they start stealing from somebody else and you actually know what they're doing, or

501
00:40:52.530 --> 00:41:01.080
Amanda: Oh yeah, my son. He's literally sitting in jail so you know what can possibly happen as opposed it to never happening around you, then you can be oblivious and blind and like

502
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:08.520
Amanda: The you knowing that all your kid was like that or did data or whatever or never sold from you, but he didn't tell the people, but

503
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

504
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.520
Amanda: Somebody else's take you do it to you.

505
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep.

506
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.870
Amanda: Yeah, I have a question you have kids.

507
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:16.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes.

508
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.180
Amanda: Do you believe in the death penalty. So say your daughter gets murdered.

509
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.280
Amanda: Whoever did that to her, would you want him to die on death row.

510
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it would depend on the situation.

511
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.640
Amanda: What do you mean like

512
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.950
Amanda: It was a brutal, he, he, like it's a horrible thing, whatever.

513
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.750
Amanda: He killed her. He tortured or whatever, just do you want him to die, what he did to your child.

514
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.000
Amanda: Yes, or her vice versa so

515
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.450
Amanda: Now, what is your son was the murder.

516
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably not.

517
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.300
Amanda: Chef a double standard.

518
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:07.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally

519
00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally

520
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.760
Amanda: People don't think like that.

521
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.610
Amanda: What about Jeffrey Dahmer his parents. They probably have to humans going to do all that stuff.

522
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No probably didn't

523
00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:25.770
Amanda: That's where my mind is all the time. Just you never know what's going to happen.

524
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:33.480
Amanda: And you just never I'm talking to you, but I'm thinking about what's going on outside because I can hear them too but

525
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:40.230
Amanda: I never stopped. I know Steve has two hours because my mind every trip I don't ever turn the TV off because I don't have my own brain.

526
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:50.610
Amanda: But that's what goes on my mind all the time like my kids. I haven't heard from my son. I said $200 let's get as far out hasn't

527
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:58.530
Amanda: I'm having like like 10 days. I think he's in jail, what I said. I don't know if he's in jail. I just haven't heard from him.

528
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.920
Amanda: A call me the other day and then you started arguing
