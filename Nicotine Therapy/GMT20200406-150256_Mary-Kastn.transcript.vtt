00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.160
Mary Kastner: I hate to tell you

171
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.530
Mary Kastner: I do think you probably do have bipolar depression.

172
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.510
Mary Kastner: And

173
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:52.470
Mary Kastner: Probably we should try something else besides this the Seroquel because it's obviously not working at a high dose.

174
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.160
Yeah.

175
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:04.620
Mary Kastner: So what I'm going to do is just suggest a few things to you one would be, do you have any medical problems like with your thyroid or your kidneys.

176
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:05.400
Mary Kastner: No.

177
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.740
Ken O: I got checked out. Everything's fine. Uh huh.

178
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.530
Mary Kastner: One would be a simple thing like lithium.

179
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:27.420
Mary Kastner: It's a mineral that we have in our bodies, naturally, it's the number 33 and mineral on the periodic table. I'm the best antidepressant in the works workshop

180
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.000
Mary Kastner: The thing with lithium. We have to get your blood taken

181
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:42.150
Mary Kastner: Initially, probably in the first week and then and another two weeks and then after that, it's about once every quarter.

182
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:51.390
Mary Kastner: And what we're doing is looking at the level to see if it's in the right therapeutic range and make sure your kidneys are processing it. Okay.

183
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.190
Mary Kastner: Are you still working.

184
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.810
Ken O: Not right now. No.

185
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.700
Mary Kastner: Okay, because then when it gets hot, you have to watch it with lithium if

186
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.240
Mary Kastner: You know anything. Is there anything else besides that.

187
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.070
Mary Kastner: Yeah, it's just number one.

188
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.730
Mary Kastner: Number two, we could do something like

189
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.830
Mary Kastner: Dive our Pro X. It's a anti-convulsants that we use for bipolar disorder.

190
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.620
Mary Kastner: It increases the

191
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:34.020
Mary Kastner: Glutamate in your in your know chemistry, which is sort of the quieting neural chemical and another thing, it's

192
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:40.020
Mary Kastner: Newer on the market is another anti psychotic or major tranquilizer like the Seroquel

193
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.790
Mary Kastner: Seroquel is an anti psychotic and major tranquilizer.

194
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.490
Mary Kastner: And it's called lead to de

195
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.440
Ken O: Or

196
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.380
Mary Kastner: And it also is pretty good for depression.

197
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.960
Mary Kastner: So,

198
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.280
Ken O: You take a look today at night.

199
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.210
Yeah.

200
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.210
Mary Kastner: You can start that you could start to lower the Seroquel

201
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.280
Mary Kastner: And basically run two major tranquilizers.

202
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.630
Mary Kastner: Should help you with sleep.

203
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:19.770
Mary Kastner: Oh, should help you with seeing the shadows and the racing thoughts bullshit.

204
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.560
Ken O: Can I ask you something.

205
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.070
Ken O: Like seeing the shadows and stuff like that. Have you heard of that before.

206
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.390
Mary Kastner: Yes.

207
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.450
Ken O: I mean, what does that. I mean, that's just

208
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.250
Ken O: It blows me away because

209
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.090
Ken O: Yeah.

210
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.750
Mary Kastner: It's also almost a hidden a Gaga illusion.

211
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.000
Ken O: Weird

212
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.340
Mary Kastner: It is weird. It is

213
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:53.430
Mary Kastner: Not a true hallucination. It's almost hip no Gaga, meaning you're not getting enough sleep, and you're seeing things.

214
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.330
Well,

215
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.440
Ken O: Okay, okay, I'll say one other thing.

216
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.150
Ken O: I had, I had a broken nose for a long, long, long time.

217
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.000
Ken O: Right, I broke my nose. My the kid and I never got it fixed. Right.

218
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.350
Ken O: And then

219
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:24.150
Ken O: Finally, I found a doctor, I went to a sleep lab and everything and edit work. I walked out of there. That was crazy. But ever since they fix my nose. I can breathe again, you know, it's amazing how just getting your nose fixed and breathing again.

220
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.520
Mary Kastner: When did you get your nose fixed

221
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.170
Ken O: A couple years ago.

222
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.290
Mary Kastner: And you did you start sleeping better

223
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.940
Ken O: Yeah.

224
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.170
Ken O: Yeah. Yeah, I would. I mean, because I realized that I mean

225
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.350
Ken O: Every night of my life every day of my life. I was fighting for, you know,

226
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.220
Mary Kastner: Great. Yeah.

227
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.390
Well,

228
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:49.680
Mary Kastner: When you do wake up at night like you did it to 10 this morning you wake up coughing and choking.

229
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:50.550
Know,

230
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.480
Ken O: you snore. I don't know.

231
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.560
Ken O: I don't, I don't think so. No, I've never been told a snore.

232
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:10.860
Mary Kastner: Okay. Well, having a history of a deviated septum like that. Um, can you know make me think a little bit about sleep apnea.

233
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.110
Mary Kastner: Usually the symptoms of that are extreme fatigue during the day. I mean, you sit down in a chair you fall asleep.

234
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.390
Ken O: Well, I don't. I've never been able to

235
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.140
Ken O: Elaborate take me, trust me. I don't know if I

236
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.880
Ken O: Fall Asleep like that as

237
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.530
Ken O: I gotta fight.

238
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:36.150
Mary Kastner: Okay, there you go. Um, and waking up several times during the night, usually coughing and choking.

239
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.980
Mary Kastner: So think about it. You next time you're into the

240
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.100
Mary Kastner: To the medical doctor, you could ask if if he thinks you should get a sleep apnea test.

241
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.170
Ken O: Would that would that involve the sleep lab.

242
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.120
Mary Kastner: Well, when I did mine. I got a little machine to take home.

243
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.630
Ken O: With you I toss and turn

244
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.910
Ken O: Well, that's another

245
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.780
Mary Kastner: That's another sign, you know, and this the what they did. I think it was a risk thing that I had to wear

246
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.200
Mary Kastner: Then you take the

247
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:20.790
Mary Kastner: Machine and then they read. Read it, and tell you whether you have it. And if it's mild or moderate or severe

248
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:35.550
Mary Kastner: If you do have it you do wind up wearing an apparatus to sleep. Some of them are very uncomfortable. Some of them, you know, you just get used to it. I have a nose thing that just kind of goes like this, it's not

249
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.230
Mary Kastner: You know my mouth is free. So it's just over the nose. Yeah.

250
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.440
Mary Kastner: My husband has to have a

251
00:16:45.090 --> 00:17:04.320
Mary Kastner: Thing like this looks like alfalfa keeps his mouth shut. At night, so he's not blubbering. You know, so he has actually two apparatuses but we can't even take a nap without them because you get so used to sleeping with them. I mean, you'll find it, you can't sleep without them.

252
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.110
Mary Kastner: Okay, so let me just let you kind of chew on those possibilities.

253
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.190
Mary Kastner: Okay, well, a

254
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.670
Ken O: breather was living in today. And every one.

255
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.580
Mary Kastner: Of our products and convulsing

256
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.280
Ken O: Know what's that number three.

257
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.910
Mary Kastner: That it. That's the second one I mentioned that

258
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.830
Mary Kastner: Works on the glutamate.

259
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.610
Ken O: Okay, what it, what it is. I've taken something Pam or

260
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.790
Mary Kastner: Pamela

261
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.740

262
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.310
Mary Kastner: Oh, lorazepam yeah those are direct dial.

263
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.960
Ken O: Or the are those sleep aid.

264
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.740
Mary Kastner: No.

265
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.500
Mary Kastner: No, they're anti anxiety pills that

266
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:54.900
Mary Kastner: Are minor tranquilizers where what you're on now as a major tranquilizer. And the minor ones actually very addicting.

267
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.390
Ken O: Okay, okay. I figured

268
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.500
Ken O: That's good. I don't want to take them. I just know before and I slept I slept better with them. But if they're that link decal I don't want them.

269
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:05.970
Ken O: Okay.

270
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.430
Mary Kastner: No, we wouldn't give them for sleep ever

271
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.050
Ken O: Okay. Good. All right.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.220
Mary Kastner: Okay, and

276
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:29.460
Mary Kastner: This is I'm going to talk a little bit into the recording because I have a transcriptionist it's going to write this down for us.

277
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.900
Ken O: Oh, yeah.

285
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.430
Ken O: I'm not sure. I don't know. You know, it only took them five minutes.

286
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.570
Ken O: I was in a county

Mary Kastner: What we can do you have a history of being diagnosed very briefly.

308
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.200
Mary Kastner: In an assessment by a psychiatrist in 2012 when you are hospitalized for

309
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.990

315
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.860
Ken O: I would drink kill it. I was completely stupid and

316
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.750
Mary Kastner: Okay.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.440
Ken O: Something wrong with me that was

319
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.930
Mary Kastner: Just that wasn't me anymore. Okay.

320
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.350

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.380
Ken O: under the influence of alcohol. Okay.

322
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.120

charles clark: After I left security. I tried holding down. I tried getting some other jobs, but I couldn't hold them down and it's like nothing was working out. So my family suggested that I go on to SSD I so I would have some type of

1215
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:20.910
charles clark: Like a steady income.

1216
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:23.940
Mary Kastner: What kept you from holding down a job.

1217
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:33.960
charles clark: I don't know exactly. I'm not sure it was just i a lot of the jobs, I was getting were like minute were entry level jobs and, you know,

1218
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:49.890
charles clark: I don't know. I guess I just wasn't ready to hold them hold them out. And then there was like a lot of mainly there was a number of like managers that would just go on power trips and I just didn't want to put up with it.

01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:04.320
Mary Kastner: Like, like what

1222
01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.120
charles clark: Well, I mean,

1223
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.580
charles clark: Yeah, it's like, um,

1224
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:12.510

1227
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.780
charles clark: Before I'm

1228
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:38.340
charles clark: A 19 1996 and it was just, it was there was a job that Wendy's. You know, like a fast food joint and

1229
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:46.110
charles clark: You know, I just told the boss. I hate, I just told the boss. I said, Hey, I didn't think this job. I don't think it's jobs for me. So, you know, I'm resigning you know what

1230
01:22:46.740 --> 01:23:00.900
charles clark: And the guy just gotta man up to you. So he was shoving me, you know, in the back. While I was walking away so I grabbed him by his shirt bathroom in the fry rack, you know, and that's powerful last behavior problem that I can remember, you know,

1231
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.760
Mary Kastner: Where the

1232
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.280

1234
01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:22.200

1235
01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.390
charles clark: I worked with a

1236
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.870

1237
01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:32.760
charles clark: Uh huh. And she she she helped me apply and

1238
01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:37.110
charles clark: I you know I got on it. Okay, so it wasn't that hard.

1239
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.140
Mary Kastner: It was it here in California.

1240
01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:40.920
Yeah.

1241
01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:45.600
Mary Kastner: You don't remember the name of who you worked with. Do you

1242
01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:47.760
charles clark: Know what yeah

1243
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:50.730
Mary Kastner: I just think it might help other people because

1244
01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:53.040
Mary Kastner: It's very hard to get on SST I

1245
01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:02.220
Mary Kastner: Usually have to have a certain medical diagnosis to do that.

1246
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.300
charles clark: Do you

1247
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:04.920
Mary Kastner: Do you know if they gave you one.

1248
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.000
charles clark: I'm not that I can remember off top of my head.

1249
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:17.910
Mary Kastner: So typically you don't have this kind of behavior where you would put hands on somebody because they were being a jerk.

1250
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:19.500
charles clark: Well, I mean,

1251
01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.110
charles clark: No, not, not today, but I mean it was just like

1252
01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.240
charles clark: You know, back then it was like

1253
01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:27.870
charles clark: You know, the way I look at it, it was like the manager was on the wrong and not really

1254
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.160
Mary Kastner: Me. Yeah.

1255
01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:37.620
charles clark: I mean, maybe I mean I resigned. True, but I mean, he didn't need to start, you know, pushing me around, you know,

1256
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.410
Mary Kastner: And he actually put hands on you first.

1257
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:42.060
charles clark: Yeah, exactly. So

1258
01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.760
Mary Kastner: Okay, so what is the diagnosis stated that they gave you for the Risperdal

1259
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:57.360
charles clark: Uh, yeah. Again, it was like you know just due to anxiety and I think it was like high blood pressure. Those two things, you know,

1260
01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:15.330
charles clark: I mean the risperidone basically, you know, I took it because I started taking it because it helps it helps keep me. Come on, you know, and I had like some, some, you know, hard times, staying calm before I started taking it, you know, that sort of thing.

1261
01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:16.530
Mary Kastner: So what would you do

1262
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:20.610
charles clark: Well, you know, I would just get real hyper real excited. It

1263
01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.120
charles clark: You know, just felt like anxiety and

1264
01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:31.770
charles clark: I didn't really do anything wrong. Exactly, or crazy. Um, I don't know, it was just the way I felt, you know,

1265
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:33.630
charles clark: You know,

1266
01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:37.560
charles clark: It was. Yeah, it was suggested by

1267
01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:40.680
charles clark: Some of my family that I that I look

1268
01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:43.980
