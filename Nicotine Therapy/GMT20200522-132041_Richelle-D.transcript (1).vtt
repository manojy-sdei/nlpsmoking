49
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.450
Richelle Direny: So the kids knew

50
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.240

51
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.240
Alyse: He, he put some guy in this mess that was working for them that she was screwing that they're together. Oh, it's that me. Is that me is this guy.

52
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.260
Alyse: It had to be believe in all the shit.

53
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:32.280
Alyse: She's so much of a scared little thing that you're about to get on my messenger I messaged me. No, I never mess with them. I swear to God I Never mess with them. I'm like,

54
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.320
Alyse: Ooh, ooh, I don't know about you but if I'm screwing around with some other woman's man that I don't like. And all this ship was said to me.

55
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:58.770
Alyse: And I'm sending her screenshots of how these dudes are talking about me. I've been like, yeah. Yep. I was over there, all over there in the bed in the shower in the kitchen. I was all over there. But you want to know what I mean. Yeah. Put the phones or girl, girl.

56
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.970
Richelle Direny: No no no no no i'm i'm

57
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.510
Alyse: In

58
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.760
Alyse: A different place. Like, I don't know, like my brain.

59
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:18.750
Alyse: Like he would have gotten away with it to me and I would have sat there and look like a fool even longer behind everybody's like in front of everybody, everybody talking shit behind my back.

60
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.760
Alyse: Like this is just come to light this realization in general they goes so deep in so many areas like I told him I was like it.

61
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.960
Alyse: Like he told me last night. If you don't come back. It's over.

62
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:41.040
Alyse: That's fine, because you're not going to put a timeline on this one by timeline will be when she walks inside a clinic and this is taken care of. That's my timeline.

63
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:53.070
Alyse: And then I don't know I don't know I can't, like, I can't process it yet. I don't even think it's I feel like you're hitting me, but I really don't think it's hit me yet. And when it does, hit me up. I'm pretty afraid.

64
00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:02.010
Alyse: Like that's that's a pill that I can't follow like I don't even know. Like, how do you wake up every day. How can you lay next to somebody like that like

65
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:12.240
Alyse: It kills me because I didn't want to have to leave like I wish I could have worked it out but like I can't, like, come on man, sorry I'm not one of those like women on

66
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:30.930
Alyse: The lifetime channel or hallmark who's going to sit there and just, you know, put my hand on your shoulder and tell you, everything's gonna be okay. We're going to get through this together. No, I will. I am hurt to my core even deeper and I'm

67
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.910
Alyse: Like people might want to act like it's not a big deal but

68
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.460
Alyse: What's the big deal.

69
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.890
Richelle Direny: It is a big deal.

70
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:52.590
Richelle Direny: It is a big deal. It's a big deal because for everything that invests you have invested into the relationship. It's a big deal.

71
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.960
Richelle Direny: Because you

72
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.870
Richelle Direny: You wanted it to work. And you guys have been through a lot

73
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.880
Richelle Direny: Your babies are still young, they're still intense

74
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:12.150
Alyse: Like like while I'm sitting here wondering how we're gonna I'm gonna take care of your children. You're gonna drive getting drunk.

75
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.010
Alyse: That was your first intention to begin with and

76
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:24.750
Alyse: Always your intention was when I left for you to call over there and do whatever you wanted to do. You know what I mean, like, that's

77
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.470
Richelle Direny: you're muted you're muted. Hold on.

78
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.260
Alyse: No.

79
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:46.860
Alyse: I said, you know what I mean, like, like that was. That's the issue. Like you were never like worried about your family at all. Your family is your little bitch ass on that you can feed.

80
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.250
Alyse: Every day of his life and his

81
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.390
Alyse: friend who I have no words to say about her either

82
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.070
Alyse: You know,

83
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.200
Richelle Direny: Is on an addict.

84
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.870
Alyse: Know it sounds just a little bitch.

85
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.330
Alyse: 22 years old still had God and have a handheld by his daddy.

86
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.260
Alyse: Always will have to have held by his daddy.

87
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.510
Alyse: No.

88
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.660
Richelle Direny: I just so what I'm

89
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.550
Richelle Direny: So where is really going from here now.

90
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.930
Alyse: I don't know. I mean, to me, there is no going anywhere from here. Like, I'll just go all in my life unless he makes her good of abortion.

91
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.760
Richelle Direny: But they're not gonna change anything, it doesn't change the fact of

92
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.290
Alyse: The infidel know at

93
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:43.740
Alyse: All I gotta say. I mean, Rochelle. You can look at me I rewind. I want that. I want that fucking baby gone. I don't care if I was on at the end of the day, or not.

94
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.350
Richelle Direny: But hold on for a second.

95
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.020
Richelle Direny: For a second I want you to let's let's process it.

96
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.210
Richelle Direny: Abortion or no abortion. It doesn't change what happened.

97
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.260
Richelle Direny: You're what you're saying is a

98
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:07.050
Richelle Direny: Abort the child only because I don't have to see the evidence of your infidelity, but I still have the knowledge of your infidelity.

99
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.930
Richelle Direny: Like huh

100
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.010
Alyse: I said, Maybe I just wanted me to hurt the way I heard

101
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:29.610
Richelle Direny: And that's what it so but I just want you because the knowledge of infidelity is just as lasting as the evidence.

102
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.340
Richelle Direny: Because the mere Farida yeah

103
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:53.010
Richelle Direny: So you understand so telling her to get rid of this what may be her only child, and regardless of your saying that, yes, it was something that she actively engaged in a relationship with someone who she knew was in a relationship. So just as much

104
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.680
Richelle Direny: As it's hurting you.

105
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.560
Richelle Direny: The thought of telling her This is what she needs to do. It's hurting you. Just as deep

106
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:14.640
Richelle Direny: It's hurting her just as deep. The only differences, your depth is attached with a whole lot of other things. So she gets rid of the child are you now going to get back with him and make it work.

107
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.550
Alyse: It would never work for long, even if I chose to

108
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:21.570
So why

109
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:23.940
Alyse: I

110
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.260
Alyse: Because I'm selfish.

111
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.930
Alyse: There's only one reason why that I mean I'm selfish. Like, I don't care. I don't

112
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:50.310
Alyse: Get it because it doesn't belong here. That is why that is why, like, what do you do, like, you think I'm gonna sit around and let you support some nasty piece of garbage in her kid.

113
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.110
Alyse: And

114
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:52.800
Richelle Direny: Then

115
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.640
Alyse: You okay with it.

116
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.530
Richelle Direny: Okay, she's a piece of garbage and her unborn child right

117
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.750
Alyse: Yeah, okay.

118
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:12.450
Richelle Direny: But remember, the daughter that he has that you're caring for even though you entered this relationship with this already existing daughter. This is exactly how you described her mother.

119
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.820
Richelle Direny: And he supports her

120
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.190
Alyse: Yeah, but that was like already going on before I came around, you know,

121
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.620
Richelle Direny: Okay, you justify the action.

122
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:35.160
Richelle Direny: Because I entered this relationship with her with him. It was already going on, but he still yes only obligated to the child, he is not obligated to that mother, but he is supporting this letter.

123
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.340
Alyse: And you even

124
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.620
Richelle Direny: Argue with it. You didn't move out.

125
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.860
Alyse: Hello. I even though I mean that

126
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.400
Alyse: She lived with us for how many months.

127
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.080
Richelle Direny: But you still use it and you

128
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.280
Richelle Direny: Have no clue what he was doing when you weren't there or when you were asleep.

129
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.600
Alyse: I know you

130
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.670
Richelle Direny: Have knowledge of it.

131
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.350
Alyse: Mm hmm.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.100
Richelle Direny: Now here is it this this baby is in the picture.

Alyse: Yeah. Have you ever been there. I'm not saying like, you don't know him. I

136
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.940
Richelle Direny: Know, I have never been there, but I can imagine.

137
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.600
Richelle Direny: All of the thoughts that crossed your mind. I can imagine. And I probably been there helping to hold your hand.

138
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.400
Richelle Direny: If

139
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.280
Richelle Direny: It's hard.

140
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.090
Alyse: It's like one thing after another anymore. You do.

141
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.740
Richelle Direny: Should love her despair Elise

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.390
No.

143
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:53.670
Alyse: Never, never. And that's why it was so easy to walk away. Yes, me because it's like, man, like, Okay, I've had my little problem. Yeah, I lied about being biased for two years, whatever, but come on me.

144
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.450
Alyse: And I said, that's how it over to different people. Because the first thing you go to do

145
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:11.100
Alyse: Is go to screw somebody because you want to hurt me by like trying to figure out how to take care of kids or what rings gonna be over like

146
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.080
Alyse: Elise, it's hard.

147
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.010
It's hard.

148
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.860
Richelle Direny: It is I've never

149
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.340
Richelle Direny: I don't even wanna feel how

150
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.660
Alyse: She feels

151
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.560
Richelle Direny: Because you know what Elise, my response might be different from yours.

152
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.090
Richelle Direny: Just like there's like everybody's response is going to be different.

153
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.580
Alyse: You like

154
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.760
Alyse: Like you won't be sleeping that bed like

155
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.450
Alyse: Yeah, I have to go to urgent care today. Go get tested for us to be

156
00:14:52.650 --> 00:15:03.810
Alyse: Because now you slept with some nasty mares the mirror image. That's the better route then been tossed around between you and your boys for the past year.

157
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.640
Richelle Direny: So do you mean tomorrow.

158
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.710
Alyse: Everybody that that's worked for him some screwed or his brother.

159
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.520
Alyse: His duty called his best right and for how long.

160
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.680
Alyse: So how are you, how does he short. How's he sure that this chart the baby belongs to him. Yeah.

161
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.960
Alyse: Listen, listen, listen. This is how stupid. This man is. This is why partially is irritating so bad.

162
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:37.140
Alyse: This was what I was just out of the house at the end of April, you supposedly screwed her at the end of April. So that'd be four weeks, three weeks, four weeks.

163
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:46.410
Alyse: I don't know about you, but I've always known that you can't take a pregnancy test that early, it takes like six to eight weeks for you to be able to piss on that stick and come up positive

164
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:55.860
Richelle Direny: within four weeks he thinks that there's these tests that can tell you, like right at conception that you can know what your. The thing is you hush.

165
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.020
Richelle Direny: Nobody knows the

166
00:15:59.190 --> 00:15:59.550
Richelle Direny: Time.

167
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:05.130
Alyse: So I'm probably not supposed to be doing well today, but you guys something condemned me in the record book.

168
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.460
Richelle Direny: You're not supposed to be doing, what

169
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:14.310
Alyse: I don't. Yeah, I'm trying to secretly smoke a cigarette without you seeing me because my nerves are going to the room.

170
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:15.660
Alyse: And I

171
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:23.190
Richelle Direny: camera. The camera. Yeah, I keep I be really interesting to do. That's why, like we didn't conversation.

172
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:29.520
Alyse: Cigarette and I can't help it. And I know I'm not supposed to smoke. So I try to, you know, I've tried to wiggle the system.

173
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:36.450
Richelle Direny: A little bit different now okay on camera. You're smoking, my friend. Now you're hiding that I know you're smoking.

174
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.320
Richelle Direny: What you're I know you're smoking.

175
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.860
Alyse: I still don't want to do it though. I don't want to you.

176
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.900
Richelle Direny: Okay, Elise, I respect that you're doing that, but, um, listen.

177
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:58.920
Richelle Direny: You don't need for he doesn't he doesn't know if the travel logs to him, but at this point. That's not even a conversation, whether the kid belongs to him yes or no.

178
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:13.440
Richelle Direny: It's not the conversation. The conversation is the emotional impact that it's having on you because it's not about the conception of a child, it is about the infidelity.

179
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:24.120
Richelle Direny: And the continuous this honesty about infidelity. Yeah. So car belongs to you, child doesn't belong to you. The mere fact is

180
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:40.590
Richelle Direny: You have just confirmed to me now about this person. And the only reason why you're coming up honest with me about this infidelity. It's because now there's the possibility that this child. Maybe mine. So hey, I gotta tell you, I got hurt and tell you

181
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.360
Alyse: Yeah, like

182
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.660
Alyse: And he

183
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:58.770
Alyse: You know, he told me yesterday that if I left that he is, he's going to keep it. That's what as well. I'll just British can keep it a few leave like for

184
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:10.110
Alyse: Like I have to stick around and see what's supposed to have, you know, I just don't like I'm so like gone in my mind right now. I can't even think like I got so much stuff running through my head. I can't even

185
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.980
Alyse: Focus. You know, you know, but

186
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.940
Richelle Direny: Let's go back to our original conversations from

187
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.900
Richelle Direny: Months ago

188
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.330
Richelle Direny: And I think the last time I said Elise, you can't keep running on and running.

189
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:43.620
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you can't keep running on and running in he can't. It's almost like an abused person who he comes, he cries and he tells you, I'm sorry. I won't do it again and you go back, does it stop the abuse or all he did was just

190
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.900
Alyse: made it sound good.

191
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you

192
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:56.730
Richelle Direny: At some point, at some point you have to emotional abuse is not, there's no real evidence to emotional okay he's emotionally abusing me. How is that

193
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.670
Richelle Direny: It's mental abuse. Well, how is that you have to, you have to at some point say

194
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:09.720
Richelle Direny: I have to learn how to stand on my own two feet like what else does he have to do free for you to come to that place where you

195
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.350
Richelle Direny: Say,

196
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.900
Richelle Direny: I had to learn to stand on my own two feet.

197
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.790
Richelle Direny: And not be completely dependent on him.

198
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.790
Richelle Direny: Because it sounds to me that

199
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.980
Richelle Direny: That's what hurts even more like

200
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:37.680
Alyse: You know, it's funny. If you would have asked me two months ago. Like, what would be the thing that he would do to you, they would like put like break the camel's back and I'd be like, you know what I mean, like, Okay. Worst possible fact. Hi, you get somebody pregnant.

201
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.270
Richelle Direny: Okay, now you're at that road. Yeah.

202
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.370
Richelle Direny: Now this invisible thought has come to life.

203
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:54.540
Richelle Direny: You'll have to come to. I remember when you were pregnant and you were staying at your moms and you said that you were going to talk to the social worker worker. And I said, Why don't you have a conversation with the worker.

204
00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:03.360
Richelle Direny: About trying to find housing learning how to stand on your own two feet if this relationship is going to work. Make it work in that aspect.

205
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.960
Richelle Direny: We're learning to have your own independence.

206
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.360
Alyse: Yeah.

207
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:10.860
Alyse: Yeah.

208
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.870
Richelle Direny: Keep going in and running out.

209
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:23.520
Alyse: And know center. We got phone I have to get on the computer, or get on the phone with like job informing services and apply for some emergency food stamps or something because

210
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:34.740
Alyse: I don't lie. Like I just, I mean, I'm not gonna maybe one day, I won't be this Bitter. Bitter person, but it's too early right now. Like, I don't wanna. I don't want to think

211
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.320
Richelle Direny: If you can hear me. I can't hear or see you

212
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:48.630
Richelle Direny: Again,

216
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:19.890
Alyse: I mean yeah i i played. I think I played with the fact, like, try to play mental games like right now, I'm just playing mental games with them, like all I want is that Mr all disappear. It's never really gonna disappear, but the physical evidence could disappear, and I look at that.

217
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.620
Alyse: You know that. Yeah, I still live with mental damage. Every day of my life like

218
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:34.920
Alyse: This like this is never going to be okay for me. Listen. Like I told me, actually, like, I heard like I feel like somebody just died.

Richelle Direny: Oh my god.

242
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.740
Richelle Direny: Do they do they play with each other a lot

243
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:17.640
Alyse: And nobody really just beat each other up right now. Like every you know they have that like pulling and scratching kind of thing.

244
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.530
Alyse: So they get together and it gets a little violent but they love each other and they like to watch each other.

245
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.630
Richelle Direny: So they get it gets a little

246
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.600
Alyse: Yeah, it gets a little violent just a tad

247
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.730
Richelle Direny: But Elise, I mean,

248
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:45.960
Richelle Direny: As you said, it's the hurt the pain right now, when you're hurting the pain, the betrayal that everything that's associated with it. It hurts you know if there's something that you said

249
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.880
Richelle Direny: That he told you

250
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:49.530
Richelle Direny: If

251
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.210
Richelle Direny: I leave

252
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.070
Alyse: We're just going to keep

253
00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:04.950
Richelle Direny: These little clips, there's this monk, like I guess he's no longer a monk anymore. And he does these videos about like real life. Like if you

254
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:16.050
Richelle Direny: The way we we react to certain situations and circumstances. And this is how it really is. So there was this one clip that he showed where

255
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:28.560
Richelle Direny: It was this concert this couple that I'm aware they had been together, got married, the whole nine and they were trying to hold on.

256
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:41.850
Richelle Direny: Sorry, they were trying to have a they were trying to conceive later found out that in everything that they did. They did. They were not, they were able to conceive. So then, um,

257
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:59.460
Richelle Direny: You know, after their last attempt. She didn't conceive the child, but they've been married for years, but through through this time he had been having extramarital affairs and in him having the extra marital affair. He

258
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:11.070
Richelle Direny: Decided like the woman became the woman came to the house to pretty much confronted. So this woman knew he was married knew everything. So she was bold enough to come to the house.

259
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:19.440
Richelle Direny: And tell the wife, I need to see your husband. And she was like, like what business you had she was like, Listen, I need to see your husband, like she was bold enough to do this.

260
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:28.830
Richelle Direny: And so when he finally came, he was like, you know, what are you doing here, like, first he denied who she was. He's like, I don't know who she is and

261
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:42.450
Richelle Direny: You know she kept being persistent. So eventually, right before he kind of like shoved her way, she said, I'm pregnant. And so when he heard that she was pregnant, like, in his case, he was really, you know, happy to hear that she

262
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.230
Richelle Direny: Was pregnant. So now the wife is now finding out about the

263
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.970
Richelle Direny: extramarital affair.

264
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:48.870
Richelle Direny: And now.

265
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:56.280
Richelle Direny: The fact that he's competing child her feeling is devastated as she is, um, eventually

266
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.920
Richelle Direny: Kind of like what you're saying. He wanted her to stay because here it is that this is something that

267
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.780
Richelle Direny: He wants to he wants a child he wants to

268
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:14.250
Richelle Direny: He wants to child. So he ends up leaving she ends up leaving him. They get the divorce, he ends up leaving him and he

269
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.750
Richelle Direny: Decides to move this this woman in his house.

270
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:28.560
Richelle Direny: They have the child. He later finds out that the baby didn't belong to him. So he was willing to throw his marriage out the door.

271
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.730
Alyse: His relationship that he's

272
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:38.160
Richelle Direny: Had with this woman everything out the door and he you know started this life with this woman comes to find out that the baby didn't belong to him.

273
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:51.060
Richelle Direny: He leave ran into the wife later on in life. She had gotten remarried, he saw her excited to see her. He her. She turns around, only to see this big behind belly in front of her.

274
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.610
Richelle Direny: And he said,

275
00:26:54.930 --> 00:27:00.750
Richelle Direny: I thought you couldn't get pregnant. He was like, no, I didn't have the problem you're the one with the problem.

276
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:14.790
Richelle Direny: So then he says, well, if you know it doesn't work out, like I'm here now he wants her back because now the world that he decided to enter because he thought like the grass was greener on the other side, his whole world and some falling apart.

277
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:29.100
Richelle Direny: The thing is the moral to this is that, and I think in as you said that and I thought about your situation. Like I said, hey, here it is that there's more than because here it is that he sleeping with this woman. But clearly, this woman is sleeping with other people to

278
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:30.150
Alyse: You know,

279
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:39.030
Richelle Direny: You think that hey, now I'm finally going to have this son that I've always wanted. You're not finding out later on, know that kid everybody belongs to you, goes to show you

280
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:54.060
Richelle Direny: That she was dipping and dabbling when you think that she was just with you and he decides to enter into this thing and so as you're saying what you're saying. And he says, well, if you leave, then

281
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.900
Richelle Direny: I'm, um, this is what we're gonna do.

282
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.130
Richelle Direny: And I think in the scenario. And I was watching this little clip.

283
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:14.070
Richelle Direny: He said, I think he proposed the same thing to her as well. And the she chose. No, I'm not doing this because it's not just about the evidence of this child.

284
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.790
Richelle Direny: It's about the infidelity. It's about the deception. It's about all that we've gone through

285
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:32.760
Richelle Direny: And you selfishly thought that you stepping out of on our relationship and doing what you're doing, was ok and now you want me to be in full acceptance of it.

286
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:46.110
Richelle Direny: So I'm going to be living with this hurt in my face daily and I'm confirming to you that it's okay for you to continue doing the things that you're doing, all in the name of love.

287
00:28:46.890 --> 00:29:02.130
Richelle Direny: Love shouldn't hurt that much love doesn't do that to people and so later on she found her happiness. She ended up having her child she ended up living her life. But the thing was, she opted she made that decision.

288
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.200
Richelle Direny: Is it okay for me, all in the name of what I think is love to stay in this

289
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:19.680
Richelle Direny: Where he keeps doing this. He keeps hurting me. He's not thinking of how I would feel about it. He's not thinking that you know what No we shouldn't take this route.

290
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:31.920
Richelle Direny: She opted to move on. He acted to choose the route that he did in the end to hit that brick road that brick road. Oh, these. I don't know.

291
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:46.290
Richelle Direny: But sometimes maybe in order for Harold to come to terms with what he needs to come to terms with maybe this is that where you need to remove yourself from that picture.

292
00:29:46.830 --> 00:30:00.420
Richelle Direny: He's never going to be out of your life at all, simply because you have his goals. He can never. No matter how much you want him to be out of your life. He can never be out of your life. He is joined to you for life, simply because of these two girls.

293
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:10.290
Richelle Direny: He has helped you on this journey to some degree in terms of financially your didn't majority of the work with your sobriety.

294
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.910
Richelle Direny: But he's helped you.

295
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:20.970
Richelle Direny: I applaud you. Every time I tell you at least like I still applaud you. Because when it's all said and done life keeps hitting you. It keeps hitting you.

296
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.310
Alyse: And you haven't had a relapse.

297
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:42.810
Richelle Direny: You still come out on top in the end everything that you've at least you and I have been meeting together for well over six months and no oh a year because how because it takes 10 months to give birth physically. So we've been together for a year. This is a legit relationship.

298
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.170
Alyse: So we don't break up.

299
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:59.520
Richelle Direny: You can't break right now. Not right now. Surely not. Right now, but I'm just saying you've gone through in this last year that you and I have been together. You have been through crap.

300
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.300
Richelle Direny: And you are still hanging in there and how many times have you relapse in all of this.

301
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.090
Richelle Direny: My point

302
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.970
Richelle Direny: You had CPS in your life referred him running in threatening you

303
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.700
Richelle Direny: And how many times you relax.

304
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:32.580
Alyse: Oh, did I tell you that case is closed after they came to my house and had me going pee in front of the lady, because he thought I was going to fail. Mm hmm. Like, come on man real like

305
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.580
Richelle Direny: Am I supposed to expect.

306
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.130
Alyse: Yeah.

307
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.770
Richelle Direny: I don't know. Right. I told him yesterday.

308
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.470
Richelle Direny: So, you told me yesterday what

309
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:53.340
Alyse: I said, is exactly what I said yesterday, I was like I say, if it was up to you. I said, I said, you know what I said. You go ahead and do what you gotta do, and have your perfect life. And I said, I hope.

310
00:31:53.700 --> 00:32:02.490
Alyse: This time, you can actually treat her like she's somebody else's pregnant and like you did me. I said, because if it was up to you. I would have lost those two girls. My whole pregnancy.

311
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:11.670
Alyse: Every weekend drink it out at the bars on your bike screw and Lord no to you don't. I mean, every weekend I said the hell I torment.

312
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:22.440
Alyse: You put me through. I was pregnant is was enough right there. To add a real like somebody who's a logical and understanding, but like, no. So let's say

313
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:35.160
Alyse: The same, right, this shouldn't be happening. You know what I mean, but yet I kept on coming back and I stayed and stayed and stayed and went through so much to look to the hurt was deep enough that I that I had to leave. But then I go back

314
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.670
Richelle Direny: You went back every time.

315
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:45.480
Richelle Direny: So every time you've been through so much since our time together now.

316
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.680
Richelle Direny: He knows about the Suboxone

317
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.510
Richelle Direny: You've got so you've gone through so much like at this point.

318
00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:15.960
Richelle Direny: You've been tempted, because here it is that someone who is in their active addiction, who refuses to admit what it is. So he is he, he's if he's an alcoholic. He refuses to admit that I'm, you know, here it is the infidelity, you're caring for six kids, even after giving birth to twins.

319
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:21.930
Richelle Direny: And still caring for six children ripping and running to school dealing with all of it.

320
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:37.680
Richelle Direny: Elise sometimes in order for a person to figure out, like you have to allow them to fall and figure out how to get up. Well, you have to remove yourself from that situation so they can know

321
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:49.710
Richelle Direny: Because in this case, to some degree, maybe without realizing it. You are somewhat in in in in an enabler.

322
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:51.390
Alyse: Yeah.

323
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.880
Alyse: That's true.

324
00:33:55.170 --> 00:34:00.990
Richelle Direny: You think about in a true alcoholic family or even think about the the addictive family.

325
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.830
Richelle Direny: Every time I come and rescue you out of your situation. What have you learned

326
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:08.370
Oh,

327
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.080
Alyse: Yeah, you know,

328
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.910
Richelle Direny: They're just gonna come get me. Yep.

329
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.420
Yep.

330
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.910
Richelle Direny: And then the minute I decide that. No, I'm not going to come get you. Then you start screaming and yelling and calling in saying all

331
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.740
Richelle Direny: The nasty things there is

332
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.500
Alyse: That's how it used to be with my mom and dad.

333
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.180
Alyse: That was getting high. As soon as I can get. What I wanted to the end of the world.

334
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.920
Alyse: The end of the road.

335
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:32.790
Richelle Direny: So,

336
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.110
Alyse: That's what it is with him.

337
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:42.630
Alyse: And so he can't get what you want to kick you couldn't get. He said, I came to like a man and told you about this. I could have dealt with this behind your back.

338
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:52.050
Alyse: He walked analyses that I gotta tell you something. And I'm saying now he goes tenuous pregnant. That's, that's all he says it to me.

339
00:34:53.130 --> 00:35:00.660
Alyse: Like like no emotion. No, no care no hurt, no nothing for me.

340
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.490
Alyse: For me,

341
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:11.910
Alyse: This ain't about you, you knew what you were doing you knew the chances of what can happen when you suck your dick enter sorry people

342
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:32.130
Alyse: But you knew that I had no idea. None. So my her is as raw as it will ever be. I had no clue. Everybody else knew what I was stupid enough to think that know this shouldn't happen. You know what I mean, I'm sure you probably knew do

343
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.900
Alyse: I rails did

344
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.170
Alyse: You see now.

345
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.470
Richelle Direny: Now this is the thing. Elise

346
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.530
Richelle Direny: What is it gonna take for you.

347
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.540
Richelle Direny: To say enough is enough.

348
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.540
Alyse: Is this truly like this has to be enough. I mean, I don't know, like if I really went back like I

349
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.070
Alyse: I don't even like

350
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.700
Alyse: I don't, I didn't want to leave like I i don't i

351
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.870
Alyse: Mean what

352
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:11.880
Alyse: The other discuss like that pain because like now it feels like everything I've ever thought in my mind. It's true.

353
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:27.570
Alyse: Like anything like I just I caught you know what I mean, like, come back. Go to your phone find you know your your son's beach as girlfriend would somehow taking a picture downtown while you guys are kicking in a hotel. The night I

354
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:35.940
Alyse: Cut my hand open when I hit the door and put my finger to the glass or my hand through the glass like you're in a hotel room kicking it

355
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.880
Alyse: We weren't together because that's what you said, but I'm at your house with your children taking care of them.

356
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.360
Alyse: You know what I mean, like, it's just so much like what

357
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:58.650
Alyse: If this isn't enough then, like, what, what would be enough, there could not ever be enough. So I'd sit around and be mentally and physically abused for my arm mentally and verbally abused for the rest of my life or mentally, emotionally

358
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:03.390
Alyse: Because I think I verbally and physically abused. Now I don't mean physically like that, like, you know,

359
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.040
Alyse: Hey guess what that is.

360
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.400
Alyse: And that's the way you gotta give it ethically and got to give it cuz I gotta take it the way I have to take a constantly

361
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.200
Alyse: Growing something every now and then.

362
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:20.580
So,

363
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.780
Richelle Direny: I think

364
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.090
Richelle Direny: This is what I think.

365
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.810
Richelle Direny: The longer you stay away.

366
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:39.330
Richelle Direny: He's gonna come crying like he does, he's gonna wind. He's going to call he's going to tax. He's going to seem, sorry. He's, he's going to all of them. Right.

367
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:45.660
Richelle Direny: Yeah, eventually you're going to if you decide to hold your own and stay away.

368
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.570
Richelle Direny: God forbid something happens.

369
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.200
Richelle Direny: To him because he's

370
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.360
Richelle Direny: This is what's gonna happen. You're gonna go

371
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:11.790
Alyse: Yeah, but then like that's what I said that I said to my mom like for what I it would never be okay. Like that's not healthy, that it would never be healthy again and I

372
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.060
Richelle Direny: Guess what you're saying. You're saying things get better.

373
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.480
Richelle Direny: When are you going to recognize that it's not healthy for you.

374
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.970
Alyse: For a moment, let's remove the kids to make

375
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.020
Alyse: I think I recognize that now.

376
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:36.570
Richelle Direny: Why, because what you just said if she has the abortion because the reality is we don't know if the baby belongs to him. But if she has the abortion. Are you going to see say, okay, well, now he he really because of the fact that she has the abortion.

377
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.060
Alyse: Or maybe he and tell you that she had the abortion but you're never going to see her again.

378
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.620
Alyse: Yeah, but like I said to my mom earlier like I'm

379
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:54.780
Alyse: Like it even if I went back like what, just to leave again because that would that's what what happened like I will carrying this around with me.

380
00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:02.460
Alyse: Like this is like a, like I said, like, this isn't like one of those things I can sweep under the rug and we don't deal with this is a not ever going to

381
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:09.390
Alyse: Be that way this every day. I opened my eyes. I will look at you and tell you, you are a nasty FUCKING PIG

382
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:20.250
Alyse: So we can never be together again we can get as much as I'd like to think oh yeah that's that whatever like I know like, there will not

383
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:31.230
Alyse: They there there there couldn't be because I'm like, I like how could I ever let you touch me again like this is the thing.

384
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.870
Alyse: What happened to

385
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.000
Alyse: You okay

386
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.590
Richelle Direny: This is the thing.

387
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:47.970
Richelle Direny: You the whether you stay or whether you go, there's always wants to be that in your mind, not so much of the child. But if the devotee.

388
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.990
Alyse: Yeah yeah yeah

389
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.350
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. Always going to be whether she gets rid of the child or not.

390
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.530
Richelle Direny: It's always going to be about the infidelity. Yeah.

391
00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:03.450
Alyse: Because it's everything that I've ever thought and everything you've always denied you literally like just put in front of my face on this shiny silver platter.

392
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.090
Richelle Direny: The problem is

393
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:11.280
Richelle Direny: Outside of the infidelity. What you're fighting against is for alcoholism.

394
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:22.260
Richelle Direny: And his refusal to come to terms with the reasons he's drinking and how he self medicating he's hurt and pain.

395
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:44.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's what you're always going to find again until he comes to that because change will never ever come until he comes to that place to admit to himself that something has to change. I can't live my life like this. So, whether it is he decides to um

396
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.250
Richelle Direny: She, she makes her get rid of the child and now you have

397
00:40:51.540 --> 00:41:03.450
Richelle Direny: You okay, now that's behind you. Something else is gonna come up because of the fact that you're still active in your own addiction in his case, the alcoholism.

398
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.730
Richelle Direny: He refuses

399
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.830
Alyse: Oh, the baby sitting in front of this

400
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.790
Alyse: I'm sorry, I'm listening to you. Don't worry, but

401
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.140
Alyse: Yeah, she's sitting in front of us for a little thing yet.

402
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:23.790
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

403
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:30.930
Alyse: I thought she was talking about. I was trying to get my mom to get her to look at it or get my mom to look at her because she was adorable.

404
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:34.170
Alyse: Sorry.

405
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.900
Alyse: scatterbrained

406
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:42.780
Alyse: In frozen Oh damn. I look rough today. Are you there.

407
00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:44.610
Richelle Direny: I'm here. Hold on, let me

408
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.350
Richelle Direny: Switch my, I have to switch my because the weather, where I am is really bad.

409
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.570
Richelle Direny: So yeah, I'm

410
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.600
Alyse: All you guys coming up on the hurricane season.

411
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.010
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but

412
00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:58.680
Alyse: No.

413
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.430
Alyse: Is it windy. There's something or stormy

414
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.930
Alyse: Know my comfort.

415
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.220
Richelle Direny: Zone. You might lose me. Hold on.

416
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:15.330
Okay.

417
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:23.040
Alyse: Over

418
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.580
Richelle Direny: Okay.

419
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.130
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

420
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:39.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's been it's nice. Now, but all week. And so I think because of it. It's affecting the internet service.

421
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:48.300
Richelle Direny: So the carrier, they keep on saying that they're having an outage, but um what I was saying to you is that

422
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.220
Richelle Direny: You're always going to be fighting with the fact that

423
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.760
Richelle Direny: He refuses to come to terms with why he self medicating what he's hurting from

424
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:10.710
Richelle Direny: We talked about the loss is loss of his mother, you know, even what is, what was that relationship with his mother was around dad not being there just so many other things. So you're always going to be fighting with that.

425
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.810
Richelle Direny: That's always going to be an issue. Even if you decide to forgive him for the fact that

426
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:31.350
Richelle Direny: He cheated on you, you finally came to admit it, and that you know this this child does belong to him, even if you forgive that there's there's going to be something else, simply because he's still active in his addiction, though he refuses to admit it.

427
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.570
Alyse: Yeah.

428
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:40.890
Richelle Direny: You're always going to be fighting with that. So that's kind of one so we peel it back by like the banana and we get to the core of it.

429
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:53.070
Richelle Direny: So, you know, okay, so like the core. Here it is. The banana has the shutter that you use, you have to peel the banana right and you eat down the banana and on the bottom of it. And there's that little black thing that you don't eat.

430
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.850
Alyse: The but

431
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.200
Alyse: That's what you call it the but

432
00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:00.960
Richelle Direny: The book now you got to get to that. But in order to get to that. But you got to go to all of this. Yeah.

433
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:09.330
Richelle Direny: You will never be able to get to that simply because he refuses to admit to his what the because the book.

434
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.200
Richelle Direny: Is where

435
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.340
Richelle Direny: Everything is

436
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.340
Richelle Direny: What is where everything is.

437
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:23.100
Richelle Direny: Until he decides that I want to get to that route. I need to go through the process. You're always going to fight with her, you're

438
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:23.790
Alyse: Always gonna fight.

439
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:26.340
Richelle Direny: But you

440
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:31.980
Richelle Direny: Until he he need to figure it out on his own, just like you to come to that place.

441
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.860
Alyse: Like a direct result of his alcoholism is now going to have a baby.

442
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.900
Richelle Direny: Why you think not gonna have a baby. He is it

443
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:49.860
Richelle Direny: He is slowly district. You are watching him slowly destroy his life. He doesn't see it that he's destroying his life.

444
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.360
Alyse: Oh no no not at all like, you know, everything's just peachy keen to him.

445
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.140
Richelle Direny: Go like this, Elise move over to this side to the controller.

446
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:05.430
Alyse: Yeah.

447
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.570
Richelle Direny: All I'm seeing is like this big ball a son sitting on your face.

448
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.270
Alyse: Um,

449
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.730
Alyse: Yeah, like us.

450
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:19.920
Alyse: Oh,

451
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:23.700
Alyse: Whenever

452
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.970
Richelle Direny: The hurt for you. It's not just about

453
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.630
Richelle Direny: Told you that he's been cheating.

454
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.380
Alyse: Yeah.

455
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:54.630
Richelle Direny: But a part of you have always convinced yourself to continue in this relationship. So you've always known you just wanted to hear the evidence of it. You just wanted to confirm you just wanted it to come out of his mouth to admit it, but you've always known

456
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.270
Alyse: Well, yeah, yeah. Like that's not

457
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:58.680
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

458
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:10.680
Richelle Direny: Okay, she's pregnant. Alright, well thanks for letting me know, because I already knew even though he was lying to me. I already knew what I know. It just hit you like a ton of bricks, because now this is the evidence of it.

459
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:17.040
Alyse: Yeah, I'm like the evidence couldn't just be like some bitch messaging me right. No, no.

460
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.760
Richelle Direny: Now you knew. So here it is.

461
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:34.410
Richelle Direny: It's a surprise, but that it's not because you knew this is all that was going on the behaviors and everything else you fought with a lot over the last year.

462
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:47.310
Richelle Direny: It's like, here it is, to me, the straw that broke the camel's back me personally is the mere fact that you did this to try to get these babies taken away from Endymion unfit mother.

463
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:58.170
Richelle Direny: That would have been the straw that broke the camel's back. Not that you got some key person pregnant is that you try to take away the life that I'm trying to rebuild for myself, because remember,

464
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:07.680
Richelle Direny: You have one child that was given up for adoption, one that you just officially got back, and now you're trying to put me through this with these two little girls.

465
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.080
Richelle Direny: Like really yeah

466
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.320
Richelle Direny: That would have been the straw that broke the camel's back for me.

467
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:25.080
Richelle Direny: But you were able to to get through that you were upset but you got through it because you had such confidence that hey, this is just another thing, but I could get through it because

468
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.120
Alyse: To me that's like a joke like that's like top that's like something you know that's something I expect you know like

469
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:41.820
Alyse: I knew she doesn't have to be on my door. That's no that's just how hero plays, whatever.

470
00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.660
Richelle Direny: That's how they

471
00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.040
Richelle Direny: Play. So why is

472
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.510
Richelle Direny: Why is this so hurtful that he got someone pregnant.

473
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:59.430
Alyse: Something like, to me, it's like, like, that's my special thing like that was like you know what I mean, like, yeah, you have kids with somebody else, whatever, but who cares but like that's like

474
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:08.820
Alyse: Like, I thought I was the last one is gonna be able to share that. You know what I mean like you think I wanted to get pregnant to begin with. No, not at all.

475
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:12.840
Alyse: Really, I wanted to get pregnant with twins. Hell no.

476
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.220
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

477
00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.940
Alyse: But I made it through all that and now you're going to give like

478
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.970
Richelle Direny: Because there was some part of you know

479
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:21.750
Alyse: What I mean like

480
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.960
Alyse: Like there's something in there. I don't know how to explain it. But you gave

481
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:31.140
Richelle Direny: In you that figured eventually he's going to come to his senses. He's gonna love me the way he

482
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:31.920
Alyse: Island. Yeah.

483
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:36.300
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and we're gonna make this work. So you were convincing yourself daily

484
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:50.340
Alyse: Yep, that's why I went back to us last time, because I'm like this can work this can work now. Now he understands. I feel Bobby can be daddy like using to take a bath and girls hanging out with a more and talk a little more and

485
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.650
Alyse: Want to know why you doing it because you knew, you're screwed somebody behind my back.

486
00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.640
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. You use you're saying the last time that we met.

487
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:13.770
Richelle Direny: You talked about the pattern of even though you did so much you do so much for the kids. You said, but this is the pattern every woman that comes in, does the same thing.

488
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:23.310
Richelle Direny: Well then, there was a part of you that thought, well, there's nothing unique about what I'm doing, because the next woman that comes in is going to do the same thing be there for the kids and all this different stuff.

489
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:39.840
Richelle Direny: But I think a part of you felt and new I'm a damn good mom. So then, therefore, he's definitely going to choose me out of the rest. So you saw how much self talk that you gave yourself to convince yourself to stay though you were being hurt.

490
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:53.490
Richelle Direny: After he found out about the Suboxone which, like you said, it's not like it's the end of the world, but he gave you the cold shoulder after having twins, not just one baby but having

491
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.360
Alyse: Ended up at your baby Momma's house. Hi, I hope.

492
00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.460
Alyse: I mean, while my kids are while my daughter still in the hospital.

493
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:03.450
Mm hmm.

494
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.420
Richelle Direny: And you were going back and forth.

495
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.080
Alyse: Saw them twice in the 16 days she was there.

496
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:19.560
Richelle Direny: So we could talk about all the different things in the experiences you've had in the last

497
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.420
Richelle Direny: Where is your what WHERE ARE YOU WANT TO SAY Elise

498
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.710
Alyse: Yeah, like

499
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.690
Richelle Direny: Your name again your own independence, you need to stand on your own two feet and you need to

500
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:49.260
Richelle Direny: Prove not only to yourself, but to your children that is in your life right now that you have to be independent. You cannot be so dependent on someone else that you know you will accept it no matter what the cost mentally or emotionally

501
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:49.830
Yeah.

502
00:50:50.970 --> 00:51:02.430
Alyse: Yep. So this kind of where it has to be deployed. You know, like, I'll just go look a little bit more suffering before everything gets better. But like, it's just there. It's that it can have or be okay.

503
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:20.220
Alyse: I try to play it off in my head but me when I got here. Yeah, I have to be like reality LIKE LIKE THINGS WILL NEVER BE OKAY GUYS. They just won't they will not be ever, ever. You're stupid enough to sit there and I believe that this kid yours, like you ruin my life and my children's life.

504
00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:26.640
Alyse: As a direct result of your alcoholism and your whatever

505
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.070
Alyse: I there's just like

506
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.900
Alyse: So,

507
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:42.390
Alyse: I mean, I might show. My heart hurts so bad, so bad.

508
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.030
Richelle Direny: For why do because it's it's

509
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.410
Richelle Direny: A, it's a lot to smile.

510
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.180
Richelle Direny: A lot to swallow.

511
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.600
Richelle Direny: How are the kids. How are the kids handling it.

512
00:51:52.710 --> 00:52:01.380
Alyse: Um, oh, Mackenzie was pretty upset but like she said yesterday you knew, he's you know he's a cheater. So I don't know what to expect.

513
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.670
Richelle Direny: So she told you the truth. How did you hear that one, she said.

514
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:11.640
Alyse: I just looked at her. I really didn't have my mind was alone last place, although

515
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:21.330
Alyse: Genes only told me that she was driving a truck around and driving Harold around and this and that yesterday.

516
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:27.750
Alyse: So I said, Yes, kids lying to me about said, you know, I mean like this was full circle.

517
00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:30.270
Alyse: Full Circle.

518
00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:33.720
Alyse: So,

519
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:35.880
Alyse: I mean,

520
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:37.410
Richelle Direny: I was

521
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:53.760
Alyse: Trying something over his friend's house last night he is. I mean like you told my mom and dad is like that one was a bad one, baby. He knows what's going on and I leverage that stupid he younger he feels bad for me like he understands

522
00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:01.200
Richelle Direny: It's gonna be up there. I honestly think Elise, at some point, you need to get in counseling.

523
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:08.280
Alyse: Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know it'd be easier to do now right down the street. Most inspired fine.

524
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.750
Alyse: So that'll be our next step here because

525
00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:18.090
Richelle Direny: So when you

526
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.700
Richelle Direny: When you called me. It was right after he told you

527
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:25.770
Alyse: Yes, I'm going like that I learned the same as I need to power shell.

528
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.020
Alyse: Yeah.

529
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:31.500
Richelle Direny: I think it was in the middle of a session on Europe. Yeah, or middle of her

530
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.560
Alyse: Here she's getting up in the air.

531
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:44.250
Alyse: Yeah, so I just was like, I need her, like, that's all I can think about looks like one track mind. The ones I use Rochelle to

532
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.270
Richelle Direny: You see, you see how you have such

533
00:53:49.830 --> 00:54:01.500
Richelle Direny: resounding resilience. It's ridiculous. Elise and I don't even think you understand it because for you. It's like one thing after the other after the other after the other after the other.

534
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:07.290
Richelle Direny: And you still find a way to stay on top cannot think

535
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.690
Alyse: I don't know how I don't know.

536
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.910
Richelle Direny: I have no means that you

537
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.210
Want

538
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.780
Alyse: To go go buy a bag of dope and get high. Like what is that going to do for me.

539
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:25.230
Alyse: What is that really going to do you know what I mean, like,

540
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.340
Alyse: You're all think

541
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:38.520
Alyse: This process out your hero goes and gets another woman pregnant. I go buy a bag and stick a needle my ring of stones and I die in the process. And then, what, what am I, kids get out of this.

542
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.180
Alyse: They lose a mother and a father or they lose a mother and get to go be with a father and a piece of trash.

543
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.000
Alyse: No, I'm okay with that one. Like my kids would never be with somebody like you know what I mean, like,

544
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:52.770
Alyse: I just

545
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.830
Alyse: I'm okay. I'm okay in

546
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:08.790
Alyse: That department me. I can't say that I don't want to go with a bottle of tequila and just, you know, get messed up for a night. But that's not gonna do anything for me either probably leave me in jail.

547
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:11.520
Alyse: I'm getting a bottle.

548
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:17.700
Alyse: So you know what I mean like I can think I can think that process out pretty clearly these days because

549
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.610
Alyse: Where's the don't get my. Oh, no.

550
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.550
Alyse: Oh, I got no sorry sorry sorry you're trying to get a bottle for being

551
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.110
Alyse: There for a minute know so it's like there's no point in me going to get

552
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:47.610
Alyse: And I'm sure I'm not gonna go get high. So it's just like, I'll sit here and do with my pain. The normal way like normal people. Do you know what I mean. And actually feel it and try to understand it.

553
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.350
Alyse: And then maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and have a better day

554
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:56.100
Alyse: When I do

555
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.440
Richelle Direny: You know what

556
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.510
Richelle Direny: He taught me a lot of that.

557
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:06.270
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. But listen, you see if even if you later on. You think about it and you cry. It's okay.

558
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.500
Because it hurts.

559
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:12.090
Alyse: It hurts. Okay, so look at it this way. Name is

560
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:18.750
Richelle Direny: Not hard for a long time. It's gonna hurt for a long time. Look at it this way. Okay, so here's a little bit of transparency.

561
00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:21.450
Richelle Direny: I'm a, I'm a product of a

562
00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:24.720
Richelle Direny: I was conceived

563
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.940
Richelle Direny: Inside of a marriage.

564
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.430
Of infidelity.

565
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:31.860
Richelle Direny: So how it sounds. You

566
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:33.210
Write

567
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:36.270
Alyse: To your mom and dad remarried and you're

568
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.960
Richelle Direny: Willing to no

569
00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.260
Richelle Direny: No, no, no, I'm conceived, just like

570
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.360
Alyse: Oh,

571
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.290
Alyse: Yes.

572
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.990
Richelle Direny: Okay, in America, till there was a married

573
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.590
Alyse: Woman in a white

574
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:54.450
Alyse: Harold was conceived the same way also. His mother was will say, we'll put it in his terms the side, bitch. That's what he says.

575
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:56.430
Richelle Direny: But this is others.

576
00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:00.090
Richelle Direny: But this is it wasn't so my mother didn't know

577
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.320
Richelle Direny: Though he was married, she didn't know

578
00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:05.580
Richelle Direny: But I was conceived

579
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:09.840
Richelle Direny: Yes, she didn't know when she found out, that's when it was just like oh my god

580
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.600
Richelle Direny: So then there was that conversation.

581
00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:15.330
Richelle Direny: As well so

582
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:31.470
Richelle Direny: Why not, why don't you just get rid of me though. Well, that wasn't a cut out that that wasn't a thought back then. And so if I if his wife had said. And so there are

583
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:37.200
Richelle Direny: Four children that was conceived outside of this marriage.

584
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:37.650
For

585
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.950
Alyse: And I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing at my mom because you know

586
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.260
Richelle Direny: Now think about it, Elise

587
00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.990
Richelle Direny: All of us, all of us.

588
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.280
Richelle Direny: Are super close

589
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:58.170
Richelle Direny: All of us are super close, even though all for the for their for outside children of this marriage.

590
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:02.130
Richelle Direny: All of us are super close as children as siblings.

591
00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:13.560
Richelle Direny: I don't think at that time there was ever that conversation back then. Oh, why don't you do this and he does it was but regardless of what it is. Let me tell you something, Elise

592
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:16.920
Richelle Direny: I love that woman.

593
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:36.480
Richelle Direny: The wife, they're not together. They're not together anymore. And I think the biggest mistake my father ever made is when he left to this day. And it's been well over

594
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:51.270
Richelle Direny: 40 years since they've not been together. The biggest mistake you ever made. Because there's that part of his heart that goes back. There's that part of his heart that belongs to that wife.

595
00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:56.910
Richelle Direny: Biggest mistake. Now granted, this was a no alcohol or anything like that was just

596
00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.800
Richelle Direny: Me and being a man but

597
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:06.090
Richelle Direny: We all know her value know her worth and respect her to the nth degree.

598
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:18.840
Richelle Direny: And to this day, I can go and I can stay with her, my children and I and she embraces us as if she was the one that gave birth to us. That's the type of woman. She is

599
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.870
Alyse: And don't you think might

600
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.200
Richelle Direny: Get there one day but sure to help, let me know and I'm sure

601
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.610
Richelle Direny: But, but guess what, Elise

602
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.930
Richelle Direny: I'm sure, just like you when she found out

603
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:34.860
Richelle Direny: How hard that was for her to swallow that pill.

604
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:46.560
Richelle Direny: I'm sure it was hard for her to swallow that pill. So even when we're no longer in existence.

605
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:53.160
Richelle Direny: The mere fact is the core of the situation was the infidelity, and the

606
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:53.880
Richelle Direny: Destruction.

607
00:59:54.420 --> 01:00:01.920
Richelle Direny: That is something that they have to deal with. They will have to. Yes, here it is that I'm the evidence of this infidelity.

608
01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:10.770
Richelle Direny: But at the end of the day, they don't got nothing to do with me. I asked the code that was his life that brought me about, but

609
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:17.790
Richelle Direny: Think about that pill that you are swallowing that so many other women are swallowing.

610
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.340
Richelle Direny: And how hard it was

611
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:25.500
Richelle Direny: To even think about swallowing that pill. So in the end,

612
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.050
Richelle Direny: The child is the one that's innocent in all of it.

613
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:45.570
Richelle Direny: The child is the one that's completely innocent and all of it. It's all comes down to, because now this woman is completely aware that this man is in a relationship, and she continues to engage in this

614
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:54.150
Richelle Direny: So, it speaks volumes about her and god knows what her story is maybe she doesn't know any better. Who knows who knows what her story is

615
01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:54.960
Richelle Direny: But at the

616
01:00:54.990 --> 01:01:09.510
Richelle Direny: End of the day your concern is not about her your concern is not about whether she's a trifling A B C D E F G that's not your concern because she wouldn't be in it for you to have an opinion of her if he didn't invite her

617
01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:11.550
Alyse: Yeah.

618
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:18.570
Richelle Direny: So you're only person that you have an issue with is not what this woman and this unborn child, it is with him.

619
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:30.030
Richelle Direny: You're not upset so much that the fact that she's pregnant, you're upset. Why would he do this to me.

620
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.920
Richelle Direny: In all that we've been through. Why would he do this to me.

621
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:52.380
Richelle Direny: That's where the that's where the core of your heart comes in everything that we've been through in everything that he's putting me through in everything that I deal with in everything that I do to help in state of flow.

622
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.740
Richelle Direny: I see him at his worse.

623
01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:08.370
Richelle Direny: I know his qualities I know his abilities and why would he she'll do this to me and I'm still standing by his side, regardless of what it is that's the heart.

624
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:18.330
Richelle Direny: That's the pain because that's when you sit down today and every other day asked for this. And you think that's what you're going to be thinking about

625
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.300
Richelle Direny: You're going to be thinking about all of that with a caveat of this chick is pregnant.

626
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:26.280
Alyse: You. Yeah.

627
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:28.500
Richelle Direny: You're not just

628
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:30.390
Alyse: Like why

629
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.670
Alyse: Like, like I said, I think that's as far off. Like, that's what I think about kind of feels like how kids like how could you do this to me.

630
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:40.560
Richelle Direny: How you do this to me.

631
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:41.940
Like how

632
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.270
Richelle Direny: So now you find out that the baby don't belong to him.

633
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:52.500
Richelle Direny: And he's like, Oh, thank God. That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a thing off like okay thank God that maybe don't belong to me.

634
01:02:53.070 --> 01:03:00.660
Richelle Direny: But I'm still hurt so okay you're safe. The baby don't belong to you, that doesn't change what you did to me.

635
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:12.750
Richelle Direny: That doesn't change the anxiety because now I gotta go. Have them probe me to find out if I have an STD, and that anxiety I sat with for them waiting for them to give me this results.

636
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:22.980
Richelle Direny: I don't know if I got a phone or if I got chlamydia. I don't know if I got this or no forgot that simply because of your recklessness.

637
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:35.550
Richelle Direny: It's all about. And if you go and you find out you have this sickness. Now, and it was because he gave it to you.

638
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:45.570
Richelle Direny: It's like, how much more will you have to deal with before you say Elise, you have to learn how to stand on your own two feet.

639
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:53.970
Alyse: slowly start learning

640
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.860
Alyse: Okay, with

641
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.920
Alyse: Some other slowly start learning moment capable

642
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.190
Richelle Direny: And I want you and I and I'm happy that

643
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.520
Alyse: You do.

644
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:08.040
Richelle Direny: Unfortunately, even though I wasn't available at the time. I'm happy that you thought for call me because what I don't

645
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.870
Richelle Direny: I would really hate to hear

646
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.160
Richelle Direny: Is that God forbid you go down to urgent care and they say you came back positive for something

647
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:15.300
Richelle Direny: And then now.

648
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.670
Richelle Direny: You become blind.

649
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I can hear reaction.

650
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.810
Alyse: Yeah, yeah. Right. I know.

651
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:34.140
Alyse: Yeah, I had to make sure I got in real quick and then all of a sudden I thought message this morning that we had an appointment and like to be really or she's she just making this up.

652
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.350
Alyse: And even

653
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.780
Richelle Direny: Making it up, you still needed the appointment.

654
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:44.130
Alyse: Yes, I'm like, I guess I'll log into this one today.

655
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:45.660
Alyse: Yeah.

656
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:48.930
Alyse: Yeah, but, um,

657
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.810
Alyse: Like it can get done saying yesterday. It is what it is. And like now. That's just how it feels like it is what it is.

658
01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:59.940
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna be like that right now. It doesn't mean that you're going to feel like that later on today.

659
01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.070
Alyse: Yeah, cuz I'm probably going to be hurt again later. I've

660
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:09.390
Richelle Direny: Been wondering why you're going to be every time you're faced with adversities with the kids in

661
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.620
Richelle Direny: The limited

662
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.230
Richelle Direny: In not having a lot of income or

663
01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:13.590
Alyse: Are you

664
01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:21.780
Richelle Direny: Charles that year when the heart when the, when the hardship really truly starts, you're going to remember it, and you're going to be hurt on again. And you go, you go.

665
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.300
Richelle Direny: You can cut them up.

666
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:32.610
Richelle Direny: You can call him everything you're going to hit the very ground he walks on every time you're faced with all the difficulties.

667
01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.330
Alyse: Yeah, I thought, always happens to

668
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:38.370
Alyse: Every

669
01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:41.460
Richelle Direny: Emotion, you have to go through it, though, that

670
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.560
Alyse: Stronger. Yeah. And that's where I always work out that that's where I always end up

671
01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:53.250
Alyse: You know what I mean, like, Okay, I'm done. Like, I'll go back to what are you doing

672
01:05:55.230 --> 01:06:01.620
Alyse: No, no more milk. They don't need any more help. Just let them have the bottle. Can you get your little sticky hands off of it.

673
01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.300
Alyse: Sure nephew. Yeah, yeah.

674
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.860
Richelle Direny: What's his name Josiah

675
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.050
Alyse: Yeah, just I say hi.

676
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.840
Alyse: Oh, he's a low. He has a cold.

677
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:21.210
Alyse: My I have a cold to this isn't like just crying babies have had stuffy noses and coughs so

678
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.660
Alyse: It's all been we've all been sick.

679
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:28.290
Alyse: One way or another.

680
01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.240
Alyse: And then deal with all this rubbish in my mind.

681
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:47.340
Alyse: I want you to to really just just

682
01:06:48.900 --> 01:07:01.440
Richelle Direny: Implement as much as you can from self care throughout the weekend and maybe for the weekend, not having a conversation with him. No phone calls, no tax for the weekend and next week.

683
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.400

696
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:21.180
Alyse: Like recordings and recordings because their management things that open the lady I spoke to yesterday can give me that information. She shouldn't even been doing what she was doing but she can hear the despair in my voice.

697
01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.520
Alyse: So it's just like

698
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:31.560
Richelle Direny: You know someone told me yesterday, but this person is in another state. But then, but he said to me, he said you know if anybody's having this issue. You should tell them

699
01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:38.790
Richelle Direny: You could call apparently could call your senator of your state because he said that's what you get and everything came through like almost the video.

700
01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:55.830
Alyse: Really no I'm gonna call him. He loves me. I tried to do the right thing and file my taxes this year. I don't have this this this number that I was supposed to need can contact anybody I'm stuck here with like out money and no place for me and my children live just lost my job.

701
01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.150
Richelle Direny: Like your senator or that's

702
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.060
Alyse: Right thing for myself and

703
01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:04.440
Alyse: Yeah.

704
01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:07.200
Alyse: What do they

705
01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:08.760
Alyse: Care. Remember

706
01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.310
Alyse: Okay, I'll

707
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:20.160
Richelle Direny: Just look look look it up and see. Yeah, call the senator and see, because that's what I mean. He wasn't like I said he's in another say he did say he said

708
01:09:20.610 --> 01:09:23.670
Richelle Direny: What he did when because I think for him. It was like unemployment.

709
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.830
Richelle Direny: And he kept getting the same run around and he called us senator and he said someone who's, like I said, what was it a long way he sucks. Surprisingly, everything went through really quickly.

710
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:37.350
Richelle Direny: So, but he said that's what he did. He said he had heard it a long time ago. But if you call your senator

711
01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:50.550
Richelle Direny: Or congressman or whomever and just go from that avenue and just let them know you know you hadn't. This is the situation with your taxes in your stimulus and all this different stuff. And, you know, see where you can get through.

712
01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:52.470
Alyse: With that maybe something will start

713
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:54.630
Richelle Direny: Coming through really quickly. I might that's

714
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:57.660
Alyse: Sounds like a good idea.

715
01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:07.500
Alyse: At least, I mean, you guys want to do my taxes just kill you have some stimulus money please help a lot right now. I'll tell you that much.

716
01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:13.080
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yeah, so call your senator $50 to my name, it really wants to my mother.

717
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:25.920
Alyse: Link. This is about to be getting real interest and if i told me like my my wedding ring back and I said no. I said, Sorry, I should I gotta get rid of. So me and my children can survive like

718
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.900
Richelle Direny: He asked me if I have the choice.

719
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:32.220
Alyse: To go. So yeah, that's the only thing you ever cares about

720
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.140
Richelle Direny: Is the range. Oh, the ink. The imagery ever

721
01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.330
Alyse: Cares about. Yeah.

722
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:48.990
Alyse: No, some other bits about doing some other business finger, but her chin as boyfriend buys apart from a pawn shop.

723
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:51.120
Richelle Direny: So,

724
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.720
Richelle Direny: So every time that you leave, he asked for it.

725
01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.040
Alyse: Yeah. He always wants it back.

726
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.500
Sorry.

727
01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.460
Alyse: Always wants it back. Always, always

728
01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:14.040
Alyse: I mean, he's like, and I used to get pissed off and given to him because he'd say that, you know, certain shifts to me and to give me so mad that I throw it at them, right.

729
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:29.700
Alyse: And I'm like, then I realized how bad he wanted it. And I was like, why would I give you something that you want so badly. When I can get have a damn thing i want badly. You know, I mean, so, no. You deserve never come off my finger again.

730
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.200

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:35.910
Alyse: Like

732
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.970
Alyse: Are you kidding me, that's all your care about your ring seriously.

733
01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:56.700
Richelle Direny: This is what I would recommend, like I said, this weekend. Just practice yourself care, just take care of yourself, take your kids stay focus on them.

734
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:01.470
Richelle Direny: And next week Tuesday because Monday is a holiday.

735
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:03.450
Richelle Direny: Call your

736
01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:09.510
Richelle Direny: Your caseworker if you still have the case, we still have the case with the right

737
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:16.320
Alyse: Well, like Napa job and Family Services case worker because my cases close, but I still have to help me grow worker.

738
01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:30.210
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and see if if if she's not gonna be able to help you, just to be able to you know get another case worker or to get a caseworker she can refer you, who that you could go to just to have that assistance.

739
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:31.650
Richelle Direny: With

740
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:50.250
Richelle Direny: Applying for some kind of housing or just kind of to help you get started. Like I spoke to someone yesterday who lives on high above where she lives in Ohio, she was telling me that she got approved for low income housing and she's only paying $107 a month.

741
01:12:51.660 --> 01:13:02.220
Richelle Direny: So if you if you can find um you know if they can help you get on it, whether it's a waitlist whatever it is they are especially in light of everything that's going on.

742
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:10.830
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, I'm sure there is some type of assistance that could get accelerated because just being in a relationship like this.

743
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:24.060
Richelle Direny: It's not, it's not healthy for you. And even if you decide to become civil with him in just being a corporate relationship. Do it living in two separate home because now you're doing it on your

744
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:24.420
Alyse: Terms.

745
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:25.980
Not on. Yes.

746
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:31.440
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and I think that's what that's what ultimately needs to happen doing it on your terms not

747
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.070
Richelle Direny: On his terms, where you're under his roof and you're having to

748
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.790
Richelle Direny: Completely depend on him.

749
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:48.660
Alyse: Yeah I know, that's when my mom even side. She was like, you know, now it's time. He always wants to play out all these rules for you. Now it's your turn now. We used to play by your rules.

750
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.160
Alyse: Are you still there.

751
01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:57.600
Richelle Direny: I'm here.

752
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.940
Alyse: So, I mean, she's right in that aspect because he always hold the upper again.

753
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:20.640
Alyse: Tell me, I made the decision to leave you gave me no other choice but to leave you could have did this behind my back. Like that's right there should have been all the answer I needed to realize what kind of person. I'm really, really do what

754
01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.930
Alyse: I could do this behind your back.

755
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:28.410
Alyse: Now God here. I got a site.

756
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:34.740
Alyse: You know, so

757
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:38.670
Alyse: Sorry, we're getting sleepy. Sleepy time here.

758
01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:40.710
Alyse: Oh,

759
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:43.320
Richelle Direny: Alright, let me try.

760
01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:48.780
Richelle Direny: To schedule your phone.

761
01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.330
Alyse: Yeah I know she don't smile.

762
01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:00.780
Richelle Direny: Let's meet on the fifth at

763
01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.320
Richelle Direny: Nine. Okay.

764
01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:04.410
Alyse: The fifth at nine.

765
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:07.380
Alyse: That was good to me.

766
01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:20.910
Richelle Direny: Just let me know. We need to make it earlier, for any reason, car, but as I said your, your feelings, your pain you're hurt all of it is very legit.

767
01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:33.210
Richelle Direny: And, you know, but, you know, for the time being. It's also not allowing him to get to your head. Don't engage in because this is so new. This is so raw your emotions are all right now.

768
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:45.930
Richelle Direny: I'm just if you as much as you can not engaging in any of conversation or interaction that is that you don't necessarily have to engage in

769
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.080
Richelle Direny: Because all that's going to do

770
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.120
Richelle Direny: Is just going to make you eventually just become irrational.

771
01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:59.340
Richelle Direny: And not magical because you're just acting out of the hurt and pain that this is all causing

772
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.180
Richelle Direny: Okay.

773
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:16.920
Richelle Direny: So this is, it's just, just right now your world is your kids and you have to just kind of keep them as your, your focal point and you know you have your mom, you have your, you know, you have

774
01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.660
Richelle Direny: Your family alarms right now and I think

775
01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.660
Richelle Direny: That's what's important and not allowing Harold

776
01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.200
Richelle Direny: You can't. You can't enable him anymore.

777
01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:26.550
Alyse: Yeah.

778
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:28.410
