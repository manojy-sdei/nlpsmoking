1
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.960
tracy jackson: There.

2
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.480
iPhone: Can you hear me.

3
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.800
iPhone: Can you hear me okay

4
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.330
iPhone: Oh, I can't hear anything.

5
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.250
tracy jackson: See

6
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.320
tracy jackson: So it says. It says it's working on my end.

7
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.480
iPhone: It's just really, it's, it's almost silent. It's on the it's the super quiet.

8
00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.240
tracy jackson: I am as loud as I can go. Can you turn up on the phone or put headphones on, maybe

9
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.050
iPhone: Yeah, I'm not the man, if you don't mind me putting my ear to it. Maybe I'll do it that way.

10
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.880
tracy jackson: Okay.

11
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.250
iPhone: Is that better. Let's try that.

12
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.130
iPhone: That's got it, got it. That's perfect.

13
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.780
iPhone: Okay, okay.

14
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.390
tracy jackson: So I got your message that you're still pretty uncomfortable and I reached out to our medical director as well and

15
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.940
tracy jackson: You know, he confirms that 24 milligrams should be should be plenty

16
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.500
tracy jackson: Enough.

17
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:45.210
tracy jackson: His feeling is that there are a lot of sort of behavioral cues for that kind of craving withdrawal feeling as well that no amount of Suboxone is going to really take under control and he agreed that there that

18
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.790
tracy jackson: Bigger doses of gabapentin may calm that down. Have you been, have you been using that

19
00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:04.380
iPhone: I have and I think part of it is, I hurt my wrist this weekend, my back was acting up and I I injured my wrist picking up my son. And so I made an appointment and about I think it's about a week just have an x ray done, they want to do have it so it looks like a bone.

20
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.540
iPhone: Sticking out a little bit so

21
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.200
I know

22
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.760
iPhone: It's not good, but it's not that they'll prescribe anything. And obviously I was willing to talk to you first.

23
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:24.210
iPhone: Obviously don't want to take anything for that. But I, I'll let them know I'm on the Suboxone and everything, but between my back in that. I don't know if it's because I'm in more pain.

24
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:38.100
iPhone: That I'm having a worst reaction to, I don't know. I don't know if that has anything to do with how I'm feeling with the Suboxone or not, or if it's just that my not used to being in this much pain without taking anything, if that makes sense.

25
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.250
tracy jackson: And just the pain is equal in your wrist and you're back and you're all over

26
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:53.160
iPhone: Yeah, we'll definitely my risk of hurting the most right now. Like, that's just kind of a steady, you know, background pain, but that's definitely been increased with the wrist.

27
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.090
tracy jackson: Okay, and then tell me how you're taking the gap within

28
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:08.370
iPhone: I take traditionally take it six times a day. But I've also been told in the past, they can just take like three at a time, twice a day or two or two times three times. However, I want to split it up.

29
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.520
iPhone: To this morning. I took three of them. And I didn't notice a difference with that but just some ibuprofen, a little bit ago thinking, you know, hopefully that might take the edge off as well.

30
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.070
tracy jackson: Yeah, so

31
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:32.730
tracy jackson: In terms of so you have that you are sort of rotating for these symptoms you have ibuprofen Suboxone flexor ill and gabapentin

32
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.250
iPhone: That's correct. I don't take the flex while during the day, just because it makes me a little tired and I have to work so I usually just take that at night, if I have to. Okay.

33
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.440
tracy jackson: Have you

34
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.480
tracy jackson: Ever tried light account the prescription will used to be prescription, but it's now over the counter. I know at Walgreens. The 4% lighter King cream, the numbing

35
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.760
iPhone: I do have some of it. And as I have the old patches that you could put on like the kind of cooling numbing patches.

36
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.820
iPhone: But it's not like it's not top of aware it's hurting. It's like the actually the bone like

37
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.710
iPhone: I'm sure I could show you if

38
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:21.870
tracy jackson: You're thin enough the line of Cain will will seep in. You know enough if it's clear, you know, on a wrist. It's always close enough to the surface that that should be okay.

39
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:36.810
tracy jackson: I mean, the other thing is they can you know an orthopedist, and I'm sure in most states the offices have opened up for elective stuff, but they can they can do a nerve block of that risk to if it gets to be bad enough, they can go in and just

40
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.140
Yeah.

41
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:48.150
iPhone: Yeah hopefully I years ago, I had to have an injection in the same risk because I had an issue with the same race. So they didn't injection that mine so I'm hopefully that's something that they could do but

42
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.800
iPhone: Again, it was just kind of like everything happening at the same time. So I wanted to talk to you.

43
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.090
tracy jackson: Yeah, sure, because

44
00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:02.220
iPhone: I noticed, like I was getting those real hot and cold flashes all over again and just some of the symptoms I had initially that I thought were kind of dissipating

45
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.760
tracy jackson: Yeah.

46
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.980
iPhone: And then it kind of started again really bad on Sunday, and I didn't know why that would be or her

47
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.720
iPhone: If I was, I don't know.

48
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.020
tracy jackson: Do you have the capacity to check your blood pressure your or your heart rate when these things are happening.

49
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.190
iPhone: Yeah, I mean I could take my my pulse like my polls.

50
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.600
iPhone: Yeah yeah

51
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.710
tracy jackson: So tell me right now. Like, so how much quantity. Are you taking in a day. And when you take notice any difference.

52
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:37.500
iPhone: I am taking I did take it on Sunday and Monday and I took one and then in about three hours it took a second one. Mm hmm.

53
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.890
tracy jackson: And did you notice any difference in the hot and cold flashes when you were on that medicine versus not.

54
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.520
iPhone: I didn't notice a difference in the hot and cold so much

55
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.700
tracy jackson: Okay. Did you notice any difference difference at all.

56
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.050
iPhone: Maybe I felt a little bit more slow down, like it was a little more

57
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.480
iPhone: sedating or call me or whatever, however you want to term it, I felt a little bit more

58
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.050
iPhone: Yeah.

59
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:14.490
tracy jackson: So, so here are sort of, I'm going to give you sort of the maximum doses of what you can take and how, if I were you, I would spread them out trying to work. Okay. Okay.

60
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.240
tracy jackson: So you're taking the Suboxone and you're taking the film's. Is that right, is that what was

61
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.070
iPhone: The films. Yes.

62
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.900
tracy jackson: So the films generally maybe work a little better than the tablets, but which, which one is generic or how

63
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.500
tracy jackson: I want to make sure I can't believe they wouldn't substitute a

64
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:43.800
iPhone: Generic. I know. And I literally was like 200 and something dollars out of pocket. My insurance wouldn't do it since it was circled a brain that brand name only.

65
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.270
iPhone: On the prescription and I told them no generic fine. They said, No, we have to talk to the doctor.

66
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.050
iPhone: Wants us to do not pick them up. I can't do that either. So I had to pick them up and pay for it, but

67
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.460
iPhone: Yeah, generic was fun would have been fine and covered is that we're asking

68
00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.850
tracy jackson: Yeah.

69
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.810
tracy jackson: And so you're taking one film three times a day every

70
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:13.830
tracy jackson: every eight hours. Okay. And then in terms of ibuprofen. Yeah. And you don't you don't take anything else containing ibuprofen know elite, you know,

71
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.230
tracy jackson: Aaliyah all the same. So you can take up to 2400 milligrams of ibuprofen, a day.

72
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:32.880
iPhone: Yeah, and so I usually do that when I do need it. I do I use take forward a time of the 200 milligram tablets. So I'll take four and then usually I don't do that more than twice a day because I just, I know it's not great for you, but um

73
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:44.430
tracy jackson: Well, in the short term, while you're doing while you're doing this. And while you have potentially a bony injury, I would say, let's, let's just say you take your Suboxone at 8am. OK.

74
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.300
iPhone: I will say,

75
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.700
tracy jackson: I will take your folder. Every person.

76
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.040
tracy jackson: At noon and then take your other Suboxone at four.

77
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.810
iPhone: And then you're okay.

78
00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:03.960
tracy jackson: Know what I mean. So I would you can take both of those medicines every eight hours, but I would stagger them. So you're getting something every four hours.

79
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:11.730
tracy jackson: Okay, print it a ibuprofen at noon Suboxone at four ibuprofen at eight, you know, that are however

80
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.800
iPhone: Okay, yes.

81
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:21.420
tracy jackson: So those are the two I would do that with the Gabba Princeton, the maximum of that is 3600 a day.

82
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.490
tracy jackson: Yeah, and it doesn't seem to make you too, and

83
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.160
iPhone: It doesn't do anything.

84
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.570
tracy jackson: To me. Okay.

85
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.260
tracy jackson: Yeah, so with that one and

86
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.970
tracy jackson: Are you having any trouble is sleep a big problem for you or is it getting through the day. That's the problem for you.

87
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:51.720
iPhone: It's getting through the day, that's a problem. But I'm also not sleeping really well. So like I've been up since 4am I you know I was up quite late and then I slept for a little bit and I was up at four again.

88
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.330
iPhone: So that was bothering me. And I just woke me up and I

89
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.600
iPhone: Couldn't go back to sleep. So that's the problem as well.

90
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.510
tracy jackson: Okay, so, and

91
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.200
tracy jackson: What I'm gonna do with the Gabba Penton

92
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:14.430
tracy jackson: It's up to you. Do you, do you really feel like you like to have something to take all the time, or would you and you know cuz I'm worried about you getting too.

93
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.170
tracy jackson: Sleepy, I guess.

94
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:29.580
tracy jackson: The gabapentin really, you can do it however you know I tend to want to say like take 1200 three times a day. Take four of them at one time.

95
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.350
iPhone: Three times a day. Yeah.

96
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:41.700
tracy jackson: The best like kind of a big way to do it the other way is like you said you could take if you felt that that was interfering with your ability to work because it didn't necessarily make you sleepy but it can make you feel stupid.

97
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.690
Yeah.

98
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.610
tracy jackson: So you know the other option is to take like 400

99
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.510
tracy jackson: A couple like two or three times throughout the day. Okay.

100
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.490
tracy jackson: You didn't take 1200 at night.

101
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.350
iPhone: Okay.

102
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:06.090
tracy jackson: Just to help you just a big so depends if you can take 1200 three times a day, or you can split it up and then take 12 or 1800 at night before you go to bed at one time.

103
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.260
iPhone: Yeah. And I've tried that in the past because I've been on Gabba pin for quite a while so

104
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.570
iPhone: I have tried doing the bigger doses, you know, LATER AT NIGHT. So if I need it later at night.

105
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:27.660
iPhone: Um, so yeah, just, it doesn't really kind of to make me feel anything. I don't feel like either sleepy or stupid. I know to make in the beginning it did when I first started taking it definitely but

106
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:40.470
tracy jackson: Um, the other possibility for some of this, some of this up and down hot and cold. Is that actually could be your blood pressure, you know, going up and down. And so it's hard to know because I can't take your blood pressure. I don't know if you had

107
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.500
tracy jackson: That but the quantity and could actually be making that worse if your blood pressures already already to love.

108
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:59.640
tracy jackson: So again, it's a silly sort of thing. But the, you know, like aggressive hydration because the more you're dehydrated, you're in the if you're feeling diarrhea or anything, your blood vessels will constrict and relax more aggressively.

109
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.630
iPhone: In order to

110
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:08.250
tracy jackson: Maintain your blood volume. So the more hydrated. You are generally, the better off that hot and cold flash stuff tends to be

111
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.990
tracy jackson: Okay, and

112
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.760
tracy jackson: I would get some litecoin cream and just try it.

113
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.500
tracy jackson: You know, just a

114
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:25.500
tracy jackson: small thing, but I really am hesitant to I think if we increase the Suboxone it may actually cause you more side effects. And I don't think it's going to do anything.

115
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:27.060
iPhone: Okay.

116
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:38.850
tracy jackson: You know, and if you go in and they offer additional pain management, it won't do anything. So, you know, like taking 100 or whatever. It's not gonna do anything over and above.

117
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.730
iPhone: Exactly. Yeah. And I, and so I want to talk to you because I don't, no matter what. I don't think that they're going to offer that because I'll just talk about friends. I'm on it. But

118
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:54.690
iPhone: I really don't want to. I don't want to go back on, you know, I'm still I'm still getting through the hump on this with the Suboxone so I don't

119
00:11:54.690 --> 00:12:00.120
iPhone: Want to go back at all. I don't want to go through it again, you know, and I mean, again, I'd rather just

120
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.650
iPhone: Get through it now and

121
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:02.640
tracy jackson: Yeah.

122
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:11.790
iPhone: I just, I was just, I was a little worried that it seemed to have been better tracking of seemed like I was going backward, as far as like that. My reaction. Yeah.

123
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.800
iPhone: And a little concerning yeah

124
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:23.910
tracy jackson: And to be fair, you know, like definitely their physical changes occurring because it's the transition for sure you've been on these guys for a long time. So transition

125
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:38.580
tracy jackson: And also the stress about the transition the stress about the kind of distress about the working like all that kind of stuff and just the it's just like Pavlov's dog. You know, you think about a stressful situation you go for a pill. You know you crave

126
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.830
tracy jackson: Alright so that is definitely can be a part of it and

127
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.410
tracy jackson: I'm wondering

128
00:12:47.460 --> 00:13:00.120
tracy jackson: What have you like what are your sort of go to coping strategies when those things when you start to feel craving and you don't have a pill or the pills aren't working like tell me kind of walk me through kind of what you're doing in those scenarios.

129
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.820
iPhone: Usually I go smoke because that's

130
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:14.760
iPhone: Probably the worst response. But that's, that is what I'm used, you know, that's kind of my get super stressed out, go have a cigarette. I mean, that's usually my most what calms me down the most and fastest but

131
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:21.300
iPhone: You know, besides I know I could be doing other things like getting doing a little exercise or whatever, you know when that happens, but

132
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:30.210
iPhone: That's really it. That, you know, used to be like if I when I had, you know, Xanax or whatever. It would be like take a little bit of Xanax and calm.

133
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.050
iPhone: Down and then

134
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.670
iPhone: You know approach it that way. But that's, again, reaching for the pole solution.

135
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.950
tracy jackson: To. There are a lot of pills here. So, I mean, I would say like

136
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:55.950
tracy jackson: If there's if there's an app. I mean, just something like wow you're smoking the cigarette, like, go ahead and put on some headphones or have an app, whether it's like a guided meditation, whether it's something to it, whether it's, you know, one of those seven minute

137
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:13.770
tracy jackson: Squats seven. You know, I don't know. Seven minutes something some sort of distraction music like trying working on trying to cultivate something that you can just automatically do that doesn't require too much effort you know i find that

138
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:20.010
tracy jackson: A lot of people find it's helpful for people to tell them something to do. So if they just have an app loaded up or a

139
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:35.940
tracy jackson: You know, just something that you can do in the bathroom or you can do when you walk out on the porch while you're smoking. Just a little something you can plug in without thinking that either. If you're sort of person that likes the, you know, just

140
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.990
tracy jackson: 20 push ups or whatever. I've never found that might affect it that

141
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.000
iPhone: Way I could with my wrist right now. But yeah, normal yeah yeah

142
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.140
tracy jackson: Yeah, like a Wall Squat or it were, if it's just a matter of

143
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.330
tracy jackson: I'll send it on the chat to you. Now there's an awesome app called insight timer.

144
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.650
iPhone: Okay.

145
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:56.850
That's free

146
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:05.970
tracy jackson: That one has been probably more helpful than anything for the people in the groups that I've talked about today.

147
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:17.430
tracy jackson: There'll be a part on they're trying to get you to pay some money, but they have tons of free meditations. And again, some people will be annoying and some won't. But you can also do it by time. Like if you only have five

148
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.120
iPhone: Minutes.

149
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.010
iPhone: Or 10 minutes. Okay.

150
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.690
tracy jackson: Something that you can

151
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.380
tracy jackson: Just another source of distraction.

152
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.370
Sure.

153
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.900
iPhone: But, but you don't think anything's actually wrong with me that I'm that I'm feeling that like that's not like

154
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.210
iPhone: Okay.

155
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.070
tracy jackson: It's time for this to happen now. Certainly, if you look at the side effects of buprenorphine.

156
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:56.100
tracy jackson: Some people can report, insomnia, a little anxiety, you know all the things like just like if you looked at the side effects, we will have a wide range of responses. And in general, by and large, what we see.

157
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:06.840
tracy jackson: Is that a lot of it just has to do with their other things other than the opioid binding receptors that are at play here when I when you

158
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.290
iPhone: Okay.

159
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.690
tracy jackson: If you it's off, you put Suboxone there to keep the sort of opioid craving a day. But there's a

160
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.520
tracy jackson: Lot of underlying sort of

161
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:23.280
tracy jackson: Anxiety and other things that that are just either not as not managed as well. Are you there.

162
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.960
iPhone: Yeah, I don't know what just happened.

163
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.500
iPhone: Yeah, okay.

164
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:34.200
tracy jackson: And so hopefully, you know, I think you have an appointment with the therapist in one week. Is that right,

165
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.460
iPhone: I believe so, yes.

166
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.930
tracy jackson: On the 12th. I made sure that that I've seen if they can move that appointment up

167
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:50.070
tracy jackson: But also if you feel that you just need to call and check in that everything's okay that you're safe. I'm traveling back to the States, hopefully on this.

168
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.720
tracy jackson: On this humanitarian flight on Friday. So somebody will be available at bright heart of another physician to learn

169
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:06.450
tracy jackson: But, you know, if you want to check in with me and another couple of days or whatever. After you tried this. And the other thing need you can add

170
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:19.620
tracy jackson: Is Tylenol and it sounds silly but you know talent all was invited and Tylenol is in Percocet. So there's other medicines work better. So you can take up to six extra shank talent all the day as well too.

171
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:31.380
tracy jackson: So you can plug those in. So if, if some of the cues and the anxiety is, you know, just wanting to know you have a pill or something and something new to try, you can add that in. Because sometimes

172
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.580
tracy jackson: It makes the other things work better. Even though by itself. It doesn't tend to do too much.

173
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.390
iPhone: Right, right.

174
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.670
tracy jackson: But you did sort of acutely stop Tylenol as well. You know when you

175
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.560
iPhone: Guys, true. Yeah.

176
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.320
tracy jackson: Adding that back in for whatever that's worth

177
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:58.830
tracy jackson: And maximizing the doses of what you're doing but on a more consistent basis, you know, you make sure you have something every four hours, and it's trying to incorporate one thing

178
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:11.700
tracy jackson: Whether it's a, you know, while you're smoking listening to an insight timer doing some stretching. Just something forward folding in yoga just leaning forward and letting your right

179
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:17.760
tracy jackson: Your rag doll is a super grounding thing or your legs up the wall playing

180
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.310
tracy jackson: Your legs up the wall, you can try this thing.

181
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.550
iPhone: Yeah, I'm wondering if I'm just feeling pain more acutely now because I'm actually feeling it for the first time.

182
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.480
iPhone: You know, to me, and not covering it up and now my back feels like so much

183
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:41.700
iPhone: Worse and my wrist is whatever but my back is just like it's constant. It's just, it won't stop and I guess I, you know, I'm wondering if I just it was always like that. I just didn't feel it as much. I don't know.

184
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:51.180
tracy jackson: And honestly, there is it so when that so you have the capacity to feel more pain because of the way that the affiliates have always been on the receptors.

185
00:18:51.570 --> 00:19:01.740
tracy jackson: And so that does go up a little bit and there's no question when you're not getting good sleep. And when you're anxious as well because of the transition is this going to work the uncertainty about it. Yeah.

186
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.190
tracy jackson: That will dial the volume up on your typical pain signal.

187
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:18.780
tracy jackson: So okay, so don't discount the fact that, you know, your receptors are pretty covered, you know, the Neurontin covers the same receptors, sort of, is the Xanax kind of stuff. The Suboxone is covering the other receptors.

188
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:32.370
tracy jackson: It's just also a matter of making sure that your body and environment feel safe, you know, that's where the chariot back the breathing, like all that will help you know so it's multimodal manner management.

189
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.480
iPhone: Basically you're okay.

190
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:45.660
tracy jackson: All the receptors. You've got the muscle relaxant, you've got the other things on board and now just incorporating those other adjuncts to help when it really like when you would use a cigarette, doing things that you can

191
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.160
tracy jackson: Do pretty quickly.

192
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.590
tracy jackson: A chair yoga session a breeding session just really trying to prioritize those things as well.

193
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.030
tracy jackson: Okay, she through the next little bit and I'll see you Thursday anyway.

194
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:09.180
iPhone: Yeah, exactly. Um, is there is there an alternative to the flexible. I find that like when I'm taking that it's I don't feel a lot of benefit from it in my muscles and it makes my mouth super dry on that's normal, but

195
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.660
iPhone: Like I'm having that kind of reaction to it and I was

196
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:22.020
iPhone: All through the day, like I'm taking them at night like today all day at my mouth is so dry can hardly speak without drinking every two minutes. I don't know if you have a suggestion on that.

197
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:34.350
tracy jackson: Have you ever been on to zanna dean or Zana flex know so I can try that one for you. It has much less than dry mouth, and the flexor ill. It can be studying so I'll write two to four, which is one to two

198
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:41.670
tracy jackson: every eight hours. So it kind of same schedule. You can mix it around, but I would definitely take the first is when you're not working.

199
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.270
iPhone: And I

200
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:56.130
tracy jackson: Just want to be seen to see and listen. If you're sort of it works in a different way than flip through but in results. So muscle relaxation, but it's much more likely to sedate you so I would

201
00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.410
tracy jackson: Try that.

202
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.040
iPhone: At least

203
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.150
tracy jackson: He sleep.

204
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.920
iPhone: You know, and if yeah yeah

205
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.930
tracy jackson: Well, then you can take it three times a day.

206
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.110
tracy jackson: And say ever makes sense for you so

207
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.550
tracy jackson: I'll call that in for you today. And so we can try that. Let's really make it in

208
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.430
tracy jackson: One thing that you can do this more of a sort of cognitive calming exercise.

209
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:23.460
iPhone: Yeah, just downloaded one this morning, my work actually sent us something on that. So we just all downloaded that wrong.

210
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:24.510
So,

211
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.340
iPhone: My mindfulness or something. Mindfulness app, something like that. So,

212
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.590
tracy jackson: So try that. Because really, that will dial up the pain signal and it will start to

213
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.380
tracy jackson: You know, that sort of

214
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:48.240
tracy jackson: The stress that you have a million reasons to have to get all that is going to be sort of resistant to pills, unless you're totally numbed out, you know, right.

215
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.980
tracy jackson: It's just, I'm trying to find that balance. So I'll call you standing. But don't take the flux ruins insanity saying

216
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.340
iPhone: No, no, no. Y'all just got rid of the flex all, I think at this point because

217
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:07.860
iPhone: It's, I don't like the results and and then it won't be an issue going forward to do the generic of the. Is there a difference between the generic and the name brand at all or no.

218
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.610
tracy jackson: What some CDs. I'm going to call them just to avoid any confusion.

219
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.230
iPhone: See it's CVS.

220
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:20.790
iPhone: It's the one that they, I guess they just that they circled it on the last prescription that it was to be name brand only and so they wouldn't do generic

221
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.380
tracy jackson: Okay so CDs on what road and what town.

222
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:31.230
iPhone: Washington and it would say Palm Desert or bring it to do. And so I'm not sure which one that goes under the Palm Desert.

223
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:37.470
tracy jackson: Okay, great. I will. I'll give them a call. Now, just to make sure that's not going to be an issue. And then I'll see you

224
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.400
tracy jackson: Okay, okay.

225
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.120
iPhone: And then Thursday at five o'clock or 530 is it

226
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:52.050
tracy jackson: This Thursday is the, you know, I had said 530 for you. That's the pain meeting, but because we're still working with your prescriptions and I want

227
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:52.410
iPhone: To

228
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.540
tracy jackson: Talk to you more. Let's do 130 on Thursday.

229
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.670
iPhone: 130 Thursday. Okay, perfect.

230
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.190
iPhone: Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.

231
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.340
iPhone: Good luck on your flight home. I hope that they look and

232
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.710
tracy jackson: They work. I see.

233
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.060
iPhone: Thank you. Bye bye.
