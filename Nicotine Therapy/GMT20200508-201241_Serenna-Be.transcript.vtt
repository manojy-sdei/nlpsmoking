Yeah.

8
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.410
Serenna Beers: Have you ever done a bio psychosocial before

9
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.480
Amber Hascall: I don't know.

10
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:11.130
Serenna Beers: Okay, so it's just an assessment, I, I asked you probably 15 questions maybe and it's just kind of gives me a little, a little snapshot of who you are, where you come from. And it's just a chance for me to see maybe areas that you and I can work on

11
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.990
Serenna Beers: I

12
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.030
Serenna Beers: Every appointment with your therapist always starts with the bio psychosocial

13
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.020
Serenna Beers: And I didn't know like if you have any history of substance abuse or mental health, you probably would have done one at that point. So that's why I had asked

14
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.070
Amber Hascall: You if you'd ever done one

15
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.390
Serenna Beers: Tell me about what brings you to bright heart health, and why

16
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.470
Serenna Beers: Why now.

17
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:46.380
Amber Hascall: I just moved out here from Nebraska, about a year ago and I was seeing a doctor there and he was giving too much. He's giving me to 12 today.

18
00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:03.210
Amber Hascall: I kept telling him that. But it, you know, listen to me. So, and then when I told him I was moving and gave me a couple extra months. And so that's last me this long. I had a little bit left that I was going to be myself off of things. I got put in an argument with

19
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.650
Amber Hascall: The guy we were forced to live with the landlord, and I got put on

20
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.030
Amber Hascall: Hold for no apparent reason. And now I lost custody of my youngest child.

21
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.870
Amber Hascall: Father's Sister who his father does nothing but

22
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.670
Amber Hascall: Jugs.

23
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:38.520
Serenna Beers: So how long have you been out of the hospital for what you you were just recently put on a 5150 hold. What was their reason like what did they say that that

24
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.370
Amber Hascall: I needed to get

25
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:54.840
Amber Hascall: For this court date, but the the reason and I can't get it from the cops the head doctor said that this is ridiculous. And I shouldn't be in here because I said their recent says, I don't want to live here anymore.

26
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.960
Amber Hascall: Nah, I don't want to live anymore because we were arguing about us being in that house.

27
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.060
Amber Hascall: So,

28
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.360
Serenna Beers: Wow.

29
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:18.870
Serenna Beers: Yeah, um, do you have is your history be behind substance abuse or is it behind chronic pain. When did you originally start to use substances.

30
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.420
Amber Hascall: Well I, I originally started using

31
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.310
Amber Hascall: Opiates when I had my first section I gotta dance.

32
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:46.050
Amber Hascall: But I I done math. When I was younger, like 15 with my mom just needles in my arms, he did that for like a year and a half, and then I stopped and I went out to San Francisco and

33
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:58.260
Amber Hascall: I didn't do heroin or any of those bad things because I knew about my addictive personality from doing that. So I didn't do anything until I had my son and 2001 and then I got addicted to it.

34
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:08.640
Amber Hascall: For like eight months and then I stopped for probably six years until I moved out to California and suddenly going out my young son sad.

35
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.140
Serenna Beers: Okay.

36
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:27.420
Serenna Beers: Okay. And are you adjusting to medication now. And the reason that I asked you, because I see that you're very sleepy. So, your eyes are drifting in and out. And so I don't know if, like, if you're on a high dose or if you're just trying to figure out your dosage, or maybe

37
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.970
Amber Hascall: I'm not on any sleep.

38
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.550
Amber Hascall: Okay, I haven't been sleeping.

39
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.430
Serenna Beers: So you're probably really tired, I would imagine.

40
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:49.560
Serenna Beers: What about. So at what point do you feel that your substance abuse was was at at it was at its worst that you felt that you needed to reach out for medication assistance.

41
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.250
Amber Hascall: And when we were in Nebraska and

42
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:08.760
Amber Hascall: My son said kept going back to California to get some or whatever. And I can try and come back to be with my kids and I didn't know if there was a

43
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:30.000
Amber Hascall: Methadone clinic there. So I started going to that and I was on that for about a year and they kept giving me so much. I was trying to get less than, like, I woke up and and mythological the bathroom and I fell back and bang my head so I switched from that to people walking to Suboxone

44
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.990
Okay.

45
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:52.410
Serenna Beers: What about tell me. So do you have any history, other than bright heart health, or I know you've seen a doctor. But do you have like any history within patient, substance abuse, any mental mental mental health beside your 5150. Do you, do you have any other history around treatment episodes.

46
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.640
Amber Hascall: I've been to treatment for drugs.

47
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.060
Amber Hascall: Once last kid. And the last time was about like five or six years ago.

48
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:14.370
Amber Hascall: I've never been to like treatment or been locked up because of mental. I mean, I have depression, anxiety and OCD.

49
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:30.810
Amber Hascall: But I've never had any episodes until I don't know what happened that night. I mean, my son, pick me up from work and we he went home and it's only 10 minute drive and we were arguing about something and it was probably about

50
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.440
Amber Hascall: his youngest son's family but

51
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.330

Serenna Beers: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

54
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.560
Serenna Beers: What did they, what did the doctors end up saying before they did.

55
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:03.060
Serenna Beers: This chart charged you did they evaluate you give you like a mental health assessment and what was their thoughts on it.

56
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:15.990
Amber Hascall: I'm pretty much the same is what I thought. Everyone's always trying to say that I was bipolar, even though I disappeared with them. They said that I am MTD major

Serenna Beers: Like, tell me, maybe three things that you feel might be beneficial that you might want to like work on, you know,

136
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:50.310
Serenna Beers: I know it's probably, probably a lot and I would imagine that you've got probably a lot going on. Especially after what just happened with you and just kind of just trying to stabilize from that.

137
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.970
Serenna Beers: So if you can't think, think of three things maybe maybe at least give me a couple of things.

138
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:06.180
Serenna Beers: Sir, any like anything you want to learn about or is there any short term goals that you have that you want support in

139
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.630
Amber Hascall: Maybe anger management.

140
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.070
Okay.

141
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.020
Serenna Beers: We could do that.

142
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:40.950
Serenna Beers: Do you damn and and with anger management up oftentimes a core correlation between someone who struggles with their anger is the inability to express how they feel in a non confrontational manner. It's like your communication could stand to be a little more for lack of better terms.

143
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.010
Serenna Beers: Worked on you know

144
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.110
Serenna Beers: There's different styles.

145
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.880
Like you people

146
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:57.810
Serenna Beers: Okay, communication and anger management. Those are really good ways for us to start communication skills and anger management.

147
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:11.430
Serenna Beers: Okay, let me take a look at my schedule. Let me see what I got available. How flexible are you as far as like, you know, times and everything.

148
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.730
Amber Hascall: I don't even know right now because I know one of my jobs starts. What were you thinking

149
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:33.570
Serenna Beers: I was thinking, I mean, I don't know if you want to keep the same time what times it's 130, we could do a two o'clock on Friday, the 15th. Let me see what because you just got out of the hospital. I just want to be able to

150
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:45.420
Serenna Beers: support you, you know, in any way that I can. I would imagine you're probably emotions are like this, I would imagine. I mean, that would make sense and just

151
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:53.520
Serenna Beers: You know, maybe, maybe just for the first month, especially in until you start this job if I could see you on a weekly basis for for the

152
00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:00.510
Serenna Beers: First month and then see how things go. And then let's then we could talk talk about lessening but

153
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:09.810
Serenna Beers: I just think, you know, I just want to be able to support you in any way that I can, especially right now while you have the time. If you're open to that.

154
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.950
Serenna Beers: Okay, let me take a look. So I have on the

155
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.030
15th.

Serenna Beers: And anger management. Okay, so I'm gonna let the

165
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.160
Serenna Beers: VC know

166
00:19:51.600 --> 00:20:08.520
Serenna Beers: To put you in on my calendar for 2pm on the fifth 15th and in between now and then I'll kind of take a look and see about different things that you and I could work on as far as communication skills and some anger management stuff.

167
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.260
Serenna Beers: Is

168
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.700
Serenna Beers: How's your anxiety right right now on, on a scale of

169
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.780
Serenna Beers: Zero to 10,000 okay

170
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:33.330
Serenna Beers: I'm going to give you a really quick skill. Before we get off the phone and it is it's used for anxiety. It's a great skill I use it. I use it with my kid, and she most the time doesn't even know it.

171
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:42.510
Serenna Beers: But I use a water bottle and you have pressure points that are right here and right here. You also have your brain stem.

172
00:20:43.080 --> 00:21:00.570
Serenna Beers: And what that does when you put cold on those pressure points it initiates what's called a diverse response a diverse responses. It's a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy skills tool skill and when your brain is is

173
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.600
Serenna Beers: When your brain when a diverse re responses initiated, your brain will automatically go to

174
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.760
Serenna Beers: To survival mode.

175
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.440
Serenna Beers: And it'll start to shut down things that your body doesn't need in order to

176
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.720
Serenna Beers: In order to survive survive. The first thing that goes, Are your emotions.

177
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:35.610
Serenna Beers: Your, your brain knows. Intuitively, we don't need anxiety and fear to get us through this situation. We need, we need to be able to breathe. We need to be able to think so it'll shut down those emotions that hinder your process of being able to

178
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.570
Serenna Beers: To, Sir. Sir, Sir survive so

179
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:48.000
Serenna Beers: This is a very utilized skill by probably every therapist that I know and it is an amazing skill.

180
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:56.520
Serenna Beers: If you're in a store and all. And all of a sudden you start to feel yourself getting angry or irritable and you know it's coming from anxiety walk over to

181
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:09.660
Serenna Beers: Where they keep the pop or whatever, open up that door and just stick your head in there. I mean, like literally use cold. Um, if you're in your kitchen, you're making dinner and you're like, so pissed off that you don't really want to grab a water bottle and stick it on your

182
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:17.430
Serenna Beers: pressure points and open up your freezer, stick your head in it. Believe it or not, it'll bring your anxiety anxiety down enough so that you can

183
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:31.470
Serenna Beers: Focus enough to do what you have to do to make somewhat of a good decision. And I say some some somewhat because it takes a while to really use this skill to train your brain to be more effective.

184
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.410
Serenna Beers: With it, because the goal of the cold therapy.

185
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:44.760
Serenna Beers: Is to decrease the anxiety, so that you don't stay in in emotion mind. We don't want you in emotion mind. We're not very effective when our mind is just running on our emotions.

186
00:22:45.180 --> 00:23:00.210
Serenna Beers: We need the rational mind with the emotion mind together makes the wise mind. And that's all about what that's about the Dialectical Behavioral therapy so cold water bottle. Cold. Cold. Cold. We want cold. Cold. Cold on your pressure points.

187
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.370
Serenna Beers: Oftentimes I might even double fist it not in the way that I used to, but in this way now.

188
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:24.060
Serenna Beers: And I, and I'll do this, but I will walk around with with a thing on my brain stem and I, it really is effective. So I'm going to ask that. That's the skill that you put in place over the next week and then I will touch base with you about how it's working.

189
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.680
Amber Hascall: And so I want you to share that with me, it's, it's a simple

190
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:35.520
Serenna Beers: Easy to remember skill in between fingers right here pressure points or do your brain stamp or any you know any anywhere.

191
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.780
Serenna Beers: Where you know that you can feel a vein running through, you know what I mean.

192
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.150
Serenna Beers: It's very effective.

193
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.440
So,

194
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:57.360
Serenna Beers: Is there anything, any other thing that I that I that I can do for you know that I can do for you. Is there any other support that you need from me, before we get off the phone.

195
00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.310
Amber Hascall: So,

196
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:11.490
Serenna Beers: No. Okay. Just remember that your circumstances are temporary. It's not always going to be this this way and we just got to push you until we can get through to the other side, whatever that looks like.

197
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:18.720
Serenna Beers: But at the end of the day, worrying and stressing isn't going to change whatever your situation is right. It's how you react to it.

198
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.130
Amber Hascall: Right.

199
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.080
