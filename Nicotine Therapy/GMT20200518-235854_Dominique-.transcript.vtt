00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.390
Martin Price: I should have given the virtual clinic more time it's it's just they have to go to these individual breakout sessions. Now,

2
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.260
Martin Price: It doesn't work as smoothly as it used to. Sorry.

3
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.200
Dominique Pozo: That's okay. So just for so I know if I can tell other patients, how long did you give yourself and how long do you think would be best to give yourself.

4
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.040
Martin Price: Gosh, I only gave myself about five minutes and I probably I should have just done it earlier in the day or at quarter tell

5
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.700
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, I usually don't give the number till probably like 20 minutes before the session.

6
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.710
Dominique Pozo: So it wouldn't be there.

7
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.180
Dominique Pozo: Earlier in the day. Yeah.

8
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.530
Martin Price: Okay, um, they said that you can do it any time but for four hours before the meeting that maybe that's for

9
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.530
Dominique Pozo: Well, you know, maybe you can you can check in and do everything and then they'll call you back. Once I give you, once I give them the number. So, yeah.

10
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.780
Dominique Pozo: Actually, if you want to do it early in their data. I bet that's fine. I just, they won't give you the number until about 20 minutes 1520 minutes before the session.

11
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.400
Martin Price: Okay, well I'm here.

12
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.140
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. How's it going,

13
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.260
Martin Price: I'm better. I just

14
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.400
Martin Price: I don't know, I just kind of gave up on trying to ratchet down so quickly, because it was, you know, it was actually just getting like bouts of depression and everything so

15
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.620
Martin Price: You know, I'm just going to go slower.

16
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.980
Dominique Pozo: I think that's really great Martin. I mean,

17
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:14.730
Dominique Pozo: Aside from your own judgments around what you're doing, which are valid and I want to honor them. I just, aside from that, I don't see a rush. You know, it's like

18
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.630
Dominique Pozo: We can keep working through those judgments and see if you know maybe you'll have

19
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.860
Dominique Pozo: You'll be able to find more space, a piece around at all.

20
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.380
Martin Price: Yeah, right now I'm just

21
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.500
Martin Price: I don't have a choice. I like I can't just take

22
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.100
Martin Price: A couple months off and, like, go to a treatment center and and then just expect like I've been through this before you know it takes a while to get your motivation back and

23
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.970
Martin Price: So,

24
00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.980
Martin Price: Really where I am, is I just have to deal with it as best I can and take advantage of this job and this contract rate and everything and just do the best I can.

25
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.360
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like you're coming to some acceptance around

26
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.120
Martin Price: Yeah, and I'm, you know, feeling a lot better when I actually when I took the regular dose. It was like, I feel fine, you know,

27
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.930
Martin Price: I'm not like

28
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.510
Martin Price: On the verge of crying.

29
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.950
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh, uh huh.

30
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.610
Martin Price: profound effect on me.

31
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.140
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Sounds like it sounds like it's really kind of rattling and

32
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.160
Martin Price: Yeah.

33
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.300
Dominique Pozo: So regulating although and I'm kind of interested in the tears, what, when, when you feel like crying. Is there something really attached to it or is it just you can feel that there's an imbalance in the chemistry.

34
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.200
Martin Price: It's both. And what happens is I get really depressed and then I start attacking myself, you know,

35
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.270
Martin Price: All the stupid things are done in the last two or three years and

36
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.910
Martin Price: It just gets really grim, you know, and I know it's you know

37
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.470
Martin Price: It's like a temporary thing but

38
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.170
Martin Price: You know, I'm tired. I guess I get tired of being miserable. So

39
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.690
Dominique Pozo: What

40
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:28.470
Dominique Pozo: When the tears come. What is that about because I think you know whether you're tapering or not, it's worth looking at that, you know, those emotions that are strong enough to elicit tears. What, what is the wrapped up in that

41
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.280
Martin Price: Well, I mean, I do think it's triggered by like withdrawal or whatever my

42
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.910
Dominique Pozo: Brain

43
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.690
Wanting more

44
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.210
Martin Price: But it's just

45
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.500
Martin Price: You know it's me like judging myself for being 60 years old and

46
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.020
Martin Price: Having to start all over again financially and everything.

47
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.110
Martin Price: And I

48
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:16.410
Martin Price: Good Michelle like girlfriend. I used to be with. I finally hooked up with a lawyer, and you know kind of sent a letter and said, hey, we had a financial agreement, you know, and what's the deal so

49
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.460
Martin Price: It looks like she did buy this business like God, she bought and so

50
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.870
Martin Price: Maybe something good will come out of it. I don't know. It's

51
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.390
Martin Price: pretty crappy that she doesn't feel like she should have to pay it back.

52
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.990
Dominique Pozo: Yes, definitely. I'm glad you got a lawyer for that.

53
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.540
Martin Price: You know, because I get so mixed up with spirituality to it's like

54
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.230
Martin Price: Know there's a section in the Bible culpa.

55
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.990
Martin Price: Songs and

56
00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:03.600
Martin Price: You know, it's, it's all about if you forgive someone else that their debt, and you know, God will forgive you and

57
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.520
Martin Price: I don't know where you draw the line. You know, it's like

58
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:28.650
Dominique Pozo: I'm going to invite you to just check in with your, your gut, like what what you know is right. Regardless, I think those are nice concepts they could be true yet with Michelle. It's this is a particular situation with a particular history.

59
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.790
So, I mean,

60
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.370
Martin Price: He's literally just being irresponsible. Once you know saying, I don't have to pay this and

61
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.470
Martin Price: So I think of the lawyer was the right way.

62
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.360
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

63
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.570
Dominique Pozo: I do too. Yeah.

64
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.790
Martin Price: Um,

65
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.160
Martin Price: And then I don't, I don't know, today I just got

66
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.270
Martin Price: Kind of challenged with

67
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:07.950
Martin Price: Doing a specification at work that I kind of just don't know anything about, you know, and I don't even know where to start and

68
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.320
Martin Price: So I got really rattled you know

69
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.890
Martin Price: I don't like working alone at home. I like

70
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.530
Martin Price: I would go be asking people, you know, in the office. You know, like, how would you approach this. Do you have any ideas on this.

71
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.990
Martin Price: It's just different when you have to call them or email them, you know, and

72
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.630
Martin Price: Then it's kind of like, well, they're busy, you know, and I don't know, I just think personal interaction is the best

73
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:48.840
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so, so kind of you're struggling with not having that support around you and

74
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.390
Dominique Pozo: Me forces of people

75
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.310
Martin Price: Right, yeah.

76
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:02.310
Martin Price: The guy. I think I told you I what happened was there fire protection engineering cancer and

77
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:13.290
Martin Price: I was able to spend a couple months with them, trying to figure out the plan. He'd put together and all of his assumptions and the way he was going to go forward and then he just laughed, you know,

78
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:22.230
Martin Price: So I'm just stuck with a lot of like documents that were done during his reign, you know, and

79
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.070
Martin Price: I don't quite know like

80
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:35.010
Martin Price: Where he got his information and it's, it's just, you know, not a fire protection in here.

81
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.390
Martin Price: So I don't get

82
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.820
Martin Price: It down deep and find someplace to start and then hopefully it'll start flowing, you know,

83
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.350
Martin Price: You stifling a yawn.

84
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.180
Dominique Pozo: No.

85
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.230
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's

86
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.000
Dominique Pozo: That perspective I've been up

87
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.380
Dominique Pozo: To 30 I couldn't sleep. I, I had a strong dream and I have been

88
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:06.660
Dominique Pozo: Over. Oh my gosh, it's to its to 20 here. I've been up for about 12 hours. So you're not boring me. I've just been up for a long time.

89
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.400
Martin Price: Is it a scary dream or something.

90
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.350
Dominique Pozo: Oh no, is a very powerful gene. Yeah.

91
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.670
It's very powerful.

92
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.020
Dominique Pozo: Speaking of dreams do you are you having dreams. I'm just thinking

93
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:28.410
Dominique Pozo: Of everything that's up in your psyche. What, are there any that you're willing to share with me because I think sometimes it's helpful to listen to and and look at the dreams.

94
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.680
Martin Price: One of them before we're kind of

95
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.640
Martin Price: About my ex wife like

96
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:47.970
Martin Price: You know, she would be with like another she'd be married him is with another guy or or she just like

97
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.630
Martin Price: You know,

98
00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:01.260
Martin Price: I would talk to her on the phone and you know she just had her own life. And she was all you know i just like

99
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.200
Martin Price: I know there's like still a lot of

100
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.150
Martin Price: I guess remorse on my part, or whatever, you know,

101
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.380
Martin Price: And I don't know.

102
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:27.690
Martin Price: You know, I've talked about it a lot with the counselor and stuff like that and like what happened. And whose fault it was and all that kind of thing. And

103
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.180
Martin Price: It was. Yeah, just some really difficult circumstances, you know,

104
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:35.880
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

105
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.350
Dominique Pozo: And so lately. So that was those dreams were happening but

106
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.670
Yeah.

107
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.140
Martin Price: I'm trying to think of some of the ones I've had lately. This

108
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.320
Martin Price: Like weird skiing dreams and

109
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:03.300
Martin Price: Dreams that like I'm still addicted to drugs and, you know,

110
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:16.380
Martin Price: You know, trying to find a way to cover up my usage or something like that, you know, stuff that like we've been talking about the guilt that I have

111
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.210
Martin Price: And

112
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.780
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know.

113
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:34.020
Dominique Pozo: I just, I had an idea about 10 minutes ago, and I just came back into my mind. So I'm wondering if it would be helpful for you to make a time

114
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.300
Dominique Pozo: And what because one thing I'm hearing as I have been hearing is this desire to be like

115
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:53.430
Dominique Pozo: Off the Suboxone and just be done yet, you're in the process right now. So rather than the destination then host is very cliche, but it's, there's some truth to it. I'm curious about, you know, the journey to get there.

116
00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:02.910
Dominique Pozo: And so I'm wondering where it would be helpful to start a timeline. Definitely. Michelle, I don't know, maybe your ex wife.

117
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.760
Dominique Pozo: And somehow just illustrate like okay these are major

118
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.380
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I know who Jessica is she's trying to get into the room like a letter and

119
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:24.330
Dominique Pozo: These are major events you know your your previous wife. And what happened with Wiley and how that ended.

120
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.620
Dominique Pozo: And then, Michelle. I don't know if there's anyone in between that, but then Michelle's another significant one and then I would say from

121
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.340
Dominique Pozo: Miss the ending with Michelle. And then if you can for see into the future being off of Suboxone

122
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:59.040
Dominique Pozo: I'm curious for you to fill in the process of these major events and then really imagine into what could this process look like, what would you know from the ending with Michelle on to you being off of the Suboxone. What are the gifts that could potentially and maybe are right now happening.

123
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.870
Dominique Pozo: As you're in this process, because it seems like it's not going to happen quickly. You're kind of accepting that

124
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.730
Dominique Pozo: You're not going to go to treatment program at this time. So here you are, you're here.

125
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.430
Martin Price: Yeah, I just can't financially do that.

126
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.760
Dominique Pozo: So let's focus on this. This process that you're in, because this is all you got, you know,

127
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:37.260
Dominique Pozo: So maybe paint a picture for me of some some major gifts that have come of all of this, some lessons, some opportunities gifts and then we imagine into what could be possible in this recovery process.

128
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.220
Martin Price: Just got like significant a dancer. That seems I broke up with Michelle.

129
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:55.860
Dominique Pozo: No, no. What I'm, what I'm inviting you to do is to think of from that time and then look ahead until

130
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:13.020
Dominique Pozo: When you imagine just put in any any date year that feels realistic to around being off the Suboxone and then imagine. Imagine what this process could be the most fruitful process of recovery. What would that look like

131
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.120
Dominique Pozo: Does that make sense.

132
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:26.190
Dominique Pozo: I'm not asking you to relay what has happened. I'm asking you to imagine what could happen in this process, it's setting some intentions.

133
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.530
Martin Price: Okay.

134
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.080
Dominique Pozo: Okay, what what happened.

135
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:48.450
Dominique Pozo: Oh, yeah.

136
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:49.890
Martin Price: Little bit.

137
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.720
Martin Price: Of history in

138
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.820
Martin Price: And it's just like a bunch of milestones on a timeline.

139
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:57.840
Okay.

140
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.500
Dominique Pozo: And which one stand out for you.

141
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.910
Dominique Pozo: Or what do you want to tell me about. Tell me about something.

142
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.050
Martin Price: Just kind of like my dream or my hope about

143
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.440
Martin Price: The future.

144
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.140
Martin Price: We things return out

145
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.470
Martin Price: Okay, of course, they tell you never make a plan, you know, but

146
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.560
Dominique Pozo: Well, it's nice to have an intention and then see how things unfold. It's

147
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.810
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

148
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.460
Martin Price: That's probably nothing helpful.

149
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:42.480
Dominique Pozo: Oh no, that helps that helps. I can see it. So, okay, let's see black black Michelle block Michelle.

150
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.600
Martin Price: Yeoh. That's basically when it broke up with her.

151
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:53.340
Dominique Pozo: Back to Wisconsin meet April place to stay. So that ok so now this is what you're envisioning

152
00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:06.810
Dominique Pozo: Immediate from place to say sailing kayak padam 40 Lake Michigan settlement with Michelle great skiing in Southwest with April nice off Suboxone okay

153
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.810
Dominique Pozo: Other than the

154
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:28.230
Dominique Pozo: What is the relationship financial stability happy relationship. Beautiful. Take a moment, Martin and let that in let in what you've what you've, you know, envisioned for yourself. And just what does that feel like to

155
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:34.770
Dominique Pozo: Give yourself that permission to dream of what you want and really imagine that it's possible.

156
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.010
Martin Price: It's like I just feel like I've had

157
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.090
Martin Price: Kind of a run of bad luck, you know, and I and then

158
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.610
Martin Price: You know my counselor spiritual guy is always just

159
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.170
Martin Price: You know,

160
00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:04.140
Martin Price: Don't have unrealistic expectations and just accept what God gives you and be grateful and that

161
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:18.720
Dominique Pozo: I don't want to say he's wrong. I just wanted to say what I hear with that is it's staying really small and here so you can be so big. Why not, you know, why not be the big

162
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:27.510
Dominique Pozo: One. Yeah, please give it a go. I want to really encourage you to not stay small and just let yourself dream everything you wanted

163
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.050
Martin Price: That would be

164
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.050
Martin Price: You know, wonderful.

165
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:40.200
Dominique Pozo: Don't do this is kind of a silly question, but wouldn't you like a wonderful a

166
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.190
Martin Price: Yeah.

167
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.290
Martin Price: No, I know like

168
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:53.280
Martin Price: I keep telling myself God's will for me is to make myself happy or to be happy. He wants me to be happy.

169
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.270
Martin Price: God wants me to be happy and

170
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.960
Martin Price: But then I'm just so down on myself for being on the buprenorphine that

171
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.970
Martin Price: It's like, I can't let myself be happy, you know,

172
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:11.820
Martin Price: Be happy.

173
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.410
Dominique Pozo: How does this. How does this phrase sound to you.

174
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:26.940
Dominique Pozo: For now, you are on the buprenorphine to get you to the place you want to be. And it's supporting that it's supporting you in your journey to get to where you want to be.

175
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.890
Martin Price: Definitely

176
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.070
Martin Price: You know, off of pain pills and

177
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.250
Martin Price: I feel like I have some stability.

178
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.170
Martin Price: I just like

179
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:54.540
Martin Price: Have the whole na programs so ingrained in my head. I was in it for a long time, you know, and just the whole idea of

180
00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:03.930
Martin Price: You know, being on whatever if it was methadone or medical marijuana or whatever, you know, is just this

181
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.510
Martin Price: You know, a total non starter in that program and

182
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:22.170
Martin Price: So I'm just in a really like right now and I feel really good. I feel really balanced.

183
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.300
Martin Price: You know, I feel like I'm usage and everything, and that the dose. I'm taking ism.

184
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.250
Martin Price: With the word be

185
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:50.160
Martin Price: Giving me bad judgment or like I'm not making bad judgments at work or something like that. And I would think after nine months, they would have said something if they thought that I wasn't capable

186
00:24:50.850 --> 00:25:04.080
Dominique Pozo: Definitely. I think that's a good gauge to recognize that. Okay, you're on the Suboxone and your work is reflecting back to you that you're doing good. You're doing well. They still want you. It's not

187
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.360
Martin Price: It's not the type of place where you get a lot of compliments engineers, just don't know.

188
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:09.780
Yeah.

189
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.400
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

190
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.630
Martin Price: No, my boss is trying, but he's just very

191
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.730
Martin Price: They're very much. Show me type people, you know,

192
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:32.730
Martin Price: Um, but yeah, I mean, this is kind of an interesting exercise because it's things that I've been thinking about that. I'm sort of working towards and

193
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.090
Martin Price: But it's like I can't allow myself to

194
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.970
Martin Price: Like I can work towards him. I just can't like have unrealistic expectations.

195
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:58.620
Dominique Pozo: Well, I mean, I, I'm just gonna ask you very honestly dude does any of that seem unrealistic to you what you've written

196
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:09.300
Martin Price: No, I mean, I told April and like trying to taper off this pain medicine and I'm pretty open about it.

197
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:18.540
Martin Price: I think the only thing she doesn't know for sure is that I smoke but her son smoke. So that was, that was good to hear.

198
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.530
Martin Price: Em.

199
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.300
Martin Price: You know, I can't like

200
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.610
Martin Price: Equate my happiness to being

201
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:41.220
Martin Price: You know, in a relationship with her someone else you know i know i gotta learn to love myself and be happy with myself, but

202
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

203
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.530
Martin Price: Well, I think it's also an unrealistic expectation to expect me to like

204
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.020
Martin Price: Learn to love myself in

205
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.660
Martin Price: Each 60

206
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.710
Martin Price: I mean, I

207
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:09.990
Martin Price: Like it would be a big transformation for me to be like, Okay, I'm just gonna, I'm just in it for me and

208
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:21.090
Martin Price: I'm gonna, like, go have a meal alone at a fancy restaurant and enjoy it, you know, and it's just me. You know, it's just not me.

209
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.310
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm going to validate that Martin. I mean, one thing that I've heard since we started

210
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:33.090
Dominique Pozo: Working together is how much you value companionship and there's nothing, there's nothing wrong with that. I think

211
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:45.870
Dominique Pozo: The thing that I just want to keep checking in around is, you know, are you overriding your own needs. Are you overriding your, your truth or your values, just to be in relationships so

212
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.700
Dominique Pozo: I think that's the thing that we can keep checking off. But, I mean, it's such a

213
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.050
Dominique Pozo: Human thing. We're here to

214
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:58.320
Dominique Pozo: Relate where we are, you know, interdependent species we need each other so

215
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:06.030
Dominique Pozo: I don't want to encourage you to just go be alone that self love. No, it's okay if you choose to want to be in partnership

216
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.600
Dominique Pozo: How can you love yourself through that. Yeah.

217
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:10.800
Yeah.

218
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.350
Martin Price: It's been

219
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.670
Martin Price: I've definitely been working on like

220
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:25.050
Martin Price: You know, just taking care of myself and sort of keeping my world, small and

221
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.310
Martin Price: You know, it just, I feel like I'm in a lot of fear.

222
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.090
Martin Price: And guilt, you know,

223
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.240
Dominique Pozo: What

224
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:53.850
Dominique Pozo: Let's see, we have plenty of time. Will you make a list of the fear and the guilt what's underneath those two headings.

225
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.370
Martin Price: Like I need the buprenorphine to stay motivated and

226
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.590
Martin Price: Survive at work.

227
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.200
Martin Price: Another fear is like rejection by April.

228
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:59.940
Martin Price: And like a third one is a general bands and I can't get another one because I'm on the beep an orphan.

229
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.790
Martin Price: couldn't pass a drug test.

230
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.300
Dominique Pozo: Can you read the first one again.

231
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.000
Martin Price: I need the buprenorphine to stay stay motivated and survive at work.

232
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:14.700
Martin Price: Right.

233
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:24.300
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so there's a. Okay, so just to distill it. I hear a fear of dependency a fear of rejection. And then what was the third one again.

234
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:29.550
Martin Price: I'm like the current job I man ends and I can't get a new one.

235
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.040
Martin Price: Because of drug testing.

236
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.770
Dominique Pozo: So,

237
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:42.810
Dominique Pozo: I mean,

238
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:53.460
Dominique Pozo: I think, I think the the main, the one that's sticking out. Well, which one sticks out for you. What's one that we can focus on moving forward to begin with.

239
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.440
Martin Price: The first one

240
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:02.730
Dominique Pozo: The first one

241
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.850
Martin Price: Is where you know I get depending on it and it. I feel like it does help me.

242
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.010
Martin Price: Complete like monotonous tasks.

243
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:17.670
And

244
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.940
Martin Price: You yet. I know.

245
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.800
Martin Price: I have like this creativity in me. Anyway, I mean,

246
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:27.210
Martin Price: I've

247
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:33.990
Martin Price: And went for like 16 years like clean and sober and did really well.

248
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.790
Martin Price: It's funny. It's kind of a long story because

249
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.550
Martin Price: What happened to me was like in graduate school.

250
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:57.240
Martin Price: I started taking it was like a mild opiate. It was called modal. It's like an anti diarrheal

251
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.830
Martin Price: And

252
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:05.700
Martin Price: It's like all the sudden I could focus and I was motivated. I started getting A's and

253
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.220
Martin Price: So,

254
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.070
Martin Price: I had this strong

255
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.740
Martin Price: I don't know what the word is I just felt like it really helped me, you know, like say Adderall might help someone else.

256
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.890
Martin Price: And

257
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.350
Martin Price: So for about 10 years I was on that medication and

258
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:43.350
Martin Price: It was really a prolific period in my life, you know, I got a master's degree got hired at Los Alamos, you know, build a house raise two kids. I mean, it was like everything went really well.

259
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.560
Martin Price: Until the end, you know, when I got

260
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.700
Martin Price: Tolerant, you know, and I had to keep taking more and more, and it just stopped working.

261
00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:04.080
Martin Price: But it. So that's kind of stuck in my head. And then there was a 16 year period where I was clean and sober and got married and

262
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.240
Martin Price: Made a ton of money and did really well in my career. So it's like

263
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.200
Dominique Pozo: You don't need you don't need the substance to do well, it's what I'm hearing that you really

264
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.750
Martin Price: Like the motivation is in me.

265
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:19.950
Martin Price: Yeah, um,

266
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:28.950
Martin Price: So that's like something I just wrestle with, you know, yeah, I know the motivation is in me to do it, but it

267
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:42.120
Martin Price: After you stop taking the opiates. It just takes a while for it to come back or to get into that rhythm where you're just doing things without even thinking about it.

268
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.870
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think it's so great that you've had an experience of both so that you have like

269
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.960
Dominique Pozo: You've got perspective. You know what happened when he started taking the lemme drove

270
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.040
Martin Price: The moto

271
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.030
moto

272
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:07.650
Dominique Pozo: moto. So there's that. And I can imagine if you had stayed on you know taking something this whole time that there would be a real question like, can I do this without it but

273
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:19.110
Dominique Pozo: That's not the case. I hear that you had a 16 year window of, you know, generating that motivation yourself. So it's there. And I think focusing on that is going to really

274
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.170
Dominique Pozo: Help as as you keep moving forward through the fear of getting off Suboxone

275
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.470
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know what it is the

276
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.140
Martin Price: Opiates to me. Want me to motivate me and they make me like

277
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.220
Martin Price: You know, let's do a team appointment later, you know,

278
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.920
Martin Price: Let's do a schedule or let you know things that

279
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.540
Martin Price: Normally, you know, you just wouldn't be that into, you know,

280
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:47.970
Martin Price: And

281
00:36:49.050 --> 00:37:00.120
Martin Price: There's a lot of that you know with this job right now just things that aren't really all that gratifying and also things that I don't know anything about and I have to be really creative and

282
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.270
Martin Price: I don't know. I don't know what to say. It's just

283
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:07.860
Martin Price: I never

284
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.760
Dominique Pozo: You've never like

285
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.830
Martin Price: I never let go of that idea that

286
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.340
Martin Price: In some respect. They helped me to a certain extent.

287
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.260
Martin Price: Okay.

288
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:30.690
Dominique Pozo: Well, how, how do you feel after you go skiing or do any sort of physical activity.

289
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:37.680
Martin Price: Really good. I mean it's it's a real sense of calm and my anxiety is

290
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.860
Martin Price: It really helps with my anxiety. That's

291
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.610
Martin Price: That's kind of why I exercise so hard is because

292
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.200
Martin Price: It's just a really good way for me to deal with my anxiety.

293
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:57.660
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think it would be a good experiment to just witness yourself in the next month, let's say, to start with a month.

294
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:09.210
Dominique Pozo: Of doing regular exercise and getting regular time for yourself in the natural world and start maybe start replacing that start replacing with Suboxone with those

295
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:17.100
Dominique Pozo: Experiences and I think because we need some you got to replace it with something that feels good, you know, or there's just going to be this empty hole.

296
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.540
Martin Price: Right and

297
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.580
Martin Price: Running is like my favorite

298
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:21.210
And

299
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.980
Martin Price: I just can't.

300
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:32.370
Martin Price: It was just getting to the point where I had to run six miles to actually, you know, have that runners higher or whatever but

301
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:42.870
Martin Price: I've started running a lot less lately, like a mile or a mile and a half. Just, just to get out of the house and go do something and it actually is pretty nice to

302
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.010
Hmm.

303
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.310
Martin Price: And riding my bike and

304
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.960
Martin Price: Yeah, I really like to ski and play tennis and stuff like that.

305
00:38:52.770 --> 00:39:06.360
Dominique Pozo: I mean there's you've got a huge selection of things to occupy your time with. And now that the weather's better. I think as to see how much the supports your, your recovery and your tapering process actually

306
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.490
Martin Price: Yeah, I am.

307
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.320
Martin Price: I'm kind of looking forward to going back to Wisconsin.

308
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.510
Martin Price: Because it's a new group of eight people and I don't feel like

309
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.890
Martin Price: They seem to be more open and accepting about the whole medically assisted treatment thing.

310
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:36.510
Martin Price: Not all of them, but you know my sponsor doesn't have a problem with it. He just says, just keep trying to taper and do it slow and do the best you can, you know,

311
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.110
Dominique Pozo: I heard the main obstacle to overcome really

312
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:52.440
Dominique Pozo: You know, judging yourself telling yourself it's wrong and bad because I think once you really come to that place of peace and owning it. It doesn't matter what anyone else says, and if

313
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.520
Dominique Pozo: They don't accept

314
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.840
Dominique Pozo: If they don't accept it, that's their problem. You know what works for you, right.

315
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.070
Martin Price: So far, I mean I yeah

316
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:08.700
Martin Price: I just kind of try and look at every day is a little financial victory, you know, the

317
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:19.440
Martin Price: When you're a contractor they pay you a quite a bit more because you don't have any benefits or anything like that. So that's helping me recover from Michelle.

318
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.600
Martin Price: Oh, good. It wasn't

319
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.540
Martin Price: Just, it wasn't just her right I just

320
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.790
Martin Price: I don't know, I just like really lost my

321
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.650
Martin Price: Sense of budget and everything and

322
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:40.590
Martin Price: And then once it got down to a certain point, I was like, well, what difference does it make, you know,

323
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.430
Martin Price: So,

324
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.620
Martin Price: But it's, you know, it's hard to make and now I'm realizing that

325
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.180
Martin Price: So anyway, it's all a big lesson.

326
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.520
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, well, I

327
00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:06.870
Dominique Pozo: I just want to reflect. I think you're doing great. And you're showing up regularly and you know you're being self reflective and recognizing the ways that you get in your way and being willing to look at that is huge.

328
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:09.570
Martin Price: Right, well I'll keep trying.

329
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.800
Martin Price: It is, you know, I kind of just don't know what to do. So I think I just kind of have to like

330
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:29.310
Martin Price: Try this path. It's in front of me, you know, and that timeline is basically was a way to put on paper, what

331
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.300
Martin Price: You know, the way I hope things turn out.

332
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:43.110
Dominique Pozo: Keep looking at it, Martin I invite you to put it in a refrigerator, put it wherever you are going to see it regularly to remind you, because these things are powerful.

333
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:58.830
Dominique Pozo: I heard recently that our input becomes our output. So whatever we choose to fill our mind with and you know our psyche with that becomes eventually what we put out into the world. So if you're

334
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.290
Dominique Pozo: You're allowing these dreams to be your input. I have a strong sense you're going to make it happen.

335
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.840
Martin Price: Yeah, you know, the I turned do repetitive prayer to and it just

336
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.060
Martin Price: I don't know. It just doesn't really seem to be working for me. I mean it.

337
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:28.860
Martin Price: I think having like tangible goals and stuff like that is pretty important to humans. You know, I've taken on this spiritual counselor, guys.

338
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.160
Martin Price: You know advice and it's like

339
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.640
Martin Price: It works for him.

340
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:44.640
Martin Price: But you know he's like 74 or something and he just like spend the whole day counseling and he's

341
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.520
Martin Price: Not trying to go like

342
00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:55.950
Martin Price: Sure to recover from a midlife or late life crisis, I guess you'd say,

343
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.600
Martin Price: Or get

344
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:11.760
Dominique Pozo: Frustrated, I'm gonna keep encouraging you to listen to what is right for you and keep identifying that let's let's make that I think that could be a good goal to keep identifying what feels right for you.

345
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.600
Martin Price: All right, I mean,

346
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:24.420
Martin Price: I'm really torn about the drugs, but everything else. You know, I feel like I'm doing as best I can, you know,

347
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.110
Martin Price: I'm really trying to make an effort to

348
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.910
Martin Price: Kind of be real and genuine with

349
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:43.710
Martin Price: April and do the best I can, at this job and

350
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:54.060
Martin Price: You know, keep the house up on this. And I think the hardest thing for me is working alone all day. I just

351
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:55.470
Martin Price: Don't like

352
00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:00.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I really am. I think it's coming to an end sooner than later. And this is going to

353
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.340
Martin Price: Power opens next two or three

354
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think so.

355
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.760
Martin Price: Hey,

356
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.070
