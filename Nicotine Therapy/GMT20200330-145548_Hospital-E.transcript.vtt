00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.270
Joan Kandel: Oh, good. Okay, great.

12
00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.180
Joan Kandel: Maybe it's maybe it's my internet. I don't know. Anyway, we made it here. We're here together. Thanks for being persistent

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.920
Joan Kandel: I guess they gave you the wrong room.

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.460
Joan Kandel: Number.

15
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
Joan Kandel: And then, yeah, finally got to the right one. Okay. Sorry about that.

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.610
Letisha shivers: That's okay, no problem.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.900
Joan Kandel: Okay, okay.

18
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.760
Joan Kandel: So,

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.310
Joan Kandel: Welcome to bright heart health. I'm glad you found your way over here.

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.720
Letisha shivers: Thank you.

21
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.960
Joan Kandel: How did you, how did you find us.

22
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.810
Letisha shivers: A friend of mine. He goes through, you guys, and he was experiencing a lot of the same things that I am going through and he told me that you guys are really good program.

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.540
Letisha shivers: So, um, yeah, I decided to go ahead and see if I could get on board with you guys.

24
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.470
Joan Kandel: Great. Well, so are you currently in a program

25
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:57.750
Letisha shivers: No, I'm not. I was on a program. But then when things went. I wasn't able to get there with my vehicle and I told them that I wouldn't, I was going to go ahead and go with you guys.

26
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:15.330
Letisha shivers: Right hardest a bright heart health. And they said, that's fine. They gave me a prescription. So I'm pretty much out of the prescription, it ends tomorrow. So, and I was on. So it was on eight milligrams three times a day. So they did get it regulated.

27
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:26.340
Letisha shivers: But they're only giving me two weeks at a time and then I would have to go there. It was kind of, you know, tedious, because I would have to show up every two weeks and then do my labs and everything.

28
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:37.170
Letisha shivers: So I'm kind of looking for something where I don't have to go as much just once a month, you know, hopefully, um, but they did get me regulated to where I do do three strips a day so

29
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.240
Joan Kandel: And what program was that

30
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.110
Letisha shivers: It was an Albuquerque health care for the homeless.

31
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.310
Okay.

32
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.600
Letisha shivers: Yeah.

33
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.920
Um,

34
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.230
Joan Kandel: And did they have groups.

35
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.930
Letisha shivers: No, they didn't have groups.

36
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.220
Letisha shivers: They just had me

37
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.490
Letisha shivers: Come every, like I said, every two weeks and talk to the doctor.

38
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.060
Joan Kandel: Okay, so it's just a one on one, but no group support.

39
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.180
Joan Kandel: No. Okay, so

40
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.380
Joan Kandel: So our program is a little bit different.

41
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.050
Joan Kandel: And one of the great things about the program, obviously, is that you could be where you are right now and you don't have to get in the car and go someplace.

42
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:30.900
Joan Kandel: And and we do, we do groups. We do weekly groups. So, it is more often. But it's but it's very supportive. It's, it's weekly groups and you could just be in your home and and you just joined by zoom like this.

43
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.090
Okay.

44
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.180
Joan Kandel: And and in the weekly groups.

45
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:46.650
Joan Kandel: There are anywhere between, like, five and 10 patients and we're all on zoom. So everybody has their little square. Are you familiar with zoom or is this your first time.

46
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.360
Letisha shivers: This is my first time.

47
00:03:48.720 --> 00:04:03.660
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Well, it's kind of neat because you get to like you get to see everybody and you can interact with everybody at the same time. And there's a doctor there and an in a therapist there. So they're, they're very good. I think you like it.

48
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.040
Letisha shivers: Alright, cool.

49
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.270
Joan Kandel: Yeah. And, and, generally speaking, when we

50
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.190
Joan Kandel: When someone is new to the program. We do weekly prescriptions.

51
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:28.650
Joan Kandel: And then as as it once you show up to all of your visits and you and you're more stable in the program. Then we'll go to every two week visits and it takes. I mean, every two week prescriptions. It's still every week visits.

52
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.120
Joan Kandel: And

53
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.070
Joan Kandel: And that's usually we'll do like every two weeks prescriptions.

54
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.720
Okay.

55
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.100
Joan Kandel: So tell me about

56
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:51.870
Joan Kandel: Tell me about the the eight milligrams three times a day, and how you got to that point and how you feel on that dose.

57
00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:02.970
Letisha shivers: All right. Um, so basically I always find it a little because they're giving me the generic and so I was finding it a little bit harder in the morning when I would get up.

58
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:14.850
Letisha shivers: I was feeling real estate sick, basically because I sleep little bit longer than normal people. I guess probably 12 hours instead of eight to 10 hours. So when I would wake up.

59
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:30.960
Letisha shivers: I would feel more fixed or why would take a whole strip and then I would have to regulate it, and then afternoon around probably I would say I would wake up around nine or 10 around two or three I would take a half a strip and then I would take a full strip before bed.

60
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.060
Letisha shivers: So, and then in the middle of the night, instead of going all night. I will take a half a strip

61
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.360
Letisha shivers: So it would be one strip half a strip whole strip half a strip

62
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.610
Letisha shivers: So that's how I got the three

63
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.500
Joan Kandel: That's a lot of times in a day, taking medicine.

64
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.210
Letisha shivers: Yeah.

65
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.250
Joan Kandel: Did you ever

66
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.100
Joan Kandel: Did you ever tried taking it all at once.

67
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:12.630
Letisha shivers: Yeah, I did. And, but like I said I would wake up and it would be, it would just be, it would be harder for me to get up basically

68
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:22.260
Letisha shivers: You know, I would feel. I guess it was a car from, you know, I don't know, I just wouldn't feel as as well. I would just feel really sick, my body would just hurt really bad.

69
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.850
Letisha shivers: So then that's when the doctor, he told me, Well then try to break it, you know, maybe try to take it in the middle of the night when you wake up.

70
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:39.810
Letisha shivers: Try to take it in the middle of night because I don't sleep very solid, you know, I still wake up in the middle of the night when like every two hours. I guess I wake up, so

71
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.520
Joan Kandel: And when when you did take it all at once. Did you take the full 24 milligrams all at once.

72
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.520
Letisha shivers: No, I didn't try that.

73
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.350
Joan Kandel: How much is the most that you ever tried to take one today.

74
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.760
Letisha shivers: Um, I think it was 12 TOMO gram

75
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.770
Joan Kandel: Strip and a half.

76
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.940
Letisha shivers: Yeah.

77
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.950
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. So

78
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:14.520
Joan Kandel: This medicine is really meant. It's built. It's designed to last the full 24 hours so that you just have to take it once a day because

79
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.500
Joan Kandel: Because people I think generally are more functional when they just take their medicine once a day and they don't have to keep like

80
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:33.930
Joan Kandel: chipping away at it and keep taking a little bit at a time and and then getting sick and then taking a little bit and feeling relief and then getting sick and then feeling relief. So

81
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:49.290
Joan Kandel: I think it might be nice for us to get a sense of how you can take the same dose, so total of 24 milligrams, but not have to just keep taking it throughout the day and especially not having to get up in the middle of the night and take it.

82
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.110
Joan Kandel: So, do you also have chronic pain issues.

83
00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:11.910
Letisha shivers: Yeah, yeah, I do. Um, I had, um, basically, I had a back surgery. I had a facade in my back and I was on pain meds always on oxy codeine 15 milligrams four times a day as

84
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:26.430
Letisha shivers: Well, yeah. And then last, last year that abruptly stop. I'm like, I had some issues with my home situation, I was able to keep my appointments. And so then that's when I started using

85
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:36.570
Letisha shivers: Because I wasn't able to stay on track with doctors and everything else. And so I had lost that pain script. So I do have chronic pain in my back my lower back.

86
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.520
Joan Kandel: And does the does the buprenorphine help you with that.

87
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.110
Letisha shivers: It does.

88
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.990
Joan Kandel: It does. Okay, so

89
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:59.880
Joan Kandel: After saying all that I said about taking it just once a day, people who have chronic pain tend to do better when they split up their dose, just in terms of their pain, they tend to do better.

90
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.910
Joan Kandel: But I don't think that you need to take it four times a day, like you're taking it so

91
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:19.140
Joan Kandel: You might want to try either taking 12 milligrams in the morning and then 12 milligrams 12 hours later. So, like, say you take it at nine in the morning, take it at nine at night.

92
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.110
Joan Kandel: And

93
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.850
Joan Kandel: Or you could take

94
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.940
Joan Kandel: eight milligrams three times a day, like

95
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.400
Joan Kandel: Okay, eight hours apart but but hopefully you won't have to do that middle of the night one

96
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.400
Letisha shivers: Okay, yeah.

97
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.470
Letisha shivers: Yeah, sounds good. Yeah.

98
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.960
Joan Kandel: Okay, so

99
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:50.790
Joan Kandel: Before you were on the oxy codeine for for your back pain. Did you have any

100
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.730
Joan Kandel: Issues with with drugs.

101
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.380
Letisha shivers: No.

102
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.620
Letisha shivers: Not at all. No, no, no.

103
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.670
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

104
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.970
Joan Kandel: And tell me about

105
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.600
Joan Kandel: Tell me a little bit about what happened when you were on the oxy and then off oxy

106
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:20.220
Letisha shivers: Um, when I was on the oxy I had, you know, as you know, it doesn't last. So, you know, I started to use more

107
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:43.080
Letisha shivers: And then, you know, I had this genius friend who said, oh, you know, something else might help you so you know I decided, okay, well we can try heroin it last longer and you don't have to have a prescription for it. So I started, I started using heroin.

108
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.680
Joan Kandel: Start it or shoot it.

109
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.620
Letisha shivers: I shot it up.

110
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.490
Uh huh.

111
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.990
Letisha shivers: And it was a great relief to me. And then that's when everything just started to spiral out of control.

112
00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.100
Letisha shivers: Hahaha

113
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.500
Joan Kandel: So tell me what you mean by spiral out of control.

114
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:15.210
Letisha shivers: What is well when I lost my job and I just wasn't as productive in society anymore. And then I lost my pain script, because I wasn't able to do a clean urine.

115
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.430
Joan Kandel: Me know how that goes.

116
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.760
So,

117
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:25.410
Letisha shivers: They just kind of got me off that and I just couldn't deal with the pain anymore. And then it just became more of an issue.

118
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:42.570
Letisha shivers: So with then I decided that I wanted to get treatment. And so that's when I started the Suboxone about three months ago and I'm still I'm still, you know, I had, I had a Muckle I have relapsed I i I'm still trying, you know,

119
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.230
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I'm still

120
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.920
Letisha shivers: Fighting

121
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.850
The good fight.

122
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.380
Joan Kandel: Right. So tell me about, you know, relapses it's part of the disease. It's a, you know, it's

123
00:11:53.670 --> 00:12:01.230
Joan Kandel: Comes with the territory, sort of, you know, hopefully we'll get to the place where that's not happening. But, you know, you're still early in recovery. So

124
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.590
Joan Kandel: Yeah, tell me about the. Tell me about the relapses when has that happened.

125
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:29.640
Letisha shivers: I'm like, when I get really stressful, um, you know, sometimes and I just kind of getting back into society. You know, I'm trying to find a job and I just feel like I know that there's going to be let downs and things like that, that just kind of when things feel like hopeless to me, I guess.

126
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.960
Letisha shivers: Is when I relapse.

127
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.640
Letisha shivers: Uh huh, I'm

128
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:45.420
Letisha shivers: Not to get to that hopeless point. You know, I try to do things like go to a meeting or find support peer support. Um, but there's really not a lot of peer support that I have right now.

129
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:52.020
Letisha shivers: So, okay, and I find myself isolating and then when I find myself isolating and boredom.

130
00:12:52.710 --> 00:13:09.570
Letisha shivers: I am has a lot to do with it. Because working right now. And so I just tried myself busy and in a stable mindset where I can, I can do this kind of mode and not up not, I guess. Oh well, kind of mode, you know, so that's where I'm at right now.

131
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:10.770
Yeah.

132
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:29.610
Joan Kandel: Well, you know, I really feel like the like the groups are going to really be helpful to you because you'll have a chance to connect to other people who totally get it. You know, and who can give you give you that boost of support when you're feeling that that hopeless feeling

133
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.390
Joan Kandel: That'll be good. Yeah.

134
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.340
Joan Kandel: Um, yeah. Yeah, I think it's gonna be really helpful.

135
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.430
Joan Kandel: When was the last time that you used heroin.

136
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.570
Letisha shivers: Last week,

Letisha shivers: And

303
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.750
Letisha shivers: It's just, it's just harder than others. So

304
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.780
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I get that.

305
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.610

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.830
Okay.

Letisha shivers: In the next six months or so, but I'm right now. No, I don't wanna quit.

321
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:22.740
Joan Kandel: Well, I am i think that that's a great goal. You know, once you get stable and everything. I think that would do so much for your, for your health.

322
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.430
Joan Kandel: Because smoking is nasty for the body.

323

371
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.410

Joan Kandel: All right, so

386
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.200
Joan Kandel: The, the video is pretty choppy. I think I've

387
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.620
Joan Kandel: January's because we're on this thing, but

388
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.560
Joan Kandel: It seems like the video is really

389
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.370
Joan Kandel: choppy. So I don't think I'll be able to do much of any of that today, but that's okay.

390
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.560
Joan Kandel: Alright, so the, what's the pharmacy that you go to

391
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:29.100
Letisha shivers: Dismiss on constant Carlisle. I even the information

392
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.810
Joan Kandel: Perfect.

393
00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:32.910
Joan Kandel: Great.

394
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.830
Joan Kandel: Okay. And did they tell you about going to the lab.

395
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.000
Letisha shivers: Yeah, they did. They told me

396
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:59.580
Letisha shivers: The quarantine lifted because they're not do it after quite right now. So probably a week, maybe two and was just lifted on their quest getting those laptops for you.

397
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.360
Joan Kandel: Perfect. That's great. Yeah, that's fine. So

398
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:15.330
Joan Kandel: So what I do is I put the prescription through the computer. So it's sent electronically. So when you go to the and I'll do that today. After we get off the phone.

399
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:20.160
Joan Kandel: So when you go to the pharmacy, they should have that for you.

400
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.470
Joan Kandel: And and like we talked about, I will just do a week at a time.

401
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.090

403
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:47.730
Joan Kandel: 24 milligrams a day and you see how it goes with the trying it like 12 and a half, like a strip and a half in the morning and then a strip and a half 910 hours 12 hours later, sorry.

404
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:59.850
Joan Kandel: And see how that goes. And try to be consistent with that and see if, if that makes you feel a little bit more stable and not having to go through that like feeling sick and then taking some and then feeling sick and and taking some

405
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.610
Letisha shivers: Okay. All right. Don't

409
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.920
Letisha shivers: I don't think so. They were out for some reason.

410
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:20.910
I don't know.

411
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.940
Letisha shivers: It's our cat or something but

412
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.800
Letisha shivers: Orders.

413
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:34.320
Letisha shivers: You have something for me. They said they said they were seeing some so

414
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.550

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:46.920
Letisha shivers: OK.

421
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:06.360

425
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.940
Joan Kandel: You know that virtual clinic number that you called that that may number

426
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.650
Letisha shivers: Yes.

427
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.950
Joan Kandel: So that's the number that you're going to call every time you have any kind of appointment or group.

428
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:54.810
Joan Kandel: So, and, and we ask that you call about a half an hour before the group so that they can do, they'll do a questionnaire and get you all checked in and everything so that you're on time. So at four o'clock tomorrow. Call that number, tell them that you're calling in for your group.

429
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:55.950
Joan Kandel: And then

430
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.820
Joan Kandel: I'll see you tomorrow. That'll be fun.

431
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.640
Letisha shivers: Alright. Alright, sounds good. Thank you.

432
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.090
Joan Kandel: You're welcome. Let me see if there's anything else.

433
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.320
Joan Kandel: One more, one more thing to tell you about the, I don't know if they already told you this in virtual clinic, but about the

434
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:20.640
Joan Kandel: We do urine drug screens about once a month, did they tell you about how we do that.

435
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:27.600
Joan Kandel: Yeah, they did. Okay, so they're going to send it to you in the mail and don't open it until you call

436
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.180
Joan Kandel: Okay.

437
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:31.740
Joan Kandel: All right.

438
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.790
Joan Kandel: So Leticia. Do you have any questions for me.

439
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.920
Letisha shivers: Um, nope, will be good. So I'll meet you again, just one on one.

440
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.720
Joan Kandel: So we don't

441
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:55.830
Joan Kandel: We don't know. We don't have to do one on. Once we usually do as part of the groups. We do a medical check in. So I usually kind of go around to everybody. And that's how we do the medical check and

442
00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:03.330
Joan Kandel: I'm always open to meeting one on one, if people feel like they want to talk to me about something that they don't feel like talking to the group about

443
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:15.450
Joan Kandel: But if it's you know dosing questions or anything that you feel comfortable about then we usually just briefly cover that in group and that counts as the doctor visit and that's once a week. So that's pretty often.

444
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:22.230
Joan Kandel: But if it anytime you feel like you want to meet with me individually like this, just let me know and we'll schedule that

445
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:23.580
Okay.

446
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.220
Joan Kandel: Sounds good.

447
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.440
Letisha shivers: Yeah, sounds good. Thank you.

448
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.150
Joan Kandel: All right, my dear. Well,

449
00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.060
