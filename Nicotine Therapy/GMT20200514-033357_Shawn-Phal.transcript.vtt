00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.870
Shawn Phalen: Hey, I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.970
Galaxy A50: Thank you so much for seeing me I have a feeling I know what happened that

3
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.870
Galaxy A50: The new guy. I had a different problem.

4
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.060
Galaxy A50: On Monday as well.

5
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.250
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. What happened to heat Chucky when earlier today.

6
00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:02.760
Galaxy A50: No, he checked me in at eight o'clock. I mean, it's a at like 745, uh, but he said something. Oh, like, oh, let me see if you can see a Sean because

7
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:20.220
Galaxy A50: You had group today. And I said, No, I did. And then he's like, oh, okay. So you have and then he couldn't. And then all of a sudden he's like, okay, I see it. I see you have an appointment and he must have just thought group and check me on to do. Do you do have group you also carry

8
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.350
Shawn Phalen: No. So what happened is I saw this morning and he

9
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.180
Shawn Phalen: Checked human somebody check you in the morning.

10
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.530
Galaxy A50: No afternoon. It wasn't a check in. They had a question, because I never paid yesterday. Okay, and

11
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.730
Shawn Phalen: What it did is it took you out of the eight o'clock spot like

12
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.380
Yeah.

13
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.860
Shawn Phalen: So that's what happened. And I was like, Oh, she must have reschedule. And then, okay, all right. Sorry.

14
00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:05.040
Galaxy A50: But then they say, for every question log into the virtual clinic. So if that does that, then I can effectively use my appointments. Oh, that's so annoying.

15
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.190
Shawn Phalen: Well, it doesn't mean that you, it just, it was bizarre. So now I know if that happens again that it's just that I just

16
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.850
Shawn Phalen: I just take it and do something else was going on. So,

17
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.240
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, okay. Sorry, how are you

18
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:38.220
Galaxy A50: So I'm good. I know, two weeks ago, I wasn't so good. And I'd like to explain and also I would like to tell you. And this is not to gloat I'm just letting you know you were wrong.

19
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.800
Galaxy A50: The guy really had a hidden agenda Bobo were either. I was wrong. Was I assumed it was personal.

20
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.780
Galaxy A50: It wasn't personal. It was he was trying to cover his own ass. So there's two things that could be playing a role here.

21
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:12.750
Galaxy A50: I have a feeling that either didn't realize or he didn't want to take on the responsibility of being the supervisor during the supervisor time between Hayden, and I, right. So that could be it. Pretty much. That's what I would think, because he started backpedaling for no reason.

22
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.350
Galaxy A50: Then he you know that he involved his boss right his supervisor. Did I tell you that. Okay, so all of a sudden he stopped answering me

23
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.390
Galaxy A50: Oh wait, the date that we spoke was the day I think that I was supposed to have an appointment with him. So, yeah.

24
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:45.060
Galaxy A50: We went back and forth, because this is where it got really upsetting to me. He kept trying to convince me in emails that I'm asking for something else that I'm that I'm not asking. He kept making it about Hayden's privacy.

25
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.720
Galaxy A50: But I never said violate his privacy. So then his supervisor tries to ship with me and I'm so sick of hated people putting words in my mouth.

26
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:10.620
Galaxy A50: So I said, I said it like four times or I was like oh let me assure you, and I was respectful and all, but I was like, I don't know where you getting this that's not what's happening I'm going by what true tool.

27
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:23.580
Galaxy A50: And how we finally ended this and that was on a very positive note is that kind of cornered them into since he did recommend having one on one. I mean,

28
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:38.100
Galaxy A50: To him, and I sessions family sessions, they recommended family therapists to me, probably because they wanted to get out of this particular corner that I accidentally box them into again. I didn't mean to.

29
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:48.210
Galaxy A50: I knew that I felt the talks should be supervised. But I'm thinking, who's better to supervise talks my hillbilly ex husband or, you know, a counselor.

30
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:59.970
Galaxy A50: So now I had to submit a request to my ex husband and he's not answering, which means he's just been as he. I'm going to go away.

31
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:14.040
Galaxy A50: And yeah, that's it. And hopefully I'll, I'll go on from here because I'm going to try and see if maybe Hayden could appear by zoom also because

32
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.270
Galaxy A50: We're both have legal custody. The only issue is Hayden. Somebody has to drive eight and he can't get there.

33
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.820
Galaxy A50: So if I get Hayden to download zoom, then I'm in much better shape.

34
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:37.230
Galaxy A50: Have you talked to Hayden lately. Yes. So there was another little problem. I don't know if it's add or if it's

35
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:48.930
Galaxy A50: Just generally, I guess, changing. Puberty or whatever. But he really blew me off on Mother's Day and. But the thing is, we talked about it the night before.

36
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.460
Galaxy A50: So I don't understand why. And he said, Oh, I was doing homework all day, and I almost want to say, I don't believe you, but I can't say that. But the only way I got two year Hayden's voice.

37
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:15.840
Galaxy A50: Is because me being a detective that I am, I tried contacting my ex husband, a few times and then he wasn't obviously responding or answering

38
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:25.740
Galaxy A50: So then I decided the only way I get a response if I'm pretending I'm someone else but it has to be someone that he doesn't expect

39
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:40.590
Galaxy A50: Me to try and have any connection with so I downloaded an app with a fake phone number. I picked his ex wife's number. And he was so shocked, he picked up the phone and then he had no choice but to let me talk to him.

40
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.620
Galaxy A50: See, I don't want to do these things, but

41
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.580
Galaxy A50: This is the card that life dealt me

42
00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:06.300
Galaxy A50: And there's been quite a few things that make no sense to me. And I'm not really anxious. I'm just at this point just sad. It's been one thing after another. So, no, my

43
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.450
Galaxy A50: Now I need another attorney on a different matter, but whatever. We'll deal with that later.

44
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:26.910
Galaxy A50: Oh I sued by I'm sorry I keep looking over here because I have notes on what I needed to talk to you about. So I sued, an employer with the Labor Commissioner.

45
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:50.130
Galaxy A50: Because I didn't get paid for so many things and really that i mean i won a very small amount, but it's absolutely ridiculous compared to what it's like pennies on the dollar and the reasoning behind it. If you read it. The reasoning itself. But what if you know like the fact

46
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.830
Galaxy A50: Half the bathroom at it.

47
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:10.410
Galaxy A50: And I don't really understand why. And it's not even about the money. It's because I already know that this woman has not learned a lesson. So her winning in this case would make it so much harder for her to ever look

48
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.400
Galaxy A50: So yeah, and then

49
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:32.160
Galaxy A50: The everybody kept telling me well like because I didn't get my stimulus money, which is fine. I don't need it right now, but I just wish I wanted to make sure that it wasn't like hacked out of the IRS fund or whatever.

50
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.180
Galaxy A50: And they kept saying, well, if they did, grab it for the benefit of child support.

51
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:50.700
Galaxy A50: They'll send you a letter, the IRS itself would send you a letter. So I finally get this letter and all it says this, this is Donald Trump. Congratulations. We deposited

52
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.150
Galaxy A50: But it doesn't see where

53
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.390
Galaxy A50: So you still have no idea where to look for your ship. It's so annoying.

54
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.840
Shawn Phalen: You're not going to

55
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.340
Galaxy A50: Know,

56
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.530
Galaxy A50: Do you, do you see how

57
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:24.300
Galaxy A50: It, it's not like I take minor problems and blow them out of proportion. It's really that these things just keep happening to me.

58
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:44.130
Galaxy A50: Not like not like I'm not in charge of my own life, but it's like a glitch here and a glitch there and a glitch there. And eventually, it's like you don't even know which glitch to attend to first. So now the courts are supposed to be open.

59
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.170
Shawn Phalen: When are they reopening

60
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:59.040
Galaxy A50: So they're supposed to start rescheduling as of the 26 but they closed on March 20 and I was supposed to have a hearing on April 14

61
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:11.460
Galaxy A50: So that's, let's say, a little over three weeks. Right. So they're going to open at a much slower pace. I understand. So I have. I can't even gauge when they'll get to me.

62
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:21.780
Galaxy A50: And I really need Hayden sooner rather than later, because I need him in school and I need him in a good school and I need him where I could do him.

63
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:29.280
Galaxy A50: Because it's just embarrassing where you can watch where I can be the one doing homework with him.

64
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:44.880
Galaxy A50: He is just eat. It's not that he's not taking anything seriously except he's not learning anything and he's the type of kid when he's not learning anything whatever he learns just evaporates.

65
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:56.370
Galaxy A50: I so and I if he was somewhat self like engaging, kind of, if he could motivate himself a little bit. I'd be way easier. But he's not

66
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:08.850
Galaxy A50: So my only, I guess. Good thing. Oh, yeah. So this decision, the court, the court, the labor Commissioners decision.

67
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:20.580
Galaxy A50: There's another little issue with it. It arrived as a check, and it was supposed to arrive as a decision with sufficient time to appeal.

68
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:34.350
Galaxy A50: And when I emailed them because I actually drove there. But of course, everything's closed it said the road, the answer. The reply was, we sent you the decision on this in this day.

69
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:53.430
Galaxy A50: I have no decision. So then the attached the decision to be email. And then I realized what might have happened is, I think, and I'm not sure if it's on purpose or not my old boss had some control over what happens to my mail.

70
00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.950
Galaxy A50: So on a very, very low chance he could have intercepted it because he knew

71
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.380
Galaxy A50: That the decisions technically basically favorable to the other side.

72
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.450
Galaxy A50: That or if he didn't do it on purpose. Then he just never bothered checking the mail.

73
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.840
Galaxy A50: For the readings. Now, how much is this person. Oh, you

74
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:29.850
Galaxy A50: I consider it a little over 1000 like eight and a half. And I got 856

75
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:40.860
Galaxy A50: But seriously, it's, it's one thing if if it said like, you know, the plaintiffs didn't bring enough evidence or whatever I showed plenty

76
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:52.020
Galaxy A50: It's just a total woman. What about 50% of it is the one with like the big monetary like penalties added to it is Omid

77
00:12:53.490 --> 00:13:09.630
Galaxy A50: I don't know i i have to just really think about and read it over again. I sent it to a lawyer who looked at over who's a really good friend of mine, and he said, let it go because it's a sound decision, but I wasn't gonna like start

78
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:18.390
Galaxy A50: This person's doing me a favor. I couldn't just be like well effects are omitted. So I need to actually have

79
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:37.320
Galaxy A50: Like a face to face or virtual face to face conference and show the other attorney, like the professional labor dispute attorney what what I have and see if that's so, like, for example, this lady rates playing diff one sick pay,

80
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.890
Galaxy A50: Because she was supposed to have surgery but she didn't put it on the card.

81
00:13:45.060 --> 00:14:04.290
Galaxy A50: Like the clock in card. Well, yeah, but that's because I was at home recuperating from surgery and pay period was ending. So I text her and I had the text that clearly says, hey, add a five hours to BECAUSE WE USED TO WORK IN FIVE HOUR SHIFTS at five hours for my surgery.

82
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:16.140
Galaxy A50: And it like a good employee employer would have been like, What are you talking about, and a dish, like a reply was something like, oh, for one day.

83
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:26.790
Galaxy A50: And so, and I didn't think anything of it. And honestly, I don't think it was on purpose. I think after the fact, she realized, oh, I don't have to pay her because there's, there might be a good

84
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:44.610
Galaxy A50: So, and I specifically said, Oh, I'm sorry for Friday. And then I added. I apologize. I like it. And then I'm not used to it so well. What do you want, it's like a new pill that I'm on, and I'm at home bleeding.

85
00:14:45.720 --> 00:15:00.480
Galaxy A50: Did I really have to do anything other than send a text message which I had. So it's like things, things like that. And it makes me, of course, want to be like, Yo, you don't want to do a job, go get a different job, Commissioner.

86
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.330
Galaxy A50: In in in deleting that the lady who I was going against

87
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:19.860
Galaxy A50: She was so clearly lying, that the Commissioner a few times. She just she all and you know she has to stay calm and neutral, but a couple of times. She was like, I could read it in her face.

88
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:28.710
Galaxy A50: So I don't know what it's like she clearly showed how much she disliked the other party compared to me at least.

89
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.570
Galaxy A50: And I don't know what else to do.

90
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:51.180
Galaxy A50: It's like, no matter what I try something. And luckily, I'm not a depressed person. Otherwise, this could be really bad for me but I gotta just win at least on the things that I'm that the laws on my side, let alone. Sometimes

91
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.330
Galaxy A50: throw me a bone here and there. I'm not even talking about that.

92
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.750
Galaxy A50: So, yeah.

93
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.750
Shawn Phalen: I think it really depends on where you want your focus to be and where you want your energy.

94
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.140
Galaxy A50: I don't, I don't know what you're saying. It depends on what

95
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:15.180
Shawn Phalen: Depends on where you want your focus to be and where you want your energy to be spent.

96
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:25.140
Galaxy A50: Well, I want my, my focus is on tying up loose ends and moving on with my life.

97
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:27.600
Shawn Phalen: Okay.

98
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:37.320
Galaxy A50: And but I constantly get the runaround, so after and I'm not saying like, oh, life built me about card. But what I'm saying is

99
00:16:39.120 --> 00:17:01.860
Galaxy A50: All situations. This is one that I did nothing wrong. Like, I see how what I did with Hayden at the airport is off, and I am so lucky that the judge is the only reason why he's giving me the second chances, because my ex husband left Hayden with me. It's not like

100
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:19.140
Galaxy A50: It's not like he wanted Hayden, and the judge awarded him to me first. And now, he'd be like, oh, I regret doing this. Let me give it give the child to the Father. It literally was that will the mothers was doing all this everybody's allowed a quick hiccup.

101
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.500
Galaxy A50: In this in this particular case I did nothing.

102
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:45.540
Galaxy A50: And they would in the the testimony that they gave me and they gave us was so our religious in so improbable, and I kept I kept challenging it I have things to challenge it with. What else could I have possibly done

103
00:17:47.790 --> 00:18:03.180
Galaxy A50: A show. It's not so much focus. It's just like when people say, well, what's the point of trying. Nothing good happens to I always laugh at people like that, but at the same time. I'm thinking will if something like that happened to somebody who wasn't

104
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.780
Galaxy A50: Sorry for, for lack of a better expression, not as intelligent or as educated as me.

105
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:22.830
Galaxy A50: In didn't have that bigger picture in their mind or had depression problems this amount of crap would put them deeper in deeper and

106
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:38.010
Galaxy A50: So I'm actually thinking I'm doing pretty well. Um, but at least the only thing that's working out for me is that I get to see my clients, which a lot of people don't. And my clients have always been a big deal to me.

107
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.940
Yeah.

108
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.640
Shawn Phalen: How often are you working

109
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.250
Galaxy A50: Whenever somebody needs me. And I'm sorry I'm working like on the DL kind of

110
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:56.670
Galaxy A50: But what am I supposed to do. I'm getting no small business help because apparently I opened my business that the weird time

111
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:04.800
Galaxy A50: The cutoff was FAVOR OF FEBRUARY 15 which I don't understand why there's the cutoff.

112
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:14.610
Galaxy A50: And I don't want to stop paying rent, because then I won't, I won't find Dad Good and that cheap of a place

113
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.240
Galaxy A50: Right, if we were to be open right um

114
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.110
Okay.

115
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.150
Shawn Phalen: So,

116
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.960
Shawn Phalen: With the stimulus check

117
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.120
Shawn Phalen: It might have deposited in the raw someone else's account.

118
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:48.090
Galaxy A50: So they originally the IRS said I didn't even know that was supposed to be a letter. Originally, the IRS if you went into just check the status, it's check with your bank.

119
00:19:48.570 --> 00:20:06.360
Galaxy A50: The bank said nothing was even wired to my info period. So for me, and then as I kept digging and digging and said, if the check was diverted somewhere you will receive a letter. So like for example, did you receive a letter.

120
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:07.980
Shawn Phalen: No.

121
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:21.750
Galaxy A50: No. Okay, so this letter must have just been sent to people like me, whose money somehow went somewhere else. But the check literally says this is Donald Trump. I sent you.

122
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.770
Galaxy A50: Know the weather. Yeah, well,

123
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.300
Galaxy A50: I do know what I'm talking about. I'm yeah

124
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.660
Galaxy A50: It's a little bit that they send out. Yeah.

125
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.660
Galaxy A50: So then everybody got

126
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:44.100
Shawn Phalen: That's that was the idea that not everybody got it. I don't think

127
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:55.350
Galaxy A50: Okay, so then I'm supposed to get probably another letter that says, oops. We intercepted it. Okay, so I didn't know about this. I thought that this was it.

128
00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:03.150
Galaxy A50: Okay, well I'm at this point. I don't even want my money. I just want something to get resolved.

129
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.160
Galaxy A50: Like, one thing that I could go. Okay, check this is finished.

130
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.930
Galaxy A50: So, yeah.

131
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.630
Galaxy A50: Otherwise, I'm doing okay.

132
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.080
Galaxy A50: My mother's day of course sucked.

133
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:24.630
Galaxy A50: Yeah, that's and then my half birthday kind of sucked the week prior to, I know I celebrate my half birthday.

134
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:26.640
Galaxy A50: But that's because

135
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:27.960
Hmm.

136
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.840
Shawn Phalen: I like that. I've never heard of that.

137
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:40.080
Galaxy A50: What it's because I gave birth to my son on my half birthday. So then we became each other's have birthday present and love it.

138
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.610
Galaxy A50: So, and he he was so rude to me.

139
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.750
Galaxy A50: I don't even know. Like, he was rude to me. And when I and I was very calm about it.

140
00:21:52.830 --> 00:22:09.330
Galaxy A50: And then when we talked about it a few days later, I was like, what was that about, and he goes, oh, I didn't want you to say something mean so I instantly said that what he said to me, and I was like, why would I be mean.

141
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:23.100
Galaxy A50: And of course, I want to say is somebody telling you these things, but I can and I was like, why would you an English. Because last time I mentioned this one person you've got mad.

142
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:39.180
Galaxy A50: Well yeah, I did. But when he mentioned this person. I didn't get mad at him. I got mad at my ex husband and he was something about what that person was doing it had nothing to do with my son's birthday.

143
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:57.420
Galaxy A50: So I know that it's in his case, it's a misunderstanding, but it's a big misunderstanding that if somebody doesn't know how I really am they, going to read this and be like, What is this relationship between these two.

144
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.680
Galaxy A50: And and then one more thing.

145
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.970
Galaxy A50: I guess my parents sent my. Did I tell you this. My assessment. Yeah, they sent him money.

146
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:17.970
Galaxy A50: I think I told you this, your parents and your excess money yeah why

147
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:24.930
Galaxy A50: I'm in there jacked up mind they were hoping with Hayden.

148
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.330
Galaxy A50: Hayden didn't see a penny of this

149
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:41.790
Galaxy A50: But Hayden doesn't know how much certain amount of money really is worth so I know that my parents sent, I want to say probably between four and 500

150
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:50.640
Galaxy A50: And I don't know if it was because my ex husband might have said, oh, Dina doesn't pay child support or something like that, which is not true.

151
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:59.370
Galaxy A50: But my ex husband brought him a dog from the shelter right and said, your grandparents bought this for you.

152
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.220
Galaxy A50: And kept the money.

153
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:13.920
Galaxy A50: Of course, in the grand scheme of things. I'd rather it be that way because I'd rather save a dog from a shelter or from somebody's home can keep it.

154
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:27.660
Galaxy A50: Then, but this dog is clearly it was somebody choice to get this dog. It's microchips, it's like, ready to go. So, something must have had this was no puppy that somebody wanted to get rid of.

155
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.050
Galaxy A50: So, and I can't be like a yo Hayden Chuck doubts pockets.

156
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.910
Galaxy A50: And then I know, I know, I know, say I might come off a little frazzled. But in addition to everything.

157
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:59.520
Galaxy A50: My ex husband when to Idaho child support and is trying to collect through that. So I had to try and get them. It's, it's just I I really always wanted him to have a hobby. I didn't realize that I was the hobby.

158
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.320
Shawn Phalen: Did you ask your parents, where they spent money.

159
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:22.860
Galaxy A50: Yeah, well, I don't really speak to either of them. But it was done as if for Hayden. But the thing is, everybody knows my ex husband has this very strange idea about money.

160
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:42.660
Galaxy A50: It's better not to get him not to give them anything. Like if if he if he says I need blah, blah, blah. Go buy it for them, then hand them money. It's kind of like, don't you know don't give a homeless $1 go buy him dollar worth of whatever

161
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.120
Galaxy A50: At not only does he not use it correctly.

162
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:59.880
Galaxy A50: When my parents have shown any kind of generosity to him. He would literally cut me off from money or go to court and argue that

163
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:11.490
Galaxy A50: What her dad must be helping her. Why should I so it in my parents, giving him anything actually costs me money in the long

164
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:24.240
Galaxy A50: And of course, I'm never gonna let him keep this dog. I'm going to take it with me when I take Hayden back to California, because at this man needs to learn. So then I'm going to have a husky to take care of.

165
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.170
Galaxy A50: I'm not, I don't mind because it's my choice.

166
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.820
Galaxy A50: But I know how he is in a sense that everything is a competition with him so

167
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:48.000
Galaxy A50: If I don't take this dog from him, or at least try to it's going to become OC. She was powerless and it's just it's it's not

168
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:59.970
Galaxy A50: Like some people say, well, you got to let things go like don't engage don't. It does not work with him. The moment you distance from the conflict.

169
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:11.370
Galaxy A50: He pushes even more because he feels like he does not understand that it's not a victory defeat kind of situation. It's that I just don't want to deal with him anymore.

170
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:19.320
Galaxy A50: So overall, I feel like I'm actually less anxious than I could be

171
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.630
Galaxy A50: I just have a long to do list.

172
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.950
Galaxy A50: And I don't really know what and how

173
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:40.140
Galaxy A50: It what what i can do and how I can get Hayden, and I to have sessions. I mean, of course, I'm going to keep trying, but to some extent.

174
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:50.520
Galaxy A50: Depending on timeframes. It's almost best not to because then Hayden is going to get back here and he's going to be like, Well, I'm annoyed. We have to tell this whole story.

175
00:27:51.060 --> 00:28:11.520
Galaxy A50: All over again to a third adult now because he's already seeing his own therapist molto Hayden thought he liked the idea. He really, really, really wanted to see me. Oh. Remember how I told you that day that's supposedly Hayden said no, he wasn't interested in seeing me

176
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:22.110
Galaxy A50: Or maybe I didn't, I have to look at when I sent what the when I saw you, but I was told that he then decided not to have me be in session.

177
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:38.100
Galaxy A50: Well, next time I talked to Hayden like so he didn't give consent but next time I talked to hate and he asked me why I wanted to, I could listen in on his session. So the way the guy for treating

178
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.800
Galaxy A50: His mom will just sit there and listen to what they're talking about, which is ridiculous.

179
00:28:44.790 --> 00:29:05.370
Galaxy A50: So this guy tried everything possible to cause a problem, but I really hope because he also has to talk to that Liliana Liliana really great lady I really hope this doesn't come and bite me in the ass in any way. But all I wanted was just to chat with a counselor and my kid.

180
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:08.850
Galaxy A50: See your

181
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:17.370
Shawn Phalen: Is your, is your doing that too. Is he going and having sessions with Hayden that you know

182
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.290
Galaxy A50: No, but he can

183
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:31.560
Galaxy A50: I don't see him ever wanting to do anything like that. He's only doing this because it's court ordered he now has yeah

184
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:48.090
Galaxy A50: I took my son to a birthday party once and I said, he said something like, why did blah, blah, blah. And I said, well, I took him to a birthday party like two different errands, you know. And he said, Well, who asked you to

185
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:56.370
Galaxy A50: So he doesn't quite like grasp that it's, you can do it just because it's what a parent does

186
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.850
Galaxy A50: It's more like somebody made me

187
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.860
Yeah.

188
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.820
Galaxy A50: Any thoughts.

189
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.010
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I mean I would so Hayden is he's it the court order that he see a therapist.

190
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.900
Galaxy A50: Uh huh. Yeah.

191
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.530
Shawn Phalen: It's a therapist that he sees on his

192
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:36.330
Galaxy A50: On his own like oh he's well I don't know there's he's inside a group pediatric group.

193
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.370
Galaxy A50: And then, no, no.

194
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.460
Shawn Phalen: So this therapy, it's one on one counseling.

195
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.370
Galaxy A50: Yeah, yeah, uh huh. Yeah, and that's the court order.

196
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:55.350
Galaxy A50: Yeah, but that's for Hayden's trauma of being separated from anybody else can do whatever Hayden, and I used to see a therapist here.

197
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.940
Shawn Phalen: No, I understand.

198
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:05.040
Shawn Phalen: I'm just trying to okay so he's doing, he's doing individual therapy up there because it's a court order and

199
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.930
Galaxy A50: You have a therapist.

200
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.730
Shawn Phalen: Right, that he works with

201
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.510
Shawn Phalen: And you were wanting to have sessions with Hayden with his counselor.

202
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:23.100
Galaxy A50: I originally just wanted one session. So the gentleman COULD HELP US COMMUNICATE but

203
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:34.290
Galaxy A50: A dental like I wanted like half an hour, maybe just because there were certain things that being said that maybe didn't come across correctly.

204
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:43.980
Galaxy A50: Between me and Hayden, and then we could both individually handle like

205
00:31:45.420 --> 00:32:00.270
Galaxy A50: Like for example, I want help, and I want to learn how to not get my feelings hurt by certain things right but i at the same time, when he didn't to learn not to say certain things.

206
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:22.050
Galaxy A50: Just because that seems like the quick easy thing to do. Like he wrote me something about making a mistake, but it wasn't that big of a mistake and I was trying to kind of get him to not worry about this so much. And I was doing a very good job. I mean, I didn't dismiss him in any way.

207
00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.470
Galaxy A50: I address that he had an issue.

208
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:39.690
Galaxy A50: I suggested that this is not that big of a deal and to look on the positive and then I kind of try to take his mind off it with something else. And he wrote me unblocking unit.

209
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:55.350
Shawn Phalen: So here's the deal. If he is quarter to do his own therapy that into the own therapy that it's not the forum for you to say, hey, can you help us learn how to communicate the therapist.

210
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:56.670
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

211
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.400
Shawn Phalen: So the therapist is going to work directly with Hayden, and it's actually because this is court ordered

212
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.710
Galaxy A50: Yeah, I get it.

213
00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:25.650
Galaxy A50: But what I don't like is that he kept lying to me for however long if he would have just told me this. Yeah, the whole thing would have been taken care of fast. So now I have a different therapist and

214
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:32.610
Galaxy A50: Everything is set except my ex husband being the driver will not make the appointment to bring Hayden.

215
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.650
Shawn Phalen: Well, it's court ordered. He has to do that.

216
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:55.740
Galaxy A50: Well, it's not. It's the recommendation of the court ordered a counselor. So that's what I'm saying. Is it like a chain reaction kind of thing. I have no idea, but I have nobody to complain to and under the circumstances. I'm kind of okay but this. Yeah.

217
00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.850
Shawn Phalen: It's not court ordered by the judge.

218
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.400
Not a court order.

219
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:16.800
Galaxy A50: No, I get that. It's not a court order, but I was not aware that for everything that I asked my ex husband, I have to have a court order like some people should just use their brain.

220
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:30.150
Galaxy A50: So for me to be able to get a court order he first has to somehow say no or ignore me right so he's now been ignoring me for about five, six days.

221
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.530
Galaxy A50: I'm fine with this. It's just at the moment.

222
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.860
Galaxy A50: I have nobody to complain to time is, however, passing and

223
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.170
Galaxy A50: I feel like it could really help us, but there's nothing I can do.

224
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:57.030
Galaxy A50: I'm not trying to enforce a quarter. I'm just trying to help myself and my son stay as close as we used to be. Yeah. And I know it's really hard.

225
00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:58.830
Shawn Phalen: Not there.

226
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.320
You 12 right

227
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.180
Shawn Phalen: So that's kind of the age where they start to pull away.

228
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.860
Sir, to try and find their independence.

229
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:24.270
Galaxy A50: I completely respect this except my son is not really doing this. He is more Miss quoting somebody or miss.

230
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:34.860
Galaxy A50: Miss raising me and the same things that are somewhat hurtful and somewhat almost non existent. Yeah.

231
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:43.590
Galaxy A50: So when I explained, like we we wait, what are you referring to, then he's like, oh, okay. So I wrote him if I could just very quickly.

232
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:56.580
Galaxy A50: He likes those cards, you know, the ones that when you open something jiggles and shakes. So I got one for my birthday, and it was like a Kim Kardashian looking lady and her but shook and divided

233
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:15.420
Galaxy A50: So, and my son, to this day, think sparks are hilarious. So his card that I sent him you open the card and it says, it says redneck fireworks and as you open it, it makes this part in like an exclusion thing.

234
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:28.290
Galaxy A50: My son's reaction was haha very funny in I'm just like, What, now, like how do you not like something with barks, and he's like,

235
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:36.270
Galaxy A50: Are you being sarcastic know why because you said everybody in Idaho is a redneck

236
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:48.390
Galaxy A50: Like I never set this so then it becomes even though I did not mean to it becomes somewhat argumentative right suit. And I was like, Hayden. Never in my life have I said

237
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:57.210
Galaxy A50: And then he's like, No, you. You said this, you always say this. So if somebody just listening to this part, I'm coming off the bat. Right. And then I'm like,

238
