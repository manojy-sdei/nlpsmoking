48
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.630

Richelle Direny: When did you get diagnosed with multiple personality.

64
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:28.500
tim: I've had, I've been diagnosed and seen doctors since I was 14 so I've had a ton of diagnosis is that I could tell you, but I don't think they're accurate.

65
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.000
Richelle Direny: Where did you ever go see like psychologists or did they did.

66
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:36.960

70
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.250
tim: Not done done all that

71
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.400
Richelle Direny: I mean, I think a lot of people who pay and I in the past.

72
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.040
Richelle Direny: I've heard people with diagnosis, where I've been question like, where do you get such a diagnosis.

73
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:38.280
tim: Right, so I do see a therapist outside of this group and I have a psychologist or psychiatrist who prescribes my prescription meds, um,

74
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.350
tim: But I am working on things myself. Yeah, I see a therapist like twice a month outside of here.

75
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.160
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um,

76
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.680
Richelle Direny: And that's for the for your mental illness or their coats for Co occurring.

77
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.380
Richelle Direny: Mental illness and substance.

78
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.970
tim: For me to. Yeah, figure out

79
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.830
tim: Those things. I wouldn't put a label on it.

80
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.830
tim: I'd say it's for everything.

81
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.640
tim: Not, not focused on one thing or another.

82
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.870
Richelle Direny: Let's see here that

83
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.950
tim: There's obviously no need to be seeing somebody so

84
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.000
tim: It is obvious that I need to be seeing somebody so yeah

85
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.240
Richelle Direny: I just wanted to see why.

86
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:04.740
tim: So like sometimes there's some things in groups that if you just don't know and I don't feel comfortable saying I'll just, I'll just say that

87
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:20.130
tim: I don't know if you'd be able to get everything that you need to know about me in a session. That's why I asked for this warm one because there's a lot of questions that maybe you should ask.

88
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.120
tim: So that I don't have to answer them and be embarrassed in front of a group

89
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:38.910
Richelle Direny: So in the in the two sessions are in the two groups that we've attended what I'm what questions were asked that for you felt

90
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.660
tim: No, no, nothing like that. I'm just trying to avoid that.

91
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.180
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, trying to avoid. Okay.

92
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:56.550
Richelle Direny: I mean, but overall, in terms of, like, even with the isolation, it sounds like. Is it is it um

93
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:03.750
Richelle Direny: You have social anxiety is one of your diagnosis as one of your diagnosis. Sure.

94
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.180
Richelle Direny: You said sure, as in like, okay, I'll go with that or is it actually

95
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.820
tim: I don't trust people I don't trust anybody.

96
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.690
tim: I paranoia paranoid delusions.

97
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.770
Richelle Direny: Will come

98
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:32.010
Richelle Direny: Out. Now, in turn, now how is it for the groups, given that you're in a group setting and you're having to share or speak and sometimes questions are asked how does that, you know,

99
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:45.240
tim: Really have a problem, whether they're just like sometimes my answers can be good. Oh, personal to where the the therapist might understand, but the rest of the people grew my not

100
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.810
tim: Because they don't want my life just like anybody else.

101
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.720
Richelle Direny: Now,

102
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:11.880
Richelle Direny: Well, how in the length of time or over the years that you've been in therapy. How has that in terms of working and you say you work with multiple therapists.

103
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:19.680
tim: So that since I was 14 years old. Yeah, I can see it's lose of therapists and psychiatrists

104
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:29.790
Richelle Direny: And in that time in terms of your social anxiety in your parents haven't gotten worse over the years, or has it gotten better.

105
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.210
tim: No gun. I mean, like,

106
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:43.500
tim: My anxiety is a little bit more under control. But no, I had a mental breakdown, like a couple months ago and thought crazy

107
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:50.640
tim: And what was no delusion. So I wouldn't say that I compost mantas know

108
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.290
Now, yeah.

109
00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:02.100
Richelle Direny: Now I can now I can see maybe one aspect of the mental breakdown. You did say that you go you went, what, four days without sleep, you said

110
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:08.610
tim: Four days without sleep watching windows in my house and shadow people in the backyard. Yeah.

111
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.440
Richelle Direny: Okay, yeah, four days without sleep. I mean, listen. On the fourth day

112
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.360
tim: None. I think that my dreams are real and actually happening and

113
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.140
Richelle Direny: Yes, that's a perfect recipe for a psychological

114
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.600
tim: Breakdown. Right, right. I know.

115
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.850
Richelle Direny: You're not sleeping. Now what was going on that led you to not sleep. Is it like we're

116
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:36.780
tim: getting death threats and people showed up to my house and then people followed me around the neighborhood with guns.

117
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.590
Richelle Direny: Okay and this one.

118
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:53.940
tim: Was more than normal just death threats, where I brush them off. And so you are people roll up on me and mega threat or want to fight this is different.

119
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:03.750
Richelle Direny: Now is this due to because you did say that at one point you were a dealer. Do you think that that period of time that you weren't

120
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.180
Richelle Direny: Yes, that's part of what was kind of

121
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Okay. And how long ago did you stop.

122
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:12.720
Richelle Direny: Feeling

123
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.760
tim: Stuck dealing um

124
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.490
tim: I don't know.

125
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.890
tim: Once I got over

126
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.110
tim: A soul. I used to sell medication, a little bit, but I've stopped doing that.

127
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.180
tim: Probably for like a

128
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.670
tim: year, year and a half and selling drugs.

129
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:47.400
Richelle Direny: Okay. So about a year and a half. And so that here. Is it that wherever you were, were you dealing for someone like working for someone

130
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:53.850
tim: Oh no, I, I get the medications myself and I sell them or I

131
00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:05.820
tim: Kill you or something, or I get front of the sheets of acid or vials, the acid or Academy and GMT Moscow and show like that and solid

132
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.710
Richelle Direny: Okay, so there were things that you were selling your old medication for selling and

133
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.330
tim: I'm also able to get front hallucinogens and solemn

134
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.150
tim: And big quantities.

135
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:27.870
Richelle Direny: Now,

136
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:40.620
Richelle Direny: I'm just trying to with all of the years of therapy that you've been going through that you said that you've been a part of the paranoia someone have gotten worse.

137
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.410
Richelle Direny: I would say maybe in the last six months to a year has the doctor increase, decrease

138
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:57.030
tim: Change. Yeah, increased put me on the on Conan yeah it's been helping a lot

139
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:05.820

140
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.800
Richelle Direny: Now,

141
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:29.430
tim: All the medication and gather makes me feel emotionally numb. I feel like Suboxone robbed me of every, every everything I want I wake up in the morning I take my meds and I have no desire to get out of bed or do anything. I have no energy for it.

142
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:44.010
tim: I'm so dedicated that I I hate it. I'm trying to get off of it. I'm trying to get off Suboxone as well. But for right now it's my safe. You know, so

Richelle Direny: So you're you're actively working on getting off of Suboxone

146
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.460
tim: No, don't put that in my file.

147
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.240
tim: To be working on taking less Mads,

148
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.640
Richelle Direny: Well, one. Okay, so let me reword that then I mean we've heard that.

149
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.110

151
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.140
Richelle Direny: Either way, just follow just hear what hear my question.

152
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.690
Richelle Direny: Your question.

153
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:41.310
Richelle Direny: Overall, like I was discussing group or anywhere else. I mean, in your own in anyone's own time.

154
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:53.010
Richelle Direny: If they want to taper off of any medication. They do that in their own time and that is the conversation that you have with your, your physician or whoever's prescribing medication.

155
00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:08.760
Richelle Direny: I'm from a clinical standpoint, from my standpoint, I mean, I can't take you off or reduce your K for you. I can't do any of that only the your primary or the doctor to do that or whoever's prescribing medication can do that.

156
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.380
Richelle Direny: My

157
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:17.190
Richelle Direny: My question is more related to your ultimate goal.

158
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.290
Richelle Direny: Because as

159
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:36.660
Richelle Direny: I think it was no I think he was in another group, but in a group, you would hear me only safe when it's all said and done, as a matter of fact, in the group last night with the with the statement that I'm that I read the little blurb that I read the group discussion was good.

160
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:46.290
tim: I Don't Think things will ever change with my parents, no matter how much I try, no matter how much things have proven to them.

161
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.140
tim: They didn't put up cameras in the house. It's like I could wear a body cam I would

162
00:19:52.710 --> 00:20:03.300
tim: BEFORE I GO ANYWHERE I COULD questioned up and down and it causes a fight between my parents. And when I get home. I get questioned up and down and causes a fight between me and my parents.

163
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:11.250
tim: And I'm telling the truth. I've been telling them the truth for a very long time and I will never an inch of

164
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:18.960
tim: Any of their respect or or truth or anything.

165
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.620
tim: They will never change it.

166
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:35.640
Richelle Direny: I'm not talking about your parents because you're, you're not in counseling, you're not working your program because of your parents, you're working your program for you.

167
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.570
tim: I'm doing fine right now.

168
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:51.570
Richelle Direny: But just now, you talked about, you know, overall, you find that for you. The medication. What makes you emotionally numb and is

169
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.360
Richelle Direny: Do you think that's a good place to be who you want to be emotionally numb.

170
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.560
tim: Or do I mean sometimes isolation is better than

171
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:12.660
tim: I need to be taking this time to work on myself. It doesn't really bother me. People aren't asking of me to I told my parents that I mean I

172
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:26.790
tim: I do shoot the shit around the house but like I've stopped asking them to tell me to get a job I've stopped asking them to expect so much man because they need to back off because I need to take this time for myself so I'm not

173
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.290
tim: I'm not liking it, but I am dealing with it.

174
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.680
Richelle Direny: So you're not liking.

175
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:47.310
Richelle Direny: The situation. The, the numbness that it cause you're not liking the whole big picture, but you're you're learning how to cope with it and deal with it because, in your mind, there's

176
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:54.450
tim: Well, I used to be on three and fall asleep all day so I got came over from that.

177
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.940
tim: I used to be on so much medication that fall asleep on the bus. I fall asleep and meetings on a show like that so

178
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:04.500
Richelle Direny: No.

179
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.850
tim: Getting better

180
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.230
Richelle Direny: So, but, again, going back to my question and hear me out before you answer.

181
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.460
tim: I'm sorry, I guess.

182
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.820
tim: Maybe it takes a long time for you to

183
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.130
tim: Ask the question.

184
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.910
tim: I'm sorry if I'm interrupting, maybe I don't see a question coming like

185
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.310
What

186
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:45.450
Richelle Direny: Do you want to be in a place or do you want to work towards being in a place where you're no longer emotionally numb and that you're actually working on pulling back the mandate to get to the core of your, your issues.

187
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.710
Who would

188
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.950
tim: Who would it

189
00:22:51.960 --> 00:23:08.910
Richelle Direny: You're right. Who wouldn't, but this question is specifically for you because in one breath. You say, Well, I'm fine. Right now, but then in another. You said that I'm emotionally numb and based on my observation of you in the short amount of time that I've had an interaction with you.

190
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.610
Richelle Direny: You are some, will you come across somewhat robotic

191
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:38.400
tim: In terms of, I mean, I mean, I'm fine. As in, I'm not a time bomb here. I'm not thinking of going out and doing things and using I don't ever think you using the heaven for years. I'm not waiting. I'm not about to jump ship and go run anywhere. I'm fine. Like, I'm ready. I'm

192
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:50.520
tim: The one on stage will be working on this and also say in the same sense I fucking hate the life that I'm living

193
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:56.790
Richelle Direny: I agree I i get that from day one I get back from everything that you said

194
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.280
Richelle Direny: How and in what you're saying you'd like you said what you just said.

195
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:20.550
Richelle Direny: I would take it more on the extreme end of the thought process or, you know, and I'm not thinking that way. And I'm not gathering that you're at that place, but where I am right now in my line of exploratory questioning is

196
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:32.520
Richelle Direny: Starting with you being emotionally numb and if your ultimate goal if your ultimate goal is to not be so emotionally numb.

197
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:48.000
Richelle Direny: Then it is identifying those issues in circumstances that keep you emotionally numb the medication, to some degree, maybe the the dose of it. Maybe you feel that way. But at the end of the day.

198
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.210
Richelle Direny: Your way of coping with all of your presenting

199
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.320
Richelle Direny: issues or problems.

200
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:13.170
Richelle Direny: Your way of dealing with it is just being numb is just saying, you know what I am numbing myself towards it. I don't want to feel because feeling it puts me in a place of discomfort.

201
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.580
tim: Saying I

202
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.780
tim: AM SAYING I do feel it. I'm not numb to

203
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:37.080
tim: I do feel feelings. I am learning how to deal with them off being drugs. I just don't deal with the situations that I'm in right now with my parents living here because there's nothing I can do about it.

204
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, now

205
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.260
Richelle Direny: Should I gather that if you were not

206
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:59.850
Richelle Direny: Living with them. If you were supposed to move out of the current situation that you were in it will put you in a better place to work through a lot of

207
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:06.120
tim: Yes, I needed to be out of here so that I can work on myself better

208
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:15.240
Richelle Direny: But that's not based on what you're saying that's not going to happen in the very near future. I

209
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.770
tim: hope it does.

210
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.790
tim: I'm on

211
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.840
What

212
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:30.240
Richelle Direny: I hope for you. It does too. But while you're if this last for the next month. We're just going to put it short term in the next month.

213
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:38.580
Richelle Direny: What can we work on are what are you working on to at least help to

214
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.200
Richelle Direny: Alleviate or get through some of your stress.

215
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:53.340
tim: I don't know. I don't know what to do with my parents anymore. We had a huge argument about me going and getting coffee and then leaving the house for two hours.

216
00:26:53.850 --> 00:27:05.310
tim: And I had a huge argument with them asking them, you know, heart, trying to have a heart to heart with them and they wouldn't continue the conversation told me to go away.

217
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:16.200
tim: The my mom and my dad are communicating on the same level and brought something up to them. The other night that my mom agreed with my dad didn't

218
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:30.420
tim: Cause the huge fight between them. And I just shattered and said fuck it on so nevermind and caused a big fight between them. So I there's no i don't think that there's any

219
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.370
tim: Way to work with. So

220
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:47.880
tim: I don't, I don't see anything else I can do one here to make it easier for me besides isolated from them.

221
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.090
tim: Maybe the isolation will lead me into a job.

222
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:55.860
tim: I

223
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.450
Richelle Direny: isolating yourself also adds another level of

224
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.770
Richelle Direny: Anxiety, depression, anger that lead adds another level of you.

225
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.660
tim: What choice. Do I have

226
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.380
tim: What choice. I have but so I saw it hang out with people.

227
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.230
Richelle Direny: But then you said that you don't really trust people and

228
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.460
tim: I'm not injured and also not interested in going and hanging out with that one.

229
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.520
Richelle Direny: Okay. So when you say what choice do you have

230
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.790
Richelle Direny: Also not to hang out with him.

231
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:34.290
Richelle Direny: So,

232
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.700
tim: Going My friends or dad is just like, Who do I call the hang out with

233
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:47.190
tim: My brothers I've I'm brothers don't speak with me and my parents told them not to not to hang out with me.

234
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.490
Richelle Direny: You have any brothers. Do you have

235
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.330
Two.

236
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.920
Richelle Direny: And they all live in close proximity

237
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:05.040
tim: One of them was three blocks away and the other on yeah let's kind of be pretty close. They still with us.

238
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.550
tim: Not to like couple years ago. Have you tried out to them.

239
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.680
Richelle Direny: Outside of whatever your parents thing.

240
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:20.610
tim: Sure, but I view my parents is the final word. They say, Don't fuck with they can't fuck with them.

241
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:27.510
tim: They're not calling me to hang out there and I add me on Facebook, they're not talking to me. I don't

242
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.820
tim: See your talk to them unless holidays.

243
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.280
Richelle Direny: Are you older youngest middle

244
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.240
Younger

245
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:42.810
Richelle Direny: Now,

246
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:50.130
Richelle Direny: You also say that in there. When you say that their alcoholic, he said they're active or they have a history of

247
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.420
tim: My parents or my brother's your parents.

248
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.280
tim: Activists.

249
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:04.560
Richelle Direny: What is the most recent argument you had with them was when you went to get a cup of coffee.

250
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:30.450
tim: No, um, last night, a friend asked me if I wanted to go to the bar to shoot pool at 830 at night and I went downstairs and asked if that was cool. And my mom said it was my dad freaked out or and started a huge fight. I said, Fuck it. I'll stay home. I continued fighting until I went to bed.

251
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.270
Richelle Direny: Well, what is the relationship with your, your eyes, why you have to ask them okay for you.

252
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:45.900
tim: Because they don't trust me if I just up and left, then it would make them freak out more.

253
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.300
tim: And they put up cameras on the House to see what I'm doing.

254
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.790
Richelle Direny: What's the conflict between the both

255
00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.700
tim: They don't trust me.

256
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:03.660
Richelle Direny: No, no. But you said once that it's fine. But then the other SEC know

257
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:13.470
tim: So it's like, because he doesn't trust me, they think I'm going to do some massive drug dealer crowd and do a bunch of cocaine or some shit or or whatever the fuck they think

258
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.430
tim: A 30 at night. Oh, no, no, those hours. Oh.

259
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.780
tim: I'm talking 12

260
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:36.300
Richelle Direny: One request that I do have Tim is to come down on the profanity.

261
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:39.330
tim: Sure.

262
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:57.600
Richelle Direny: So it is a pretty hard situation that you're in, based on what you're saying everything that you're sharing is a pretty hard situation, I can definitely understand how overwhelming that you're living in a home that you're not necessarily free

263
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.480
Richelle Direny: To be

264
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.790
tim: I'm also not wanted to hear.

265
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.030
Richelle Direny: What you say you're not wanted. But then, same time, who are living there.

266
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.860
tim: I mean, you don't want me to be here.

267
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.010
Richelle Direny: So what options, have they given you

268
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.270
tim: Options, have they given me.

269
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.750
tim: They haven't given me any options.

270
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:27.570
Richelle Direny: Now because you said they don't want you to be there, but you are living there. So it's kind of

271
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.210
Richelle Direny: A double negative

272
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.450
tim: Because it but my mom doesn't want me to disappear.

273
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.000
tim: Again, my dad wants to kick me out.

274
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.870
tim: So mom is enjoying the fact that

275
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:50.040
tim: She is getting to know her son, my dad is not comfortable with any of it doesn't want to get to know me now.

276
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.440
tim: That's the only reason why I'm here.

277
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.400
Richelle Direny: Well, the conflict is not so much with mom, dad,

278
00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:57.870
Yes.

279
00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.830
Richelle Direny: So have you a dad always had a strong relationship.

280
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.880
tim: Me and my dad don't communicate well, he doesn't communicate well with anybody. It's well known, our family.

281
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.820
Richelle Direny: Is your brother's have the same

282
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:24.000
tim: doesn't communicate well with my mother, so it doesn't communicate well with my brothers. He doesn't communicate well there's employment with those employees. I'm guessing their co workers.

283
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.600
tim: He'll is there. He works in a factory or he doesn't have to communicate with people.

284
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.290
tim: It's always been under certain my family. Don't try to talk me out. He is. He

285
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:49.530
tim: Is he won't be able to talk about it or you don't be able to talk about about it with you.

286
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.100
Richelle Direny: Without having to

287
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.650
Richelle Direny: Without having to

288
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:22.770
Richelle Direny: In terms of how can I, because I also don't want to necessarily having to reinvent the wheel or start all over again from scratch, but

289
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.350
Richelle Direny: One moment. Let me just review this one second.

290
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.360
Richelle Direny: Dr.

291
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.930
Richelle Direny: Recommended getting off of the box.

292
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.230
tim: Nice. That guy just wants me all Suboxone so that we can work more in depth of last month.

293
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:24.840
Richelle Direny: So he does he feel that the Suboxone his contract indicated the segments that you're taking. Yes.

294
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.150
Richelle Direny: He know that you are back on the Suboxone

295
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:53.430
Richelle Direny: Yes you because you said that he put you on the line as a pan.

296
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.010
tim: Yes.

297
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:19.170
tim: Um, I told him that I would probably be off of it. I might be off of it by the next time I see him. I don't know.

298
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:55.470
tim: I just pulled down the back or I just fell down the top flight of stairs recently and fucked up my back and neck so he understands me wanting to be taking Suboxone went to the ER. They wanted to give me two months worth the percocet times. So it's a better choice.

299
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.760
Richelle Direny: Your brother works at a brewery, and he was trying to help you get a job. What happened to that.

300
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:58.590
tim: Um, the cooks already hired they're wanting to smoke weed.

301
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:11.850
tim: There was a bathroom. Next, the station where I work that has a window to the outside. I gave one of my pipes to smoke with they wanted smoked in there.

302
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:23.580
tim: And then when the boss asked, Why does it smell like weed and here they said, oh, Tim must be smoking dope in the bathroom. So I got fired for it, even though I did not do it.

303
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.500
Richelle Direny: And that also added to the reason why you don't trust people in on how

304
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:42.270
tim: I wouldn't say it helps, but it didn't make any thing better or worse.

305
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.650
tim: It's kind of what I expected.

306
00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.470
Richelle Direny: Now,

307
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:05.610
Richelle Direny: Looking at one of the notes that you when you met with talks about not

308
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:17.040
Richelle Direny: Spirituality are not very spiritual, but given that there will be some for you to still be alive. We do believe that there is a higher power.

309
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:21.810
tim: Question.

310
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:32.940
Richelle Direny: No, I was just looking. What does that mean helped me to understand that when you say there's no reason for you to be alive. What you believe there is a higher power.

311
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.000
tim: Um, well, I started doing

312
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:52.230
tim: Was 14 and I've overdosed and God will cope with Narcan in the hospital like over 30 times I also overdosed on I was 15 on next to see and got a shock with the paddles, but to life.

313
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:58.110
tim: Than a lot of situations shoot out stabbings have been stabbed.

314
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:09.210
tim: A lot of stuff I shouldn't be alive or I felt like I got picked up out of my group of friends and everyone else died, and I didn't

315
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:16.770
tim: But I mean, like, there's a reason, I guess.

316
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.650
tim: I'm no longer wants to die.

317
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.060
tim: Because I see that there's some reason that I'm here.

318
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.420
Richelle Direny: To this point, I'm

319
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.280
Richelle Direny: Still feel like there is a power higher than yourself.

320
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.150
tim: Sure.

321
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.540
tim: I feel like you're focusing too much on that.

322
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:51.150
Richelle Direny: No, no, I'm not focusing any on anything. I'm just trying to understand your train of thought and I'm kind of what

323
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.700
Richelle Direny: Your beliefs and you know just understanding, a lot of the

324
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:03.810
tim: Coaches feel like my beliefs are very important than my addiction. It's like I answer on the server.

325
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:10.860
tim: Or America.

326
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:24.450
Richelle Direny: So help me then now to part of just the update just your plan, like, what, what are your, what is your goal. Your goal when you're trying to

327
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.420
tim: The main goal is to be fully recovered just like any other addict.

328
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.270
Richelle Direny: And to be fully recovered.

329
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.320
tim: It includes my mental state, not just my drug addiction.

330
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:46.260
Richelle Direny: Exactly and where that is concerned. Now what it is that we can work on to address.

331
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:48.630
tim: Outside

332
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.400
Richelle Direny: Outside of

333
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.990
Richelle Direny: What you're already working on in your

334
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:00.060
Richelle Direny: With your, your therapist. Your outpatient therapist.

335
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:08.190
tim: I don't really know. I feel like I'm already somewhat addressing it by being an in group answering questions with other people.

336
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:20.100
tim: I don't really know if there's something specific that we need to work on our life. There's a lot of things.

337
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.310
Richelle Direny: You said you feel like there's a lot of things.

338
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:37.500
tim: I said, I don't think it's one thing specific that we should work on. I feel like there's a lot of things, but it's that way with each individual

339
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.190
tim: My main focus has to be recovered.

340
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:50.700
Richelle Direny: If there is one thing that you can identify to say, you know what I would like to work on this, and I would like to address it.

341
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.140
tim: I honestly can't

342
00:42:53.550 --> 00:43:00.990
tim: I'm trying, I'm thinking, and I can think it's to be recovered and I hope to be recovered.

343
00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:12.000
tim: I, I can't think of one thing right now. I can't say my relationship with my parents because it's hard for me to talk in group.

344
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.750
tim: Because usually my parents are buzzing around me.

345
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:24.000
Richelle Direny: Well, this is not this is we're talking about individual nothing to do because group is very general. We're very general conversation.

346
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:32.130
tim: I know I mean like you and I are personals I guess to, like, this is the only time that I've had a

347
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.510
tim: session where my parents are imposing around me.

348
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.960
tim: Nothing I can really do about that the computers in the kitchen.

349
00:43:47.760 --> 00:44:00.450
Richelle Direny: Okay, what is one goal that you're working on. Even though I know you talk a lot. You say a lot about your mental health in your individual there's nobody around you, it's just you and a therapist in a room, having a conversation

350
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:24.840
tim: I don't know. I already worked on my paranoia and social anxiety with my therapist with this there with you. I plan to work on my recovery and problems with addiction in everyday life and to be fully recovered.

351
00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.930
tim: I don't know how else to answer that.

352
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.090
Richelle Direny: Even in recovery and you talk about your

353
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.510
tim: I don't, I don't, I'm sorry.

354
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.600
tim: I don't know how else to answer that.

355
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:49.530
Richelle Direny: That I understand that you don't know how to answer that. But as I said you have to allow me to finish my train of thought. But I don't want you to get aggravated or frustrated. Sorry.

356
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.970
Richelle Direny: To come only because I don't want you to be frustrated

357
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.020
I'm straight.

358
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.610
Richelle Direny: When we're looking at addiction.

359
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.550
Richelle Direny: There is

360
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.610
Richelle Direny: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and

361
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:43.950
tim: Well, I feel like you're, as you're trying to get the answer for this one question, and I get it. But I don't know how to answer, I'm trying to the best of my ability, and you're asking it in different ways, which was making me very irritated. Oh.

362
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.050
tim: I don't know how else to answer it.

363
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.100
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then what we can do then is that

364
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.810
Richelle Direny: How often do you meet with your therapist outside

365
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.430
tim: Two times a month.

366
00:45:59.070 --> 00:45:59.880
Richelle Direny: Every other week.

367
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.530
Richelle Direny: Also from

368
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:03.960
tim: What

369
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.170
Richelle Direny: You said two times a month. So I'm guessing there's every other week.

370
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:20.820
tim: Yeah, every other week. I see my other therapist and then once a month. I mean, with my addiction therapists and I also have to me. Who is my psychiatrist every other month

371
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:26.400
Richelle Direny: Okay.

372
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:28.770
Richelle Direny: So,

373
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:37.050
Richelle Direny: While it would be good to meet with you. But then that seems like a lot of therapy.

374
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:46.050
tim: Right. That's why I try to keep my addiction therapy to once a month because I also have to make meetings with Dr farago

375
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.080
tim: Every other Monday, which is

376
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.890
tim: There's just a lot of therapy going on.

377
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.830
Richelle Direny: A lot of therapy. There's a lot of therapy.

378
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.260
tim: Right. That's why I get overwhelmed and frustrated. So I apologize for that.

379
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:16.050
Richelle Direny: Probably it is a lot of therapy. I mean, what I can say is an I can recommend is that we can check in. Once a month.

380
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.990
Richelle Direny: Or once every other month

381
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:30.180
Richelle Direny: Or as needed. You know, if you just need that extra support as needed, because what I don't necessarily agree with is

382
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:42.480
Richelle Direny: When you have another therapist on the outside or other therapists and they're working on something you having to go through everything over and over again with every therapist.

383
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:47.370
tim: Yeah, I don't like that either, but as something that I have to do.

384
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.850
Richelle Direny: Well, when you say you have to do it. Remember in everything that we do. We have a choice. And so

385
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:59.640
tim: You know, you can, um, give me what I need.

386
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.330
Richelle Direny: For what do you mean

387
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:16.620
tim: Okay, so I have this. So it's therapy for my addiction and my recovery and I have that therapy for my are and also this for my meds.

388
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:27.390
tim: And I have that therapy for my day to day dealings and social anxiety and just by general stuff. So there's, it's like it's better

389
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:34.110
tim: To have a team working on those things I do understand that there is a lack of

390
00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:47.790
tim: Of communication on some of those points, but I'm okay with that. And I'm more comfortable with that because there's some things that I'm more comfortable speaking with my other therapist, I am with my addiction therapists.

391
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:56.490
Richelle Direny: We would you mean that you're saying that you mean the two different therapists that you're working with on the outside. Right. That's what you're talking about. Right.

392
00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:03.750
tim: I'm talking about you and I'm talking about the other therapists, the psychiatrist isn't doesn't isn't a therapist.

393
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:21.120
Richelle Direny: I agree with them. So I'm just, I'm just trying to get clarity in when you say that moving forward. If you meet with because yes, you're absolutely right when you're working with a team. But then we're not a team that necessarily communicates with each other. You're saying

394
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.380
tim: So, and I'm okay with that.

395
00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:23.340
tim: Because I

396
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.710
tim: I feel like

397
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:38.850
tim: You you to be goal oriented as you that you should be focusing on my addiction on my recovery and she should be focusing on the, the things that I'm speaking about with her.

398
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.480
Richelle Direny: Yes, but if you already have an addiction therapists outside as well.

399
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.030
tim: She's not an addiction therapist.

400
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.840
tim: She's seeing me and I am I added, but she is not an addiction therapists much

401
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:13.830
Richelle Direny: So then I would be considered your addiction therapists is what you're saying yes you have the one for your mental illness, you have your psychiatrist that you see. And then there was me. Right, let's just a total of three people.

402
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.390
tim: Right, what

403
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.980
tim: Else. Is there a reason that I got.

404
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:23.400
tim: switched out of Jodi's Europe. I was just wondering, because I felt like I got kicked out of it because I missed our meaning.

405
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.800
Richelle Direny: No, no, you didn't get kicked out of it. God cut back completely on this program.

406
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.340
tim: Okay, I get that she was super wrapped up in a

407
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.420
Yeah, she was, she was, um,

408
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.990
Richelle Direny: I started to go over everything for her.

409
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:42.600
tim: Okay, so

410
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:50.400
Richelle Direny: I just, I was I'm sorry I was confused because I thought you had to other including your psychiatrist to on the surface.

411
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:52.950
Richelle Direny: So now.

412
00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:13.080
tim: I see my psychiatrist from ads. Um, and then I see the therapist that doesn't here in the therapist doesn't even communicate with my psychiatrist. There was no like links between my mice. My second my bike. My psychiatrists my therapist and my addiction purpose.

413
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:20.490
Richelle Direny: Okay, but like I said for me.

414
00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:34.650
Richelle Direny: The way I operate for me as a clinician, how I operate when you're looking at addiction therapy. I'm looking at the whole gamut. I'm looking at

415
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:41.100
Richelle Direny: Your addiction is one thing, but there's something that is causing the addiction.

416
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.870
tim: I understand that, but I don't think that our sessions there long enough for us to be able to capture the entire thing.

417
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:53.430
tim: And you can i know i don't want to have to lie to you, just to make it into this group.

418
00:51:54.030 --> 00:52:00.060
Richelle Direny: None, and you're not. But remember, when you say that it's not long enough. Remember, there's always

419
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.580
tim: More sir. Yeah, I can do.

420
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.460
tim: More therapy. I can do.

421
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:15.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah, see, there isn't. You can never capture everything in one session, even with your beer outside that you can never do everything in one session you only deal with one issue at a time.

422
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:15.720
Richelle Direny: And

423
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.280
tim: I was kind of being sarcastic. I don't want to do more therapy. I'm doing

424
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:35.640
Richelle Direny: Okay, regardless if you're being sarcastic or not, but I'm just telling you the reality of, of whether it's your meeting with me or anybody else you can never capture everything in one session and working through

425
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:43.020
Richelle Direny: Whatever it is that you need to work on. So if it was, if you were meeting with me for depression.

426
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:51.000
Richelle Direny: That it's over the course of many sessions that you work through that and if depression is what

427
00:52:53.730 --> 00:53:06.630
Richelle Direny: propels into or is the catalyst to your addiction. Then we're going to be working on your depression if your anxiety is the catalyst to your addiction, then that's what we'll be working on whatever

428
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:10.830
tim: I feel like my living situations catalyst my addiction.

429
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:18.750
Richelle Direny: But then if that is the catalyst and if that's the core of what's going on right now that makes you have the urge, I'm not saying that you

430
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:28.170
Richelle Direny: Know, I'm not saying, and I'm not suggesting that you have it right now. But if it is the catalyst that makes you you know

431
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:40.470
Richelle Direny: Have thought of using or whatever that is, if that's your stressor right now. If that's your overwhelming situation right now. That's what we work on. That's what we talk about now.

432
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:49.080
Richelle Direny: It's not effective to say, let's do that once a month or once every other month. What can you really do once a month or once every other month that

433
00:53:50.250 --> 00:54:05.370
Richelle Direny: That's not going to be effective you I mean how therapy works is that you meet with your therapist, whether it's weekly until you get to a place where you're able to cope with your situation, then you move into once a month or once every other month

434
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.440
tim: So what are you suggesting

435
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.560
Richelle Direny: You tell me. Because you just said that you don't want to meet

436
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.290
Richelle Direny: For. So you tell me

437
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:20.610
tim: I would suggest to me more if you if you suggest that I mean you're the, the boss here.

438
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:37.410
Richelle Direny: Tim. This is I'm going to answer, I'm going to ask you a straightforward question I will always recommend weekly sessions, but are you able to meet weekly. Are you at a place where you can meet we

439
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.510
tim: Know, I would miss miss it a lot.

440
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.660
Richelle Direny: And why do you feel you're missing a lot because you're saying that

441
00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.690
tim: So many other things going on throughout the week.

442
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.260
Richelle Direny: So what will work for you, then

443
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.440
tim: Believe me, if

444
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.940
tim: I had an individual and group once a month.

445
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.200
tim: That's what I was doing with God.

446
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:31.290
Richelle Direny: Now I want you to think about this question, and I want you to answer it fairly is it that you've just gotten used to meeting with Jody be clean.

447
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:40.050
tim: And, you know, no i i feel like she was definitely on my side. And she understood everything that I

448
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:46.530
tim: had put forth to her and she understood and respected it. So that's why

449
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:56.160
tim: That's why we were able to focus on what we focused on and still be able to render for that we had

450
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:04.620
Okay.

451
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:13.650
Richelle Direny: So we go back to you would prefer one someone so then we can meet once a month, once a month.

452
00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.570
tim: Yeah.

453
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.210
Richelle Direny: So we'll just meet once a month.

454
00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.930
tim: I feel like you're not happy with that.

455
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:33.870
tim: Yes.

456
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:35.820
I feel

457
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:47.970
Richelle Direny: Happy. It's fine if you want to meet again i like i said once a month is fine, you are if you were not meeting with someone else outside if I was the only therapist who will be a very different conversation.

458
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:59.850
tim: But I understand. I understand that and i would i would i would consider that an option. If I was able to be alone with this other

459
00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.780
tim: Party, and I'm not able to do that.

460
00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:21.030
tim: I'm able to go see my therapist. My parents aren't there I can talk about what I want when I mean with you guys restricted I talked about 16 my addiction and

461
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:28.200
tim: That's, that's kind of what I have to do. There's no I can't, I can't, like,

462
00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:36.990
Richelle Direny: What are their days that is better for you are times it's better for you, where you feel like you have complete privacy.

463
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.630
tim: During the daytime like

464
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.930
tim: I mean, they're always

465
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:51.990
tim: In and out. But during the daytime, like how it used to be like 1130 1030

466
00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:57.810
tim: Those times I'm usually completely alone. Other than that.

467
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.800
tim: Those people here, or no, no.

468
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:25.800
tim: These late at night. Both my parents are here so that doesn't help at all. There are blocks away in the room right now because I tell them that I need to be alone for individual and they're not happy with that they will make me feel like, shut up about it since I brought it up.

469
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.300
tim: Like I'm hiding something.

470
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:50.370
tim: And I've already conveyed conveyed. I've been conveying how I feel about this truthfully, honestly, from the heart to my parents since day one and

471
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:57.000
tim: Like I said, things aren't going to change between them.

472
00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:16.290
What

473
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.020
Richelle Direny: You're saying anything. You're saying any day during the day is necessary.
