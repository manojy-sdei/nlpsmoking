00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.820
Mitch: Hello. How are you, I'm good, how are you

2
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.740
Good.

3
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.260
Mitch: Defend my pen, pardon me for one second. I need to blow my nose.

4
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.310
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

5
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.310
Shawn Phalen: Tell me what's going on.

6
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.080
Mitch: Well,

7
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.360
Mitch: A lot of quarantine,

8
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.650
Mitch: And driving been driving me nuts.

9
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.700
Mitch: Hours have been cut down drastically at work.

10
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.790
Mitch: From full time to, I don't know, I'll be lucky to work like two days a week.

11
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:51.120
Mitch: I kind of sucks. I'm, I'm, I like routine. I had a good routine going on. I was used to the money I was making now everything has kind of been turned upside down so

12
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.510
Shawn Phalen: Remind me what you were what you do, again,

13
00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:06.450
Mitch: I build a shed like construction. I work for a company called California Barnes. Okay. How long have you been doing. I've been there, just about six months.

14
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.800
Mitch: I build the floors, for every shed. So, and I was making commission to on every floor that I build I make commission. So it actually make a really good money.

15
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.250
Mitch: And now kind of cut back

16
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.970
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so tell me where you're living

17
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.360
Mitch: I live in. I live like the city. Now who do you live with. Oh, I live with my girlfriend and our daughter.

18
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.560
Shawn Phalen: Okay, is this going to be a financial burden for you guys.

19
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.790
Mitch: No, no, we're all right. Luckily I we've been saving and Rory. Okay. Hopefully we pull out of it soon.

20
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:59.910
Mitch: But didn't you guys just get some weeks tack them like you got to go to May 15. Yeah, that's what I hear. And yeah, no, I think, how it affects my work is we get, like, a lot of our nails and hardware from China. So

21
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.600
Mitch: That's, that's all kind of stopped.

22
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:16.680
Mitch: So we're used to doing inventory and special orders and obviously there's a lot more. It's probably about 80% inventory 20% special orders and now we can only do special orders.

23
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.260
Mitch: Yeah.

24
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.840
Mitch: I mean,

25
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.270
Mitch: We're healthy, where we have a house overhead. We have food in our bellies and we've got each other. So, I mean, it could be a lot worse.

26
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.920
Shawn Phalen: You know, and this will and you know it will end.

27
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:48.270
Mitch: It's just, you know, just getting through it do time in due time. It's a lesson in patience. Yeah, you know, and it has to be done the right

28
00:03:48.270 --> 00:04:01.770
Mitch: Way because if we open the country up too soon, then we run the risk exactly down again. So hey, this is crazy. It's crazy, but yeah.

29
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.160
Shawn Phalen: So, um,

30
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.210
What are some things you want to work on anything that's like pressing for you. Like you wanting to go or

31
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.740
Mitch: Um, well, I'm on ankle monitor. So for a year. So

32
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.730
Mitch: As I've kind of been quarantined before the quarantine started

33
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.850
Mitch: Though, but I mean,

34
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.690
Mitch: Just some in general things that I want to work on. Yeah.

35
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.430
Shawn Phalen: So like as we meet like you know

36
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.640
This is just to kind of help you. This is just to give you some added support, you know, if you're having

37
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.920
Mitch: You know, things that come up in between the groups because I know you did the groups. Yeah. Yes, it's just

38
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.750
It's just for added support.

39
00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:05.730
Shawn Phalen: It certainly doesn't have to be something that we do every week, but I'm right hearts gonna start requiring people to meet with a therapist at least once or twice a month. Okay, so

40
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:17.550
Mitch: You know it's you can even just be general things. It doesn't have to be anything that's, you know, well I mean what I've kind of been interested in

41
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.450
Mitch: Working on myself as being a better parent or a parent like adopting some parenting skills or and

42
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.710
Mitch: Seeing how I can exercise, being a better significant other. Yeah.

43
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:51.720
Mitch: Those are just a couple of things. I mean, I've definitely probably need to work some work on both of them. So do you feel like you have a good relationship with your girlfriend or do we just, we don't exactly see eye to eye all the time.

44
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.590
Mitch: But at the end of the day, at the end of the day.

45
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.410
Mitch: We know that we're meant for each other.

46
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.440
Mitch: We've actually been together since

47
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.000
Mitch: About July, we started we got together.

48
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:27.930
Mitch: Not too long ago we were actually expecting our daughter, daughter in July night. Wow. So about exactly a year after we got together. Okay, so you have

49
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.430
Shawn Phalen: She has a daughter, that's

50
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.120
Mitch: Yes, she does. She just turned four years old.

51
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.960
Shawn Phalen: Are you ready to be a daddy.

52
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.960
Mitch: I am well ready or not. I'm excited.

53
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.470
Mitch: Exactly. Yeah, you're

54
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.980
Mitch: Not really. Anxiety just

55
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.200
Mitch: I'm just excited. I'm ready for her to be here. I want to meet her, and take care of her.

56
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.950
So like what questions do you have about parenting.

57
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.930
Mitch: Oh, sure.

58
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.710
Mitch: Well, I mean, the parenting thing is kind of new to me.

59
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.040
Mitch: I mean, a year ago I was

60
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.840
Mitch: shooting heroin running the streets with no saw or site and slowing down at all and then

61
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:25.620
Mitch: Now, here I am with the roof over my head full time job and expecting the parent or an apparent to one but expecting my first daughter.

62
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.150
Mitch: I don't know, I just sometimes I have a hard time

63
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:45.120
Mitch: With discipline. Okay. Um, and, I mean, I don't know, I feel like I'm doing it right. But sometimes I don't. I don't know. This is all new to me.

64
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.640
Shawn Phalen: So,

65
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.800
Shawn Phalen: Maybe one thing when we can think about this is taking what didn't work when you were young.

66
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:16.650
Mitch: So how your parents raised you the parts that were really not okay yeah don't incorporate those into your parenting skills and take the ones that really worked. And that you appreciate it and incorporate them. I'm the one thing with kids to say love structure.

67
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.180
He

68
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.690
Does is that gives them a sense of safety.

69
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:34.740
Mitch: So yeah and that's kind of, we haven't been here in our new apartment for too long. Few months now, and before we got here. We were kind of all over the place with not much routine or structure. So,

70
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.360
Shawn Phalen: Where were you living prior to your apartment.

71
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:54.630
Mitch: Well, prior. We were just we're staying in an apartment or a motel but waiting for this apartment to open up and prior to that we were staying at my parents. And that was, that was good. Sometimes, but sometimes it was not good.

72
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.450
Mitch: My, my mother. My mother is kind of all over the place. So one day she loves me one day she hates me.

73
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.390
Mitch: So, but, um, yeah. I keep that in mind too that this is all kind of got a sink in, and

74
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.870
Mitch: For how to know

75
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:22.560
Mitch: Sometimes I chalked it up to her being kind of wild is that this. She's just now settling in. And how place to call home.

76
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.390
Mitch: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

77
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.170
Mitch: So I can't really expect her to, you know,

78
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:42.870
Mitch: Mind everything, you know, let's go get used to all the structure and stuff. And she's for yeah

79
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:57.390
Mitch: They're into everything. Yeah, sometimes I forget that she's four years old. She's such an adult. That's crazy. Yeah. So girls have a little bit more maturity point yeah um

80
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:06.000
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. So as long as you're giving her you know like bedtimes at the same time dinners at the same time.

81
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.830
Mitch: See, and that's like a big thing like

82
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:21.960
Mitch: It's not huge things that are problem just like bedtime. Sometimes she she wants to stay up really late but that's another thing I chalked up to when we, when we didn't have our own roof over our heads bedtimes we're kind of all over the place, right.

83
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:42.300
Mitch: So, so here's the thing is, and I hear this a lot, is that kids want to stay. I'm I hear sometimes kids especially with this quarantine and not having to get up to go to school, they're staying up until 234 in the morning. That's crazy. Or like, that is crazy.

84
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.710
So,

85
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.750
Shawn Phalen: You want to have

86
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.140
Shawn Phalen: This is how it like okay dinner right then you do bath.

87
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.720
Book bed.

88
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.030
Mitch: Yeah.

89
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:08.070
Mitch: Matthew do any have four year olds need a ton of sleep so she should not be going

90
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.650
Shawn Phalen: You shouldn't be up past what eight

91
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:11.790
Yeah.

92
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:22.140
Mitch: Eight. Nine. So Max, you know. Yeah. Like I would push for eight because she in preschool when thing. Not yet. Okay.

93
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.450
Shawn Phalen: So here's the thing is like you want to get her on a schedule because when preschool starts

94
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.050
Mitch: She exactly not to get her you know like

95
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:41.640
Shawn Phalen: You know, kids four year old should not be sleeping until 910 11 o'clock in the morning like that is not, that's not cool. No.

96
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.530
Mitch: Because then you're just

97
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:52.020
Shawn Phalen: You're asking for way more work on the back end, so it's easier if you do it right now on the front end and get everybody settled in situated.

98
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.730
You know, you're going to want to have your girlfriend be on board with that.

99
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.460
Mitch: With that stuff we're on the same page. Okay. Yeah.

100
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:09.150
Shawn Phalen: And so maybe some days it's, I don't know, however you want to work it where you guys alternate

101
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:19.770
You know bath time reading the book, putting her down. Like, I don't know, that's kind of however you guys want it tour, whatever works for

102
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.180
You know, maybe you start doing that mom.

103
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:34.320
Shawn Phalen: I don't know, talk about it. See what you want to do, because when the baby comes.

104
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.760
Yeah, you're gonna have a lot going on under one house. There's a lot of, you know, be tired.

105
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.480
Babies don't sleep through the night.

106
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.970
Shawn Phalen: You know there's their sleep schedule is and it's, it can be hell.

107
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.710
Mitch: Yeah, like

108
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.630
Tired. So

109
00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.120
Shawn Phalen: So hopefully by then you'll be back working. Does your girlfriend work.

110
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.280
Mitch: No, not a moment. Okay.

111
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.130
Shawn Phalen: So, you know, she's going to need a break.

112
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:12.570
Mitch: When you go back to work full time and all that stuff you come from, you're going to be tired, you know, you both going to be tired singing I want

113
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:25.230
Mitch: To make sure you're supporting each other. Yeah. And I honestly I don't, I don't really, she says she she wants to go to work, but I, I'm totally fine with working and

114
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:36.210
Mitch: Bringing home the income and her just being like focus on taking care of the baby. Yeah, right. But I mean issue, I can understand if she wants to get a job, man, you know,

115
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.340
Mitch: I can understand that. But either way, we'll work through it. Yeah.

116
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.830
Shawn Phalen: She, she has some time.

117
00:13:44.640 --> 00:14:02.490
Shawn Phalen: Yeah yeah yeah so yeah and then just making sure that you guys are on the same page, and that you guys are supporting each other and that you're, you know, it's really the most important thing is like communication that's so key.

118
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.430
Yeah, I can't even tell you like communication and trust or with make a relationship.

119
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.820
Mitch: I agree foundation. Right.

120
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.570
Shawn Phalen: And so, okay, so you have an ankle monitor for the next year.

121
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.670
Mitch: I do. Okay.

122
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:29.790
Mitch: Oh, it's just a accumulation of possession charges and it was it was never anything more than possession

123
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:37.650
Mitch: But an accumulation of in and out of jail, and I've missed court like once or twice so out of failure to appear.

124
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:46.620
Mitch: And it came to this. I'm grateful. They gave me the opportunity for an ankle monitor, but otherwise I'd be sitting my button jail.

125
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.710
Mitch: But I think I think only about three months in

126
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.680
Mitch: A while.

127
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.370
Mitch: Okay, it's not that big a deal. Yeah, I want. It's all over. It'll be just

128
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.260
Shawn Phalen: Me over

129
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.690
Mitch: Yeah. Yeah, right.

130
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.770
Shawn Phalen: So you only have a year probation, then does that video.

131
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:20.100
Mitch: Well, I'm still I'm on Prop 36 as well. So yeah, I have two cases one case I'm on the ankle monitor one case something crop 36

132
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.100
Shawn Phalen: So let's bring her prop 36 then

133
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.660
Mitch: They are, yes.

134
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.310
Mitch: My meetings that I do with bright heart count for my prop 36 meetings. Awesome.

135
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.690
Shawn Phalen: Um, how long does prop 36 last now.

136
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.300
Mitch: How many months is probably six

137
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.150
Mitch: Yeah, that's all done nine to 12 months, I think.

138
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.350
Mitch: Depending on like how you know

139
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.400
Mitch: If you're like you don't miss a meeting, you're on time for everything you get off sooner if you look

140
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.370
Shawn Phalen: I see you on the Suboxone

141
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.600
I am

142
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:27.750
Mitch: Ok cool TV on Suboxone obviously. Yep. They are me and me and one of my friend actually he's doing the same program through bright heart and we were the first two people here in Glen county to do the whole bright heart thing through the court system.

143
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.900
Mitch: That's awesome. Yeah.

144
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.360

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.580
Mitch: Yeah, this is all new and again

146
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:53.370
Mitch: This, I mean, it's really saved, saved our lives. Honestly, some people look at it differently, but the way I look at it. I'm not, you know, sticking. Who knows what into my arm and

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:04.170
Mitch: I'll take this Suboxone any day over that. Yeah, it's it's it's really amazing. I see amazing results from it.

148
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:18.180
Mitch: Just I still I still don't like the thought or the fact that I'm dependent on something. But, you know, eventually I'll start working on tapering down and getting off of it.

149
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:33.150
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, because if it allows you to lead a productive life. You know what I would not even worry about it right now, you know, get, get some long term sobriety under your belt and then think about tapering

150
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:44.370
Mitch: That's not something you need to know, you know, just look at it's giving you a second chance. You know, to create a life that you want. Exactly.
