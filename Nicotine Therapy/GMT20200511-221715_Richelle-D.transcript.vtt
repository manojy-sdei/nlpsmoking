34
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.000

35
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.480
rosita stotridge: My mom is a very difficult person.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:26.850
rosita stotridge: But my mom, my sister. Let's my kids go to my mom's and stay like she shouldn't be the judge. The judge knew how my sister was letting the kids go stay with my mom, it wouldn't it wouldn't fly.

39
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.180
rosita stotridge: Because I even asked at one point in time. If cuz I gotta be supervised with my visitations with my kids.

40
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:51.720
rosita stotridge: So I had asked if my mom could be the one that supervised the visitations with me and my kids because I could tell when my sister Monica was in the room with us. My kids would hesitate before they would

41
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.700
rosita stotridge: Ask me to do something or wanting wanted my affection or something. I could say I hesitate. They could they would hesitate on it.

42
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:19.680
rosita stotridge: But with my mom around. They didn't do you know they didn't act like that. So I had asked that I gotta Milan him and my lawyer and my sister and her husband and my mom could supervisor visitations my sister's said no, she didn't want my mom to do the

43
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:39.030
rosita stotridge: Super supervisor visitations because my mom was the tough person if you give her and she'll take it a mile, but that's the only. That's how I do see my kids is through my mom. I never really I've done like to visitations with my sister with my kids. The rest is with my mom.

44
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.860
rosita stotridge: But my sister didn't want to put that down on in the court papers. When I asked for it. My sister didn't want it.

45
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.230
For it. Yeah.

46
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.810
It's a mass

47
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.190
Richelle Direny: It seems like you didn't you have court sometime or something.

48
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.290
No.

49
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.300
Richelle Direny: I didn't you say something about like you have a care plan or something that you had to do that you wanted to for us to work on or

50
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.950
rosita stotridge: Yes, I do want to go, I want to go File for a new petition on the kids, I gotta go File for a new whole new petition on him.

51
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.040
Richelle Direny: And that petition is for you to gain

52
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:31.530
Richelle Direny: Gain my custody back. But then what the supervised visitation and everything that you're going through now. Isn't that part of it is that you're working on regaining custody.

53
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:41.250
rosita stotridge: No, that's just, that's just a care plan that they had come up with one my sister's GOT CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN.

54
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:54.660
Richelle Direny: But even with that care plan isn't now part of it is that there. I mean, there is not an order in place for them to, um, for you to

55
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.930
Richelle Direny: lose custody for them to

56
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.780
Richelle Direny: What is it called

57
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:13.110
Richelle Direny: Like, you are not your, your care plan is for you to for unit working towards reunification, not for them to what is it called, I forgot what it's called the kit.

58
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:28.650
rosita stotridge: The care plan that the CPS had sit down with me and my sister and we come up with where my sister's against my fiance. They're trying to say he's got anger issues. So my sister wanted me to file for a

59
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:43.560
Richelle Direny: Look at calls called what witness protection. No, no protection know what they want you to fight for your fiance. He wants to she wants to file on the shining water.

60
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:52.980
rosita stotridge: It's basically like a restraining order. Yes, for me, she wants me to file a restraining order against Tim is what she's telling the judge and the

61
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.900
Richelle Direny: Father restraining order against him, you live with him because she's saying.

62
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.840
rosita stotridge: That she don't want the kids. She didn't want the kids around him. She is what she's saying that he has

63
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.420
Richelle Direny: What are the, what are they, his father or aren't he, the father of the children. Yes.

64
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.130
rosita stotridge: But he's not on their birth certificates, because I'm currently married

65
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.180
Richelle Direny: And yeah.

66
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.730
rosita stotridge: So he right now he has no he has no razzi at all.

67
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.470
Richelle Direny: legal rights to them because of the fact that so the father. Your husband.

68
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:42.210
Richelle Direny: Would say that he is not taking any custody and that that he is not the Father and He relinquished whatever rights to them and then the by his biological your fiance.

69
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.690
Richelle Direny: The what but then why would she want to create a she would want to file a restraining order.

70
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.210
rosita stotridge: Why would you want me to get a restraining order.

71
00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:00.930
Richelle Direny: Yeah us. Yeah. Why would she, in general, even want to get a restraining order, whether it's you or get a restraining order.

72
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:09.990
rosita stotridge: Because her her in him. They have never got along. Never. And she just that something for her. She just used

73
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:24.000
rosita stotridge: She said that he has anger issues and she don't want him around the kids he has no domestic violence charges or there's nothing like that ever on him nothing like that. But that's what she's

74
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:31.170
rosita stotridge: And so they wanted me to do the restraining order. I had to regain my Lawson's

75
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:44.730
rosita stotridge: And I had to get a bigger home at the time, I had a three bedroom home so she said that I had had the judge wanted me to get a bigger home and for all the kids to resign and one home.

76
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:56.910
rosita stotridge: Because my oldest daughter was Dan with my biological mom through the week and going to school and on the weekends come into my house.

77
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:07.650
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yes, I remember that. And then you said that your step mom who is a little bit on the younger side was I'm also helps your dad with the kids, right.

78
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.690
rosita stotridge: He'll yes with the other three

79
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.400
rosita stotridge: There's

80
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:21.750
Richelle Direny: A problem because of the fact that your sister doesn't care for your step mom. Yes.

81
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:29.970
rosita stotridge: So they got me on neglect, because where I live my step mom keep

82
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:42.900
rosita stotridge: Mom two youngest ones and but it wasn't like keep them permanently what nothing like it wasn't like that like that. It's like what my sister's basically tune with my mom right now.

83
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:50.910
rosita stotridge: So the judge got me for neglect said I had to get a bigger house for all the kids there is on and one home did that.

84
00:10:52.830 --> 00:11:04.500
rosita stotridge: Right down I lost. I lost it because I felt like every way. I was turning. I was losing. So I did give up. Darren all this process, but at first I was fun.

85
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:24.330
rosita stotridge: When we first went to court. I was in a Suboxone clinic. I was at eight milligrams a day and I was coming down myself at the time I was only on, I think it was two or four milligram when I went up in front of the judge.

86
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:43.200
rosita stotridge: Had my drug test. Oh effects to her everything she still wasn't okay with it because my sister and my and my dad sister was going against the Suboxone Sam where I have been into treatment for so long that

87
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.040
rosita stotridge: They basically say that abuse it.

88
00:11:48.690 --> 00:12:00.090
rosita stotridge: That I'm just trading one drug for another, they don't agree on methadone or Suboxone they ain't no okay with that treatment at all so judge Simmons had ordered for me to get out of Suboxone treatment.

89
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.640
rosita stotridge: And I had to do a

90
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:15.060
rosita stotridge: Alcohol and drug is set assessment, they're rich of you. So I had done my rich of US thing I had done the bigger house I had about the bigger house.

91
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.910
Richelle Direny: And

92
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:26.160
rosita stotridge: Oh, I had to get a job she ordered. I wasn't working at the time either associated order for me to get a job. I had got me a job.

93
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:34.620
rosita stotridge: But they were still taking taken against me because of where my sister is saying that

94
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.200
My fiance.

95
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.620
Has anger issues.

96
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.380
Richelle Direny: Um, so it seems like I mean your challenges and your challenges is always going to be

97
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.080
Richelle Direny: Your sister you not just regaining some type of

98
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:04.860
Richelle Direny: Costs to me or to develop a relationship with your children, it's always going to be your sister will always be some type of hindrance or block to them.

99
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:06.960
Yeah.

100
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.230
Richelle Direny: But with even. That being said,

101
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:21.030
Richelle Direny: Do you feel like you're not equipped are capable of me, I'm

102
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.250
Richelle Direny: Challenging or fighting your sister and being successful in regaining custody of your children.

103
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.130
Know what I know I could do it.

104
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.180
And I know what good is just

105
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:49.440
rosita stotridge: Being able to fund just funded and myself to know to as I don't have a lawyer. I ain't gonna be able to do the same and

106
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.520
Richelle Direny: And right now, so you would have to get legal aid involved in order to do that.

107
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.630
rosita stotridge: Legal Aid called legal aid if they don't help in custody battles.

108
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:13.080
Richelle Direny: Oh, they don't. But then, okay, what is your worker saying because like at this point. It doesn't seem like it's much of what your sister wants her what she says it's a lot more of your, your arm. It's a lot more of your CPS worker.

109
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:30.240
rosita stotridge: Is the CPS worker. She I try this. Like, I tried to call my CPS worker and she she wouldn't answer the phone, they assigned me a new one. The last time I had went to court and

110
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:41.820
rosita stotridge: Cuz Miranda. The last one I had, I can never get ahold of her never and my sister even verify that in court because my sister had tried to get hold over cuz

111
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.370
rosita stotridge: Where my sister lived in Nashville. It wasn't just the BS that got involved. It was

112
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.250
Something else I can't think of the name.

113
00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:03.960
rosita stotridge: But my sister, trying to get new and and Maria, then they could not get whatever. So they give me a new CPS worker and she basically

114
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.920
rosita stotridge: Told me as I didn't get the restraining

115
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.080
Richelle Direny: If I didn't do the restraining order against

116
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:16.380
rosita stotridge: Doing that I was going against the plan that my sister was one

117
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.250
rosita stotridge: They didn't really give me a choice and much innocence.

118
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:30.540
Richelle Direny: But I thought that your CPS workers who comes up with a plan, how does your sister get to be a part of the creation

119
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.640
rosita stotridge: It was me. My sister in the CPS worker. I'll sit down in one room.

120
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.900
Richelle Direny: Oh, and they came up with the plan of what you're doing. Yes. And you agreed to not have

121
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.130
rosita stotridge: Yeah i said i

122
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.030
Said,

123
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.350
rosita stotridge: I said, I'll do the job. I said at the time.

124
00:15:50.400 --> 00:16:04.800
rosita stotridge: I was only like I said I was going on the store to milligram at the time. So I said they would want me to do that via the trial chart is what Judge Simmons was kind of more going after my sister didn't want me to do the

125
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.150
rosita stotridge: Big Trouble shot at all. She just wanted me to not you know nothing but

126
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:28.440
rosita stotridge: I said know about the rabbit trail shot. I said, I'm only at two or four milligram. I said I'll quit this a box. And I said, I'll do get the job. I'll get the bigger house. I said, but I want to work out where their, their dad is involved. That's it. I've

127
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.360
rosita stotridge: Never done nothing out of the way, not to be around these kids.

128
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.770
Richelle Direny: And so you're torn between

129
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:42.570
Richelle Direny: Your

130
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.580
rosita stotridge: Your really dark. I can't see you.

131
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, hold on a second, hold on.

132
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.740
That's better.

133
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.260
Richelle Direny: So, the sun is setting behind me, I guess.

134
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.680
Richelle Direny: I think that's

135
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:25.110
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, no. I was saying. So you're you're torn between two places because you're fighting to regain custody of your children. And it seems like you're also fighting to maintain the relationship with your fiance.

136
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.010
Richelle Direny: But you have to it mean

137
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:38.220
Richelle Direny: Does you regaining custody of your children from a CPS standpoint, does that I'm

138
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.930
Richelle Direny: Maintaining this relationship with your fiance does that

139
00:17:46.560 --> 00:18:03.390
Richelle Direny: Does that relationship kind of hampers put a hamper or the damper on you regain custody to hold on. Yes, it does. Yes. So you're sold, then it's so then do you think like at this point you're fighting a losing battle.

140
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.880
Sometimes I do

141
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.660
Sometimes it feels that way a lot. Yeah.

142
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.370
Richelle Direny: So what do you want to do, because it's really, it's really

143
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:28.080
Richelle Direny: I mean, it sounds like you can fight and it sounds like the possibilities of you getting your children back. It is a possibility. I'm not necessarily strictly under her terms. But, you know,

144
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.870
Richelle Direny: If I can get a lawyer.

145
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.480
rosita stotridge: Able to get someone on my side and helped me build my page.

146
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.010
rosita stotridge: I didn't I, when I went in.

147
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.870
rosita stotridge: Not knowing nothing. I mean, I didn't know

148
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.800
Richelle Direny: Why do they not want him around his own children.

149
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.430
rosita stotridge: They just, that's just how they don't like him. They just don't want, I mean,

150
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:09.330
Richelle Direny: Not liking a person is not just, I mean he's their father. So, what, what, what is it that the court of law is saying that says that this man can't be around his own children.

151
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.650
rosita stotridge: Where he worries, not on the birth certificate. He has no right to them.

152
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.810
rosita stotridge: You have no right to him whatsoever. Once

153
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:33.960
Richelle Direny: Because by because because legally, you're still married so because you're married. They're saying that he has no rights to him from a legal standpoint biological standpoint, they are his children.

154
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:46.620
Richelle Direny: But there that I'm trying to understand what is there were a court of law is saying that because let's just say he's he's your stepfather. Let's just say

155
00:19:47.310 --> 00:20:00.180
Richelle Direny: Why is it a court of law is in agreement with your sister to say that they side with her that he is seeing that they're signing with her CPS who is doing is, is who

156
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:12.720
Richelle Direny: Are dispatched to do an investigation for them to have you, where you have a care plan that you're working towards. What is it that they're saying we're collectively, they're all saying

157
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:20.670
rosita stotridge: They're, they're saying that he's domestic violence and he used to use a via user

158
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:27.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, he being a user. So, okay, he has a history of domestic violence against

159
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:33.630
rosita stotridge: Julio no no charges, but he has no charges no records of any of this.

160
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.550
Richelle Direny: But remember,

161
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.150
rosita stotridge: By hearsay on what my sister is saying.

162
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.890
Richelle Direny: What remember

163
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.880
Richelle Direny: It's called child protective services, the state is saying that they need to protect the children. The children are their number one concern.

164
00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:08.880
Richelle Direny: For them to pull out an allegation based on what you're saying would be an allegation that he has a history of domestic violence, there has to be some evidence of something to say or in the pet that says that, number one, because I can say

165
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.380
Richelle Direny: That

166
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:22.170
Richelle Direny: You know what Rosita, you're a heroin user. How do you know that you've never tested positive. I've never seen it. I'm never did. There's no evidence of it. Nowhere. Anywhere. Anywhere your history.

167
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:34.620
Richelle Direny: How am I going to being a heroin addict, all because you look like a heroin addict know that no, you can chart. You can put that on a person. You look like a heroin addict. So then therefore juice bar.

168
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:53.340
Richelle Direny: There has to be something that pays for them. You feel because, I mean, I don't think it you know any state is any different when it comes on to children, their first go to is not to remove the children from the home if they're removing the children from the home.

169
00:21:54.090 --> 00:22:04.740
rosita stotridge: Or nothing never come into my home or nothing. Never notified me never come into my home and done a drug test. Nothing. They just took my kid they

170
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:10.710
Richelle Direny: Were you here. Okay, so he is. He has a history of being an addict.

171
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:28.350
Richelle Direny: You have a history right now is it that they're saying that you've abandoned the kids were in in your active addiction, you've left the kids home or you did not provide sufficient whether its food or whatever it is you did not

172
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:35.400
rosita stotridge: Worried about that sufficient food that's where she got me on neglect because my

173
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:59.520
rosita stotridge: half sister Jasmine was telling my sister, which is my step mom would have spoke up in court on all this, it would have helped me so much, but she did in that and my sister toe to toe dead Simmons AMA Bosco father had said that I wouldn't he'll pay with diapers, or formula.

174
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.440
rosita stotridge: Which

175
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:11.940
Richelle Direny: I did there has to be more again for them to remove the children from your home and give your sister or anybody else temporary custody.

176
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:33.150
Richelle Direny: And come up with a care plan. It's that they're there something that they were able to to hold you on so okay there's neglect I come in and as a as a as a worker social worker. I come in and I do my investigation and based on my investigation. It's not that there was not

177
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:44.940
Richelle Direny: An adequate amount of food. There were more than one things. And then I said hey Rosita, these are these are grounds to have your child removed.

178
00:23:45.390 --> 00:24:06.660
rosita stotridge: They never come into my home. Nobody ever come into my home and looked and looked in that. And the only thing that had only thing about said was that I would leave my children. I'd like let's say out of a week they would stay at my dad's four days maybe five days out of the week.

179
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:14.100
rosita stotridge: And then come with me and then they would be with me a week, maybe four or five days. Then go back

180
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:22.920
rosita stotridge: And during this time if they needed diapers, or formula or anything like that. I provided I give it to them.

181
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:44.010
rosita stotridge: But my dad is saying that I didn't, I didn't provide he had to provide for them. So she she got me on neglect because I left the children at my dad's house too long of a time I went on a period of time. And because I didn't provide diapers and formula.

182
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:54.930
Richelle Direny: What exactly is your kid in your care plan. What exactly are you following to be able to work towards reunification.

183
00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:06.510
Richelle Direny: Because right now, you're under supervised visits. So, Ms me to a place for if they're thinking there's something more if they're saying that you have to have supervised visits.

184
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.650
rosita stotridge: I don't know. Nobody, that's just, I have no idea.

185
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.990
Richelle Direny: You know what, what do you mean you don't know what's in your plan in the plan. Only thing.

186
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.580
rosita stotridge: It has stated is

187
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.370
rosita stotridge: I get the job.

188
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.860
I don't go, I don't know. I got my safe with me. I've got my plan. I wish I had it with me.

189
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.400
rosita stotridge: I have to get it. I had to get a job.

190
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.280
Richelle Direny: Do you have a job. No, I think.

191
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:50.340
rosita stotridge: Again, I was working at his home health care, but I just felt like I wasn't getting nowhere felt like I was, you know, when a sinking ship. Oh, I won't want to win the battle. I just give up and started using again.

192
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.470
Richelle Direny: What kind of job you had

193
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.550
rosita stotridge: And it was home health care.

194
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.500
Richelle Direny: What were you doing

195
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:04.020
rosita stotridge: I was going in and sit and and helping taking care of an elderly person.

196
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.820
Richelle Direny: And what happened with that job. Excuse me. What happened with that.

197
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.990
I could get to draw. I could go back and get it today. I just I just quit basically

198
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.440
Richelle Direny: Because you felt like you were in a sinking ship.

199
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:39.570
rosita stotridge: I just let go, wow, cuz that was I got the bigger house. And when all this was happening. I would live in a three bedroom trailer and when they took the kids as I was trying to fight for my kids back I had got the job with the home health care. I had rented a four bedroom house.

200
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.970
rosita stotridge: I had done the rigid view is self assessment.

201
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.050
rosita stotridge: And I quit my Suboxone

202
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.440
rosita stotridge: We had went back to court.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:07.260
rosita stotridge: judge him and said that the kids was doing so good at my sister's because my oldest she did. She went up in her grades and stuff like that in school right in

204
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:17.310
rosita stotridge: judge him and said, where the kids was doing so good at my sisters that they wanted to continue the plan of them being at my sisters

205
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:35.760
rosita stotridge: And for my sister. It was all my sisters just up to my sister's discretion on how she let me see the kids as I had my law, your step up and ask for for more visitation four hours out of a month isn't enough. It just isn't

206
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:47.280
rosita stotridge: As I said video call the kids and my sister said, where she you know has a busy schedule. It's very hard. When I don't call it was that

207
00:27:47.700 --> 00:28:04.020
rosita stotridge: At certain times if they was doing this or doing that. So as. Could it be on a certain day, me and my sister, make a plan on a certain day a certain time or a video called and my sister kicked against that my sister didn't want to agree on that, because she said it made the kids.

208
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.630
rosita stotridge: Upset wanted it is very hard to get them calm down.

209
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:21.780
rosita stotridge: One of them neglect things to the kids and the kids want an update on our show. Monica about them that they did on their show

210
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.410
That was another thing only neglect to this.

211
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.150
Show.

212
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:43.050
Richelle Direny: Well, they weren't updated on their, their vaccines. Yeah. And so they got you for not doing that. Yeah, that wasn't part of the neglect. Yeah. So how long has this been going on. How long has your sister had custody of

213
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.170
rosita stotridge: A year and three months.

214
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:58.200
Richelle Direny: And in, in the year in three months as she's had them what at what point did you relapse meaning like you, you said like what you said you gave up.

215
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:12.120
rosita stotridge: That last time we went to court, last time we went to court. They said that they was given food jurisdiction of capacity to my sister and I would have to work on my care plan to

216
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.470
Regain custody, they grant and my sister full custody.

217
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.930
And when they done that.

218
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.580
I just

219
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.460
I just lost it.

220
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:38.100
Richelle Direny: And this is after you relapse strike that be granted her full custody. They yesterday during the her full custody at relaxed I quit my job. I started using

221
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.710
rosita stotridge: I'll often often house. I got it.

222
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.950
I just acquit I just quit.

223
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.680
And

224
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:57.210
rosita stotridge: What made me wake up and realize a condo very when I lost my place when I lost the house and I saw Kaylee. My oldest

225
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.980
rosita stotridge: She's not happy. Like I said, my sister, she

226
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:13.020
rosita stotridge: She goes, and she leaves on she told the judge that my mom's house was livable for my oldest that it wasn't suitable for

227
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:23.760
rosita stotridge: There's nothing changed about my mom's house since the time that all is up until now, and my sister lives in a week to two weeks at a time and my mom.

228
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.130
And

229
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:42.900
rosita stotridge: I can start seeing the the hurt the resentment with my oldest and then I know I have to pull out of this. I have to get her. I have to, I have to get my children back. I've got to have them home.

230
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.890
Richelle Direny: But the question is, you just said earlier.

231
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.900
Richelle Direny: That in order for you to regain custody of them.

232
00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:04.140
Richelle Direny: It seems like for some of it is contingent upon the relationship with your fiance and right now it seems to be weighing in the balance.

233
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:12.600
Richelle Direny: That it's always going to be that cloud like you're saying you have to get them back. You want to get them back if it

234
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:23.940
rosita stotridge: Comes down to it, I would, I would have to get not on my own place and start on my own and get the kids and then start the battle on here.

235
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:43.950
rosita stotridge: But right now, the most important is for me to do my own battle on getting the kids. I think that would be the best thing to do on regaining custody of them once I get them back then start trying to work with the court somehow to get him involved.

236
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:54.870
Richelle Direny: But if you truly believe that you have to own it, you have to start by owning that you have to believe like this is really what it's like saying that I want to make this change. What are you willing to

237
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.440
Do

238
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.290
In order to get

239
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.360
Richelle Direny: Your phone ringing

240
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:16.410
Richelle Direny: Yeah, sorry about that either. Yeah. Um, it's you. It's looking at what is it that you're willing to do to be able to get the kids back and why I mean that's a decision you have to make. I'm not trying to

241
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:28.620
Richelle Direny: Let you know, hey, maybe you need to end the relationship. By no means. And that's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying. Review your care plan. What is the hinderance what's what is weighing in the bouncer saying that

242
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.470
Richelle Direny: It seems like you're on. You're on a ship by yourself with him and everything you want is on this other ship.

243
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.390
Richelle Direny: And

244
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:49.350
Richelle Direny: There is no in between. It's either is one one or the other. And what's on this ship. You're saying

245
00:32:50.550 --> 00:33:02.760
Richelle Direny: It sounds. It sounds to me like what's in between. It is your is the court system and the court system is saying this is what you need to do. This is the plan, you need to work in order to get it back. But the only way you can do that.

246
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.970
Richelle Direny: Is you have to make some hard decisions.

247
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:23.580
rosita stotridge: They wouldn't they no way around like where they know kind of domestic violence charges and any kind of way, they no way that we could go in together and thought to try. I would have to do it separately on what

248
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.010
Richelle Direny: We

249
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:28.260
Think

250
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.250
Richelle Direny: The same

251
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.920
rosita stotridge: Every road that every person I talked to and every Rose did I keep turn into to draw. That's the same outcome I get

252
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.200
I got to do it alone.

253
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:50.550
Richelle Direny: Because if what because it regardless of you're trying to fight.

254
00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:56.010
Richelle Direny: You're trying to fight a battle that you know going in, you're going to lose.

255
00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:02.760
Richelle Direny: It's like, you know, you're going to lose it. But yet, you're trying, you're getting frustrated. You're getting overwhelmed.

256
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:15.870
Richelle Direny: You're feeling hopeless. You feel like you're losing the battle, but then everybody on the outside is looking at you like, I mean, why did you even go, you're gonna lose the battle. And in this case, you're trying to

257
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:20.430
Richelle Direny: Maintain a living relationship.

258
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.040
Richelle Direny: With someone

259
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.840
Richelle Direny: Where the courts to saying that can happen.

260
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:39.180
Richelle Direny: If you're seeing that part of your care plan is that you need to get a job, you need to get your own place. You need to show stability for X amount of time.

261
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:51.270
Richelle Direny: Um, and that this individual that's in the picture is part of the reason why I don't know if that's what the course is saying you have to make a very hard decision.

262
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.450
Richelle Direny: We're saying regaining trust. Hmm, that's

263
00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.040
rosita stotridge: That's exactly what they said.

264
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:09.420
Richelle Direny: If you're saying regaining custody of your children is is is a life for you right now. It's all that's weighing on your mind. And that's what you want.

265
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:17.160
Richelle Direny: Because remember, they have not taken away your paternal rights they have not I'm revolts your rights as a parent.

266
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:26.940
Richelle Direny: They have not said that your children are going off for custody. I do know that every now and again they keep they keep reviewing the plan.

267
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:39.420
Richelle Direny: they renew it they add something they take away, whatever it is. But after a while they say if you have until this time. And if you don't do this, then they're taking your rights away. You have to decide.

268
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:49.710
Richelle Direny: It's been a year and a half, as your sister file a petition to gain custody of your children and for your rights to be revolt.

269
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.930
Richelle Direny: She has. Yeah. And what what happened.

270
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:02.280
rosita stotridge: They, the last time the last court date that we had when on all this, they give her full custody.

271
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.390
Richelle Direny: No, no, she still has she doesn't have

272
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.290
Richelle Direny: full custody means that you've lost your parents or rights.

273
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.780
rosita stotridge: That is the last thing that

274
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.100
rosita stotridge: That was blessing that got told I haven't got

275
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:24.750
Richelle Direny: It was your was your rights revolt. Like, are you still meeting with a CPS worker or

276
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.040
Richelle Direny: So CPS is completely out of your life right now. Yeah.

277
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.190
Richelle Direny: When did this happen.

278
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.920
rosita stotridge: Back in

279
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.230
Richelle Direny: December of 2019 2020

280
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:41.850
rosita stotridge: Or

281
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:43.470
rosita stotridge: Sorry.

282
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:54.450
Richelle Direny: Um, so, in December of 2019 you're saying that you're no longer working or care plan. No.

283
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:04.860
Richelle Direny: So it sounds then based on what you're saying. It sounds like you've that you've written your you you've lost rights based on

284
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah, your parental rights are revoked.

285
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.750
rosita stotridge: Yeah, completely. I just get visitations with him.

286
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:21.360
Richelle Direny: So then that has nothing to do with um if you get visitations with them. It means that your sister is allowing you to see them. Yes.

287
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.170
Richelle Direny: Has nothing words know that this

288
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.360
rosita stotridge: The court, the courts, get my sister full discretion to do

289
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.490
Richelle Direny: So technically, your sister has adopted all of your children so so legally

290
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.390
Yeah, there

291
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:46.410
rosita stotridge: She has an adopted them yet. They said that I can eat. They said, I still have enough time to go do a petition against her to get them back.

292
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.320
Richelle Direny: So okay, so your rights were revolt. Now they're up for adoption.

293
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.940
Richelle Direny: And

294
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.860
rosita stotridge: Apparently,

295
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.380
Richelle Direny: So the, so you have to know where

296
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:08.700
Richelle Direny: You have to know what exactly you're fighting for, because if your rights were fully revoked. If your rights in his rights were fully revoked.

297
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.560
Richelle Direny: And they are up because once your rights are revolt. Now they're up for adoption.

298
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:21.030
Richelle Direny: And if they're up for adoption, your sister has full custody of them right now. They're up for adoption.

299
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:30.270
Richelle Direny: If she's working on gaining and doing the paperwork and doing everything that's necessary for her to get adoption to get them to adopt them.

300
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:37.950
Richelle Direny: And if they're saying like the limbo in between that is that they're giving you the opportunity to petition to regain

301
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:48.240
Richelle Direny: Get your rights back, but this is the thing. My understanding of your rights being revoked. You must assign some people are saying that you're you're you're giving up your rights. Yeah.

302
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.430
Richelle Direny: No paperwork.

303
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:59.370
Richelle Direny: You sure that you never signed anything. Mm hmm. So then you need to speak with I'm

304
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.800
Richelle Direny: Like you said, a lawyer or you need to speak to somebody or you need to see the paperwork.

305
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.890
Richelle Direny: To know exactly what the paperwork sense

306
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:14.340
rosita stotridge: I should be able to call tell services setting up and then directly to

307
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.790
rosita stotridge: Someone it's over this case.

308
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.230
Richelle Direny: Yeah, or your or your, your work or the worker that you had

309
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:23.820
Richelle Direny: Well,

310
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:33.210
rosita stotridge: The one I had she she wasn't worth nothing I could never get a hold of this woman. I mean, never so her and her name was Miranda

311
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.550
rosita stotridge: So I'll do out

312
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:47.430
Richelle Direny: Because it sounds like even though they're up for adoption. It sounds like your sister is still allowing you to be active part of their lights. Their, their life.

313
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:55.410
YEAH, AND I STILL GET MY visitations, I felt like it was no visitations with them.

314
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.020
Richelle Direny: And how do you visit with them.

315
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.400
rosita stotridge: at home moms.

316
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.980
Richelle Direny: And how often do you do that.

317
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.600
Richelle Direny: Um, basically, whenever, whenever my mom has them.

318
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:14.970
rosita stotridge: On, make sure to go over at least you know what the Court says, but when my mom's going on in my

319
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:16.590
Yeah.

320
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:23.400
rosita stotridge: Led to save my mom had on all week. I would go there probably two or three times a week.

321
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:31.260
rosita stotridge: And I can stay on that with someone. Yeah. I stayed on that was on that my mom.

322
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:46.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you need to speak with I would definitely recommend that you wouldn't need to speak with the caseworker or someone over the case, just to kind of see what you're saying is trying to regain

323
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.840
Richelle Direny: Custody of them.

324
00:40:50.460 --> 00:41:01.680
Richelle Direny: Understand, exactly, because this is what it sounds like. It sounds like almost like you're setting yourself up somewhat for failure or a battle that you're not going to win because you're you're you're

325
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:12.450
Richelle Direny: You showed up to a fight about you showed up to a battle and the gate was already closed all that they need to be in the battle is it is there, and the gate is already closed.

326
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.660
rosita stotridge: I'll call them first thing in the morning.

327
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:24.000
Richelle Direny: So you need to know what you're up against you in order to make an effective plan. You need to know exactly what you're up against you need to know the exact details.

328
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:31.830
Richelle Direny: You need to know what your stance is you need to know what it is that they have against you, why you're not able to regain custody. You need to know all of that.

329
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:51.450
Richelle Direny: Because I mean, if you're saying, hey, you know, shall I need, I need you to help me to get through this process understand this process, but then you don't really have you're not sharing necessarily the full details of it because the plans is in the details. It's understanding the details.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:07.080
