00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.500
SUMMER: You know, up, down, up, down, but more down. Recently, I have just as of the new year.

39
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.630
SUMMER: Literally, it was like three, four days after

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.350
SUMMER: New Year's Day. I started getting letters in the mail and you know I'm on a lot of medications. Not like

41
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:42.780
SUMMER: You know, five or six like a lot and I started getting letters and from pterosaurs one after another after another after another, stating that they weren't going to be covering my medication, you know, whichever letter that had whatever medication name on it.

42
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.550
SUMMER: They were basically pulling it from their

43
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.020
SUMMER: formulary list.

44
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.550
Magalie Marcellus: So, as in

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.590
SUMMER: You're either going to self pay

46
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.960
SUMMER: Or you're just not going to have it. Period.

47
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.890
SUMMER: And

48
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.700

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.240

Magalie Marcellus: They wanted you know what the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.860
SUMMER: Just for two weeks supply, you know, that was with a good Rx discount discount and everything.

54
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.800
SUMMER: So it's just been insane, you know, and I just have been very withdrawn.

55
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.510
SUMMER: I kind of joked other night saying like when my music choice starts

56
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.600
SUMMER: To get really sad that usually mimics my

57
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.140
Magalie Marcellus: Mood

58
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.280

60
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.490
Magalie Marcellus: And

61
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.660
SUMMER: Grew up in

62
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.120
SUMMER: It was just funny but like it wasn't

63
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.730
SUMMER: You know, because it was very real, but

64
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.160
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, I mean, I've just been like stuff.

65
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.500
SUMMER: I mean, I feel really bad. My son, I'm usually really good at least taking care of him.

66
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.320
Magalie Marcellus: With all his needs. I just don't take care of

67
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.490
SUMMER: Myself, the way I should be but like he's always priority and like he's okay he's fine and everything, but

68
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:08.760
SUMMER: Like just you know I'm used to giving him like two beds, a day and like I'm lucky if I get every other day right now just picking them up. I mean, he's getting heavier. He's getting bigger.

69
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.780
Magalie Marcellus: And then, and

70
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.500
SUMMER: With all of this stuff going on. I just I can't

71
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.360
SUMMER: You know, really function.

72
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.150
SUMMER: So it's been, you know, the hospitals and notes, you know, all of that. This is getting exhausting. I'm

73
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.340
Magalie Marcellus: I'm just at the point with

74
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:36.270
SUMMER: All the doctor stuff. Oh, and that's another thing I get letters from my insurance company that matches the medications you know that they're not covering

75
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.520
SUMMER: But I just got one yesterday that my OB is no longer quote contracted

76
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.450
Magalie Marcellus: With care source and

77
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.380
SUMMER: Which is really weird because she's part of the public.

78
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.330
Magalie Marcellus: Hospital. I go to

79
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.950
SUMMER: And that's really strange because she is part of a hospital that it takes Medicaid and things

80
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.850
Magalie Marcellus: So,

81
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.370
SUMMER: They're either starting to get really, really, really weird and picky about stuff or

82
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.020
SUMMER: Just a, you know, I don't know coincidence. I don't know.

83
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.570
SUMMER: But it's scary.

84
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.860
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, that sounds like a lot has gone on, especially when it comes to insurance and stuff. And you do need

85
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.870
Magalie Marcellus: Medication yeah so so were you able to get the medication you needed to be able to function.

86
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.650
SUMMER: Oh,

87
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.030
Magalie Marcellus: Are you still working on that.

88
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.650
SUMMER: Ya know, we, we got

89
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:39.360
SUMMER: We got the sub you tax worked out yesterday. So you got that yesterday, we got my anti medics, we got that all taken care of. So like my anti nausea meds.

90
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:56.970
SUMMER: But everything else. If I don't either have it stockpiles already like there's, um, it's not an anti diarrheal but it's it's for Crohn's disease I stockpiled it like I wasn't really using it that much because it actually kind of

91
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:11.070
SUMMER: Solidified things more and it became more painful for me so I stopped taking the med and I just refilled it because I'm like you never know. Like if at any point my disease can do the flip side of everything.

92
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.750
Magalie Marcellus: And start to be the opposite and

93
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.240
SUMMER: Maybe that medication will work. Same thing with it put me back on lol

94
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:34.470
SUMMER: For receiving help some of my pain and that actually never worked for me in the past as far as for sleeping and for pain control and it's been helping me sleep. So that's, you know what, that's why I stockpile things because you never know your body changes.

95
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.420
Magalie Marcellus: And what a maybe never works. And you

96
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.050
Magalie Marcellus: Know, yeah.

97
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.060
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, so

98
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.090
Magalie Marcellus: It's, it's just been exhausting. And unfortunately, you know, here at my house.

99
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:55.950
SUMMER: You know, I don't have help or support that like you know it's it's not on my I'm not expecting like my mother to, like, you know, do everything or do

100
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.560
SUMMER: Not trying to throw that on her, but I do have a hard time with, you know, kind of like

101
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:18.000
SUMMER: I don't know. I guess I could put it this way. If my son was my age, and he came to me is, and with all the stuff that I have going on and he had in his cancer any of this, I would do everything in my power, no matter what his ages to help if I was able to do so.

102
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.070
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, but do you feel that she's able. She's my she's chosen to do so.

103
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:29.580
SUMMER: She doesn't want to. Yeah, I think it's good Toby stop. You're gonna knock the entire thing over stop.

104
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.910
SUMMER: Stop Cove, don't do that.

105
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:46.530
SUMMER: Um, yeah, no, it's more of a like my brother nights off about it. It's more of a she grew up really poor. So all of her you know siblings are all very, like, this is mine, mine, mine, you know,

106
00:08:47.940 --> 00:09:00.240
SUMMER: Just very greedy and very cheap. So, you know, I mean, I get it. Like, it's, it's what she has to survive off, you know, her, her rest of her life. Like, I get that. But

107
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.290
Magalie Marcellus: You know, it's just

108
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:12.000
SUMMER: Even just on the emotional side like my brother he struggles with, you know, he's struggling with a lot of suicidal thoughts and I didn't know this until I moved home.

109
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:22.440
SUMMER: And I'll hear him. I mean him. We'll talk about it, like, but she says the opposite of everything that you want your mother to say to you when you're struggling and

110
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.810
Magalie Marcellus: Support. He wants to leave and

111
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.880
SUMMER: Walk away and she wants all of us out you're pushing us like you're literally saying like

112
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.630
SUMMER: Are

113
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:39.600
SUMMER: We're too much for you. And that's not something when you're suffering as a child that you know someone's that you want to hear.

114
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.380
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

115
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:56.700
SUMMER: The emotional side of me like I even picking up toys and my son or something like it's become this cluttered insane mess down here that I can't tend to, and yes, even simple things like that. Like if I'm sleeping during the day. There's something wrong with me.

116
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.020
SUMMER: Like everyone knows that.

117
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.660
SUMMER: And I've been sleeping during the day and

118
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.440
Magalie Marcellus: It's

119
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:07.800
SUMMER: You know, there's just a lack of, of, I guess, consideration and respect around here and then the lack of caring

120
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.670
Magalie Marcellus: So what is she saying, so you're not saying to you that makes you feel that

121
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.680
SUMMER: points out that this is a burden on her.

122
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.790
SUMMER: You know, like my health is a burden on her.

123
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.730
SUMMER: What she has helped with

124
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:37.830
SUMMER: In the past, you know, medications or whatever that I haven't paid her back yet for which she has the means to do so to pay. It's not like you know

125
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.820
SUMMER: She didn't have it's it's not all like that.

126
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:49.350
SUMMER: And, you know, the constant, constant nagging of like she doesn't want us here.

127
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.360
SUMMER: She doesn't even want to come home. She doesn't want to live here. She doesn't want to see us.

128
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.530
Magalie Marcellus: And

129
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.860
SUMMER: You know, here's the thing. My son and I, we were in the basement all day.

130
00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.940
Magalie Marcellus: We don't

131
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:08.910
SUMMER: We don't really interact with them that much except her if I go upstairs. I'll bring my son once in a while with me up the stairs and he can go say hi to them.

132
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.240
SUMMER: And that's about it like as far as the interaction, because it's very

133
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.810
Minimal

134
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.660
SUMMER: You know, it's not it's not really just my side. I mean, even when I do talk to her.

135
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:28.620
SUMMER: She's just not as she's already. I'm like somebody else I she's holding up a piece of paper and I'm talking about, you know, like something really important and she's

136
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:35.430
SUMMER: You could tell she's not even listening and she's like oh so tomorrow. I have to do this, this and this and you're like, you're not hearing me right now. I'm talking about

137
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:41.100
SUMMER: Something very serious and your brain is already on something else like you're not listening to me.

138
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:52.200
SUMMER: And I do think you know how much of it is a brain injury and how much is, you know, I don't know. That's what my brother and I don't know you know cuz she was. She has a very traumatic brain injury from

139
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.000
SUMMER: When she was hit you know how to run by cement truck. So, you know,

140
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.000
Magalie Marcellus: Growing up, we were it's more than likely that she

141
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.350
Magalie Marcellus: It could be something new.

142
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:07.080
Magalie Marcellus: Identical. Yes, she can doesn't recognize that this is what's happening.

143
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.370
SUMMER: Right, right.

144
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.720
SUMMER: So I try to take that into

145
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.190
SUMMER: Consideration instead of like

146
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.790
SUMMER: Letting it

147
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:21.600
SUMMER: Completely get to me you know I'm always trying to stay mindful of, you know, maybe I have to take that into a lot of consideration because yeah i mean

148
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:30.900
SUMMER: More often than not, from what I see just memory alone. She's no memory i mean it's it's to the point where my brother and I have been talking a lot about

149
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:41.580
SUMMER: Taking the steps in trying to get ahead before it really falls apart. But, you know, she's not gonna be able to keep up, you know, on her own for

150
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:48.390
SUMMER: To lunch, or I mean she really shouldn't be driving. To be honest, I mean I every time I have to get in the car with her.

151
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:59.430
SUMMER: As part of the reason I don't leave either. It's not just that I don't feel good. It's that I am terrified to get into that car. It's the scariest thing to me. Um, if you need you need

152
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.410
Magalie Marcellus: Not busy. Okay.

153
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:12.180
SUMMER: Um, yeah. So I mean it's, you know, I had a friend, all the other thing that's been weighing me too, is I had a friend that was helping me

154
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:26.700
SUMMER: With, like, you know, some of these for my, my son, and he out of nowhere because quick background. I'll give you up him real quick. My husband and I, we had met him through a mutual friend.

155
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:45.840
SUMMER: And he had been a very good friend to us for a couple of years before my husband passed away. And the thing is, is this, this guy's like obsessive with me. He's got some kind of weird obsession and my husband and I used to talk about it. Like, is this like something innocent.

156
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.280
SUMMER: And he's just kind of

157
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.940
SUMMER: You know out there and slow or is it something that we should be, you know, afraid of and worried about

158
00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:10.590
SUMMER: And we both kind of came to the conclusion that yeah he's just maybe a little slow. Like, that's all soon as my husband that he literally didn't want at. It was like the best day of his life, so to speak, like oh summers a freebie. Now, like he confessed his dire love for me. Like all this

159
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.810
SUMMER: Kind of like really heavy stuff.

160
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.070
SUMMER: So I

161
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.300
SUMMER: kind of caught him out of my life because I said this happened like two months after my husband died.

162
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.740
Magalie Marcellus: And I don't think that that

163
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.450
SUMMER: Was at all, respectful.

164
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.560
Magalie Marcellus: I don't think that

165
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.290
SUMMER: That's crossing some serious boundaries.

166
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:33.360
SUMMER: Then, and I found it incredibly scary, too, because I'm like you've had these feelings for this many years like this crazy of feelings.

167
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:42.030
SUMMER: And now you just want to like jump in and take you no charge. And I don't feel that way about you. I'm not attracted to you. I'm not

168
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.760
SUMMER: At all in any way, shape, or form wanting to ever be with you, like so.

169
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.510
Magalie Marcellus: He

170
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.620
SUMMER: I guess went down a really bad downward spiral when I cut them out of my life from what

171
00:14:52.680 --> 00:15:01.470
SUMMER: People have told me he got a DUI, sir, drinking heavily. I know he's got an issue with drinking, but I got back in touch with him.

172
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.420
SUMMER: But my really go about two weeks before my son was born.

173
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.530
Magalie Marcellus: And

174
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:16.680
SUMMER: He had told me that my husband came to him like a month before he died and said, if something ever happens to me. Will you take care of summer.

175
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:17.940
Now,

176
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:38.460
SUMMER: I call bullshit on that because I highly doubt that my husband would have gone to him, of all people, um, at first I really question like, is this true, could it be I it's always kind of been like up or down for me like part of me wants to believe it.

177
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.980
SUMMER: But 75 80%

178
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.760
SUMMER: Of me is like,

179
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.020
SUMMER: No, that's just, I

180
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:51.180
SUMMER: That wouldn't be my husband and do that like this was a very rushed suicide attempt. And you know it worked. But it wasn't something he was planning.

181
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:51.570
SUMMER: Out.

182
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.130

185
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:18.450
SUMMER: Out with that. Well, his obsessive side has come out a lot the past month. And so much to where he's like demanding my heart. He says, like he's

186
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.910
SUMMER: Literally it's emotional abuse in a way

187
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.360

190
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:35.490
SUMMER: From a lot of mental health issues and I'm dealing with and I don't want to be with anyone like I just don't

191
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:45.930
SUMMER: I said, I'm not ruling out in my life that I won't ever be with someone, again, but I'm just saying right here in the now. I don't want to be with anyone like i don't i don't want to

192
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:54.150
SUMMER: Be romantic. I don't want to be intimate, like, let alone, like it was, I don't even feel like being intimate like all these different things and he is

193
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.460
SUMMER: So creeper.

194
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.610
SUMMER: Stalker ish I he's on a stalker level now.

195
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.840
SUMMER: He will sit in front of my old house, my neighbors will tell me when I after my husband died.

196
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:14.760
SUMMER: And he would sit there and cry and his car. Like he would follow me around like he does really weird stuff and my brother, he, he really wants me to cut him out of it. You know my life completely.

197
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.760
Magalie Marcellus: Because so like I know you say he's been helpful financially so

198
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.240
SUMMER: Yes.

199
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.510
Magalie Marcellus: It says that was the reason that you're keeping them. All right.

200
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:31.740
SUMMER: Well, I've always had a, like a piece of my heart that feels bad for him because he's a

201
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.430
Magalie Marcellus: Good guy.

202
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:44.400
SUMMER: I care for him as a friend. I understand him. I guess on some levels that I don't think he has he has support with like he has very dark emotions and dark feelings and thoughts.

203
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:53.970
SUMMER: And I've always understood him about that. So I've helped him through a lot of stuff, you know, throughout the years, but that was from a friend level never anything and he's

204
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.520
SUMMER: He's literally giving me an ultimatum like you either give me your heart or I'm not helping you anymore.

205
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:10.620
SUMMER: And he's not understanding. I'm like, How can you do that, number one, like if you want to be this father figure to my son. Do you think it's right to just cut me out knowing that

206
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:19.110
SUMMER: I don't have anything coming in, but to cut that out of someone's mouth like the food, you know, in his mouth without knowing I don't have another

207
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.140
SUMMER: You know, back up at least give me some time to figure something else out. But he's been very selfish with like

208
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:33.960
SUMMER: No, you're either giving it like his exact words like very demanding like you're giving me your heart. Now, or I'm not helping period and

209
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:43.170
SUMMER: Literally, there's been a week conversation of this and like it's just circles. I tried telling him and explaining him. This is why I feel the way I feel

210
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:52.830
SUMMER: And it just goes back to him. He, he's drunk. He's been drunk 24 hours. The best I'm like I don't even know how many days is gonna work for like two and a half weeks recently.

211
00:18:53.610 --> 00:19:08.220
SUMMER: So I don't know, it's, it's, it's not just the financial end. Like I said, I mean that's a huge part of it, but it's not like I don't not care. I'm not not not using him.

212
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.870
SUMMER: I care for him. He's been a friend, like I said, For of mine and my husband for years.

213
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:28.650
SUMMER: But like my brother and I have been talking when in, where do I cross the line though and and put my foot and say you can't be rolling my life that way because you you know you want my, my heart and

214
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:43.140
SUMMER: You think that just because I'm going to give you my heart that you're gonna that's going to solve all your problems know even if I was interested I have pointed out to him. That's not going to fix your problems you may think it is and it would, but it would not

215
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.240
SUMMER: You would go through a honeymoon phase.

216
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.590
Magalie Marcellus: So just me.

217
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.380
SUMMER: Psychologically, and then when that wears

218
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:49.950
Magalie Marcellus: Out.

219
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:55.590
SUMMER: You're going to go straight back to your drinking and everything else, like it's you. He doesn't want to help himself.

220
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.800
SUMMER: So I've always been that the friend that wants to see him do well in life and

221
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:11.400
Magalie Marcellus: But if he's asking you for something specific. And you can't give them that, then you have to figure out, you know, where does that relationship spent

222
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.020
Magalie Marcellus: YEAH. ME FEEL ME IN THE Mandan and you feel uncomfortable about it. They may have to

223
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:24.510
Magalie Marcellus: Make a choice. Either to stop the relationship or what is something you want to really work on in

224
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.340
Magalie Marcellus: Life.

225
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:34.470
SUMMER: Yeah, and that's what I told him the other day I said I'm you know if this is too much stress, like he can't see the stress of me being as sick I am

226
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.330
SUMMER: Just the health side alone, he has

227
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.470
SUMMER: Expressed that the health stuff alone is very stressful for him.

228
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.060
SUMMER: Just knowing that

229
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.260
SUMMER: Everything is very, you know, up in the air with what can happen at any

230
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.580
Magalie Marcellus: Point, any time.

231
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.660
SUMMER: He has said it's too much for him. And I said, well, maybe then

232
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.460
Magalie Marcellus: If it's too much for

233
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.290
SUMMER: You then I need to remove that from your life you know like if you can't handle

234
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.360
SUMMER: Because I've had a lot of friends over the years.

235
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.500
SUMMER: They couldn't handle having a friend in the hospital, all the time. Like it just was too much for them.

236
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.480
SUMMER: So we've released a lot of friends over the years because of that. So I told him already

237
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:26.160
SUMMER: Oh yeah, that's another thing when he's calling my son, his son. He like very weird things that are kind of worrisome to me of, you know, do I keep him close because I'm kind of afraid of him to that's also another part

238
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.840
Magalie Marcellus: You know, because he's a

239
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.710
SUMMER: Really, really, really off like the deep end.

240
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.400
Magalie Marcellus: We are able to separate

241
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.590
Magalie Marcellus: Our descent yourself from him in path. So why would he be different this time.

242
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:52.890
SUMMER: Well, in the past, it was easy because a I wasn't here. I was in Detroit for a good half a year. And then when I came back. I was on the left side. He had no idea where I was.

243
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.180
SUMMER: Now I'm

244
00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:07.410
SUMMER: I'm stagnant where I'm at. I don't leave I'm literally three blocks away from him. Um, he knows I don't have a car i'm not i other people's houses. I'm not anywhere that I can quote hide out. You know what I mean. So it was

245
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.670
SUMMER: Easy in the past because

246
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:15.780
SUMMER: I, I was out and about. I was with, you know, different people. I was at different places and you know now he knows that.

247
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.340
Magalie Marcellus: I'm three bonds wrong.

248
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:28.620
SUMMER: And he knows that I, you know, unless I lied to him and said, I have to go move to somewhere else, because I'm not allowed to live here anymore. That's all I think I could but he's

249
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:28.980
Magalie Marcellus: Like

250
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:37.710
SUMMER: He's tied to the plan in level where like if I said that he would probably sit outside and wait to see if there's a sign of me still here, you know,

251
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.810
Magalie Marcellus: With so problem. She does. Yeah.

252
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.010
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah yeah

253
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.360
SUMMER: I know

254
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:56.700
Magalie Marcellus: Regardless, you will have to make a decision whether you want to keep them in your life or not. And if you don't, then he is making things harder or do anything inappropriate things and you have to take another step.

255
00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:03.360
SUMMER: Yeah, and that's kind of where my mentality has been in the past like you know week straight. It's been there for a while but

256
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.420
SUMMER: You know the tipping point really came this past week of it was like a light switch you want you know you went from

257
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:21.090
SUMMER: Very normal. You know, so to speak, but like a light switch just went off and he went to super insane mode of obsessing about this relationship thing.

258
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:35.280
SUMMER: And that's when I kind of said to myself, well, you need to tell him that if it's too much, then maybe like. He's admitting it's too much and I'm trying to use it as a you know a tool to say, then maybe we should

259
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.480
SUMMER: Back away, but he and

260
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:50.730
SUMMER: His head can't in his exact words he can't accept me not being in his life. Like he puts guilt on me that he'll either kill himself or that he can't live without me. So he plays that card a lot with me.

261
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.120
SUMMER: And then

262
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:59.880
SUMMER: Oceans right and that alone. That's that hits you know hits at home for me. That's my husband died. You know, like, now you're using that

263
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:16.740
SUMMER: In a way that is really, really hurtful to me because I feel like I need to save people. And I need to keep you around. Because if you're admitting to me that you know without me there. And I saw you go through a downward spiral and I did cut you out. I am afraid.

264
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.190
SUMMER: And my brother is trying to tell me like you can't control.

265
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.380
Magalie Marcellus: Me, you can't save everybody

266
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:30.360
SUMMER: Right. He's like you, if he wants to kill himself. He does what he's saying is, because you're not in his life. That's not true. Like,

267
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:37.380
Magalie Marcellus: You can't. It's a choices, making. But the thing is, then you have to expand. So I'm okay. You'll notice and those behavior.

268
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:45.420
Magalie Marcellus: That's not appropriate. And if he needs to be really be that support if he needs to get help from right well

269
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:53.970
Magalie Marcellus: Right, because it's obviously something is not connected. And this is why he's making those threats. Yeah. So for you to feel guilty, then you have to keep them around.

270
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.750
SUMMER: Right.

271
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.000
Magalie Marcellus: That's not the way relationship supposed to work.

272
00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.650
SUMMER: Yeah, no, no.

322
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.370
SUMMER: Like

323
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:29.190
SUMMER: I mean,

324
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:42.900
SUMMER: Say like a week goes by. If I don't talk to him for a week. Um, he assumes like I'm either in the hospital, which I'll either tell him. Yes, just so I don't have to hear like you know

325
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.580
SUMMER: This, I don't have to explain to him for any other reason why they want to talk to him, but

326
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:48.990
SUMMER: I shouldn't have to. I've told

327
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:56.760
SUMMER: Him before to me. I'm not your girl, and I'm not your wife I if I don't want to talk to someone for a day, I have the right to do that.

328
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:03.420

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.480
SUMMER: It goes back to me.

334
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:23.670
SUMMER: Feeling like I'm afraid that he's gonna go over the deeper you know over the edge if and

335
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.370
Magalie Marcellus: Any manage the last time to

336
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.030
Still

337
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.460
Magalie Marcellus: Keep himself someone

338
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:30.630
Magalie Marcellus: To get well so

339
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:43.920
SUMMER: Here's the thing. I think that emotionally. If you were, if I were to do that again and just caught him out that way that last time, from what I've heard. Um, I was

340
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:52.680
SUMMER: Really surprised that he had family involved when I caught him out. Like I would get really nasty messages from his dad and his mom.

341
00:30:53.970 --> 00:31:07.260
SUMMER: And other family members and he you gotta do I, you know, because he was drinking heavily and his family was messaging me saying, How could you do this to my, you know, my son, and

342
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:22.440
SUMMER: He, he's falling apart. Over here, all because of you. And you know all that. So I'm naturally I'm extremely I'm going to impact to the stereos I've ever had. I feel pain for others. So I feel bad for him.

343
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.490
SUMMER: And I feel like if

344
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:31.680
SUMMER: If it makes him happy just to talk to me. Then what you know where's the Harmon net, but this is where I'm seeing it's not healthy because

345
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.030
Magalie Marcellus: Like is those awesome because it's affecting you. Right. Oh.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:42.390
SUMMER: Right. Is it if I wake up and I'm like, Oh, great. There's 30 messages from him.

347
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.950
SUMMER: And I just got up in the morning.

348
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.630
SUMMER: And it's all about my heart. Why would you give it to me. It is every morning the

349
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.220
Magalie Marcellus: Best quality problem.

350
00:31:50.340 --> 00:32:07.800
SUMMER: That's an issue and is another thing I don't want my son. I'm not judging anyone for any kind of, I mean, why would I judge anyone if they were using anything. I wouldn't my issue is, though, is that I am trying to put my son in the best environment. I can

351
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:19.410
SUMMER: And I won't put my son around someone that's drinking heavily, and I never will. So even that alone. I'm like, I'm not judging you for drinking. I'm saying

352
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.260
Magalie Marcellus: I'm willfully nice treatment nice will get treatment.

353
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.950
Magalie Marcellus: If you

354
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.910
Magalie Marcellus: Obviously, that means

355
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.440
SUMMER: He's got a problem. And I said,

356
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.110
Magalie Marcellus: I may be playing a role in the way he's behaving as well.

357
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.920
Magalie Marcellus: That's what I think.

358
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.930
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah. Then he needs to take care of it.

359
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.390
SUMMER: As a depressant alcohol is a depressant.

360
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.820
SUMMER: Into that you know there's a million things. So yeah, um,

361
00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:54.930
SUMMER: I, I gotta, you know, kind of, I guess, figure out some things. But, you know, for me, I kind of went through this. It was a shock phase, you know, like the past two weeks, not having, you know, anything to take care of my son, basically.

362
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.000
SUMMER: And not having that

363
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.790
SUMMER: You know this is going to happen, like in time to prep otherwise.

364
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.320
SUMMER: And I don't even know how I would

365
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.930
SUMMER: Have otherwise I really don't like I if I did, I would be already doing this.

367
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.580

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.640
SUMMER: Okay.

371
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:35.190
SUMMER: So I have to either a find a lawyer. If I want to go that route.

372
00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.750
SUMMER: And have the and i have 60 days, you know, to, to appeal that

373
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.860
Magalie Marcellus: That decision.

374
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:49.230
SUMMER: So I have. I've been debating like do I do I try it again right now by myself, or do I just get a lawyer.

375
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.520
Magalie Marcellus: Just get the lawyer and get the customer would way because

376
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.650
Magalie Marcellus: They won't charge any fees from the

377
00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.630
Magalie Marcellus: Right, right. So,

378
00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.240
SUMMER: And I know that they take like a really big cut

379
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:01.740
SUMMER: You know,

380
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.630
Magalie Marcellus: But sometimes a few mind.

381
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.480
Magalie Marcellus: I will get it approved is probably better than

382
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.160
SUMMER: That's what I love is more long

383
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.110
Magalie Marcellus: Term yeah yeah

384
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:19.020
SUMMER: The long term of okay I'm setup. Now that's more of a win. To me, then someone having me, you know, check for X amount you know any mean

385
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.580
SUMMER: I can set myself up.

386
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.510
SUMMER: Knowing that that's going to be there, and that is something I can depend on and

387
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:35.070
SUMMER: You know, all those things. So yeah, I know. That's another thing. If I had a car right now and everything I could probably be doing something different with

388
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:48.690
SUMMER: You know, you know, even flipping like if I felt low enough to get on, you know, and get out and go to like goodwill or something. I know a lot of people flip stuff you know on posh mark and all these other you know eBay.

389
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:57.660
SUMMER: I will figure out various things like that. But I don't have the tools to even or resources to do so. So I'm literally like stuck in this House.

390
00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:05.610
SUMMER: I haven't left this house. I'm in two and a half months minus my hospital and then doctors appointments

391
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.750

392
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:17.640

393
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:23.400
SUMMER: I've been housebound for a lot of years, you know, even before my son was born.

394
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.200
SUMMER: And then, you know, when I wasn't

395
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:42.870
SUMMER: At home, I was in the hospital. So I'm used to this kind of thing, but it's getting to the point where you know how much longer can I truly be inside just leaving to go to the grocery store for 1520 minutes before all this stuff happened with the cars and whatnot.

396
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:43.800
Magalie Marcellus: That was

397
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.470
SUMMER: That little time meant so much to me.

398
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:52.260
SUMMER: 15 minutes of going to the store and having music on and being out for a minute, did me

Magalie Marcellus: To

425
00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.710

SUMMER: I haven't been well enough to watch it even leave

433
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.490

434
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.150
SUMMER: Of that, too.

435
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:20.310
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

436
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.340
SUMMER: Feels like a dead end or I'm just going in circles everywhere.

437
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:29.130
Magalie Marcellus: But why would the treatment because I know there was a couple of things in the works and trying to see

438
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.420
Magalie Marcellus: How yeah I'm

439

Magalie Marcellus: You yeah just started infusion when we're tracking

442
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.100
SUMMER: So we had, I heard you know really bad reactions to it.

443
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:45.360
And

444
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:55.290
SUMMER: We tried on the lesson for you. Should I had to give me a bunch of pre meds prior to it to see if I didn't get a reaction.

445
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.400
SUMMER: And I

446
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.520
SUMMER: Still got a reaction. So we stopped it and

447
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.990
SUMMER: As I sit right now.

448
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.150
SUMMER: That I'm not even on anything for it.

449
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.250
SUMMER: Like they don't really know what to

450
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.600
Magalie Marcellus: Do because it's not on

451
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.220
SUMMER: Our other options. There's nothing

452
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:08.640
Magalie Marcellus: Else.

453
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.500
SUMMER: Like we've been down every route.

454
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.390
SUMMER: And, you know,

455
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:13.590

457
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.640
SUMMER: I need to have my hysterectomy to get that cancer out and I don't even know how to do that, go about that because

458
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:31.050
SUMMER: I don't have anyone to take care of my son. And that's six to eight weeks. I won't be able to pick him up like can't pick up you know over 10 pounds and I

459
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:39.660
SUMMER: You know, I'm the only one that is here for him. Like, how am I going to do that, like, I don't know, I can't watch him play some I'd be in the hospital for a week, I'm sure.

460
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.150

461
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.850

SUMMER: And you know what you can move in with me or, you know, I've had, I've had a lot of offers down there and I have the most support down there. The problem is is that's why we moved back home up here is where they're all at is the worst hospital and healthcare I've ever seen in my life.

467
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.220
SUMMER: They didn't even know how to treat my club.

468
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.090
SUMMER: Microphones like

469
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.840

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.930
SUMMER: Reason only

475
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.600
SUMMER: Why would we get off the island to come back to sell.

476
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.050
It.

477
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.290
SUMMER: We did it for the healthcare.

478
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.590

480
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:49.440

481
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:54.540
SUMMER: You know, like, yes, I had to support and everything, but I won't have the healthcare. Yes, it's

482
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.690
Magalie Marcellus: It's just so up and now on both

483
00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.890
SUMMER: Sides of everything.

484
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:06.450
Magalie Marcellus: So, well, what's your short term goals right now. What do you need to take

485
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:12.690
SUMMER: A short term. I've been trying to look online to get

486
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:18.210
SUMMER: See if there's any kind of like freelance online work. I can maybe do

487
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:19.890
SUMMER: To just

488
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:25.020
SUMMER: You know, financially, I need to figure something out. It doesn't even have to be a lot of money.

489
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.310
Magalie Marcellus: Just enough

490
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.060
SUMMER: To figure out how I can you know support my son.

491
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:42.570
SUMMER: You know, and I don't really need much myself. I mean, he I need my medications. Um, but I'm kind of accepting that because they're also expensive. I just probably won't get on

492
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:53.790
SUMMER: You know, like I I can probably, you know, figure out something if I could like say got 50 or hundred bucks for a month. I probably could figure out something for my son, at least.

493
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.530
SUMMER: But, you know,

494
00:40:55.590 --> 00:41:01.050
SUMMER: One medication. The other day alone when I called about it was 160 something with the guitar.

495
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.550
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah and there's just

496
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.170
SUMMER: This just one med i mean i

497
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.550
Magalie Marcellus: There's 13 meds that they

498
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:13.590
SUMMER: Cut out so you know even if one of them say is $8 and the other 160 and then the other ones 160 and the

499
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.550
SUMMER: Other one I love

500
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:19.410
SUMMER: Yeah yeah and it's no problem, but mine. I mean I it's

501
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.240
That's something I've accepted.

502
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.490
Magalie Marcellus: But, you know, we're hoping that ensure the suppose so.

503
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.140
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah. Yeah, give you a little bit of a week so you can get the treatment that you need.

504
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.250
SUMMER: Yeah yeah

505
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.210
Magalie Marcellus: And then definitely you know

506
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:45.840
Magalie Marcellus: Does no that takes some time. The Social Security at least maybe the insurance piece of it will be different if you don't get that. Yeah.

507
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.390
SUMMER: Yeah, I think that probably would be the case, from what I know from what I've researched and read

508
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.160
SUMMER: I think that that seems

509
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.490
SUMMER: Like, you know, I would be a little more, a little bit better setup.

510
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.970
SUMMER: You know, with the help, I'd probably get because

511
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:09.510
SUMMER: I know a couple people that have, you know, that are on it right now. And they have, you know, security, I don't know if there's a difference between

512
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:21.630
SUMMER: What they do with the healthcare with just Medicaid or I'm sorry, just disability our supply us with supplemental income or whatever, you know,

513
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:27.060
SUMMER: There's a difference between those two with or do you get the same health care that I don't know. I'm not sure.

514
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.230
Magalie Marcellus: I'm gonna share but I'm just probably comparable cuz they will. Yeah.

515
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.550
Magalie Marcellus: I'm compiling the same

516
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:32.940

532
00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:30.990
Magalie Marcellus: But it's something I mean, absolutely.

533
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.950
SUMMER: Better than nothing.

534
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:32.640

SUMMER: You know, even if I can

539
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.650

541
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:12.150
SUMMER: I just need to remind myself like okay well then I have to wait for the results, but I did the short term work by getting it all set up and running to
