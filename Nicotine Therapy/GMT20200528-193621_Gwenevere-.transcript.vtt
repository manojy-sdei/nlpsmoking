00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, Alice, how are you

2
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.890
Elias Gallegos: Oh, good. Yep.

3
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. So let's talk for just a quick second before we start this assessment. Okay.

4
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.250
Hmm.

5
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright. So where am I finding you in your home.

6
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.530
Elias Gallegos: Mm hmm.

7
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're eating lunch.

8
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How much longer are you going to be until you're done with your lunch.

9
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.180
Elias Gallegos: I'll just put away now.

10
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's okay. Um, I, I think I might need to change computers anyway.

11
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.010
Elias Gallegos: Oh,

12
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.610
I'm

13
00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of challenges. One of them, I think I told you, hopefully in groups that I don't have any texts capability. But then someone put me on some sort of Wi Fi. Anyway, it might be back. Um,

14
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this. Put me down somewhere Aaliyah so that I can see more of your body, not just your head, maybe on a bookcase or table.

15
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

16
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

17
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So today's assessment is one where I gather some history and

18
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But before I do, I want to make sure that you're okay because I you and I haven't met but there was some pacing going on in group and I want to make sure you're okay.

19
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

20
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

21
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there been any recent slips where maybe you've used a stimulant a depressant, you haven't used any math.

22
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When was the last time you did.

23
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.710
Elias Gallegos: Three weeks ago.

24
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Two weeks ago, when was your last year Android screen.

25
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Two weeks ago.

26
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.670
Alright.

27
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll take me a second to just got to open up this document.

28
00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But I wanted to just let you know because you and I really haven't been introduced, you already know. My name is Gwen or you can call me one of your paid up therapist, fine.

29
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I live in Florida. Right now I'm visiting Santa Fe, New Mexico. So I'm in the same time zone as you

30
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've been practicing for over 20 years and have worked with folks sort of struggling with chemical dependence for most of my career, I really enjoy working with you guys.

31
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

32
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The only other thing. So then we'll dive into the assessment is, you know, my phone you can maybe you don't know this because I don't think I have your number yet, but normally what I do when I have good Wi Fi is I schedule individual therapy and we confirm through texting.

33
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be able to continue doing that. I'm not sure. Normally I do with my clients, but what I don't do is I don't do therapy through texting. In other words, like let's say you're going through a difficult moment.

34
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear that I can receive the text, and I won't be able to write you back. I'll probably write you back like something like this. Hey,

35
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, this is a difficult time can we meet for individual therapy in a zoom meeting. Will that be okay.

36
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

37
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

38
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, let's see, I gotta get in here. Where's your kit.

Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier.

65
00:07:49.530 --> 00:08:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed that when we first were talking in group, you seemed kind of more comfortable. Does it seem like something changed where it's even more uncomfortable to talk here in the teleconference in in zoom

66
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.120
Elias Gallegos: No, I really

67
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.170

104
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to jump to a different question, it's in a different category. But I'm curious how far did you get in school.

Gwenevere Abriel: After know

125
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good. If you could bring your chair just about two or three feet closer

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.760
Elias Gallegos: Furniture

127
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you bring the table closer to you.

Okay.

132
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I think we're having trouble hearing each other once you're able to hear. So I'm here. Let's see where we were at age 14 I don't quite have a progression yet because you don't, you're not remembering

133
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't remember at its worst, how many hydrocodone or oxy as you were taking

134
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.090
Elias Gallegos: Or I don't remember.

135
00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.580
Elias Gallegos: It was like 11 years ago.

136
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: When was the age that you first did heroin.

137
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.610
Elias Gallegos: Oh 16

138
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And how much heroin, did you do after you first used it.

Elias Gallegos: Last year,

142
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever had a brain injury. Do you know

143
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.080
Elias Gallegos: What

144
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: When was that

145
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.180
Elias Gallegos: I don't know.

146
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:28.530
Okay.

147
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.110

Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now remember that PTSD diagnosis. Right.

149
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.180
Elias Gallegos: Yeah.

150
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.080

Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Oh, yes.

482
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Very possible because I keep hearing you say you have group and individual therapy. It's very possible. You're already getting the services that you need. I think I need to

486
00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.640
Elias Gallegos: You may already have it.

487
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that I don't want to add to it. It's unethical. It's not right, can't do that.

488
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:05.790
Elias Gallegos: So this is the first time I'm

489
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Hearing that you're already seeing a therapist. I know you have a psychiatrist. That's awesome. I'm also hearing

490
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.280
Elias Gallegos: therapists have a relapse.

491
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.660

Gwenevere Abriel: So that we can maybe you don't have to do this piece with us here. You may already be getting it.

496
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.070
Elias Gallegos: But

497
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I do need to check and make sure because

498
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a little bit difficult to get information.

499
00:38:52.680 --> 00:39:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be me might not be. You might be me. But I do want to, I need. I can't call just anybody and talk with anybody. I've got to have your consent to do so. So

500
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.860

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:33.450
