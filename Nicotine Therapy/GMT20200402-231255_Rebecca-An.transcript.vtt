00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, hello there.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, how are you

3
00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.020
Matt Huss III: Okay. How are you, I'm

4
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing good.

5
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How things been going

6
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.940
Matt Huss III: pretty nuts, actually.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.060
Matt Huss III: Last week we were leaving, like in the next couple days and then we were going to leave the six and then he changed it to like two or three weeks out from

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
Matt Huss III: Last week and then today. Again he changed it back to

9
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.130
Matt Huss III: The six or seven

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
Matt Huss III: That we're getting a truck. So I think it's I think it's pretty. I think it's definite this time.

11
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:58.200
Matt Huss III: That we're, you know, going to load up a truck on the six and then take off the seventh in the morning or, you know, depending on how fast it takes a little truck. I don't know. We don't have much. We're not taking much with us. So, um,

12
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.090
Matt Huss III: But

13
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.840
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I feel, I feel like kind of like just

14
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.330
Matt Huss III: Like I've been

15
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.570
Matt Huss III: I haven't felt the cabin fever. Like, I thought I would with being trapped

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

17
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.610
Matt Huss III: And the house but

18
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.970
Matt Huss III: I know that's because of my essays. I've been able to sit at my desk and just keep my mind completely occupied

19
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.960
Matt Huss III: All day on these papers.

20
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.210
Matt Huss III: So that's been a saving grace for me but

21
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.810
Uh,

22
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.160
Matt Huss III: Huh.

23
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I missed that piece. What did you say about grades.

24
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.630
Matt Huss III: Oh, it's the papers have been a saving grace for me as far as cabin fever and, you know, locked up and

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.750
Matt Huss III: Trapped. But, um, it sucks kind of feeling like in limbo like not sure whether you know I'm going to be here for another

26
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.600
Matt Huss III: You know couple weeks week day or we're just going to pick up and take off tomorrow, you know,

27
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
Matt Huss III: It's crazy. Yeah, and that's given me really bad anxiety and

28
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:24.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So understandable because there's one thing that we don't like is change. And when we know what's coming. We prepare for it. But when the information, you know, and the plans keep changing, then it's chaos.

29
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.950
Matt Huss III: Right, yeah.

30
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You feel it internally feel it mentally. You know, you don't know whether you're coming or going. I'm just kind of playing it by ear, which keeps you in that fighter fighter flight mode.

31
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

32
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.910
Matt Huss III: All the time. Yeah.

33
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

34
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you have no idea.

35
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So now the tentative plans are you guys are leaving on the six

36
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just a few days.

37
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.690
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you excited about that or are you nervous about it.

39
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.430
Matt Huss III: I have

40
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:14.160
Matt Huss III: There's pros and cons to all things, um, you know, I have my kids in Florida, which, you know, I am so excited to see them, but it's not a good place to be for my addiction.

41
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:32.340
Matt Huss III: You know, which I'm not too worried about because I'm not gonna contact or be in touch with anybody from there that I used to talk to and stuff i mean i i deleted their numbers. I haven't talked to them, since I left.

42
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.350
Matt Huss III: For New Mexico.

43
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.120
Matt Huss III: It's gonna be tough. Like I was planning on going there and finding a job.

44
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.100
Matt Huss III: Until like it starts again at you and F because over 19

45
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.070
Matt Huss III: There's no jobs.

46
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.940
Matt Huss III: Like I just found out my my son's my ex wife and her boyfriend both got fired last week or the week before

47
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.560
Matt Huss III: Because virus and they just rented a house.

48
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.560
Matt Huss III: Apparently I just found this out today.

49
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.670
Ah,

50
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.860
Matt Huss III: So, and I've been trying. I've been constantly trying to get ahold of him.

51
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.340
Matt Huss III: You know, I wrote her a nice note saying, you know, I'm sure you're doing a good job about this, but are you making sure that your self.

52
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.560
Matt Huss III: Self isolating yourself Matthew and

53
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.990
Matt Huss III: You know, because

54
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:53.280
Matt Huss III: her family and her boyfriend. They're all Trump redneck conservative conservative, you know, so they all think it's a hoax. You know, or whatever. So I'm like, I just want to talk to Matthew and make sure that you're keeping them home and safe.

55
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.930
Matt Huss III: And yeah, as not

56
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:12.300
Matt Huss III: And that was like a week or two ago. And then I just texted her again. I called and texted her again today. Earlier today, and nothing so you know I can't, I don't know, that's getting kind of worrisome. Especially after what I heard about them losing their jobs and

57
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:31.590
Matt Huss III: You know, apparently they're going back and forth between this House and her mom's. I don't know. I don't know the situation, but like, and then I'm looking at my brother's face Facebook and him and his wife and kid or at the beach every day and stuff. I'm just like,

58
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.460
Matt Huss III: It's unbelievable. I feel like as soon as we get into Florida. I'm gonna start wearing those masks.

59
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, some people are, you know, just trying to do everything they can to get out and get in the weather, you know,

60
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are some beaches that are closed that

61
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are no allowing and

62
00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:09.480
Matt Huss III: They finally did a statewide, national shut on a statewide state wide shut down, you know, where only the necessities are open like supermarkets and pharmacies.

63
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.910
Matt Huss III: But

64
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:24.660
Matt Huss III: He wouldn't do it until literally just yesterday he did so Florida has become the next hotspot. It's going to be the next hotspot after New York is done.

65
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.870
That's worrisome.

66
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. And you guys are going right down in there.

67
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:43.890
Matt Huss III: Yeah, not, not where it's very bad right now. But eventually, like, because the worst of it isn't in Miami southern Florida and where we're going. Is Northeast Florida.

68
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.160
Matt Huss III: But it'll travel up eventually.

69
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.020
Matt Huss III: So,

70
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your daughter has her daughter.

71
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.600
Matt Huss III: She's good. I just talked to her today for a long time she's getting a little stir crazy

72
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.470
Matt Huss III: Because she's actually been self isolated.

73
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:12.870
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and she is finishing her semester of school online, like I am, yeah.

74
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.630
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so she's been she's been really good and looking forward to me come in there and

75
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.550
Matt Huss III: said we were going to start a painting together and

76
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:36.810
Matt Huss III: You know, get each other like when I when I told her I would get there and me and her are going to start like a routine and like

77
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.840
Matt Huss III: chores and

78
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:55.920
Matt Huss III: You know, and then some free time to ourselves to find to do something fun at a certain time and you know I'm thinking. So, at the same time as I need the help she also needs that structure and routine and stuff because

79
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.440
Matt Huss III: I grew up with my mom and

80
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.300
Matt Huss III: I got no discipline, no routine. No, you know,

81
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.900
Matt Huss III: I you know I i

82
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:14.670
Matt Huss III: I yeah I never had to do anything. You know, for myself, so

83
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that how it is for your daughter right now.

84
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.890
Matt Huss III: I'm assuming it is. Yeah.

85
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.740
Matt Huss III: I can probably

86
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is your daughter tell you

87
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did she tell you

88
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.030
Matt Huss III: She doesn't say much about it. We don't talk about it because I don't want to say stuff like that to her.

89
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:45.000
Matt Huss III: But I asked her, you know, you're taking care of your dog right and

90
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:59.790
Matt Huss III: She's like, Yeah, I walk them and feed them and then my mom tells my dad or something. It's actually she feeds them but doesn't walk them and you know and so

91
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.010
Matt Huss III: She um

92
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.650
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I don't want her to

93
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.230
Matt Huss III: Become an adult like me and then not know how to deal with.

94
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.280
Matt Huss III: Responsibilities and stuff like I never learned to

95
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:24.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, understandable understandable. Very much so. And so you're planning on going down there and getting into a structured routine with her.

96
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is really good because I think you guys might motivate each other.

97
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what I'm hoping.

98
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.420
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's, that's the idea. That's one panel.

99
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:46.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Good idea, that was a good idea. Tell me how your self regulating doing your papers online. Remember when we talked about it and you set up. No. Like, I probably couldn't do that. And now you're doing it.

100
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.310
Matt Huss III: Oh hello, um,

101
00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:05.910
Matt Huss III: It's literally because of the shut in that it's, there's nothing else to do you know so and it's it's completely

102
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.570
Matt Huss III: Getting my head at getting me out of my head.

103
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:16.950
Matt Huss III: Mm hmm. So it's, yeah. So, I mean, I, I'm in under normal circumstances.

104
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.360
Matt Huss III: I would assume might be better than usual, but

105
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.060
Matt Huss III: Yeah, you know, who knows for sure.

106
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, the great part about it is, you're really building up

107
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The pattern.

108
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, even though it you know it's it's because of the quarantine or whatever the reason is it's being built right now. So you're being able to do it.

109
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The pattern of getting motivated and doing it.

110
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.920
Matt Huss III: Oh, yeah.

111
00:10:47.460 --> 00:11:05.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see what I mean. And so it'll be different, you know when this thing is lifted and you're able to make the choice herself. It'll be almost uncomfortable that you don't if you don't do it or if you try to procrastinate, you know, go back to that old way.

112
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll feel the difference

113
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you will. And you'll think Oh, she was right. I'm building a new way of doing things, you know, regardless of why you're doing it. The issue is, is that it's being built.

114
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't even know what

115
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.020
Matt Huss III: Kind of amazing

116
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.020
Matt Huss III: I didn't think about that. But yeah, so

117
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.030
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

118
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you'll be able to do more things you know like that or you won't have any you know that harvest issue you you'll struggle a little bit with procrastination, but not very much because you're building

119
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:52.110
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I see myself. I'm not. Yeah, I'm not fighting myself to do something, you know, because of this.

120
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.030
Matt Huss III: Because

121
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.780
Matt Huss III: You know, if I was my normal self. I would be going nuts, you know,

122
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.150
Matt Huss III: bouncing off the walls, you know, needing to get out or do something

123
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.460
Matt Huss III: But yeah, so

124
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.620
Matt Huss III: This is probably good timing for this to happen. Yeah.

125
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I think so, you know, very much so. There's never really good time, but

126
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. What an opportunity you

127
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know what an opportunity to start build in you know those

128
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those roads that you were struggling in

129
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

130
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's kind of amazing.

131
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And with your daughter to. She's doing her schooling online. Yeah.

132
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You guys will be able to do homework together. Yeah.

133
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.930
Matt Huss III: Yep, that's the plan. We're going to have a time slot where we do homework. We're gonna have an hour of like

134
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.750
Matt Huss III: Painting or or reading or, you know, and then

135
00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:00.270
Matt Huss III: Cup like time setup for chores like cleaning the kitchen or, you know, that stuff like that.

136
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.620
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so I haven't thought I completely through but

137
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's

138
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a plan for men, you know,

139
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good. Very, very good. You seem a lot better headspace and where you've been, what you were the last time that I talked to you.

140
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Last week,

141
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.930
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Last week I was literally just so exhausted, um,

142
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.730
Matt Huss III: I did take it kind of easier than usual on my work on my reading I

143
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.690
Matt Huss III: Just because I I couldn't get myself motivated enough honestly

144
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.010

Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm

215
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:00.690

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.530
Matt Huss III: All of them. Don't you know

217
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I did it.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:13.200
Matt Huss III: I did. I don't, I don't know. I don't get how somebody at 16 1718 years old.

219
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.230
Matt Huss III: Doesn't rebel against you know authority or, you know,

220
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:29.760
Matt Huss III: Society and, you know, and go through that phase where everything's about me. Everything's for my pleasure, you know,

221
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah and you know maybe she has gone through it or or maybe she's going to be one of the ones that doesn't have to go through it and just, you know, conforms and complies you know

222
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's cool either which way you know well that way is definitely a lot easier than the other way. But, you know,

223
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just depends.

224
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, definitely. It just depends.

225
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:07.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Peer pressure's bad bullying is bad men. If you don't, if you are out of that realm and you don't have to deal with that kind of stuff, you know, gosh, that's awesome.

226
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.300
Matt Huss III: You know, yeah, there was one school. We had to take her out of because she was being bullied so much

227
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

228
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's horrible.

229
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:27.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. Um, and so everything has been just trudging along you got your guys's stuff sold in your state sale so

230
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're good to go.

231
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:44.820
Matt Huss III: I'm sorry, you're the my phone Bluetooth just connected to the car outside

232
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.810
Matt Huss III: So I don't know. So I didn't hear anything. You just said.

233
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh, I just totally lost my train of thought.

234
00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did I just ask you

235
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.020
Matt Huss III: The last thing I remember saying is, you know,

236
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:12.180
Matt Huss III: They'll either go off the deep end or conform and not have to, you know, but then that was the last I heard

237
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was asking if you got everything sold in this state sale that you needed to get

238
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.350
Matt Huss III: Rid of, oh, you may be

239
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.240
Matt Huss III: The estate sale never happened.

240
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.450
Matt Huss III: Oh, that's why. That's one of the reasons why this whole thing has been a nightmare because

241
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:37.410
Matt Huss III: Because of the coronavirus the guy backed out and is not doing any estate sales for, you know, during the coronavirus

242
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.400
Matt Huss III: So what happened is somehow he got ahold of these people that flip houses.

243
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.940
Matt Huss III: And they came

244
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:59.700
Matt Huss III: They offer to cash settlement and for the house and for all the furniture that we leave in the house and we leave

245
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.610
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

246
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That rocks.

247
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.770
Yeah.

248
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally

249
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, very easy.

250
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's cool.

251
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody needs to have it that easy when they move

252
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to me,

253
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.760
Matt Huss III: But they're making out like bandits, you know, he's got so much nice stuff.

254
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, so they kind of lowball them.

255
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.030
Matt Huss III: Yeah, definitely.

256
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.590
Matt Huss III: But

257
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.220
Matt Huss III: You know I'm

258
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: happy with the outcome. Yeah.

259
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:46.590
Matt Huss III: He's yeah he's he's content and happy with the outcome. Um, so

260
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.350
Matt Huss III: That's all the matters, I guess.

261
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:55.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. How have you been doing with your journaling.

262
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.560
Matt Huss III: I'm, I'm still at the point, like I told you last time I have two entries

263
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.680
Matt Huss III: A short one and a long one. And then I've got so

264
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:28.290
Matt Huss III: Um, and then I and then things got a little muddy and then actually last night and group. I brought it up again as because she was going around asking one thing that each of us is going wants to do differently or try and I was like, I'm gonna I've been I talked to my talking to my therapist.

265
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.560
Matt Huss III: We think it's a good thing to try journaling it now. So

266
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.920
Matt Huss III: I'm going to try to do that. Um, it's just

267
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.350
Matt Huss III: Yeah, just trying to learn a new habit. Right now it's

268
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.870
Matt Huss III: Yeah, it's just

269
00:23:49.860 --> 00:24:01.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, it's tough. It's not like you know you can just pay. It's not like school work or work, you know, is it something different. So getting motivated to be able to do that can be tough, you can

270
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.900
Matt Huss III: Oh yeah, well I was I was more referring to, like, if I knew like

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

295
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.640
No.

296
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You never talked to her.

297
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.180
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah. I forgot. Again, and it's okay.

298
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.630
Matt Huss III: I'll try. I'll try again. When I go to Florida.

299
00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't blame me, it's probably not a good time to try to start

300
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: dating somebody anyways. Right now, when you're

301
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.460
Matt Huss III: Moving. Yeah.

302
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:48.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. So what are your plans to stay away from people, places and things when you go to Florida.

303
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.030
Matt Huss III: Well,

304
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.670
Matt Huss III: The self isolation thing will make it pretty easy. In the beginning

305
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:02.850
Matt Huss III: But

306
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:13.440
Matt Huss III: I have to get a vehicle, because I'm going to, I think, my dad's done going to college, you know, whereas, I'm going to continue

307
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:23.970
Matt Huss III: So I have to go up to Jacksonville, at least, you know, three times a week or five times a week. I don't know what my class schedule is going to be, but

308
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:38.730
Matt Huss III: So I'm just going to stick to, you know, going to school coming home or staying hopefully my side job is going to be a job at the school like tutoring.

309
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:44.790
Matt Huss III: Which I have always loved doing that. That's always been my favorite job.

310
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.100
Matt Huss III: So hopefully I'll be able to do that again.

311
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.020
Matt Huss III: Because I know I can't work in a restaurant anymore.

312
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.200
Matt Huss III: It's too much to

313
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.000
Matt Huss III: Too many triggers and too many factors that just

314
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.280
Matt Huss III: And badly.

315
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.540
Yeah.

316
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.380
Matt Huss III: Yeah. And then, you know, come home, spend time with

317
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.490
Matt Huss III: Deaths and

318
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:35.820
Matt Huss III: Do home. I'm going to have a ton of homework. Apparently I like, which I didn't realize until this semester.

319
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.700
Matt Huss III: Work. Hi. I have to do so, you know,

320
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.530
Matt Huss III: My ex wife is calling me right now. That's where

321
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You want to message her and tell her, you'll be with her and if you

322
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.070
Matt Huss III: Know, I'll just, I'll just

323
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.130
Matt Huss III: I'll um

324
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:05.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can

325
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One second. Actually, since she's okay, especially since she's been so hard to get in touch with

326
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:10.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know,

327
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give her a response.

328
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.020
Matt Huss III: Sorry. Okay. Thank you.

329
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. Yeah. Somethings better than nothing. You know what I mean.

330
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially when she's been so hard to get in touch with

331
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so back to how you're going to

332
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:59.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stay safe when things start getting tough in Florida, it's better that you have something in place before you go.

333
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that you think about it and have an action plan in place before you go. So when and if

334
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If

335
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The situation arises, you have something to fall back on, you know,

336
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:27.930
Matt Huss III: I, I guess. I don't know what my options are as far as

337
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I mean, there's several different things you can do.

338
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you can certainly

339
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Reach out, do you know when it's over people there.

340
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:41.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You

341
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.240
Know,

342
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got to develop sober support system.

343
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.170
Matt Huss III: You

344
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Got to develop you

345
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.130
Matt Huss III: Start going to na meetings out there.

346
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.550
Matt Huss III: You know, get a sponsor.

347
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. That's a good plan. If you do it.

348
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.490
Matt Huss III: I

349
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gotta do it.

350
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.250
Matt Huss III: Okay.

351
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.770
Matt Huss III: Do the virus is gone.

352
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Do you have any

353
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.070
Matt Huss III: But before we were shut in here. I had a sponsor and was going to meetings.

354
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you haven't been in contact with your sponsor since you've been quarantined.

355
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.380
Matt Huss III: Know,

356
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe that's a phone call that

357
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You should probably think about making maybe that's a phone call, you should probably think about making

358
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.030
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, he might have some ideas.

359
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely something definitely something to bounce off of have him on, you know, and maybe he knows, maybe he knows a cat has a connection down there for you. You know that you don't even know yet, you know,

360
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You never know.

361
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of crazy how that works.

362
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

363
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:17.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You think about it, what you're going to start going to na again, you're going to get a new sponsor down there.

364
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try to stay around healthy server people

365
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're changing going to be changing the structure of your routine.

366
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With your daughter.

367
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so you have a lot of a lot of changes that are coming

368
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

369
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So instead of focusing

370
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On the what ifs of it.

371
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Focus on the, why can I have it.

372
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:56.550
Matt Huss III: Why can't

373
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We get sometimes when changes going on, especially a lot of change, like what you have going on. We get so stuck in fear and so stuck in the what ifs, that it holds us back from moving forward. Right.

374
00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you start having if he's having those thoughts really pay attention to the question, you know, why can I

375
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where you know what's stopping me

376
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's the fear about

377
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I make sense. You know, it could be a fear of rejection or a fear of success.

378
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

379
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.520
Yeah.

380
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:55.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really just kind of pay attention to, to that. And if you get start getting into that, you know, headspace that is self defeating

381
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:07.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And pick up your old pickup. Ask your sponsor you know in Mexico. If you could possibly keep them as a lifeline until you get connected with somebody down there and and you know, make it a point to call them.

382
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:18.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, every after, after you go to a meeting or even in times when you know you're going through the negative thought process of

383
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what, if

384
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:34.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see about letting have him letting you process through the whole thing to get to the other side. So you can see that there's nothing to fear. You know,

385
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, it makes a difference when you have somebody to bounce it off of

386
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

387
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.090
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've never had. I've never

388
00:34:53.940 --> 00:35:05.010
Matt Huss III: You know, in the moment, if I'm feeling if I'm craving something or feel like I need to take something I've never read up but he like in the moment, you know,

389
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.810
Matt Huss III: Something I really do try

390
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

391
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

392
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you were doing it when you weren't struggling

393
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:29.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On a day to day basis, then the idea is, it doesn't always happen this way. But the idea is, is that you it'll be easier to do it when you're struggling

394
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But again, that's not always how it goes. We'll call you know we'll pick up the phone and call somebody when things are going good. And we have nothing to report, but the minute that we're stressed and we really need somebody will

395
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sit in it and not make that call.

396
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I hear excuses as I don't want to burden. Other people with my problems or

397
00:35:54.090 --> 00:36:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know they've got enough going on in their life. They don't need to deal with mine or, you know, but in reality.

398
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's exactly what needs to happen.

399
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

400
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So be careful of those mind traps.

401
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense

402
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have those jobs, don't you. Oh, yeah.

403
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.830
Matt Huss III: Without a doubt. Oh.

404
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.330
Yeah.

405
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:36.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, you know, definitely. And it's really something to pay attention to and just start making those changes. I mean, you're changing everything else. You know what I mean.

406
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why not start you know changing and implementing these types of behaviors so that

407
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're already actively in place, you know. Yeah.

408
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.730
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I don't want to go there and just

409
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:02.250
Matt Huss III: Sit around writing papers all day. You know, like here. I want to go there and

410
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.550
Matt Huss III: You know, get up and

411
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.990
Matt Huss III: You know, yeah. Live normally

412
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We'll see how that goes. But normally, what's that are

413
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.490
Matt Huss III: Just getting up

414
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.740
Matt Huss III: Eating breakfast.

415
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.360
Matt Huss III: Doing having a routine of things to do.

416
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.590
Matt Huss III: You know, just not just

417
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:38.190
Matt Huss III: Sit sitting on my desk and then go and have a cigarette. Every time I need a break. You know, and then back to my desk, you know,

418
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:39.210
Yeah.

419
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because you got to have that that interaction.

420
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.140
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

421
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know whether you think you do or not. You know what I mean.

422
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important you know we talked. We've talked before where you didn't have those things when you were growing up and you know

423
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:05.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now that you're an adult. It's important that you work on building those connections, you know,

424
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tibor it's important

425
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have, there's two two assignments this week.

426
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That one to

427
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One is make one entry in your in your journal

428
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:25.890
Okay.

429
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just one.

430
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't care what it's about.

431
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:41.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't care if it's babble. I don't care if it's about a you know a situation that's happening, you're struggling with or something that makes you happy.

432
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or

433
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something that frustrates you

434
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:57.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the second thing is, is to reach out to your current sponsor and have just a connected conversation with him about your move.

435
00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and if he'd be willing to stay connected with you while you're going through the transition to, you know, find and build down there. Yeah.

436
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.220
Matt Huss III: Oh,

437
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK.

438
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And stay on your sleep pattern stay in your sleep schedule because it's working.

439
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. You can see I can see the difference in your anxiety I see the difference in your depression I see the difference in your presence.

440
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:39.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you can tell that you're, you're definitely well rested and you're feeling, you know, you're feeling pretty all right right now.

441
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.870
Matt Huss III: Yeah, getting there getting almost

442
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.300
Matt Huss III: Normal

443
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, what is normal.

444
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.140
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

445
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no such thing.

446
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.830
Matt Huss III: Nothing compared to, yeah.

447
00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Absolutely. There's nothing to compare it to Google and even back in the day when they did claim that there was a normal. It really wasn't normal

448
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now you know when you look back on it, it's like, oh God, they had so many, you know, skeletons in their closet.

449
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.040
Matt Huss III: I guess I'm

450
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:29.280
Matt Huss III: Hoping that I'll go back to like before high school where I didn't have this anxiety and depression and addiction issues. You know, I just keep hoping that will happen one day.

451
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:41.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, so you got to stop setting yourself up that way. And, you know, get to that point of accepting the fact that

452
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:54.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: These are a piece of who you are. It's a piece of your life and you can never go back and be somebody you used to be but you can certainly work towards being a better version of what you're used to be.

453
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so instead of, you know, wishing that you didn't have these things except the fact that you do and move forward with them, right, because we think that there's such a burden, and there they feel like such a burden.

454
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But when they're managed, they're not

455
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like somebody you would consider normal

456
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably struggles with depression and anxiety to and is probably, you know, secretly seeing a therapist to help them through those types of things as well, or you know what I mean.

457
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. So definitely, we're not made perfect. This world is certainly not perfect.

458
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So whatever

459
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Normal is we're in

460
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're normal

461
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:54.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Time.

462
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.810
That's depressing.

463
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think so.

464
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you know what I think.

465
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that we are you know a smart. Lot of people, I think that we definitely have to learn things the hard way.

466
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

467
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that makes us extra resilient.

468
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

469
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's some qualities. So you've got to look for the qualities in it right or you'll stay, you know, in that whole mindset that it's all negative and

470
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

471
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Life does not have to be negative, even with depression and anxiety and addiction.

472
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:46.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Certainly not.

473
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, that is the normal

474
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got your wish.

475
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You wish you could be normal and you are normal. So

476
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: mindset that you need to change. Right.

477
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There it towards that piece because there's nothing wrong with you, you know. And when you have that mindset that I wish I could be different than who I really am.

478
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That plays a factor in your self esteem piece and we're trying to get that that up to par Right. We're not trying to keep it under wraps. But we really want to, you know, change the that thinking process so that you you know don't think that you are abnormal from other people.

479
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.140
Because they're not

480
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense. Yeah.

481
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

482
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:58.140
Matt Huss III: Well, I feel like, you know, especially when I'm at school. You know, it's probably just me. It's probably just all in my head, but I feel like I am just so

483
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.880
Matt Huss III: Different than all the kids around me, you know, and just

484
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.070
I don't know.

485
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:14.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's probably because you've always had that mindset, you know, even as even younger you had that mindset.

486
00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, why would somebody want to hang out with me. It's okay. I'm better off alone. I mean, I can already. You haven't even told me that just have some of the things that go inside your head, but I know

487
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

488
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I better off without people. Anyways, you know,

489
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just think about, that's what you want to veer veer away from

490
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know is that piece because you have to get to a point where you believe in yourself. You believe in what you're doing.

491
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you believe that you are good.

492
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you believe that you are good enough. Yeah.

493
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the plan.

494
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you go when you go to Florida. You can just kind of walk in and say,

495
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's clean and sober Matthew

496
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm going to rock these meetings and I'm going to fly through school with no problems or raise my daughter, to the best of my ability.

497
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

498
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.640
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah. I think this time I'm actually gonna

499
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.540
Matt Huss III: Stay on the right track.

500
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.330
Matt Huss III: I am confident of that.

501
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta go with the

502
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:47.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. You keep that confidence in it. Keep it. You know what I mean. Don't let it go. When you start having fear, pick up the phone.

503
00:45:49.380 --> 00:46:02.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because fear is exactly what it is. And remember that fear will can take a mean it can lead you right back. And that's what you want to stay away from. There's nothing to be afraid of. You've been doing this, you know, long enough over a year now.

504
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

505
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.330
Matt Huss III: I don't

506
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.620
Matt Huss III: Know that you can do it.

507
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:09.870
Matt Huss III: It's right around

508
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.780
Matt Huss III: Maybe a little less maybe a little more not really sure.

509
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well it's close. Right. Yeah.

510
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've been doing this repetitively for a while.

511
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you can do it doesn't matter what geographical move you make

512
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can do it.

513
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so here's my next question. When you go if you wind up going on the six

514
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you can still check in and come

515
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that we can figure out a game plan.

516
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you and I are doing what we're working on.

517
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.700
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm going to

518
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:05.220
Matt Huss III: Come to group and therapy at five o'clock, you know, on Thursdays and group at 730

519
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:11.790
Matt Huss III: Every week until they tell me I can't anymore. I'm just gonna keep doing it.

520
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.360
Okay.

521
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:20.580
Matt Huss III: Because I got to talk to my doctor about my medication because he gave me a month's worth

522
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:33.060
Matt Huss III: You know, a week ago so that I would have a month to find a new doctor in Florida. But now we're not leaving for two weeks. So I'm gonna have two weeks left when I leave

523
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.840
Matt Huss III: You know which kind of so I don't know what he can do.

524
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's concerned, but he couldn't do it again. Did you remember what we don't freak out because remember we talked about this couple weeks ago call and make an appointment with one

525
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.410
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, there is one

526
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.290
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, keep trying, but it's tough.

527
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is tough, but don't give up on it and once you have an appointment, you know, and you can tell them you're in the process of getting connected. You've been calling several times.

528
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your plan is to have an appointment in place before you go, but depending on how long that appointment out is your concern in your worry, you know, and see. But if you're going to come to group, then you'll still be able to get

529
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your medication for a while and you just explain that to them. I'm working on.

530
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, getting a place

531
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting an appointment with someplace. So

532
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have it in place before

533
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:47.010
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm hoping he might be able to send in another month script script that I can't fill you know until spend time and then you transfer it to Florida.

534
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when I'm

535
00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:55.110
Matt Huss III: Bill it if that's possible. I know I've transferred controlled substances from

536
00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.830
Matt Huss III: New Mexico to Florida when I'm there visiting but never that so I don't see why would be able to

537
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't see why you wouldn't be able to either. I don't

538
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, probably anything's possible

539
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:18.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, Matthew, I'm gonna let you go. I've got somebody else here and I will see you next week. You have two assignments to do this week.

540
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay and I'm looking forward to hearing the results.

541
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:26.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Next Thursday. Okay.

542
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Have a great week, keep doing what you're doing.

543
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK.

544
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK, I will talk to you next week.
