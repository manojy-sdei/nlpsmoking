15
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.130
Adam: Because

16
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.800

18
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.880

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha

26
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.080
Adam: That's something I guess that would

27
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.310
Adam: That works. And then I

28
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.410
Adam: I put

29
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.000
Adam: That I worked at the Dollar Tree.

Adam: Like I even did this place across the street from my mom's. It's called people barely been center. It's like the place like we're kids like I guess like Chucky Cheese or Peter Parker.

39
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:38.250
Adam: So that's really what I've been focusing on with my god thing I've been. I've been seeing some

Okay.

58
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. I'm just curious. It's pretty in general alibis that people start a romantic relationship and about the first year their recovery.

59
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Why so quickly for you. Why so quickly start a relationship.

60
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.660
Adam: Um, I don't know. I

61
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.970
Adam: Know I'm here. I. Oh, and before like where this Lexi, I met her.

62
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.410
Adam: I didn't see I didn't really in our last long. But I am at work or at where I used to work.

63
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:50.700
Adam: And we were just friends just talking for a while and I told me I just talked to her about I was talking to her about what's going on with my stuff in my baby's mom and stuff like that. And we're just friends.

64
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you romantic

65
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.000
Adam: Yeah, I guess it started to be like that this recently.

66
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, obviously you can do you know you're grown man. You do what you want to do, but most most advice that is general, you know, for people just starting a recovery is they don't

67
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: sign on to a romantic relationship with they are learning how to manage themselves and you just

68
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just out the gate here.

69
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.150
Adam: Yeah, and I missed them and out and I just

70
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.360
Adam: I just think she's

71
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.390
Adam: Good actually really helped me through all this stuff because she

72
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.860
Adam: Don't

73
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.780
Adam: She I guess she used to used to use, but she's been he's been over here likes

74
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.320
Adam: And

75
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.250
Adam: She's like been through all this stuff too.

76
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So Adam if it turns out later on that that's not the case that you're you're maybe underdeveloped skills of interpersonal communication or self confidence and things like that, let's say, let's say something happens between you, too.

77
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope it doesn't. I hope that she continues to be an ally for you and support you in your recovery.

78
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But if something does happen, will you consider putting the brakes on romantic relationships for a little while.

79
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.290
Yeah.

80
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.020
Adam: I understand that. Yeah, I need to. I need to focus on myself first. Yeah.

81
00:07:50.220 --> 00:08:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just worried about you because you already have these huge you have this huge piece with the mother of your children, you just have this huge bit. It took up all this attention.

82
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And

83
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Three off course.

84
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just completely lost job just completely off the rails and

85
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If that equation wasn't there. If you didn't need someone else instead. What you did was develop confidence in your own skills, your own ability.

86
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be offering another person more as an independent confident capable

87
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might like it. You know what I mean.

88
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:42.450
Adam: Yeah, and that's exactly what I told it to like before we even started doing in thing like I was telling you like

89
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.660
Adam: I'm going to look though.

90
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but as long as for now. As long as you're honest about that. Then if you and I kind of talk and if she starts to suck you into drama.

91
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. And it starts to distract and you start to compromise your plans for stable job getting back in school, eating right, exercising if that starts to slip

92
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I remind you, and say, hey, it's happening. Can you set a boundary with her and maybe even set it now and say, hey, we can do this thing.

93
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But I might set a boundary where I'm may not be hanging out with you that much because I've got to get on point here for myself to grow to be available as a son as a father.

94
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.250
Adam: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly what

95
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.620
Adam: I told her, like I said, I'm not going to be able to

96
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:59.970
Adam: Like give you like my all that I would normally like you do in a relationship, and it's just because

97
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.070
Adam: Now, can you even

98
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.160
Adam: Came so like

99
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.900
Adam: I don't know, it's just I had this I had the conversation about everything. Okay.

100
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well,

101
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yes. I just wanted to know.

102
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like you've been proactive and talking with her, we have a pretty crummy connection here. Um, so if I'm interrupting you. I do apologize. It's just that the connections pretty crummy

103
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.430
Adam: I'm sorry, wants to be

104
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:39.810
Adam: Slow

105
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk about money for a little bit, because right now that's a pressing issue.

106
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about data. Let's get into that for a minute. Um, I know you want to throw money at at at helping your mom. I know that's a priority.

107
00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But your programs also a priority. If this falls apart. If you can't have good data here. Watch what happens. Now you're hustling and chasing after strips on the street.

108
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.050
You see it.

109
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk just hang on. I really want to hear because I can't hear you. Really well. Let me just see.

110
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What amount of money is needed so that you because we've had good connection before. So something's going on. So have you called the phone company and we found out kind of what you need.

111
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:35.220
Adam: It's just Until my next phone bill and that's like on the 13th of this month. Okay. And I guess.

112
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:54.990
Adam: And it's just I guess because I used it more fast my my gigabyte through it. Every more fast because at my mom's house. I've been putting on my hot spot, whatever the hot spot think so because I'm wants to go to internet. Okay, so I feel my heart.

113
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.790
Adam: I put my arms like is watch

114
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.460
Adam: Netflix on TV.

115
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's that's where you can get in and say, I can't do that.

116
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's going to get in the way of treatment.

117
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no. Yeah, so we got to think about something else, whether it's drawing, painting something that's crafty something you could be doing at night. That is not drawing down your data.

118
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: For a while, until you know it's not forever just, you know, until you get this job at circle K. Maybe if that pans out.

119
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.640
Adam: That's why to is because I don't have a job. So I'm pretty much like here.

120
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.760
Adam: And like after I do the application stuff by just

121
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.730
Adam: And watching TV.

122
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.650
Adam: I don't really like regular to be so that's why I put on the Netflix.

123
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what can you do let's brainstorm. What else can you do

124
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.890
Adam: Are going to because I did actually that

125
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.180
Adam: Go to the community service. My brother.

126
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:16.950
Adam: Yeah, like this start taking him with me because he liked it, too. He actually met some friends over there and stuff and

127
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:26.850
Adam: There were some. There are some other guys to that we're playing basketball, like a game like they had game is going and basketball over there.

128
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.330
Adam: So I got into that with them and then

129
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:39.990
Adam: I'm I like they really went that one day, but we just need to start playing more because we both we both enjoyed it so

130
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, and I love the movement. I love the exercise part that's healthy for the brain but read, be realistic. Can you do that at night when you're flipping on Netflix, you

131
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.440
Know,

132
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.780
Adam: So like

133
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.580
Adam: I could

134
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.610
Adam: I could just start

135
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.310
Adam: I guess.

136
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.960
Adam: Books, or something.

137
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.070

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And

151
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you have, you know, maybe, you know, just a couple weeks. I mean get through the maybe the 13th.

152
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And love to see and maybe bring them to group and show us the work you're doing. That'd be great. If not, you don't have to, but it's a nice way to sort of hold yourself accountable and say, look, this is what I'm doing.

153
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But we'll know because the data you're going to have a better Wi Fi connection or better right hotspot. I know it really does draw down all your data when you do that.

154
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.660
Adam: Then I

155
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.690
Adam: Told me that

156
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.880
Adam: Too, so

157
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't catch any of that looks

158
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: kicked you out just now.

159
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right it locked you out.

160
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.330
I can't

161
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.950
Adam: Get

162
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.220
Adam: Up like

163
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Hit your mute button. One more time. It looks like you muted yourself.

164
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.840
Adam: Okay. See what we got here.

165
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.730
Adam: Can you hear me.

166
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can hear you.

167
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.320
Adam: Just went off completely.

168
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.090
Adam: Weird

169
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got distractions. I can go play basketball community center. We've got organized my roommate. My dad do dishes. Pick up toys. I like to color YouTube podcast on rap music fixing engines.

170
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are some distraction techniques for you. I'm

171
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling tell me

172
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:12.000
Adam: Who I am, my dad because I told you my dad was going to school to be a mechanic or whatever. So

173
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:19.230
Adam: Um, I guess he's been doing side jobs like four people doing a big scene their cars and stuff.

174
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.980
Adam: And he told me that

175
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:30.060
Adam: I can when he doesn't have suicide like go with him and and help them. So I could

176
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.230
Adam: Start to learn more to about them. Oh.

177
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay about fixing engines.

178
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.520
Adam: Yeah okay nice

179
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can then you can kind of get a sense of even like it.

180
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.680
Adam: Yeah yeah

181
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:51.690
Adam: That's another thing I could start doing with with him because I guess he's been

182
00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:00.840
Adam: Because he don't have a job right now, either. So like he just going to school and in doing sides of with people, then

183
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, yep, yep. All right. And how many milligrams. Are you are you at today.

184
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.820
Adam: Two and three eight

185
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.490
Look on my

186
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.120
My list here and see what milligram says

187
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.170
Adam: It's like little bit less than

188
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds familiar. I usually see it moved. I have it on my desktop somewhere here.

189
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.040
Up.

190
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so two, you said two and three eighths.

191
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's here. Yeah. So 19 milligrams

192
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.020
Okay. Very nice.

193
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.860
Adam: Okay, so she gave me enough then because I know it's hard for me to know

194
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.910
Adam: Like how much he gave me so she gave me 10 of them. So that's up to us so Tuesday. Right.

195
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably keep having. Do you think you have enough to get group.

196
00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:00.750
Adam: Yeah, I'm pretty sure cuz yeah she didn't kind of woman I barely got him yesterday. Okay.

197
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.660
Adam: I'm pretty sure that's enough to us.

198
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This what this looks like is 17

199
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, it looks like what it should have been was 17 strips. So I'm curious if that's going to be enough for you.

200
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:41.850
Adam: Yeah, oh yeah, for a week. Yeah. That's why I don't know. It's hard, like now that it's like that I have to cut them in half like I don't know how much

201
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.980
Adam: They're supposed to last.

202
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.200
Adam: Okay.

203
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you got 10 strokes.

204
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.200
Adam: Yeah, yesterday. Okay.

205
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: 19 milligrams is what we're doing 1900 rounds and I wonder to

206
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Me say something and go to medication. See if I can see what

207
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The order look like

208
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.220
Yeah.

209
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 films.

210
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.560
Interesting.

211
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if you're going to have enough

212
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.560
Adam: So I don't know if it's like

213
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder she thought that I wasn't there, or rather I I don't do this part. So, is she thought maybe you had some leftover. I don't know.

214
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I would spend some time today, getting clear on that because we want to get this figured out before the weekend.

215
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.160
Adam: Yeah, that's for those

216
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, get it.

217
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Figured out. Do your calculation. See, see if you're going to have a shortfall.

218
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have enough to get you to at least Monday evening, then that's what we're looking for. We want enough to get you, you know, your dose in the morning on Monday, and then you would go into groups. So do your calculation. See if there's enough to get you to a dose on Monday. Okay, so

219
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.440
Adam: Calculation about

220
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I come back in here, you know,

221
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

222
00:22:51.810 --> 00:23:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got a plan. And you've got some maybe getting more coloring sort of options. But what about doing some some journaling. Do you ever do any of that we write down your thoughts and reflections.

223
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.920
Adam: I haven't recently but like in the past, they tend to do when I was

224
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.100
Adam: When I lived with my maybes mom cuz like I don't know but

225
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:33.210
Adam: I haven't recently, but I guess I could start up again. Cuz I guess that's when I really let out my

226
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:35.910
Adam: My feelings.

227
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.800
Exactly.

228
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So one thing you've identified is

229
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Coloring and maybe getting your recovery journal and doing some journaling in there, you know, maybe about

230
00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you mentioned Tay she she needs to be with someone, why don't you do some reflection about how maybe you yourself may

231
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to be with someone, right, notice how you jumped into kind of this romantic relationship pretty quickly. Maybe analyze yourself a little bit to kind of do some reflection on that, you know, what would my life be like right now if I didn't have someone

232
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to what if I just had a friend. What if I developed a friendship. What if I went to a or na and I got a sponsor. If I you know wasn't romantic, you know, kind of reflecting about that your fears about it or

233
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a positive outcome, just to sort of play with it a little bit and just see what comes up to a little journaling that could be something you could do in the evening, instead of

234
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And do some trying to you know you can do. I don't know if you like to draw on your own, not just coloring

235
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:52.920
Adam: Yeah.

236
00:24:54.690 --> 00:25:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we can draw maybe what addiction is for you now, and maybe cross it with what you'd like to have your life be like to sort of open your mind to it, do a drawing coloring of what it is now sort of all the images that come up

237
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you envision it would be in the future.

238
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.740
Adam: I don't know, it's kind of chicken. I haven't even after

239
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.290
Adam: I messed up. And I went back over there to my baby's moms like since then. I haven't even

240
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.670
Adam: Like really talked to my kids.

241
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Really what's going on.

242
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.250
Adam: It's, I don't know. She

243
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:53.070
Adam: I don't have a phone number anymore. And she had she actually she got a hold of me through Facebook on like messenger, whatever. And we were kind of talking

244
00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.630
Adam: I was kind of talking to them through there for a little bit and then all of a sudden she

245
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:18.750
Adam: Just hasn't been on there at all like I've been trying to messengers in Taiwan, talk to my boys and stuff, but she hasn't been on there at all on her Facebook Messenger had all like she hasn't even looked at messages. So I don't know. I was gonna

246
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:29.040
Adam: She is my mom could go stop by over there because I can't just show up over there because of the case that's going on right now. Okay.

247
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.470
Adam: So, and then I actually wonder, there's

248
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:35.910
Adam: Like

249
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.250
Adam: Oh, he's like in high school. There's some kid that I know that stays in that like right next door to them and

250
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:59.910
Adam: I had found him on Facebook and I had messaged him and I I told him just to when he sees my son or outside playing or whatever, just to let them know that I've been trying to get all of them. And I love them and stuff and

251
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:15.900
Adam: And, um, yeah. So I don't know, but I haven't really heard back from him really well he had told me. Yeah, that he would do it for me or whatever. But after that, like, my son, still hasn't called me or anything.

252
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that seemed like that is a concern and and occupies your mind quite a bit.

253
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.060
Adam: Yeah, well, I know there. Okay, I can still put okay just

254
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.980
Adam: I hate not talking to them for this long. Yeah.

255
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:42.390
Adam: Because it's ready been like, about two weeks or something, since I last talked to them.

256
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a way to write a letter and that might be something to do in the evening as well and get that over to them. Maybe your mom could drop that off.

257
00:27:51.810 --> 00:28:02.100
Adam: Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure, but I didn't know if she would because like my son could read but not like that. Great. You know, I mean, so

258
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.740
Adam: I don't know if she would actually like read it to them, or even

259
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're older, you're older son could do it.

260
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.910
Yeah.

261
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.460
Adam: Yeah.

262
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:31.290
Adam: So yeah, I guess, then that could be an option to but I'm going to skin. This first I'm going to just send them over there and see what what's going on exactly in, see if I could, if she'll give

263
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.680
Adam: My mom her phone number, at least, because

264
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.230
Adam: Before that. Before I went over there. This is time like she would always

265
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:42.900
Adam: She would always text me

266
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:51.930
Adam: And give me let me have your number. You know what I mean. Like I always had remembered and just because of our boys and stuff.

267
00:28:54.210 --> 00:29:03.510
Adam: But this time I don't have the same number as I used to. So she don't even have my number in right now. Okay, and

268
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:13.110
Adam: What she knows that she could talk to me through messenger. So that's why I just don't know why she says I'm being on there or anything.

269
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And remind me how you guys. What kind of terms you guys left

270
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.100
Adam: Oh, it was bad when we, when I left him but like

271
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:32.640
Adam: A cool down for the most likely couple days or a week, almost. And then that's when she finally tried to she finally talk to me on

272
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.460
Adam: On messenger whatever in

273
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.870
Adam: It was all right, like we weren't fighting or anything.

274
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.700
Adam: So,

275
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:52.470
Adam: That's why I don't understand. Like what happened because we were we're talking fine and I was talking to my boys. I've been like video chatting with them and stuff and

276
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.470
Adam: And then all of a sudden he hasn't been on

277
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:04.680
Adam: And I know something like bad happened that her mom would get ahold of me.

278
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.050
Adam: Your mom knows, I might like they know where I'm at. And I mean, so

279
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got a pretty decent connection right now let's shift gears a little bit. I want to show you something.

280
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a little bit of time. Want to start to develop some resources for you sort of on a psychological level. These are these things in here that you see seal the blue under plan.

281
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is some stuff I'd like to do with you. I've been doing this over the last few weeks with clients in group.

282
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's come down here you see where this says protective figure and nurturing figure and wise figure

283
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants you to picture in your mind. Someone that represents real or imagine.

284
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection.

285
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be from a book. It can be from your real life. It can be from imagination or a movie or something, you read when you think of an image of a protective figure what comes to mind.

286
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay well let's let's move down. We'll come back to that one. That one's hard for you to come up with

287
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's move to a nurturing figure. When you think about someone real or imagined.

288
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the embodiment.

289
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Of nurturing what comes up to you mind.

290
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.530
Adam: I guess I would say my

291
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.770
Adam: For some reason, I think.

292
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what do you picture her doing looking like that sort of has that quintessential that perfect image of nurturing

293
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.580
Adam: I don't know that she's, she's like the only one that's

294
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:24.240
Adam: That's always there for me. No matter what I do like cuz you've been that

295
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.580
Adam: Even though I went back with my baby's mom this last time she was

296
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.290
Adam: She just

297
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:40.380
Adam: Never had anything like bad to say to me, she's just always been there tells me. Let's go to church and stuff and

298
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:47.220
Adam: And like with my mom, she always has something negative to saying to me.

299
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.590
Right, okay.

300
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we'll go with your on

301
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can picture her telling you. Let's go to church and she doesn't say anything negative

302
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she ever say anything positive

303
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.370
Adam: Yeah.

304
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you say, what's something that's sort of represents a nurturing thing she says

305
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:22.380
Adam: She's just always telling me like she just always all churches goes to church all the time. So she just always sending me like

306
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.120
Adam: Like things from the Bible, and as

307
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:29.670
Being

308
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.430
Adam: Like different, um,

309
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:42.450
Adam: I guess different pastors like she'll send me little video clips of things that she thinks that will help me like to the day. And so, okay.

310
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Did they help you

311
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.950
Adam: Yeah, okay.

312
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever do you ever see going to church or any of the sort of groups that they might offer. Do you ever see that as as a sense of

313
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Resource for yourself, where you could actually get busy kind of getting more involved there to get away from sort of the negative

314
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.670
Group of people

315
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.930
Adam: That's what kind of helped me. And then again, like when I first

316
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:22.800
Adam: When I first left or broke up into my baby's mom when I first came to my mom's house I was going to the church like every Sunday and stuff and

317
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:36.570
Adam: I just, I guess it did, it did help I guess because it just, I got a job right away and I just felt better with myself when I was going to church with her and then like after I got my job.

318
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.920
Adam: I worked every Sunday, pretty much, so

319
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.600
Adam: I

320
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.030
Adam: I

321
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.870
Adam: stopped going to church with her and

322
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.790
Adam: I was working. So like my mind was always off everything

323
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.590
Adam: And then

324
00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:01.440
Adam: Now, like now I can just that I'm not work working or anything.

325
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.660
Adam: I think it will be

326
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.590
Adam: Good for me to start going backwards.

327
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or yeah, and kind of do to me remember you felt better.

328
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to hear something positive and inspiring. It gets you out of this negative thinking we spend too much time there. That's what you're reinforcing

329
00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to get you into some positive thoughts and then we're reinforcing those that's just brain chemistry.

330
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you're monitoring in your mind, which means thinking about you're reinforcing you're literally deepening

331
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The synaptic groups. We want to get your mind thinking elsewhere. We don't want it on the substances. We don't want it on negative thinking we want you literally actively thinking about other things because it gets reinforced.

332
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I love that idea.

333
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.720
So,

334
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.310
Adam: I'm actually supposed to go through this Sunday.

335
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.100
Adam: Made a plan for us for her to pick me up.

336
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.460
Adam: Right now, she's just waiting for me. I'm gonna go with her.

337
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How about I follow up with you to see if you do go. Sometimes it's nice to have a little nudge. See if you go on Sunday, February 2

338
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So today, follow up with her, you're going to be with her. Anyway, today you can work out arrived.

339
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.620
Yeah.

340
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.450
Adam: Okay.

341
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Let's talk a little bit about when we're meeting again.

342
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.880
Adam: Let me see. I think it's on the third act.

343
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.530
Adam: So,

344
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.550
Adam: Okay, so this is on Wednesday.

345
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so right now. No.

346
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not every third is Monday.

347
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:56.430
Adam: Every Monday. Okay, well then, yeah, that's when you told me, February 3 at 10 o'clock.

348
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I have it. Yeah, I see it.

349
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You got. I got you right there. That's beautiful. We're good to go. Okay, you're set there. And so what I would just to review what we talked about. We talked about was

350
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Coloring

351
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: finding out about data plan on the phone and making sure you're prioritizing right you've got it, because that's like having

352
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: A car to get to treatment like you've got to be able to have that that Wi Fi or internet connection in order to get write the prescription for the Suboxone so that's a real serious priority.

353
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but right along that line is doing the things that make you feel good and strong. So making plans with your on today, getting a little bit of money, throwing it towards your mom, making sure you're saving some for your data plan like don't forget about that part.

354
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:51.390
Yeah.

355
00:37:52.650 --> 00:38:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got also talking with this friend of yours right learning about the GED. You've got getting this phone number over to your children's mothers, so that, you know, there can be contact. You've got a lot to do.

356
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

357
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and hopefully you'll get like an interview set up with surf. Okay, that sounds ideal.

358
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:26.280
Adam: Yeah, I hope I just wonder, should I read this one is a job because that's just it just takes up my time to think of stuff. Plus, I'm making money so

359
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're, you're making it happen. Adam You're making it happen. But in the meantime, keeping your mind busy, it's going to be pretty important. So plans with your brother.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there. And if you end up having to change it because you get a job. So be it, but at least you're getting proactive with the planning.

362
00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.370
