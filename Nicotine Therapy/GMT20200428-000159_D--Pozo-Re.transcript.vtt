1
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.250
Dominique Pozo: Hi, can you hear me.

2
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.780
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

3
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.040
Great.

4
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.530
Dominique Pozo: How's it going,

5
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.410
Martin Price: Not too bad kind of switched from

6
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.290
Martin Price: Like the title was a

7
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.980
Martin Price: relapse prevention group or something like that, then it switched to her thing, so I thought maybe they gave me the wrong number. But it didn't.

8
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Oh. Oh.

9
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.050
Martin Price: It's just the same number every week or I

10
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.300
Martin Price: Mean I know I can admit the clinic, but

11
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, no, this isn't the same number. Sometimes, sometimes I use this room today. I did but it typically changes every, every week.

12
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.920
Martin Price: Okay. All right.

13
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. So how are you doing

14
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.830
Martin Price: Thanks. You're going better. I'm not beat myself up as much and

15
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.180
Oh, great.

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.420
Martin Price: I don't know, I, my house refinance went through and so that'll help me pay tax bills and get

17
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.270
Martin Price: You know, a lot of debt paid off and everything. It's I'm just kind of

18
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:42.690
Martin Price: It's just kind of ridiculous. I'm 60 years old and I'm kind of starting all over again. But, you know, certainly don't have any savings. Yeah, so about half a Bitcoin so

19
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.480
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean I work and work and work on that, you know, the negative voice that we talked about last week, and it

20
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.470
Martin Price: I think I guess, for the most part, I'm just like down on myself for you know squandering so much money in

21
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.390
Mm hmm.

22
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.320
Martin Price: I mean, I didn't squander it all out of it was from my daughter's treatment center but

23
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.830
Martin Price: You know, I just

24
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.020
Martin Price: spent money as if I was still making it, I guess, you know, and I wasn't

25
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.360
Martin Price: And

26
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.500
Martin Price: I just like

27
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.490
Martin Price: Living with my daughter, who has schizophrenia is

28
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.660
Martin Price: It's really hard and I kind of realized that I don't know if I'm

29
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.260
Martin Price: Anybody who I was married to hit

30
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.930
Martin Price: Like wrote it out with with that with her in the house, you know,

31
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.130
Martin Price: It was just

32
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.050
Martin Price: difficult situation so

33
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.830
Mm hmm.

34
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.980
Martin Price: And that helps me forgive you know

35
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.790
Martin Price: Because it's just the circumstances.

36
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.480
Dominique Pozo: Are you open to a reflection from me.

37
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.800
Yeah, sure.

38
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:26.490
Dominique Pozo: When I heard when you initially started the session and said, it's just ridiculous that I'm 60 years old and kind of starting over again. I, I was wondering if Oh is that his dad's voice again kind of shaming him or or

39
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160
Martin Price: But I mean, it's the truth, but it's

40
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.050
Martin Price: It's not helping me to keep beating myself up about it.

41
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.170
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I hear I hear kind of maybe the disappointment and grief around recognizing where you're at, at this point, and

42
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.460
Martin Price: Financially, and

43
00:03:48.150 --> 00:04:03.300
Dominique Pozo: I think hearing, hearing you kind of judge yourself as it's ridiculous that it's like I like my whole being went out, like, you know, to just hear you know I think it's more self talk. I'm just reflecting back which you're probably

44
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.970
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

45
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.250
Martin Price: It's just built into me. I don't

46
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.750
Martin Price: Know why just like this.

47
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.130
Martin Price: Lack of self love and self acceptance.

48
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.320
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think.

49
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:41.490
Dominique Pozo: You know, to, to maybe move it in to not deny that that's what you're thinking. But maybe to move it into a more generative space my invitation is to think of, okay, you're having this thought because you need blank so

50
00:04:42.840 --> 00:05:00.060
Dominique Pozo: Would it be helpful if I pulled up a list of some universal needs, like many needs and you can because that's, that's actually how in compassionate communication, whether it's to another or communicating to self. That's what we do when we have a kind of a, what's the word I'm

51
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:15.300
Dominique Pozo: Like a complaint about someone or something, then it's really looking deeper at okay that's coming up, because there's these needs that are not being met. So I'm going to pull up the needs chart here.

52
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.250
Dominique Pozo: So what I heard you say was, it's ridiculous that you are

53
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:31.320
Dominique Pozo: At 60 year in this financial predicament. And I'm thinking, okay, he's judging it as ridiculous because he has certain needs. So let's see.

54
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.260
Dominique Pozo: That maybe aren't being fully met

55
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.260
Dominique Pozo: By himself.

56
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.750
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

57
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.250
Dominique Pozo: So, so think of that statement, you know, that is what you said and kind of the disappointment that you're may be experiencing in yourself and then

58
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:19.560
Dominique Pozo: This is where the empathy comes in. So, okay, I'm feeling this way because here's some needs. I have. So see, maybe if you want to get a pen and we're going to do something. It's called mind mapping. So if you want to get a blank piece of paper and

59
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:35.190
Dominique Pozo: The slice that piece of paper with the pen and hash mark into four quadrants. So you have the space to do to really give room for, for sure. Let's start with four. Maybe we'll do eight. But let's start with four

60
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.920
Martin Price: And then what

61
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:54.360
Dominique Pozo: So choose for for needs. So when you think about where you want to be at this point in your life and you're not there, financially, it's because you need what and choose for these words.

62
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.040
Dominique Pozo: And we can choose more if more of them resonate. Let's just start with four

63
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.830
Martin Price: quadrants.

64
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.530
Dominique Pozo: Yes, in the middle in the center of the quadrant.

65
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.920
Martin Price: Choose them all.

66
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.830
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, they're all so important. Right.

67
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.640
Dominique Pozo: And we can do more with these words, for sure. Let's just start here.

68
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.150
Martin Price: Okay.

69
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.330
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so, which ones did you choose.

70
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:05.010
Martin Price: Anything to do with the money, but I just chose six acceptance affection companionship and nurturing

71
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.630
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. That's a great place to start. So acceptance nurturing companionship and what was the other one.

72
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:24.900
Dominique Pozo: Affection affection. Okay. So have you ever done mind mapping where you start with one word and then you don't even think you just make like a little hash mark and whatever, like say say

73
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.450
Dominique Pozo: I'll give you an example with another word like beauty for me. Okay. So say I have beauty in the center of the paper.

74
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.130
Dominique Pozo: I'll do a hash mark and I'll put flowers and I'll put garden, and I'll put sunshine.

75
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:49.710
Dominique Pozo: Then I'll put warmth and I'll put embrace and you just like you kind of let your mind. Loosen with what the associations are to certain words. And let me show you on a piece of paper to what it would look like. So when you've

76
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.900
Dominique Pozo: Got a blank piece of paper.

77
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.050
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

78
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.860
Dominique Pozo: So what did I say beauty. Okay so beauty. So flower.

79
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.050
Dominique Pozo: Garden.

80
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.840
Dominique Pozo: Sunshine.

81
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.940
Dominique Pozo: So here's just a very brief example here. Can you see what I've done so.

82
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.380
Martin Price: Okay.

83
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.780
Martin Price: Just start with one of these words.

84
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:54.180
Dominique Pozo: Gosh. Alright, so sorry, Martin. I don't know what happened. I just got completely bumped off.

85
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.960
Martin Price: Yeah, I think it's like we lost her internet connection or something.

86
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:08.940
Dominique Pozo: Totally so. Okay. Did you get the gist of it. So you're, you're basically letting your mind go from the, the original word and just let the different associations happen and

87
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.730
Dominique Pozo: You fall, you can

88
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.220
Dominique Pozo: Fill that those squares up so just let your mind really go

89
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.530
Dominique Pozo: Does that make sense.

90
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.070
Martin Price: Like I just said you

91
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.310
Dominique Pozo: Know, I can't, a little bit. Okay.

92
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.620
Dominique Pozo: So,

93
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:41.790
Dominique Pozo: nurturing, caring supporting helping yeah and keep keep going with that. Like maybe go off of support and see what comes and then helping and it's going to end up looking like this. This

94
00:12:42.390 --> 00:13:00.540
Dominique Pozo: spider web almost, you know, with all these lines and marks and really let your mind be loose, even if it's something strange like maybe you helped some work. And so from helping you put her name and then maybe her name reminds you of something, whatever comes

95
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.330
Martin Price: Up the words that you like I would start coming off of these other words I put on here. You mean

96
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.990
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Wherever you feel moved whatever wherever you see a word that's really alive for you that like

97
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:21.870
Dominique Pozo: stirs up other thoughts or memories. Just keep keep kind of drawing from those

98
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.390
Martin Price: Like when I look at it, it's

99
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.790
Martin Price: It's like I'm looking for someone to take care of me.

100
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.190
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

101
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.080
Martin Price: I guess I feel like I'm

102
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.620
Martin Price: You know, I'm like in those mindsets, where

103
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.840
Martin Price: You know, you're not going to get any help from anybody else. And everybody is like just

104
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.030
Martin Price: wants money and or wants something from you and

105
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.320
Martin Price: And yet, like deep down what I'm looking for somebody to support and help me, which was

106
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.220
Martin Price: Like today. It was pretty amazing that this

107
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.830
Martin Price: My virtual girlfriend or whatever went and looked at a place in Janesville for me.

108
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.210
Dominique Pozo: Oh,

109
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.510
Martin Price: Uh huh. That was really nice of her. You know,

110
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.210
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's it. Was it hard to receive

111
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:48.570
Martin Price: Um, you know, like a part of me is like, Oh my God, she's like so aggressive, you know, and then it's like I build so many

112
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.570
Martin Price: Negative things into what people say or do.

113
00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:00.330
Martin Price: You know the event or that I'm not worthy of it or

114
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.250
Martin Price: You know,

115
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.440
Martin Price: That's like a pretty forward thing to do or something.

116
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.900
Dominique Pozo: So there is a there is a judgment there cost was that, do you think that was your dad's voice again.

117
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.960
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like here's somebody like she's

118
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:24.780
Martin Price: Come across like just, you know, say like out of the blue. I really like you. And, you know,

119
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:34.380
Martin Price: Maybe if things work out. I can stay at your place every other week and things like that. And then, you know, instead of

120
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.120
Martin Price: I mean, I was happy about that. It was just kind of funny because it

121
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:59.490
Martin Price: Like I was climbing up the ski hill and just, I don't know. We hadn't talked or something. And I was, I was probably feeling kind of down or something and then I got to the top and you know I finally had signal. And she said, this really

122
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.090
Martin Price: You know she kind of busted a move or whatever is they say, well,

123
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.680
Martin Price: You won't just have weekends I have every other week off and I'd like to, you know,

124
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.720
Martin Price: Be with you and everything and we haven't met yet.

125
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.490
Martin Price: And

126
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.640
Dominique Pozo: Oh wait, I don't understand that you were up ski mountain with her.

127
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:37.650
Martin Price: No, I, I was climbing to the top of the ski hill and like you get to the top and you're just really tired and I just kind of felt rejected and then all of a sudden I read that and it was like

128
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.180
Martin Price: Oh wow, this is awesome. You know, here's somebody who really wants to be with you and

129
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.730
Martin Price: Yeah, and I guess I'm really, I'm kind of looking for someone

130
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:58.680
Martin Price: I'm like, I'm, I'm kind of jaded by I'm looking for someone and wants to, like, take care of me or help me to it just feels like

131
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.470
Martin Price: I've spent my whole adult life doing that with, you know, trying to help women at at least financially and

132
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.700
Martin Price: She's not rich by any means, but she seems like she's very caring, you know, and wants to help

133
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:29.010
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like a big opportunity to let something new in where you're actually been supported as well. It's there's a reciprocity happening. You're not. You're not the hero and the rescuer all the time.

134
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:36.720
Martin Price: Yeah, I kind of felt like that, and especially my second marriage. I just was always like bending over backwards. It seemed to help

135
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:51.120
Martin Price: move her chair like throwing out my back and just like I was always, I don't know how I always felt like I was like the Savior person or I just had to be the go to guy that was going to

136
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.190
Martin Price: Make sure everything happened, you know,

137
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.270
Martin Price: And I talked to my sponsor back in

138
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:08.220
Martin Price: Janesville today and we're both kind of out of a construction background and it's just

139
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:25.530
Martin Price: You know, it's just kind of like this mindset where if you don't do it, it won't get done and like this movie will turn into a just a big shit show or, you know, it's like you have to be the guy that steps up and makes it all work and makes it all happen.

140
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.150
Martin Price: And

141
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.070
Dominique Pozo: A big

142
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:44.490
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like it's a big paradigm shift where you've been doing the kind of work that you've been involved in a the reality that you've had. It's like you're, you've got to take

143
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.070
Dominique Pozo: Or do. You've got to make things happen you know maybe being invited to relax into receiving a bit

144
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.680
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like

145
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.380
Martin Price: I could. Um, I almost can't even imagine someone else like taking care of me, you know,

146
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:11.430
Dominique Pozo: We'll take a moment. Imagine that. What does it feel like, close your eyes. Close your eyes. I'm going to paint a picture. So what's this woman's name.

147
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.020
Martin Price: April.

148
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.320
Dominique Pozo: April. Okay. So imagine that

149
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.190
Be

150
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.100
Martin Price: It's a

151
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.560
Martin Price: It's a real

152
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.160
Dominique Pozo: Have you, I just want to know, Have you met her yet or

153
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:37.470
Martin Price: No, it's all been on like checks and we haven't even done a zoom meeting, like we're scared to because yeah ray that will there'll be some turn off or something, you know,

154
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.210
Dominique Pozo: Oh, so you haven't even seen her yet.

155
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.300
Martin Price: Yeah, I just photos and stuff.

156
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

157
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.020
Martin Price: Okay, I haven't seen her in person. Okay.

158
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.570
Dominique Pozo: Well, just imagine, whether it's April or another woman that you really are into

159
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.410
Dominique Pozo: Imagine that she actually

160
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:02.130
Dominique Pozo: She made dinner for you. You come you come back, you've been working or you've won out for you know you went up the mountain.

161
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:09.930
Dominique Pozo: And if you can close your eyes and really visionless, you know, then this person has they've made food for you and

162
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:21.810
Dominique Pozo: They've actually also run a bath for you. They want to offer you some something to so that you can take care of yourself. So after either this long day at work or using your body physically

163
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:30.570
Dominique Pozo: You know, you can get in the bath. Well, they finished dinner and they're actually nurturing you and just let yourself. Imagine you know what does that feel like

164
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.010
Dominique Pozo: In your body and your emotional body.

165
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.390
Martin Price: I have a hard time even connecting with it, you know, or even imagining it.

166
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.580
Dominique Pozo: So you can't imagine that

167
00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:01.650
Martin Price: Like, I remember. Towards the end of my second marriage like things are getting really rocky and Pam would do.

168
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:09.750
Martin Price: Things every once in a while when she was trying to, like, I guess, smooth things over like help me fold my laundry or

169
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.620
Martin Price: You know, make a nice dinner.

170
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.810
Martin Price: Thing in it.

171
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.740
Martin Price: I was

172
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.700
Martin Price: Like really, I was grateful for it, but

173
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.290
Martin Price: It never seemed like it was going to be

174
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:35.520
Martin Price: Constant or anything. It just seemed like it was kind of a one off or something.

175
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.210
Dominique Pozo: So it's hard to imagine

176
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.760
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

177
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.800
Dominique Pozo: Have you did. Did your mother was she nurturing to

178
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.990
Martin Price: She had kind of a hard time because like my dad was like, I'm sure that alcoholic tyrant and

179
00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:02.820
Martin Price: And I was like, kind of an unplanned kid and I was way younger than my oldest I was at home alone.

180
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:17.160
Martin Price: As my mom and dad were older and anyway, he just he wanted all of my mom's attention when he got home and she would kind of rat out what all the kids have done that day. You know, so you'd have this kind of

181
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.980
Martin Price: Somewhat nurturing mom during the day when dad was gone. And then my dad came back home. She

182
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.680
Martin Price: switched sides and was

183
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:26.730
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

184
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.160
Martin Price: You know, had to follow his well

185
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:39.390
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Um, I mean what's coming to mind when I hear this is I'm wondering if you've ever really had an experience of being nurtured.

186
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:46.350
Dominique Pozo: Sufficiently where you can you can let it happen.

187
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:54.120
Dominique Pozo: If you haven't, you know, if you've never had it. You don't even I'm hearing you might not know what it's even like. So how can you even imagine.

188
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.950
Martin Price: Oh I all I know is how to try and do like special things for

189
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.420
Martin Price: Women, or people you know it's usually most money.

190
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:10.260
Dominique Pozo: Well, this. I'm just going to say take it with a grain of salt, but it, it kind of makes me think of, you know,

191
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:18.270
Dominique Pozo: The behavior of a child in an alcoholic family of just wanting to please everyone, so that things are okay, whether it's

192
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.740
Dominique Pozo: Pleasing mom so

193
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:27.660
Dominique Pozo: That she can keep loving you, because things are kind of on edge with that already, and not upsetting dad so no one gets yelled at, or hit and

194
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:37.200
Dominique Pozo: I think this is really, it's the seems like it's old old material to work where

195
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.640
Martin Price: It is

196
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.350
Martin Price: And it's he was just very critical, you know, and like

197
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:51.090
Martin Price: You know, my mom would promise you do this or that for us. And then he would like, shut it all down, you know, and

198
00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:03.150
Martin Price: I don't know if I got like a sense of it. They ended men or something. But I just always yeah I guess I've always felt like I've had to be like this. People pleasers.

199
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:11.610
Martin Price: And then this the last year that relationship with Michelle was just a disaster. You know, because

200
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:24.390
Martin Price: She recognized that in me and then so she would just start reading more stories about how difficult dire straits were, you know, and

201
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.990
Dominique Pozo: Sounds. It sounds very manipulative to me.

202
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.020
Martin Price: Yeah, she just wanted more money and

203
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.010
Martin Price: And then April just seems really

204
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.930
Martin Price: Just seems carry you know

205
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:56.250
Dominique Pozo: So, this is this is this to me, speaks to health that you're actually opening up to a different experience something that may not be familiar and something that is, you know, connected to your needs to be nurtured.

206
00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:02.010
Martin Price: Yeah, I definitely like have a hard time feeling like I deserve it or anything, you know,

207
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. So that seems like a big piece to work on.

208
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:21.870
Martin Price: I care about these people like they talk about, you know, in group with the one lady out her boyfriend or whatever it takes care of her, and the husband takes care of her. And it's like, wow, you know, it just sounds so idyllic you know

209
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.390
Dominique Pozo: Who this is in group.

210
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.100
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

211
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.980
Martin Price: Hmm, Angelica Angelica,

212
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.810
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Okay, well, so what about that is appealing to you.

213
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.310
Martin Price: Somebody loves you and cares about you, you know,

214
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.240
Mm hmm.

215
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.980
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds like you're open to the possibility of this with April.

216
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:53.730
Martin Price: If I am I just, you know, it's very hard to accept as real, I guess you'd say,

217
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.610
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

218
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.200
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to keep working with

219
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.960
Dominique Pozo: It's what you want. Yeah.

220
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Yeah. And I think if anything gets in the way of you receiving. It's the self worth piece.

221
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.400
Martin Price: Yeah, just like

222
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.470
Martin Price: You know,

223
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.740
Martin Price: I'd be cynical about it or

224
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.270
Martin Price: Hmm, you know,

225
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.890
Martin Price: Nobody would ever do that for you, you know,

226
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:30.180
Martin Price: I mean, that was pretty nice. We like drove an hour to go check this place out

227
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:43.080
Dominique Pozo: I almost want to do a little more empty chair around that cynical voice that says, you know, no one would do that for you.

228
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.100
Dominique Pozo: But that's the whole process. What do you, what, what would you what

229
00:26:51.210 --> 00:27:02.730
Dominique Pozo: What would serve you most to keep maybe just sticking on this dialogue that we're having or move to the words again or do an empty chair piece around this voice that says, no one would do that for you.

230
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.290
Martin Price: Probably the thing I want to do least

231
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.670
Dominique Pozo: Which is which one

232
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.020
Martin Price: Yes.

233
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.850
Martin Price: The chair. Yes.

234
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.010
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's do it. Martin.

235
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.310
Dominique Pozo: So there's a few options.

236
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.630
Dominique Pozo: You can be that voice of, you know,

237
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:34.800
Dominique Pozo: No one's going to do that for you or who's good who would do that for you. And you can become that voice and I can role play as you

238
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:45.720
Dominique Pozo: Or you can imagine that voice in a chair. Just imagine that the critics there and you can speak to it and then start to kind of reverse roles or

239
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.130
Martin Price: I do the previous one.

240
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.870
Dominique Pozo: You want to be the voice.

241
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.240
Martin Price: Well, I like the idea of you.

242
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.240
Martin Price: Taking on one of the roles.

243
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.790
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Okay, so why don't

244
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:03.030
Dominique Pozo: Why don't you be that voice. And I'm going to just be Martin. I'm going to be you the full Marty, who's here right now.

245
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:13.440
Dominique Pozo: Who's been sharing this whole time and you if you can extract yourself and maybe sit in another chair and become that critical voice that says, you know, who would do that for you know it's going to do that for you.

246
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:22.230
Dominique Pozo: And just keep going, just, you know, Lay it on me give you say all the things you want to say, and I'm gonna do my best to engage with it.

247
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.920
Martin Price: Using you and she's just trying to be nice to you right now and

248
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.230
Martin Price: Last, and why would you think that somebody would love you and want to take care of you and

249
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.120
Martin Price: You know,

250
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.710
Martin Price: You can eat the only person you can depend on is yourself.

251
00:28:51.120 --> 00:29:00.900
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm ready to open up and I'm hearing a lot of concern on your end, I hear that and I'm listening. I also hear fear.

252
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.100
Dominique Pozo: And wondering what you're afraid of

253
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.270
Dominique Pozo: I'm talking to the critic.

254
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.710
Yeah.

255
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:22.320
Martin Price: And I mean, just to give you some background he that's like the way he was raised, you know, he his dad laughed and his mom.

256
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.290
Martin Price: Like

257
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.190
Martin Price: He had to become the man of the household or whatever. At age.

258
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:34.560
Martin Price: 10 or 12 and then she remarried and they sent him off to military school and

259
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.160
Martin Price: So I think that's why he

260
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.030
Martin Price: Had the attitude he did, you know,

261
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:50.280
Dominique Pozo: And that's so much information mighty about how you know having empathy for your dad like look where he came from. He couldn't trust.

262
00:29:50.700 --> 00:30:00.720
Dominique Pozo: People, his father, like the one the, you know, the king of the house left and how, how could we, how could one trust anyone that came leads you know it's like oh my gosh

263
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:11.160
Dominique Pozo: Who's gonna hold this up. Okay. I guess I have to, I don't know how to do this. And a lot of fighter flight I imagine you know a lot of being in a survival mode.

264
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.270
Martin Price: Yeah, and I think I just left him.

265
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:20.640
Martin Price: So like he idolized my mom and she was like this kind of pious

266
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:36.600
Martin Price: You know, really into the environment and like a mushroom hunter and she was, you know, tried to round us all up and get us go to church and nobody wanted to and especially my dad and

267
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.760
Martin Price: Yeah, he would just come home and

268
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:53.340
Martin Price: Like we would all flee and he would sit in this chair upstairs and smoke. These filter list pall malls and pound down like whiskey sours you know

269
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.450
Martin Price: Well, and

270
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.960
Martin Price: Yeah, and so he just

271
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.380
Martin Price: He was just super critical

272
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.300
And it

273
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.910
Martin Price: And so when times get rough for me like

274
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.700
Martin Price: I went for a long time.

275
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:30.930
Martin Price: Yeah, I'd like 16 years of clean time and everything, everything was going well as married making a lot of money and I just don't remember being all that bothered by this voice, you know, then when the shit hits the fan and you know you get divorced lose your job.

276
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.540
Martin Price: Better get schizophrenia, you know,

277
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.360
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's a lot compounded

278
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:45.270
Martin Price: Yeah. And then I think like last year, I tried to, like, I really did care about Michelle and I was really trying to take care of her, you know, and show her that

279
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:47.460
Martin Price: There is

280
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.080
Martin Price: You know this possibility of having someone who really

281
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.520
Martin Price: Cares about

282
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.070
Martin Price: Riley.

283
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.320
Dominique Pozo: I don't know. Hi. I were in a private session. I don't know how you got this number I'm

284
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.250
Dominique Pozo: Going to remove you okay

285
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.630
Martin Price: Guess I forget what I've seen now.

286
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.420
Dominique Pozo: Well, you said you were taking care of Michelle, and I'm trying to call

287
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:24.720
Martin Price: Yeah, like I was trying to show her that you know it cuz she said she'd been beaten intermarriage and she left with the clothes on her back and all that.

288
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:40.950
Martin Price: And so I was trying to show her that, you know, there was good people, good man left in the world. And you know, I really made the effort to start taking care of her, but it just to her. It turned into like this.

289
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.400
Martin Price: You know, I just want more and more and more. You know, it's just ever

290
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.600
Martin Price: Saw does anything that that

291
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.450
Martin Price: I don't think I don't know.

292
00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:00.540
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's go back to you. So I mean, something that I'm seeing could be very more

293
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:18.840
Dominique Pozo: separate yourself from your dad, you know, and really continue this is going to be like a constant prayer to yourself like I am me. That's my dad. He is not me. This is, you know, we are two separate people we've had two separate experiences and

294
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:32.820
Dominique Pozo: And continuing to you know get clear and refined well who am I, you know, who is Marty and, you know, remembering where do I come from. What had I had, where do I want to go all the thing

295
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:42.870
Martin Price: A big part of me swung in the absolute other direction, you know, and I just was not much of a disciplinary and with my kids or my dogs and I

296
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:55.920
Martin Price: You know, I was normally the one do well. I was always the one to apologize, like in my second marriage that's just what I did. You know, I didn't want to. I hated

297
00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.250
Martin Price: I hated it. When we got in a fight, you know, and so I just would always apologize and

298
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.510
Dominique Pozo: What just happened.

299
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.980
Martin Price: I was trying to figure out where I was going with all that it just

300
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:22.620
Martin Price: It.

301
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:38.160
Martin Price: Yeah, it just seems like someone who didn't believe they're worthy of love isn't good enough, have the confidence to like stand up to his wife and

302
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.890
Martin Price: You know cuz then when I started doing that towards the end she like

303
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:50.220
Martin Price: She couldn't handle it at all. You know, so I hadn't been that way for like

304
00:34:51.300 --> 00:35:00.870
Martin Price: You know 16 years and then all of a sudden I started taking all the therapists advice and started standing up for myself that didn't go over very well.

305
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.500
Martin Price: She said she didn't deserve to be treated like that.

306
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.180
Dominique Pozo: I wonder if it was the delivery, you know, because I

307
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:20.010
Martin Price: Was in a therapy session. I mean the guy said I was being very civil about it, but she just made up her mind that

308
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.680
Martin Price: I know I think she just made up her mind that

309
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:36.780
Martin Price: It was either her or my daughter and that she was going to move out and wait for me to go get help and turn out the way she wanted me to be, you know,

310
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:37.950
Dominique Pozo: What this

311
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.330
Martin Price: Was your plan.

312
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.210
Martin Price: And

313
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:49.620
Martin Price: You know that's didn't go that way I was. I just felt like she could at least

314
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:55.980
Martin Price: Said, Okay, well, I know I have issues to or something that weren't with her was just all

315
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.170
Martin Price: I was the I was totally in the wrong and she wasn't

316
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.650
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds to me that

317
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:16.350
Dominique Pozo: It may be have been in your best to not still be in this relationship because it doesn't sound very supportive to helping you break these patterns.

318
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.390
Martin Price: And, but, I mean,

319
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.720
Martin Price: It was a really difficult situation that

320
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:28.950
Martin Price: Work having a kid with schizophrenia, just if it's not your kid it's practically impossible to live with them, you know,

321
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.800
Martin Price: Yeah, so I got that part.

322
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.310
Dominique Pozo: So let's keep. Let's go back to the empty chair work.

323
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.930
Dominique Pozo: Are there any last things you have to say critic before we

324
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:59.550
Martin Price: End. You need to get out this stupid buprenorphine and get your shit together and stop being such a victim and

325
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.090
Martin Price: You know,

326
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.940
Martin Price: If you want any semblance of a normal life. You need to like

327
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.820
Martin Price: Stop taking buprenorphine and

328
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.900
Martin Price: So that you can work or something.

329
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.150
Martin Price: More clear headed

330
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:34.290
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean I really see and get how much you're looking after me. So I appreciate that and

331
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:47.100
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm playing, I'm playing your role. So I'm wondering when that voice says that, what do you, I'm going to pull up the needs chart again. What do you think that voice is really like what do they want for you.

332
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:56.100
Dominique Pozo: When you, when they say you know you need to get off the buprenorphine get clear headed and what is it that they, what's the need their

333
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.290
Martin Price: Name to me. I

334
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.400
Martin Price: Think that that's like tough love you know that

335
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.140
Martin Price: Is actually really trying to help.

336
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.580
Dominique Pozo: Because what did they, what does he want you to have to look on this list. And if you can name two things. What

337
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.280
Dominique Pozo: What does he want you to have

338
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.530
Martin Price: Honesty like authenticity integrity and presence.

339
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.060
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

340
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.230
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's see Mike really valuable things so

341
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:44.580
Dominique Pozo: And that's what the critic wants for you. How do you see yourself getting to this place.

342
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:53.340
Martin Price: To keep trying to taper. I mean, I have cut back and I think I can keep doing it.

343
00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.770
Martin Price: I'm running at a super high dose. I don't really feel like I'm

344
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.860
Martin Price: Muddle headed except for sometimes in the morning. I feel kind of like hung over something

345
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:05.610
Uh huh.

346
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.140
Martin Price: But

347
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:19.170
Martin Price: You know, I worry that if they if and when they ever start drug testing where I work. We turn into an issue. I don't know if it were no

348
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:29.310
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. I mean two things that I'm hearing that, you know, you're needing this maybe some patients, you know, the tapering process doesn't happen overnight.

349
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:41.610
Dominique Pozo: So some patience with yourself and then to be understood, you know, under to to be heard by this critical voice around what's important to you to, you know,

350
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.060
Martin Price: I mean I feel like I'm functioning pretty well.

351
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:09.810
Martin Price: That's important to me. Uh huh. I don't feel like I'm being like

352
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.540
Martin Price: Some out of control addict or something. I feel like I'm trying to be responsible and

353
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:21.810
Martin Price: Keep limiting my dose and trying to ratchet it down.

354
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.650
Martin Price: Which I've found it's pretty hard to do when you're alone and working

355
00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.260
Martin Price: You know, it just to tell you the truth it

356
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.180
Martin Price: It definitely helps the physical pain, but it just don't also

357
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:46.740
Martin Price: Kind of motivates me or for some reason. That's just what it does to me. It makes me want to get work done.

358
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.820
Martin Price: So that's when I sort of like gravitate to it.

359
00:40:53.850 --> 00:41:07.200
Dominique Pozo: I something I'm hearing is acknowledgment, you need some acknowledgement about what you are doing, you know, it's easy to pick apart all the things you're not doing. And I'm wondering, did your dad. Was it hard for him to give you praise or any of the

360
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.690
Martin Price: It was the bar would always be raised.

361
00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:10.440
Martin Price: Yeah.

362
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:21.000
Dominique Pozo: So this is, this is so I mean you probably already aware of this, but it's coming out so clearly that you know this. You really swallowed so much of your dad and

363
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:27.870
Dominique Pozo: And what you are needing with some acknowledgement. So at this point, your dad's not going to be giving it to you unless he's still alive. I don't think he is.

364
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.970
Martin Price: He died a long time ago.

365
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.080
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so

366
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:39.870
Martin Price: My brother scan that he's like pretty shut down to, because just pretty and but he's very bitter about my dad.

367
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.360
Martin Price: And yeah, it really kind of shut him down to

368
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:59.130
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it sounds like it was very damaging. So what I'm imagining is that the work for you is to keep acknowledging all that you are doing without being in denial, you know, of course, there's always work. There's work for forever.

369
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:06.960
Dominique Pozo: Yet, a big part of continuing to grow that confidence and self worth, is to acknowledge what you are doing.

370
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.160
Martin Price: And I mean I'm definitely making

371
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.580
Martin Price: Really good money and I'm saving and

372
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.660
Martin Price: You know, taking the right actions. Now to

373
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.640
Martin Price: Compensate for 2019, I guess.

374
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.760
Martin Price: It's, I don't

375
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:35.310
Martin Price: feel really good about it. But I, I, you know,

376
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:43.050
Martin Price: I definitely try and catch myself and say, Dude, you're doing, you know, the only thing that you're really

377
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:48.510
Martin Price: doing wrong is the buprenorphine. It's like everything else you're

378
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.130
Martin Price: You're trying to do your best and make everything work.

379
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.510
Dominique Pozo: Being responsible. That's something that I hear that you are

380
00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:01.650
Dominique Pozo: Actually taking responsibility for the adults in your life, you're doing it.

381
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.460
Yeah.

382
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and

383
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:15.390
Dominique Pozo: I think I'm just going to keep challenging that the buprenorphine is a bad thing. You know, this is kind of like a bridge. It's a bridge to get you from, you know, being hooked up and

384
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.590
Whatever you're

385
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:17.970
Dominique Pozo: Not

386
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:36.210
Dominique Pozo: Yet a pain pill. So this is a bridge, you know, you've got to cross it it's, I mean, as you know, with opiates. If it's and as I've witnessed. It's almost impossible to just quit quit cold turkey and not relapse pretty quickly afterwards if someone isn't doing the work you know the psychological

387
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.580
Martin Price: Thing and everything.

388
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:50.130
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, this takes time. So I'm just going to invite you to view the buprenorphine as a bridge and and check in. When you judge it as you know this this thing that you're ashamed of, or that's bad.

389
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.020
Martin Price: Well, I did see

390
00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:01.950
Martin Price: There was some girl only seen her once she had gotten down to like half a milligram every other day or something and

391
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.310
Dominique Pozo: I wonder if that was, yeah. I wonder who that was.

392
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:10.350
Martin Price: Like driving in her car and sharing in a meeting, I only saw it once, but

393
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.260
Martin Price: You know, internet.

394
00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.430
Martin Price: I think is trying

395
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.210
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, how to turn that really well. Yep. And

396
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.590
Martin Price: Then I'm like, Well, you're on only

397
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.720
Martin Price: four milligrams instead of 24 so that's good.

398
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.560
Martin Price: I just, you know, not only does it

399
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:33.750
Martin Price: Like

400
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:39.990
Martin Price: It helps with the hip and back pain, but it also just makes me feel better. I don't know.

401
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.380
Martin Price: That's it any differently than that. I like the way it makes me feel

402
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:43.920
Yeah.

403
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:48.630
Martin Price: I don't know.

404
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:56.130
Martin Price: But I, yeah, that's one of the main things I beat myself up over that and my financial predicament, and then

405
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.500
Martin Price: Just kind of trail of carnage for for the last three years, you know,

406
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.470
Martin Price: Some of it was my thoughts. I'm a bit fuzzy.

407
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:13.590
Dominique Pozo: So what I'm curious. I'm going to, I want to go back to those words. What are the three other words, can you remind me. We did the nurturing

408
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.010
Martin Price: Acceptance affection companionship and nurturing

409
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:25.830
Dominique Pozo: Can you work on acceptance, a little bit. Would you be willing to mind map a little bit on that one and see how much you can fill that quadrant.

410
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:36.840
Martin Price: Don't know what you mean by that means like, here's a little quadrant. I grew up and I put all the words in the middle of it. I don't think that's what you meant.

411
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:52.560
Dominique Pozo: I meant, excuse me, I meant put one word in the middle of each quadrant. So you have that space like you've got a whole quarter of the page devoted to acceptance and you have a whole quarter of the page devoted to nurturing and, you know, does that make sense.

412
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.030
Martin Price: So like pretty accepting cheer and nurturing. There are, you probably can't see.

413
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.110
Dominique Pozo: It. Yeah.

414
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.750
Martin Price: Acceptance here and nurturing over there.

415
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:08.100
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Pardon me. I meant the middle. I meant one word per quadrant in the middle of that particular quarter of the page. Yeah.

416
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.500
Dominique Pozo: And yeah, and really, if you can fill up for the one

417
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.280
Dominique Pozo: That goes to the acceptance, because it seems like that's a lot of what you're touching

418
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.310
Martin Price: That come to mind.

419
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.350
Dominique Pozo: Can you see me.

420
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:09.510
Martin Price: I can hear you now.

421
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:17.040
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I don't know what's going on, but we we only have about five minutes left, so I'm just going to leave my my video off.

422
00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.960
Dominique Pozo: So, so how did that go with the acceptance.

423
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:31.500
Martin Price: One branch, it kind of went to like self praise and self love and another branch was like

424
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.330
Martin Price: Loved by someone else and cared for by someone else.

425
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:40.350
Martin Price: It's kind of like

426
00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.810
Martin Price: I guess I only feel

427
00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:48.960
Martin Price: Like I'm worthy if someone else is like loving being caring for me.

428
00:48:52.020 --> 00:49:01.020
Dominique Pozo: Well that makes me think, and tell me how this lands for you. It may not be accurate, but it just makes me think that there's still a very young part that

429
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:10.170
Dominique Pozo: Is needing to believe that they are worthy and you, you know, you seem to be reaching to someone else and that's what kids do. That's what children do.

430
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.520
Dominique Pozo: So, you know, this is the word

431
00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:15.990
Martin Price: To validate you

432
00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:29.340
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. And this is, this is what working with the inner child is all about. It's like, yes, it is. We are we are interdependent beings, we are relational by nature yet.

433
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:34.650
Dominique Pozo: In the end, it's like we I think we got to learn how to do this for ourselves. And then when

434
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:50.520
Dominique Pozo: Someone else does it, it's like that's icing on the cake. That's great. That feels good. But at this point, as an adult, it's like really learning how to do it in it, then you're doing it you know you're you are here showing up to work on that self worth piece.

435
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.460
Martin Price: Yeah, I've done a lot of work on it. It's

436
00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.930
Martin Price: It's really hard.

437
00:49:55.350 --> 00:50:00.240
Martin Price: Yeah, just like, for some reason, it just gets ingrained in you and then it's

438
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.580
Martin Price: It's like just party or programming or something.

439
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:15.300
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's what it is they're neural pathways. I mean, you're totally naming it their pathways in the brain that have been carved out from a young age, and they're so deep. They're like,

440
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:27.750
Dominique Pozo: You know, they're like the house that Canyon under the house bridge, they're deep. And so it's making new ones as the hard work and they don't start that deep. At first, they are like little Arroyo's that

441
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:34.860
Dominique Pozo: That are beginning to form and it takes time for them to become those deep pathways that is the first go to

442
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:35.700
Martin Price: Yeah.

443
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:36.600
You know,

444
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.140
Martin Price: Yeah, I can see that it's just

445
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:55.110
Martin Price: You know, I probably maybe I should have abstained from trying to find a girlfriend back in Janesville, but I was getting kind of lonely on weekends and wasn't having much luck.

446
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.070
Martin Price: You know, finding guys to hang out with, and

447
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.300
Martin Price: Anyway, so it just went on from there we'll see what happens. Well,

448
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:15.780
Dominique Pozo: I mean, I'm just going to validate that this is a new opportunity. You're giving yourself to receive you know whether April is the, the, the one down the line or she's

449
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:31.620
Dominique Pozo: Yet another teacher that's reflected back to you. That is really worthwhile. Yeah, I don't want to discourage or judge what you're doing. I think that you've done it. And here it is. So, you know, how can you make the best of it, whatever this ends up being

450
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:46.470
Martin Price: Yeah, I just because my what I was doing was like working most weekends to so that I could have a trip back home of over a weekend of four days, you know,

451
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.020
Martin Price: When I don't really need to come home.

452
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.130
Martin Price: As much and I wanted to find somebody to hang out with them weekends.

453
00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.680
Martin Price: So that's what I did.

454
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.250
Dominique Pozo: Well,

455
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:14.310
Dominique Pozo: So just to summarize what you've touched on today. What are you taking away with you, like, what are the takeaways.

456
00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:17.160
Dominique Pozo: From the session.

457
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.650
Martin Price: It's always the

458
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.440
Martin Price: The message is, you know, I'm seeking external validation

459
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:26.640
And

460
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.470
Martin Price: You know that I gotta find that within and

461
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.870
Martin Price: I've just never really done that.

462
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:39.450
Martin Price: And

463
00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:46.950
Martin Price: You know, there's a part of me that just says, Okay, who doesn't seek external validation

464
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.670
Dominique Pozo: We all do it. It's just keeping things in check and balance like

465
00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.890
Martin Price: Yeah, doing it in a balanced way.

466
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:56.520
Yeah.

467
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.050
Martin Price: So I think I've been doing fairly well with that.

468
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:10.620
Martin Price: definitely learned a lesson with Michelle, so I'm not gonna lead with my wallet again and

469
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.230
Martin Price: I don't know, it's just like

470
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.800
Martin Price: The next five years are going to be pretty interesting.

471
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:36.870
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm really going to invite you, you know, you have this dynamic with April and it sounds like she's a generous and willing person. I wonder what her motivations are, you know, that's

472
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:44.700
Dominique Pozo: And I'm not saying that, you know, she's out to get something I'm thinking, you know, maybe she carries something similar people pleasing, who knows.

473
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:46.350
Martin Price: You know, so I me

474
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:59.550
Dominique Pozo: So I'm going to invite you to to experience what it is to receive and and and really reflect on you know what nourishment feels like what it is to receive

475
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.740
Martin Price: You'd be pretty cool.

476
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:17.640
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. You're I I see that you're doing something different, which is, I think, if a pattern that you were, you know, had in place wasn't working to be doing something different sounds very healthy to me.

477
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.240
Martin Price: Which is what

478
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.370
Martin Price: What am I doing this different

479
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:31.200
Dominique Pozo: Um, it sounds like you're you're you're being open to the possibility that somebody can give to you. You don't have to be the one to give

480
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:34.080
Martin Price: Oh yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

481
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.140
Martin Price: It seems

482
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.670
Martin Price: Like really far fetched, but

483
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.000
Martin Price: It does happen.

484
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:53.550
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. Well, let's see what goes on in the next two weeks I'm, I'm looking at my calendar here and

485
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.510
Dominique Pozo: How does this time at

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.780

490
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.300
Martin Price: Of moving back there.
