Jessica Garcia: The other day, actually, I

38
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.780
Jessica Garcia: I made myself like a little fruit port parfait

39
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

40
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.750
Jessica Garcia: And then I got really sick.

41
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

42
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.140
Jessica Garcia: Like my stomach started hurting really bad and I thought I was having an anxiety attack.

43
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:59.460
Jessica Garcia: Because that's usually how I feel when I when I'm having makeup and I can anxiety attack right like my stomach starts hurting really bad and I start

44
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.720
Jessica Garcia: Like my vision starts getting blurry and everything, but

45
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.710
Jessica Garcia: I got sick from something that I, that was all I had eaten all day so

46
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it sounds like something went wrong there.

47
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.120
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, so I do the yogurt and fruit way cuz I didn't know the word

48
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.140
Okay.

49
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so, because you define it. I want to get healthier. How will you know you're healthier. How will you be measuring healthier.

50
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.870
Jessica Garcia: Just better eating habits. I'm

51
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.440
Jessica Garcia: feeling a lot better about myself and just in general like physically

52
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.820
Jessica Garcia: Having more energy not being the sluggish.

53
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how often do you feel the sluggishness

54
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to get. So notice get is the verb. It's an in process word you're not measuring it in numbers not measuring it. And how many hours a day, you're feeling

55
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Sluggish. So these are things that are hard to measure.

56
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you know what I'm doing is sort of trying to create some way to measure whether you're reaching your goal of healthier. So right now, we're saying healthier will be measured by feeling better about myself.

57
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: General, I think you said something about energy. What was the describe what you want. General what

58
00:07:51.780 --> 00:08:00.030
Jessica Garcia: Just feeling I'm feeling healthier is doing better in general, not having more energy.

59
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, please feeling better. I'm going to go since I can't measure that I'm going to say more energy.

60
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to take this and I'm going to say some more energy and less sluggish and right now the way you rating it is you would say seven out of seven days you're sluggish, or what would you rate it

61
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are going to work. I didn't see it. I saw something else. I saw vitality to you.

62
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't look sluggish.

63
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:44.100
Jessica Garcia: Um no I, well, I don't know, maybe it has to do with my

64
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.250
Jessica Garcia: With my mental health.

65
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.980
Jessica Garcia: The feeling sluggish because I noticed that too. And when I'm out and about. I don't feel like that.

66
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So it wasn't imagining it when you were planning on going to work. And we were talking about work. He looked like you had higher energy, your mind seemed like you were able to find words faster and you, you didn't seem low energy

67
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.020
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

68
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.610
Jessica Garcia: Okay.

69
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So when, when do you get to participate in either training or work. When is that coming up.

70
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.920
Jessica Garcia: So I did the training.

71
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.670
Jessica Garcia: I'm going to call right now, after we

72
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.990
Jessica Garcia: Were done with our session and Nicole and then

73
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.070
Jessica Garcia: They should have a schedule ready for me.

74
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.900
Jessica Garcia: I fully

75
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention when you find out that schedule, whether you notice a little bit more energy, whether it's more exciting for you to plan what you're going to eat what you're going to do.

76
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of pay attention to that.

77
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Another goal you have, is I'd like to take time for myself.

78
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: In February, we were noticing. We have facials, for example, taking care of yourself with facials in March, we have

79
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Navigating the negatively experienced behavior of boyfriend. No report. Okay, so you didn't report any self care stuff in March, not to me there was more our focus was on self talk

80
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Choose curiosity over being right was encouraged.

81
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a lot going on with your boyfriend at the time.

82
00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I would like to take time for myself. Now look at the last let's say 30 days or last couple weeks. What's your assessment of whether you taking time for yourself.

83
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.830
Jessica Garcia: I'm all now have made it a habit.

84
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.290
Jessica Garcia: At the end of the night.

85
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.850
Jessica Garcia: I go upstairs. I shower.

86
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.630
Jessica Garcia: Just have some alone time

87
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.700
Jessica Garcia: Sometimes I incorporate my son in there. Okay.

88
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.980
Jessica Garcia: You came about.

89
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this what you mean. I would like to take time for myself. Are you getting that accomplished. When you take a shower and sometimes your son is in there and you're giving him a bath. Is that really alone time is that taking time for yourself. My bad.

90
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:59.580
Jessica Garcia: No. No, but I mean it's I enjoy it. Enjoy.

91
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.670
Jessica Garcia: With my son, because when

92
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.380
Jessica Garcia: When, when the ball like we just play in

93
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.320
Jessica Garcia: And filler.

94
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But so remember that this isn't my assessment. This is yours. I would like to take time for myself. If you feel it that way, then it's true. And you're taking time for yourself if, as I say it. You think no, that's not happening. That's not meeting the need

95
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you telling me yes it's meeting the need, you are taking time for yourself.

96
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't

97
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.380
Jessica Garcia: Like I'm halfway there.

98
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.040
Okay.

99
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not you're not your head nods like this.

100
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not like yeah yeah

101
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

102
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. Okay, I would say, I'm halfway there.

103
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to leave that goal. So half is 50% and would you say it's

104
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That each day.

105
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There are days when you find you have not taken any time to do, whether it's moisturizing your face or really creating me time

106
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice there's still days when you don't do that.

107
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.120
Jessica Garcia: I would say that I'm not able to do. I'm absolutely not able to do it like

108
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.130
Jessica Garcia: In the daytime.

109
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:15.480
Jessica Garcia: But like I wake up I wash my face and then I throw some coconut oil on my face and then that's it. But my, that's when I do like the mask and everything.

110
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.350
Jessica Garcia: Every day like three times a week.

111
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: See like to see it at least six times.

112
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That right

113
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.720
Three.

114
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already doing three

115
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.790
Jessica Garcia: And that's how okay

116
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's halfway there. So I just doubled it

117
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.360
Jessica Garcia: And figured you

118
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Would want to see it six days a week.

119
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not telling you ask these are real questions. This is you deciding, these are my goals. If I had to do in self care, you'd be doing a whole lot of other things. So

120
00:14:50.910 --> 00:15:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This is you, okay, if I'm using today if I you tell me if you've reached this goal. How many days a week, will you be engaging in, let's say,

121
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: facemask or the equivalent of that.

122
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.700
Jessica Garcia: Thing. Okay.

123
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I

124
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To the self care six days a week.

125
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I reached my goal. Yeah.

126
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're halfway there.

127
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm what gets in your way of doing it.

128
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:42.180
Jessica Garcia: Too much to do around the house. I guess I always feel like I'm too busy.

129
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:54.600
Jessica Garcia: But I mean, I do it at night. So I don't know if that sounds like mostly every night. I do it in. And there's some nights whenever my son and

130
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:08.190
Jessica Garcia: Even if it's like everyone's asleep, and it's like 12 o'clock at night. That's when I wake up and I like watch TV and kind of get my alone.

131
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.510
Jessica Garcia: But then I

132
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.120
Jessica Garcia: Feel. That's why I feel tired. I

133
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Also have to the next one that was still a little confusing, but I think we'll leave it there. I'll keep revisiting it because it's getting some mixed information. But I think, but we'll keep it there. I'd like to be so then have I'd like to take time for myself. And then I have

134
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that one was about washing my face cream brushing oil and a bond painting toenails. That was really I'm going to move this information over here. I'm going to move this one actually

135
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Down here.

136
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This the one above it a second to work.

137
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, let's go here. Um, this one is about communication. I will identify. Now, this is my wording, not yours. Your goal is I'd like to take time for myself. And then I create this sort of objectives that I think will help you get there. So what I have

138
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Planned will

139
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Client increase the frequency

140
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Of love, but where is it, man. But boop boop boop boop boop well client will identify challenges in assertively communicating her need for self care to her partner.

141
00:17:44.820 --> 00:18:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So this has to do with communication and boundary setting expectation, how, how you sort of assess your ability in your confidence to communicate without a leading to an argument into some other distressing event.

142
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I think for you right change happens like some some weeks, it's like, Okay, well, now he's fine. Now he's not. Now we're not now I'm getting a job like

143
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It changes. I would say within about a week there's sometimes I'll see you and there'll be a significant change that's happened so around you and your, your boyfriend. What are the dynamics between you two these days.

144
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.670
Jessica Garcia: Um,

145
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.030
Jessica Garcia: Let's see how person or do I want to get

146
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, pretty personal I would think. Right.

147
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.140
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I'm

148
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:55.290
Jessica Garcia: I feel I guess it's it's okay things between me and him are fine, fine. I'm not

149
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.250
Jessica Garcia: Sweating him anymore. I'm not stressing anymore, you know,

150
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.900
Jessica Garcia: It basically

151
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It Jessica is it that you've accepted his limitations, you've accepted what he is who he is and you have stopped expecting him to change.

152
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.900
Jessica Garcia: Yes.

153
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.490
Okay.

154
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So, it's fine.

155
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're when you say not sweating him. It's not your mouth, making demands on him. You're not saying, hey, I need you to change this. Why don't you see the value in it and arguing about it. You're just like

156
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: He's going to be this way. He was this way, this is how it's going to be, and you stop kind of asking him to change.

157
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

158
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you mentioned earlier, so I'm not sure how personal to make this, what, what do you think that was about. There's something kind of personal about what's going on in there.

159
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:02.340
Jessica Garcia: Well, what, what I meant was, like, we, we haven't been sexually active for

160
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.030
Jessica Garcia: I would say, like, eight months.

161
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:20.580
Jessica Garcia: And then we recently became sexually active.

162
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.320
Jessica Garcia: But

163
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.990
Jessica Garcia: Like

164
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Right. Exactly. So there that's personal. So, so I saw your head doing this. We weren't sexually active for for this amount of time recently we were. And then he went like this.

165
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.450
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, like

166
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like

167
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.300
Jessica Garcia: I don't like it.

168
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know now this is deeply personal but this is certainly

169
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's comfortable or not comfortable for you. It's certainly a familiar place for me as a therapist to go

170
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what you like.

171
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:07.380
Jessica Garcia: I do

172
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:18.780
Jessica Garcia: Okay, I do. I would say I do, but I just ever since. After I had the baby, my libido has gotten. Yes.

173
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So also, I don't know if this is true for you, but I've been listening to talk and what she says about testosterone.

174
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might also be for the progesterone. I don't know what other hormones, but it the buprenorphine completely messes with it. It's so you not only after the baby, but also because of the buprenorphine it's throwing off too.

175
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, hello.

176
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Right.

177
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.360
Jessica Garcia: Interesting.

178
00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and and look, there's so much to talk about a nice group meetings and I only sometimes get 15 minutes and I have to tackle what are we going to focus on here. There's so much we can talk about

179
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's been about, I don't know, maybe six or more months since we've brought that topic up

180
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll try to remember to bring it up again so that the doc can talk about it. She can normalize it for people. She can give people ideas. I'll try and give her a heads up, like, hey,

181
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring it up, let's let's talk to our clients about these things. So they don't think it's going to last forever.

182
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. So they can get that that sexual vitality back again.

183
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll see if I can check right now write myself a little note say

184
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.830
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, because I mean I just because then

185
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.430
Jessica Garcia: Because I don't know like postpartum Vargas the 30 years

186
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.680
Jessica Garcia: Maybe not.

187
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's um

188
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We can look at it like sometimes when the momentum going, then you're like, oh, that ended up being a lot more fun than I thought. Or is it things that he's doing that, you're not saying, Oh, I like that. Or, Hey, let's go do this.

189
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember what you said was, I didn't like it. Now what I didn't kind of understand was whether it's like, I don't like how it happened.

190
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I don't like me during it, like, you know, and let's refine that a little bit more, or I was kind of like I got started and I was kind of wanted to eat a piece of toast is dead. I could have just stopped.

191
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.590
Jessica Garcia: It's more like I don't

192
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.420
Jessica Garcia: I feel like a hypocrite doing it.

193
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you're not married, kind of thing. Is that what you're thinking.

194
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.390
Jessica Garcia: No, no, because I'm like

195
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.180
Jessica Garcia: He gets on my nerves so much. I can't stand them, you know,

196
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.550
Jessica Garcia: And then I'm like,

197
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.510
Jessica Garcia: Laying down with him.

198
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: He's kind of like I'm mad at you have disappointed in you over here, but I want you to please me is that what's happening is that where the hypocrite part comes in.

199
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.680
Jessica Garcia: I feel like it was more for him.

200
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, then those are always that hypocritical.

201
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I don't know.

202
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:45.660
Jessica Garcia: Like okay, maybe I use the wrong word. Like I don't I'm disappointed in him my eye. He doesn't

203
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.540
Jessica Garcia: turn me on.

204
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.990
Jessica Garcia: My whole perception of them has just completely changed in me.

205
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.900
Jessica Garcia: I don't like it. I don't like

206
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you had sex with him because

207
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: fill that in, because

208
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.460
Because

209
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:10.470
Jessica Garcia: We got

210
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.230
Jessica Garcia: It was just a moment my

211
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:19.290
Jessica Garcia: Meeting and I was like, well, I'm gonna try it, see how it goes.

212
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.410
Jessica Garcia: And looks fine and everything within just

213
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:24.630
Jessica Garcia: Afterwards, like

214
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.360
Jessica Garcia: But I can't stand him.

215
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.250
Jessica Garcia: When he gets

216
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.600
Jessica Garcia: Herbs or

217
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.140
Jessica Garcia: You know, you make me mad.

218
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so

219
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This this topic itself is now a whole field in psychology. It is a very broad topic and people can just specialize right there on this topic and do no other kinds of work and just focus here so

220
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to minimize its importance, but

221
00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In your world view is sex. Does it have to have love is sex, just for physical gratification is sex, just to make a baby right that's only three. There's a bajillion different reasons that it's for. So for you, because notice how you like, well, I'll see if I like it.

222
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But then I didn't hear anything about how it went. And then I and then it went to, but I don't want to like what he's doing. Afterwards, I'm annoyed with him, but I didn't hear about what the experience was like.

223
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.410
Jessica Garcia: Fine.

224
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:42.540
Jessica Garcia: It's fine. He's a I mean I guess I couldn't expect anything more from him. You know, you selfish in that aspect. Just like in life.

225
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now we're getting somewhere.

226
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.800
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

227
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So the fine part is

228
00:26:54.090 --> 00:27:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That it wasn't satisfying for you. This is what he wanted. It wasn't horrible, but so fine. Is it wasn't an assault like trying to see where fine as it doesn't sound like it was pleasurable. I didn't hear anything where it was pleasurable for you.

229
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:11.820
Jessica Garcia: It wasn't

230
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.180
Jessica Garcia: It wasn't. I guess my emotions have to be in that

231
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.090
Jessica Garcia: My emotion.

232
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.700
Jessica Garcia: Have to be in it and they have to like it has to be someone that

233
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.530
Jessica Garcia: You know, is passionate about me and

234
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.870
Jessica Garcia: And we celebrate each other's body and you know

235
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.140
Jessica Garcia: Not like that were pan.

236
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.360
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, it's not

237
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.530
Jessica Garcia: It felt like it felt

238
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.560
Jessica Garcia: Like the word the knowledge, but it felt like you know how the research, just go and

239
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.110
Jessica Garcia: They just step on their hands and then take themselves off and go away.

240
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.470
Jessica Garcia: Right.

241
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

242
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

243
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice your own wording right. We started with

244
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't like it. And then we're at fine and now we're at someone standing on a chicken and

245
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming you're the chicken, who have had to shake it off.

246
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.110
Jessica Garcia: The hen. No, I'm the hand. I was good at.

247
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.800
Jessica Garcia: Script on

248
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.350
Jessica Garcia: Right by the rooster.

249
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So you look at the words you are using

250
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't like it. It was fine. But really, as we continue talking. I felt a bit like the hand that was kept forcefully. I'm assuming down and then

251
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to discharge that unpleasant experience because that's what animals do is they shake it off. You ever seen your, your animal like even if you hold them too close to you. He shakes it out.

252
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: All animals have a discharge, we humans kind of keep ourselves all bunched up and we don't shake it off.

253
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how your wording starts with, it's fine. But when we look at it a little closer. You may have stronger feelings than just it was fine.

254
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.200
Jessica Garcia: I'll do

255
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:23.610
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I do. I have a lot of resentment towards him and

256
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:32.310
Jessica Garcia: He just doesn't love me the way I want to be love the way that I know I deserve to be loved.

257
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.880
Jessica Garcia: And I was telling my brother, the other day, like

258
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.610
Jessica Garcia: See found a girlfriend or some girl wrote him in prison.

259
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.960
Jessica Garcia: And then he gets out in his life. She catfish me

260
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.310
Jessica Garcia: Know my brother, you know, when me in

261
00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.740
Jessica Garcia: Drama and started talking like I was, I had already gained my sobriety way I was already on the

262
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.270
Jessica Garcia: Heavier side. So he always treated me like it's

263
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.660
Jessica Garcia: Like the way you treat that girl.

264
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.520
Jessica Garcia: I told them.

265
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.890
Jessica Garcia: And

266
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:25.440
Jessica Garcia: It doesn't feel good. Just remember, you know, you have sister and you have a mom, they get treated like shit.

267
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like he could show empathy to you. He could understand another perspective, besides his own

268
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.350
Jessica Garcia: To my brother.

269
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:52.080
Jessica Garcia: Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah. Because I don't, I don't like the way he talks. That girl is so nice to him. She's so nice to him and she was there for him and she fill in.

270
00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:00.000
Jessica Garcia: And she has her own house her own car. Like you know she seems like a nice girl, as far as I can tell.

271
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.120
Jessica Garcia: But

272
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.280
Jessica Garcia: I'm my brother's issue is that

273
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.480
Jessica Garcia: She sent him a picture to prison.

274
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:19.440
Jessica Garcia: And she doesn't look like what her pictures like what picture with the picture, she said.

275
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.180
Jessica Garcia: So she doesn't look like that in real life.

276
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:33.450
Jessica Garcia: To a lot more heavier said I'm not, I was telling them, like, don't be like that, you know,

277
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.680
Jessica Garcia: Don't be like give her a chance and

278
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.650
Jessica Garcia: And if not, then break it off.

279
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.070
Jessica Garcia: He was like, You just gave me a guilt trip.

280
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:58.050
Jessica Garcia: Like we joke around like that. And he's like, your asshole. You just made me feel bad. I was like, I'm sorry. I've been wanting to tell you that because

281
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:06.570
Jessica Garcia: That's the way I got treated. I've got treated like if I was the fat girl, and he could do better.

282
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember earlier I was asking you.

283
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If you knew what you like. Have you ever had that experience where you were having an intimate relationship and was exploring each other's bodies appreciating it you're emotionally involved.

284
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you had that sort of satisfying sex life.

285
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know what it is. You know what, it's not there, because you've had it and it's not there right now.

286
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.170

Jessica Garcia: Are you serious right now and I'm like, Yeah, I am serious.

321
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.070
Jessica Garcia: And then

322
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.990
Jessica Garcia: I just started telling her, I started telling her that

323
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.530
Jessica Garcia: That I can't get over it.

324
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.380
Jessica Garcia: I can't get over it. I still heard about that day that all that stuff happen.

325
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:53.280
Jessica Garcia: When her boyfriend slapped me across the face and she left me that apartment and she tried to tell me that she didn't leave that that's not true that she didn't leave but I know she left like

326
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.410
Jessica Garcia: Everyone knows she left and then

327
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.180
Jessica Garcia: I just, I was like,

328
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.820
Jessica Garcia: I was like on a roll. And I just wasn't letting her

329
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.370
Jessica Garcia: I wasn't letting her denial. I was in letting her

330
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.650
Jessica Garcia: You know,

331
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.900
Jessica Garcia: Make me feel like if I

332
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.510
Jessica Garcia: Like if I was in the wrong for feeling the way I felt

333
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.150
Jessica Garcia: And then

334
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.620
Jessica Garcia: I just thought it I thought it all out and then

335
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:43.350
Jessica Garcia: But she stayed on the phone with me. It was weird, like she didn't hate usually she hangs up and she did it. She was just sitting there, even after we had stopped talking

336
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:47.670
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, she just stayed on the phone. I was the one that hunger.

337
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.560
Jessica Garcia: I have to go because I was like what the hell are we just sitting on the phone for

338
00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but you do notice a difference she stay on home and know maybe you didn't know what to do because it would have been hurt turn to say something and she doesn't know what to do.

339
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, she did stay on there and that feels different. Yeah.

340
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you got it all.

341
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:20.340
Jessica Garcia: Yeah. Well, I was like, kind of in a rage. And so the next day she called me and

342
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.610
Jessica Garcia: And like she said that she couldn't sleep all night. She wasn't able to sleep all night.

343
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.000
Jessica Garcia: She said that she was dreaming about me.

344
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that make you think right there. What was that something just hit you pretty hard just now.

345
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That she would dream about you. What is that is that

346
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.650
Is that

347
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.220
Jessica Garcia: There's a dream that when I was when I was a little girl that I used to peek my head.

348
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:07.290
Jessica Garcia: Around the corner and she used to like call my name and she said that that's what she was dreaming and then she was calling my name. Yeah.

349
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't it be nice if that's what

350
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What that dream was and that

351
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That mom loves you.

352
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

353
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.030
Yeah.

354
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.800
Jessica Garcia: Yeah. Yeah. That would be nice.

355
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.660
But

356
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.690
Jessica Garcia: The next day was just

357
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.650
Jessica Garcia: Her seeing how much I hurt her.

358
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, oh, we get our hopes up. So, so there's, there's, there's this thing, you know, when I was originally telling you about what a gas lighter is capable of. And if we want to opt out right it's completely letting go of expectation

359
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But then thing you did where you said your piece where you share your side of the story.

360
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That can exist, and you did do it. The only part that I would say you might end up getting let down is expecting a particular outcome we can vent and I'm glad she stayed on the phone for it but expecting that she's going to

361
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the next right thing

362
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where you have some control and you can say to yourself, you know,

363
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The most I can expect from her is that she just quietly listen and maybe that'll be the road to some healing is you know what Mommy may not know what to say to me when I'm processing. My grief and

364
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What I remember

365
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But at least, could you listen

366
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you don't have to say anything, you know, the other day, when you are quiet and you didn't hang up the phone.

367
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.560
Jessica Garcia: Or

368
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.580
It means

369
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and then on the next day you talked about how in your dream life because she couldn't say, well, I love you and I can't fathom the kind of pain. You must have had remembering it that way.

370
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I shouldn't say those things. But she did say I had a dream and she's remembering right the way peek around a corner.

371
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be the best you can do for now just say I love you and I wish it was that again.

372
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I think you mentioned in a text that your mom was thinking about getting some psychotherapy and and possibly even through bright heart health, you know, she followed through with that.

373
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.630
Jessica Garcia: I don't think so.

374
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:52.410
Okay.

375
00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.920
Jessica Garcia: I don't think so either way should be telling me about it.

376
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, okay.

377
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:59.340
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

378
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.250
Jessica Garcia: I think I asked her, one question.

379
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so you know, you would never hear it from me like I would never say she's in she's out sometimes their siblings and there's certain things going on. And people maybe think I'll say something passively. I won't, I won't say yea it won't say nay, I, I just won't

380
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's too important. You know that each one kind of have that space to do what they need to do. I was just curious if she had said anything to you. And if you were noticing a difference in her behavior or something, I don't know.

381
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's kind of a bummer.

382
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.020
Jessica Garcia: Yeah yeah

383
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:46.380
Jessica Garcia: See

384
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.950
Jessica Garcia: I don't know what's different about her, but

385
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.760
Jessica Garcia: There's some kind of

386
00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.040
Jessica Garcia: Like

387
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:02.520
Jessica Garcia: It's just

388
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.280
Jessica Garcia: Not enough

389
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: There's not enough. Yeah.

390
00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how did it feel to let it all out to her though long we just start from that, though. What was that like to just be angry rage even and just

391
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Not keep it in anymore and tell her.

392
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.080
Jessica Garcia: I felt bad afterwards.

393
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.400
Oh,

394
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then she said you hurt me so that reinforces that you're not supposed to say when you're mad that what that's going to do

395
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.470
Good.

396
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.910
Jessica Garcia: And I know it though.

397
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.000
Jessica Garcia: The way I guess the way we're always races that were never supposed to

398
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.740
Jessica Garcia: Um,

399
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.920
Jessica Garcia: Disrespect our parents and raise your voice a second and talk back to them.

400
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.590
Jessica Garcia: So my grandma always

401
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.560
Jessica Garcia: Taught me and told me

402
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.030
Jessica Garcia: But

403
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Respect goes both ways.

404
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Children are no less deserving of respect.

405
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. They have their right to privacy.

406
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: They have the right to know when they're telling me so full. I don't want to keep eating, I

407
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know my own. I know when I'm full. I know when I'm hungry. I know, right. What I like what I don't like. That's how we can show them respect.

408
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This toy. I like that, too. I don't like you like it. Mom and son like that toy.

409
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.130
Jessica Garcia: Jay,

410
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Z waking up.

411
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.050
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.130
Jessica Garcia: He just woke up.

413
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Where's Mommy.

414
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.360
Jessica Garcia: But yeah, give me a second, let me go grab them.

415
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jessica, we're going to end our session said that I wanted to share a quick poll with you. And the reason why I like this poem for you.

416
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Has to do with this idea that somehow anger.

417
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not an acceptable emotion and that somehow it means disrespect.

418
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to read it to

419
00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You there yeah you there. So I'm going to read it to you have your baby with you.

420
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.640
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, you see money here.

421
00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just sort of take it in maybe feel his little body as he's waking up just kind of hold him, and I'm going to read it. You don't have to read it with me just sort of take it in. Okay.

422
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a long one.

423
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:50.700
Okay.

424
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being human.

425
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So this poem is called the guest house.

426
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's, it is

427
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty old this poem. It's not some new MANY YEARS OLD. So, this being human is a guest house.

428
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Every morning, a new arrival, a joy.

429
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A depression. A meanness some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.

430
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Welcome and entertain them all.

431
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if there are a crowd of sorrows who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture.

432
00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Still treat each guest honorably

433
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: He may be clearing you out for some new delight.

434
00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The dark thought the shame the malice meet them all at the door. Laughing And invite them in

435
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Be grateful for whoever comes

436
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because each has been sent as a guide from beyond

437
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe take some time, take a screenshot. Just sit with this for a while and think about how

438
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This being human is a guest house.

439
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I've never had an actual second home where I have an actual separate guest house, but when I try that on

440
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Very different than a spare room in the house, imagine that it's a guest house.

441
00:50:51.180 --> 00:51:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This being him just try that on a little bit. Put a little further out its way out here and go with that metaphor. And, see, see what what comes up for you and see if we can

442
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Share that next time we meet

443
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody

444
00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:11.430
Jessica Garcia: Feel though. Like, even though someone throws jabs I'm YEARS HAVE BEEN I HAVE TO

445
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:13.920
Jessica Garcia: Be nice.

446
00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.110
Jessica Garcia: And kind and laugh.

447
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.280
Jessica Garcia: Crazy.

448
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to reschedule for next Monday.

449
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.170
Jessica Garcia: Yes. Okay.

450
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe put in your alarm. Let's see if we can

451
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe set up a little bit of the EMT or we might pick a target sort of focus on a particular not the whole network. Not all past, but just one single memory one single piece.

452
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Of probably a very complex network of things but

453
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we could just pick one. Maybe you've talked about it before, maybe you'll think of something else.

454
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, we can get there together, but at least let's have this phone set and then have two objects, right, so that your eyes are level with mine might mean building up some books, keep your eye out. When you're in the community or if anyone's out and about.

455
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And they've wiped it down.

456
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A little

457
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A little phone stand it when you you know you have some way to kind of hold your phone up. Okay.

458
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Um, and I'm assuming you don't need any medication. I think you're on a two week deal and there's probably no issue right now.

459
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, I will see you. Will you be in group tomorrow get cold and I'll see you tomorrow morning.

460
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.300
Jessica Garcia: Okay, thank you.

461
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:56.250
Jessica Garcia: Bye.
