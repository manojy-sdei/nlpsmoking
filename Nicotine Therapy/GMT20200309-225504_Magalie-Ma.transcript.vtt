00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.100
Kelley Briscar: Okay.

166
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.770
Magalie Marcellus: So you are saying so.

167
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.180
Magalie Marcellus: Your son.

168
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.820
Magalie Marcellus: So he's there with his dad did he move out.

169
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.330
Kelley Briscar: He's, he's still with his father.

170
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:16.470
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so no cuz I know you were thinking of moving out, you know, with the job once he had a job.

171
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.850
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, right.

172
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.260
Kelley Briscar: Right.

173
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.850
Kelley Briscar: Right now obviously still no doubt, so can move out. So yeah, he's kind of

174
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.380
Kelley Briscar: Still kind of

175
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.340
Magalie Marcellus: Stop, stop.

176
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:27.810
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

177
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.820
Kelley Briscar: Okay. Oh.

178
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.700
Magalie Marcellus: He needs to be able to keep a

179
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.150
Job.

180
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:44.970
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, don't get one. Actually, I don't think the key thing. It'll be a problem. It's just the actual getting, you know, I hear that seems to be lacking.

181
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.770
Kelley Briscar: So,

182
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.180
Kelley Briscar: I mean, I think I'll get it together just

183
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.490
Kelley Briscar: Take some time.

184
00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:08.760
Kelley Briscar: But he's handling being his dad's pretty well you know he's not doing its normal stuff that he normally would do complaining or whining or anything like that. He's not doing any of that. So, which makes it easier for me because then I don't

185
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.070
Magalie Marcellus: Feel bad. Yeah.

186
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.980
Kelley Briscar: Right, I wouldn't let him know. I feel bad, but I would feel bad inside. If I knew he was, you know,

187
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:23.100
Kelley Briscar: Miserable there. And luckily, if he is miserable is keeping it to themselves. So

188
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:30.300
Kelley Briscar: Which is a change in itself. When I started, you know, normally, he has no problem voicing is done, happiness, you know,

189
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.290
Where

190
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.540
Kelley Briscar: These guys have been doing that, you know, he's pretty positive one. I do talk to them.

191
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.600
Magalie Marcellus: That's a good thing.

192
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.710
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, interested in me and actually and I like doing, you know, more so than just about him.

193
00:15:49.410 --> 00:16:02.490
Kelley Briscar: I find, you know, I mean other than the happiness and the job saying we got along well, you know, other than those two issues. You know, so I mean in a lot of ways. I miss them, you know, but

194
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.330
Kelley Briscar: You know, we still keep in touch and

195
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.760
Kelley Briscar: So,

196
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.500
Magalie Marcellus: Right.

197
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.440
Magalie Marcellus: And

198
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.010
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

199
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.700
Magalie Marcellus: The housing situation doesn't happen.

200
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:18.930
Magalie Marcellus: As well so

201
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:19.560
Right.

202
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:27.420
Magalie Marcellus: What you guys are communicating and he's still trying to get find his way. And so you can be

203
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.900
Magalie Marcellus: Independent even when you do get your space at least you know

204
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.930
Magalie Marcellus: At maybe in the future, right, he is

205
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:44.490
Magalie Marcellus: Able to take a certain responsibility, maybe we can look into. You guys getting back together. But he needs to be able to maintain a job.

206
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.650
Kelley Briscar: He had his own

207
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.260
Magalie Marcellus: One.

208
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.610
Magalie Marcellus: That he should be able to do

209
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:53.730
It.

210
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.660
Kelley Briscar: Right.

211
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.190
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, and your daughter, she's

212
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.060
Kelley Briscar: Calling you

Kelley Briscar: Mm hmm.

216
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:21.210
Kelley Briscar: After last week, I guess it was basically just, you know, stable crap. You know, so

217
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:24.510
Magalie Marcellus: That she knows

218
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.740
Kelley Briscar: She knows where I'm at and stuff.

219
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.730
Magalie Marcellus: As she has she visited with you.

220
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.100

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.290
Kelley Briscar: It's been about a month since that's in there.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.370
Kelley Briscar: Yeah.

225
00:17:52.320 --> 00:18:03.810
Kelley Briscar: And that was like the last time I saw her. So yeah, it's been a little over a month since I've been there since the beginning here on Sunday. It's been one since we came back here. So yeah, it's been a little

226
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.480
Kelley Briscar: sad eyes on it.

227
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.230
Kelley Briscar: I don't know what to do for her anymore.

228
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.900
Magalie Marcellus: This at this time. There's nothing I can do. She has all the resources available or

229
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.790
Magalie Marcellus: She needs to be able to use them.

230
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.180
Kelley Briscar: I know

231
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.950
Kelley Briscar: Just some it's just so frustrating. You know, I mean,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.720
Kelley Briscar: You know what she's done it before. This

233
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:28.500
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

234
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:37.590
Kelley Briscar: I don't know. But if I sit there and allow myself. I'll just go crazy, you know, in my own head, and I can't, I can't do it for her, you know, I mean, I like to

235
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:45.120
Kelley Briscar: Do is, that'd be there for her when when she needs me and take care of myself, you know,

236
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.140
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

237
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:59.610
Magalie Marcellus: Does he have to be healthy, in order to be a little help. And also, if I'm issue, creating anxiety filled in. That's nice, be healthy for you.

238
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.520
You have to a

239
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.370
Magalie Marcellus: Difficult, but you have to look at

240
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.840
Magalie Marcellus: What's going to be

241
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:14.850
Magalie Marcellus: What we will help you. What's beneficial to you right now. I'm worried about her or taking care of

243
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.380
Kelley Briscar: Very young

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.800
Kelley Briscar: year of my life do

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.680
Kelley Briscar: That now you know I have that all in front of me. I just got to get

264
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.600
Kelley Briscar: A fresh slate.

265
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.770
Doing it you

266
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.350
Kelley Briscar: Know bumps in the road like the tiger and all that crap you know to get in the way, but

267
00:20:40.740 --> 00:21:00.180
Kelley Briscar: Now things are starting to slow down a little bit. It's time to refocus side and, you know, get my GED, going to school to get something that's really important to me. You know, I wanna do that. So let's talk about that. I actually have to do it, you know.

268
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.120
Magalie Marcellus: Well, you have the

269
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.850
Magalie Marcellus: Information. Just now you have two

270
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.320
Kelley Briscar: Slides already

271
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.820
Magalie Marcellus: Put in those

272
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.400
Magalie Marcellus: Those action plan and sour.

273
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.200
Kelley Briscar: Ready.

274
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:20.490
Yeah.

275
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.830
Magalie Marcellus: So sort of JD, and eventually go back to school.

276
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.330
Magalie Marcellus: Any sort of

277
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.160
Magalie Marcellus: I know you

278
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.410
Magalie Marcellus: Thought about as well but

279
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.890
Is that

280
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.430
Magalie Marcellus: Or maybe something, you know,

281
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.200
Kelley Briscar: Things happen I

282
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.630
Magalie Marcellus: You say nothing seemed to happen. They don't have any openings in your

283
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.010
Kelley Briscar: Area or

284
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.840
Magalie Marcellus: What's going on, what's

285
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.780
Kelley Briscar: Up so I don't know if it's you know it's been a very long time since I've worked

286
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.230
Magalie Marcellus: But

287
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.970
Kelley Briscar: It doesn't take away from the experience that I had because I had done these jobs before

288
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.140
Magalie Marcellus: My

289
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.790
Kelley Briscar: I don't know. I just know that you know something seems promising nothing seems to ever end up coming out of it, you know.

290
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.690
Magalie Marcellus: So maybe I'm

291
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:28.260
Kelley Briscar: Supposed to go back to school. You know, maybe that's why my sound weird, but maybe that's why you know these other things happened like worked out because you know I'm supposed to go back to get my GED. And I supposed to go to that.

292
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.180
Kelley Briscar: School, you know,

293
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.600
Magalie Marcellus: So, so what's the reservation. Right.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.590
Now with the school.

Kelley Briscar: What's the blood

308
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.810
Kelley Briscar: You know, just like I started meet you. I'm very leery about this test.

309
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.200
Kelley Briscar: I see myself failing it because

Magalie Marcellus: By the end, so you can have

313
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.710
Kelley Briscar: Know, well, but I did go for some classes, not a couple years ago and I

314
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.400
Moved

315
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.240
Kelley Briscar: Me I you know I was just like, it was like they were speaking a foreign language to me.

316
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.740
Magalie Marcellus: Was done

317
00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.940
With everything else.

Magalie Marcellus: He chose

321
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.070
Magalie Marcellus: Because not everybody can just kind of
