33
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.410
Dawn Abriel: It was in an email, they sent it in an email to you.

34
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.800

36
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.220
Dawn Abriel: To deal with

37
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.330
And

38
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:41.700
Dawn Abriel: You get your medicine, week to week you show up for group and you're there for the whole hour I write a script, you're not there, you don't get your medicine so

39
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:54.240
Mike: Make sure that I am at tending my meetings in through the entire duration. I'm good. If I needed to reschedule or any of those kinds of things.

40
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:11.430
Mike: How do I do go or go about that. Like if I know ahead of time that there's going to be a conflict to schedule and I need to do my session, but I'm not going to make the regular time who I call bright heart health, and

41
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.570
Dawn Abriel: Right, you go, you go. You go to the virtual clinic, the virtual clinic is what you came to before you came in to see me.

42
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.910
Mike: Yes. Okay.

43
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.890
Dawn Abriel: Right. Those are care coordinators. They're there to answer all your questions and

44
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.490
To

45
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.870
Dawn Abriel: They can get ahold of the doc the therapist and anyone that you need for a bright heart health.

46
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.490
Dawn Abriel: Problem.

47
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.410
Mike: Got it, got it. What

48
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.600
Dawn Abriel: Once a month right heart health will send you a manila envelope like this.

49
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.120
Dawn Abriel: And when you get it did not open it.

50
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.330
Dawn Abriel: If you open it. It can't be used, you

51
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.610
Dawn Abriel: Have to go to the virtual clinic and say, I got one of these in the mail. What do I do with it.

52
00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:04.590
Dawn Abriel: Open you'll open it in front of them, then you'll take out this in your open this in front of them. You go to the bathroom, you come back and you fold it up to the camera and turn it

53
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.060
Mike: Got it. And

54
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.740
Dawn Abriel: You do that once a month.

55
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:19.410
Dawn Abriel: If for some reason you don't get one, it's up to you to call bright hard health and say something must be happening to my address because I didn't get one.

56
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.980
Dawn Abriel: Got it. Because if you don't have a current up to date. You're in drug screen, they won't let you into groups.

57
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:39.240
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to be sending you some Narcan by law. Every time I write a prescription for buprenorphine. I have to send more can and I recommend that you have it on you.

58
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.950
Dawn Abriel: There's 11 refills, and I can write for more if you need it.

59
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.180
Mike: Okay, great.

60
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.390
Dawn Abriel: So this is what you have to do to get into group.

61
00:06:49.890 --> 00:07:09.660
Dawn Abriel: Before group, you have to fill out a survey. It's called the brief addiction monitor be AM. We call it the band. Did you do your BAM and that allows me to keep up with what else is going on with you because I can't always know everything.

62
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.250
Dawn Abriel: You don't say everything you need to end group.

63
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:29.310
Dawn Abriel: So I can follow your progress. But that has to be done before group. If you wait to the last minute, you'll be late for group and some groups lock people out after 15 minutes. So then you're

64
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.860
Mike: Gonna have to be before group. Yeah.

65
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.360
Dawn Abriel: You can do it a day before

66
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.860
Dawn Abriel: Two hours before it doesn't matter, but it has to be the for group.

67
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:52.500
Dawn Abriel: And to be in group, it has to be like this. Good lighting where we can see your facial expression, absolutely, positively never, ever. Can there be someone else in the room with you.

68
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.370
Mike: Right.

69
00:07:53.430 --> 00:08:02.220
Dawn Abriel: If we see someone in the room, we will we will just kick out a group. And it's really easy. It's a push of one button and you're gone.

70
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.020
Dawn Abriel: Because

71
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.030
Dawn Abriel: You can imagine if someone comes onto the screen and recognizes you and knows you.

72
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.720
Dawn Abriel: It's a really large

73
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.310
Mike: You know, yeah.

74
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.480
Dawn Abriel: invasion of privacy.

75
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.220
Mike: Yeah, absolutely.

76
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:24.270
Dawn Abriel: We do ask people if they can, to use the earbuds. That way you know people

77
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.270
Dawn Abriel: In the other room, can't hear what other people are saying

78
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:35.640
Mike: Right. Um, I, the way that I'm doing it, I'm like the only person that's in the room is I been doing it.

79
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.800
Mike: Without your but it's okay. The other lady.

80
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:53.640
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so after we're done. You're going to go back to the virtual clinic and do two things. Okay, you're going to say show me how to do a Bam.

81
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:02.430
Dawn Abriel: And how do I do the ACE survey AC E. It's just one time 10 questions.

82
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:11.100
Dawn Abriel: And it's adverse childhood experiences a CE. O. So now we need to decide.

83
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:19.950
Dawn Abriel: Can you give me some idea in terms of grams. How much opioid you're getting per day.

84
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.790
Mike: Okay.

85
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:33.150
Mike: I'm trying to kind of divide this 600 we into daily

86
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.940
Mike: Amount I'm

87
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.730
Dawn Abriel: Let's do it this way.

88
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.170
Dawn Abriel: Let's do it this way. I'm going to give you one strip eight milligrams

89
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:14.820
Dawn Abriel: And I want you to start by cutting it in half and taking half of the strip and waiting at least an hour. See how how much

90
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.380
Dawn Abriel: Of your withdrawal is

91
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:25.740
Mike: Of really, really high dose amount per milligrams per, per day. I, I know that for certain

92
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:39.660
Mike: And so, um, I, I would rather try to play it safe and go with a higher amount I because I really know that that probably would not quite cut it as far as that.

93
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.010
Dawn Abriel: Well, I'm you know I'm going to be seeing you tomorrow night.

94
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:59.070
Dawn Abriel: At six o'clock. So let's do it this way today so you can so I can tell what's going on for you. I'm going to give you two strips one for today and one to take tomorrow morning and

95
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.560
Mike: I kind of did the math over here. And I would say about

96
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:11.910
Mike: About four and a half grams of heroin per, per day.

97
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.510
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. So you're right. I think you will take at least

98
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.300
Dawn Abriel: Two strips.

99
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.730
Dawn Abriel: So here's the thing you. I'll give you the two strips, but

100
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:37.650
Dawn Abriel: Be careful with it, you'll know that you're taking too much if you get kind of woozy and sleepy. That's too much buprenorphine.

101
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.550
Water

102
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.400
Dawn Abriel: So, so why don't you do it this way at eight o'clock tonight.

103
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.800
Dawn Abriel: Take one strip

104
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.660
Dawn Abriel: Because that's good and then tomorrow morning, take

105
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.510
Dawn Abriel: I think you just gonna have to

106
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.540
Dawn Abriel: SEE HOW SEE HOW LONG one stripped last you

107
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.810
Dawn Abriel: Before you take the second one.

108
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:15.450
Dawn Abriel: But then on a daily basis, you take them together, you would take all your medicine all at once. First thing in the morning.

109
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.500
Dawn Abriel: So, it is, it goes under your tongue.

110
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.810
Dawn Abriel: And it has to sit there for

111
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.220
Dawn Abriel: At least two minutes.

112
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:32.520
Mike: Are they in a pill form or are they the other

113
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.350
Dawn Abriel: Film i i

114
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.560
Dawn Abriel: What's the difference for you.

115
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:56.220
Mike: I beat with the dentures that I have the something to film sometimes kind of what I have noticed as it kind of got a little bit gummy and kind of stuck I if it's possible that I could get the the pill form that would be preferred. But I'm whatever it is that I get. I get

116
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:14.640
Dawn Abriel: Okay, here's the thing. If I ordered the tablets for you every single week. You have to say, Doc. Remember I take tablets, because everyone else is on the film and I the exceptions. I have a really hard time remembering

117
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:21.060
Mike: Oh, I could only imagine your workload in trying to remember everything for everybody. Okay, no problem.

118
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.340
Dawn Abriel: So I'll do the tablets and

119
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:39.390
Dawn Abriel: You, you cannot smoke a half an hour before taking your tablets, because if you do the smoking cramps down all your blood vessels everywhere. That's why it's so causes heart disease and strokes.

120
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:51.540
Dawn Abriel: But it, what it does is the network of vessels under your tongue that are supposed to be absorbing the medicine they get cramped down to, and they won't absorb it.

121
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:59.760
Dawn Abriel: So that first morning cigarette. I recommend that you hold off, take your medicine.

122
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:07.650
Dawn Abriel: And then maybe 1520 minutes later, you can rinse your mouth out because they don't taste good.

123
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.640
Mike: God

124
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.720
Dawn Abriel: Will tell me they taste.

125
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.740
Dawn Abriel: Pretty nasty.

126
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.360
Mike: Got it. So today I don't take any drugs today well

127
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.220
Dawn Abriel: If you do, no.

128
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.390
Dawn Abriel: No, no, Mike. Remember I said, You've got to have those 12 hours.

129
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:33.450
Mike: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I wanted to know. So like from like I took something this morning at eight. So I would at least one away. And then at eight o'clock tonight, I would be able to take this Suboxone

130
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.590
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, just take one tablet and then tomorrow morning.

131
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:43.590
Dawn Abriel: If you, if you're noticing some withdrawal. Then take both of them.

132
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:44.430
Dawn Abriel: Take two

133
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.330
Mike: Okay, okay.

134
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.580
Dawn Abriel: And then tomorrow night.

135
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.170
Dawn Abriel: You're you'll come into the virtual clinic.

136
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.770
Dawn Abriel: A little, little before six

137
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:11.670
Dawn Abriel: When they're there. And there are lots of groups going on. Sometimes the care coordinators have to put you in a waiting room a virtual waiting room until they can get to you because they're processing. A lot of people all at once.

138
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.940
Dawn Abriel: So, the earlier you can get in there, then they can give you the group room number because the group room changes every week, the number changes every week.

139
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:39.360
Mike: Um, so, okay, so that I take my medication in the morning and then I go to work I work 10 hour shift. So am I, is that, you know, last week through my entire workshop or do I need to take something with me because like I said it's a 10 hour shift.

140
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:50.220
Dawn Abriel: Right, so this medicine is a long acting opioids. It's it stays in your system between 24 and 36 hours.

141
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:51.270
Mike: Okay.

142
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.260
Dawn Abriel: So you won't need it again until Tuesday morning

143
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:02.550
Mike: Okay, I'm in that even if I'm at like two strips. A day or two tablets.

144
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.100
