00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.690
Brock Simmons: Did

559

Richelle Direny: So that's fine. Um, but thank you so much for responding. Now let me ask you a question. Is that like a good method of reminder

562
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.330
Yes.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:27.780
Brock Simmons: Used to the online doctor thing. So just trying to get used to everything and video call on and all that so

570
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.740
Richelle Direny: Well, yeah, you're gonna get real useful because everything is online.

571
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.000
Richelle Direny: I mean it.

572
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.780
Richelle Direny: For a lot of people because you're not driving somewhere.

573
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:45.750
Brock Simmons: In the crowd, that's my thing I've worked 10 to six that it's just hard to wake up, go to counseling. It's just, this is a lot more can be so that's why

574
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.180
Richelle Direny: It's convenient for you and it's convenient for me and it's convenient for the provide

575
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.510
Brock Simmons: Right. Yes. So it's a win win for everybody.

576
00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:08.850
Richelle Direny: The win win for everyone. The arm so let's just got kind of go over everything. Um, so how is it going to work now because you'll have to attend groups every week. Would you be able to have you gone to any group says yet.

577
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.140
Brock Simmons: No, no.

578
00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.740
Richelle Direny: Okay, and you say you work Monday through Friday 10 to six.

579
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:23.820
Brock Simmons: Yeah, actually, it's Tuesday and Saturday 10 to six. I got Sunday and Monday off. So, okay.

580
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:35.280
Richelle Direny: All right then. So, um, so I'm going to go over kind of some house rules. So typically you would log on the way the same way you do. I'll send you a reminder

581
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:52.800
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna be honest, I'm not always I'm on top of the reminders because like I will go over and I'll tell you. Okay, this is the time that we're meeting. This is the date so like I try my best to go in the night before. So, look at my calendar and send out reminders.

582
00:42:53.310 --> 00:43:01.800
Richelle Direny: Um, but I'm gonna work on like really true sending out the reminders. Each time a person has a session so that they don't i don't have so much to know shows

583
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:11.700
Richelle Direny: I'm the same way you did it, you check in through virtual counselor, because a lot of times you have to check in to ensure that everything is up to like whatever surveys, you need to do.

584
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:23.850
Richelle Direny: You will lock in that way. And then they will let me know and then we'll get on the screen. And that's for everything you're meeting with me. You're doing individuals or you're meeting with the arm. The nurse practitioner, the doctor.

585
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:30.570
Brock Simmons: Oh, do I put the two groups with you. And then how many, how many groups plus to individuals.

586
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:38.040
Richelle Direny: Well, the individual parts we will we will decide that at the end of our, our intake session.

587
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:39.150
Brock Simmons: So it's all

588
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.940
Richelle Direny: The groups will definitely be one. So every week.

589
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.050
Okay.

590
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:52.740
Richelle Direny: Yeah. The groups are once a week, but with me once, once we go over everything will make a decision, towards the end. Okay.

591
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:53.700
Brock Simmons: All right.

592
00:43:54.180 --> 00:44:00.480
Richelle Direny: Because I take into consideration. Everything I take into consideration work schedule, if you're already seen someone on the outside.

593
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:11.970
Richelle Direny: You know, I take into consideration. Now everything you always log into virtual so they know that you're there and then they'll let us know because we'll be sitting in this room waiting for you to show

594
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:25.500
Richelle Direny: We always ask that you're in, especially when you're in your group when you're in groups. There are other people that will be there that will be speaking about, you know, private things or whatever, they're just sharing

595
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:26.340
Brock Simmons: Right.

596
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:46.770
Richelle Direny: When you're in groups, we really ask that one that you're in an area that is private that you have on headphones, because you know you don't want anybody around to to hear what is going on and to you also want to always be in an area where you have the internet connection.

597
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.000
Okay.

598
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:49.800
Richelle Direny: And

599
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.190
Brock Simmons: Now I'm in the bedroom. So I don't have no distractions. I got kids. So I don't want them running around.

600
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.730
Richelle Direny: I'm right here. I got my door, and I don't have it, because I

601
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.810
Richelle Direny: Mean a lot office.

602
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:07.110
Brock Simmons: Buy a set of earbuds I don't have any of them at the moment, but that's no problem. I'll get them. So, yeah.

603
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:18.090
Richelle Direny: But especially when you're in the groups, it's definitely important. But like, I mean, I understand. I'm not going to be, you know, super critical and say, Hang on, because I don't have them on the end, but because I'm in an office.

604
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:18.960
Brock Simmons: Right.

605
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:29.220
Richelle Direny: Okay, everybody. Yeah, so I definitely get that and I don't necessarily go with some things in mind. So, but as long as you keep it where it's in a private area, um,

606
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:40.290
Richelle Direny: And again for the internet connection. They are recorded sessions all sessions are recorded session. So for the most part it is confidential. It's only the people that are assigned to you.

607
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.790
Richelle Direny: That are, you know, will be privy to, you know, information, but

608
00:45:45.090 --> 00:46:01.170
Richelle Direny: The only time that confidentially kind of walks through the door is if you ever expressed um thoughts or, you know, suggestions that you are a danger to yourself or someone else like you make any kind of threats, then, you know, naturally, that kind of goes through the door.

609
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:09.780
Richelle Direny: Right. All right, then. So let's get started in our little stem with our purpose of here now today.

610
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:24.990
Richelle Direny: It's not going to be an individual session, per se. It is just a gathering of information just a lot of asking questions background information and then towards the end, and then we will determine how often we do individuals. Okay.

611
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:25.950
Yep.

612
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:27.660
Brock Simmons: Just

613
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.280
Richelle Direny: You know you want to share how, how did you hear about bright heart.

614
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:45.240
Brock Simmons: It was actually a friend of mine that I've been going to therapy with that honestly care Mansfield, she recommended you guys and I was like, no. Why you gotta be kidding. But sure enough, you guys are real and legit so

615
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.680
Brock Simmons: Okay.

616
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.750
Richelle Direny: Oh, in the friend. She does. She does break

617
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:56.640
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah, couple of them actually they all switched. I said, Well, I'm gonna try to make that switch myself.

618
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.890
Oh,

619
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:05.010
Richelle Direny: Well, it's a pretty, you know, I have to say it's a pretty good program.

620
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:13.710
Richelle Direny: You know, everyone seems to really be invested in the program. Very different from being in a treatment program.

621
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.000
Right.

622
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.400
Richelle Direny: Now, wanting to treat

623
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:35.640
Brock Simmons: Um, I've been a treatment, off and on, probably since I've been at. I mean, I've been struggling with addiction for years and years off and on. I do good for a while and then I fall off. I started hanging around with the same friends again and

624
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.040
Brock Simmons: Eventually I just get back into the same cycles that I was in before so

625
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:48.270
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what are, what treatment center. What was the last time you were in a treatment program.

626
00:47:48.450 --> 00:48:00.750
Brock Simmons: Well, these are all outpatient treatment, nothing. And is that what should we do. Yeah, I was in New Beginning to Mansfield, which is just pretty much counseling sessions we go three times a week.

627
00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:08.430
Brock Simmons: For 90 days and then after that you dropped down to two days. We just basically took one day a week.

628
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.750
Richelle Direny: Okay. And that was the most recent one that you were in

629
00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.770
Richelle Direny: What's that it's the most recent one. You were in

630
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:23.610
Brock Simmons: Yes, yes, holding hands and then those three C's is actually the most recent one. I was

631
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.290
Brock Simmons: No, no.

632
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.360
Brock Simmons: I got a card. If you need a phone number or anything like that. Okay.

633
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.440
Richelle Direny: Um, and what. So what was your drug of choice.

634
00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.400
Brock Simmons: Which was heroin and opiates. Okay.

635
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.920
Richelle Direny: Okay not not alcohol just heroin.

636
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:52.290
Brock Simmons: And cocaine. I would say no alcohol. I mean, I've joined from time to time, but it's usually like a get together Christmas, maybe once a year that that i mean

637
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:53.880
Brock Simmons: I'm not a big

638
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:54.810
Thing.

639
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, and now how often did you use

640
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.330
Richelle Direny: With the heroin or cocaine or any opiates.

641
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:20.310
Brock Simmons: Opiates was every day. I mean, it was from the time I woke up, I had to have it and then from the time that I went to bed. I was pretty much if I had it. I would do it the cocaine wanting to study it was more of a more of a social thing.

642
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:25.830
Brock Simmons: A couple times a week. That's when I was bad when I really got into the rut.

643
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:31.530
Brock Simmons: But, you know, opiates and cocaine was really the biggest concern.

644
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:36.780
Richelle Direny: And you said that you started using when you were

645
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:38.340
18

646
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:50.430
Brock Simmons: No, actually, that's when I started receiving help for I've actually I started using cocaine. When I was probably 1314 opiates friends, a little bit later.

647
00:49:52.200 --> 00:50:07.770
Brock Simmons: But that became my drug of choice, because really, you got to have it. I mean, he wake up, you gotta have going to be sick, so probably 13 with the cocaine. I'd say probably 17 with the opiates purpose sets at that time.

648
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:15.300
Richelle Direny: What was the like the onset, you said 13 so like, what was it, um, you know,

649
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:24.060
Brock Simmons: What I've got steady using yeah yeah but same time 17

650
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.080
Brock Simmons: That was what full blown addiction yes 17

651
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:31.380
Richelle Direny: And

652
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:39.450
Richelle Direny: You you grew up to me with, you know, single family household like mom or dad or just mom.

653
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.790
Brock Simmons: Mom and Dad both was together.

654
00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:48.990
Brock Simmons: But they they get divorced. After some time, and that's really when the addiction started my mom and dad separated

655
00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.000
Richelle Direny: How old are you when the suffering.

656
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:57.210
Brock Simmons: Well to 13 my mom and dad was together and then from 13 or they were split up so

657
00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.830
Richelle Direny: I hit pretty hard.

658
00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:02.490
Brock Simmons: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Me and my sister. We both

659
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.170
Brock Simmons: Are addicts and it both started at the same time.

660
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.870
Mm hmm.

661
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.590
Richelle Direny: So it was a pretty pretty impactful when they be separated

662
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:24.480
Brock Simmons: Right. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. That's why I've pinpointed a down to my sister or deny and say that it wasn't, but

663
00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:26.790
Brock Simmons: It was

664
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.840
Brock Simmons: born dead. Just a second.

665
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:34.260
Brock Simmons: But yeah

666
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.680
Brock Simmons: It's, it's been an adult off and on throughout

667
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.900
Brock Simmons: Growing up, I mean, I get clean for a year or two and then

668
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:51.660
Brock Simmons: A fall off and I'm only about a month into my sobriety. Now, from the time that I was full blown using again.

669
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.650
Richelle Direny: And this is has that's kind of been that cycle.

670
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:05.580
Brock Simmons: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. For the past two to three years. A couple years by the last five years, I would

671
00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:18.480
Brock Simmons: Do good cuz I got a wife and children. So they like should get fed up with my BS and then I'll leave and then that's really when I began to get bad loved

672
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:19.650
Hearing

673
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:28.320
Brock Simmons: I'm actually not married. We've been together 12 years I say my wife, because we've been together so long but we ain't married yet.

674
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.110

684
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:22.770
Brock Simmons: My oldest daughter lives by herself. So we got the two boys with us. Now, at the moment, not you, not you.

685
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.460
Richelle Direny: Okay. And when you said that your wife is are your

686
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:28.410
Brock Simmons: Girlfriend

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.260
Richelle Direny: She has no histories had no history of

688
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:50.220
Brock Simmons: No, none at all. And she, like I said, I drink every once in a while she does as well. So, have a drink Christmas or Fourth of July, something like that, but nothing that she's not a drinker at all. Okay.

689
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:58.620
Richelle Direny: Now THROUGH THE YEARS OF of YOU, YOU KNOW, struggling with your sobriety. Have you had any incarcerations any miss me

690
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.110
Brock Simmons: Oh, absolutely. I probably have

691
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:12.840
Brock Simmons: A QUARTER OF MY LIFE locked up. I mean penitentiary to county jails. I've been numerous, numerous times I put him in count how many times, so

692
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:20.280
Richelle Direny: And, um, and you said you and your sister kind of traveled the same path.

693
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:30.540
Brock Simmons: Oh, yeah. Yeah, same exact we're really close grown up because after my mom and dad's foot up, it was just me and her. So we're pretty much identical

694
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:45.360
Brock Simmons: Besides the fact that she blamed it on other things, and I do so. I believe in all my parents splitting up she blames it on something that happened to as a child. So, but other than that we're saying the exact same

695
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.610
Richelle Direny: Okay, she a part of

696
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.460
Richelle Direny: The box on program right heart.

697
00:54:50.820 --> 00:55:00.060
Brock Simmons: But she won't she won't get it. She don't like to survive. Since you don't like how it makes her feel we try to get the help and until she's ready. She's not going to get it so

698
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.450
Richelle Direny: And how long is this your first time I'm going on Suboxone or you've done in the past.

699
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:17.460
Brock Simmons: I've done it in the past several times in the past. I'll take home. They'll Weigh me down and then eventually do good for a while without them. And then just start using again.

700
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.650
Richelle Direny: Okay, and

701
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.640
Richelle Direny: How long you said you've been

702
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.460
Richelle Direny: In recovery now.

703
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:37.260
Brock Simmons: For this last yeah probably about six weeks, a month and a half. I've been buying some boxes off the street for a month.

704
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:38.400
Brock Simmons: To do.

705
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:44.970
Brock Simmons: Is to the heroin and all that. And I've just continued to taking so is either via them legally or

706
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:49.620
Brock Simmons: Continuing to do illegal activity to to get this up.

707
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.500
Richelle Direny: And when was the last time you didn't heroin.

708
00:55:53.700 --> 00:56:09.960
Brock Simmons: Six weeks ago. So it's probably be the I don't know exactly when it was after Christmas or before Christmas. So right after Thanksgiving, that's when I decided to get playing visit Christmas coming up and stuff. It kind of hit me hard. Emotionally

709
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.000
Richelle Direny: So what about what about the holidays coming up made you decide, okay, no one I need to make

710
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.880
Brock Simmons: What about it, that, that's when I decided to make a change, you

711
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:24.810
Richelle Direny: Know, I know I said what what transpired. Like, what was the significance in

712
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:42.120
Brock Simmons: My wife, not being able to afford gifts for the children and stuff like that. And it just kind of she come and pick me up one day and we was talking, and she kind of broke down to me struggling financially wise because I worked. And I've always had held a job so

713
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:53.490
Brock Simmons: I'm pretty much just there. And then, and she was on the last leg, she was going to leave me stop seeing someone else made around forever so

714
00:56:54.630 --> 00:57:04.320
Brock Simmons: I just decided to grow up and just get clean off the stuff like, I don't know, it's weird. I love the way it makes me feel, but also hate the person because

715
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:07.590
Brock Simmons: That makes sense to you probably don't.

716
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:09.750
Brock Simmons: It makes sense.

717
00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:27.180
Richelle Direny: The idea of any type of you know drug that you do. You're suppressing an emotional feeling voices, whatever it is that you're going through whatever pain you're feeling, whatever the situation may be your little feeling. So when you say that you like the weight makes you feel

718
00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:39.420
Richelle Direny: You away from those feelings that you don't want to feel so it's It numbs that it gets rid of that. But then the consequences of what you deal with afterwards is the z.

719
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.880
Richelle Direny: Oh, okay. I'm

720
00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:48.030
Richelle Direny: So I'm glad you took that step.

721
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:53.460
Richelle Direny: To. Yeah. Let's hope it's not how, what was the longest that you'd ever maintain

722
00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:00.060
Brock Simmons: Two years I've went to use of at total absence, um,

723
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:12.570
Brock Simmons: Well, the i mean i did drink a few times. I mean, like I said once a year or so, but other net total abstinence from heroin opiates was two years and then I relapsed again as well.

724
00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:24.570
Brock Simmons: I forget what transpired. At that time it was all my grandmother had passed away and I just backed up. One night I just went often used and never got back to

725
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.750
Richelle Direny: Your, your grandmother

726
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.400
Brock Simmons: Oh, yeah, yeah. My grandmother and my grandfather. They're both dead now. So

727
00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:38.490
Richelle Direny: What's that maternal or paternal

728
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.500
Brock Simmons: And maternal

729
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.050
Richelle Direny: Are both your parents are still alive.

730
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.920
Brock Simmons: No, my father passed away last year, my mother's still alive.

731
00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:57.210
Brock Simmons: Well,

732
00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.340
Richelle Direny: You said your mom and dad.

733
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.010
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah, she's an addict as well.

734
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.850
Richelle Direny: And has always been all your life word just

735
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:14.100
Brock Simmons: No, not all my life, probably around the time that her and my dad divorced. She had fell down a flight of steps and had broken leg.

736
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:23.850
Brock Simmons: And then that's when she become addicted to the purchase sets and that's when I become stealing them from her. And that's how I become addicted to the purpose sets as well.

737
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.440
Richelle Direny: Well, you were living with her.

738
00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.190
Richelle Direny: After you guys

739
00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:29.880
Brock Simmons: Before. Yes, yes.

740
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.490
Richelle Direny: Now, does your father have a history.

741
00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:44.730
Brock Simmons: No. No, he didn't. I mean, he drank from time to time, but nothing like he depended on sort of everyday to maintain

742
00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:56.970
Richelle Direny: So until from your for your, from your father. There was some alcohol abuse and mom was more opioid addiction. After you know

743
00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:07.320
Brock Simmons: My dad drove semi so he had to be clean to work. So he would just straight from time to time. And that was, he never did anything

744
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.450
Richelle Direny: On the road.

745
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:19.380
Brock Simmons: Yeah, he would go on the road for weeks at a time and then come home and that's when him and my mother was doing good. So it was a good day.

746
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.060
Brock Simmons: I say

747
01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:25.680
Richelle Direny: He was on the road working. It was good. But then he stopped and then it was just like, Okay.

748
01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:46.830
Brock Simmons: A pretty much. Yeah. I mean, when he stopped going long distance like this and become low pause when my mom was having problems. He didn't. My mom griped about him being going for weeks at a time. So he decided to take the local route and that's when I knew things was pretty bad because

749
01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:51.870
Brock Simmons: He was just barely hanging on to the relationship and stuff like that so

750
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.160

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:59.250
Richelle Direny: No ever not for you or anyone else in the family. Is there any UM, YEAH, MAN, SAUCE or attempt of suicide.

763
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:17.040
Brock Simmons: No, no thought or no attempts know I did have a little spell. I first time I ever got locked up. I did say that I was going to because my girlfriend. But long story short, I got locked up and

764
01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:25.410
Brock Simmons: I was trying to get out of jail because they wouldn't let me out. So I said it, but I never did follow through with any actions or nothing like that.

765
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.170
Brock Simmons: As when my family know

766
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:30.060
Brock Simmons: Where

767
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:33.360
Richelle Direny: You said you said it just to try to get out of here.

768
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:45.720
Brock Simmons: Yeah, because, as you said, well, back then, if you said that they would take you to the third floor of the hospital and then from the third floor of the hospital, you can leave. So that's what I was trying to get my way to the hospital.

769
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:48.150
Richelle Direny: didn't really realize like, that's not gonna work.

770
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.540
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah, it was the messed up situation, but I never tried it again. I'll tell you that.

771
01:02:56.430 --> 01:03:00.450
Richelle Direny: So, and is that the same person that you're in that you're aware

772
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.080
Brock Simmons: OH NO GOD, NO, NO, THIS IS LONG TIME AGO.

773
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:18.330
Richelle Direny: Now you said your father passed away. Did he fall passed away from like natural causes, or was he was, he

774
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.720
Brock Simmons: Yeah, he had small cell lung cancer.

775
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.170
Brock Simmons: Was within a year he died.

776
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:27.180
Richelle Direny: Was he a smoker. No.

777
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:29.400
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah. He's a smoker.

778
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.910
Richelle Direny: And your mom doesn't have any illness or anything like that.

779
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.800
Brock Simmons: She has cancer as well.

780
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.140
Brock Simmons: Lung cancer at the moment.

781
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.480
Richelle Direny: And she's a smoker as well.

782
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.400
Brock Simmons: Yes, OK.

783
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.850
Richelle Direny: I see your smiling here. How often do you smell our

784
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.470
Brock Simmons: Time I wake up I spoke a couple packs.

785
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.960
Brock Simmons: I was gonna like it up, but I didn't know if you mind it or not. So I figured I just want

786
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.410
Brock Simmons: Your house. I know that, but I just didn't want to

787
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:13.110
Richelle Direny: Now are you currently in any type of or do you see like an outside therapist or in any kind of IP program.

788
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:14.760
Brock Simmons: Moment.

789
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:20.520
Richelle Direny: Okay, and you don't. Well, that's right. You did say because of your work schedule so now

790
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:30.630
Richelle Direny: And earlier. You did say that there was a program that you were a part of that they, um, you weren't seeing a counselor.

791
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.650
Brock Simmons: Right.

792
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.330
Richelle Direny: And that was how long ago.

793
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:41.640
Brock Simmons: I would say probably four or five months ago, I would volunteer just on my own. Time to go and talk to them because

794
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:56.700
Brock Simmons: Like I said, I've been in recovery for probably 15 years now. So I know a lot of the counselors around town and on the probation officers and stuff like that. So I would just go to group and just be us with everybody. So, probably, I'd say four or five months ago was the last time I

795
01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.890
Brock Simmons: attended a session.

796
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:10.980
Brock Simmons: Really hard to keep up with all them and then work in and then the kids got appointments. It's just, it's, it's tough to keep that schedule.

797
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.190
Brock Simmons: I don't

798
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.260
Richelle Direny: Know that's I can, I can definitely understand

799
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:25.320
Richelle Direny: I'm

800
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.890
Now are you

801
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:44.580
Richelle Direny: Now, there was no with your children. I know you said there's no history of mental illness, no history of drug use there no history of past thoughts of suicide attempts, or anything like that would come on. Right.

802
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:59.130
Brock Simmons: Though there is no drug use, as we know what the two oldest. I mean, they are out on our own right now. I mean, we are a part of their life every day. But I mean, as of right now. No, there is nothing that we are aware of

803
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, and you're free you're all pretty cool. So you're pretty involved.

804
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:09.000
Brock Simmons: Oh, yeah. And we talked to him every day we go and see him or they come here, one of the two. Yeah, every day.

805
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.470
Richelle Direny: Were you born and raised in Ohio.

806
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.670
Brock Simmons: No, I was not born in Ohio. I was born in West Virginia, and then I moved to Ohio at probably the age of five. And I've been here ever since.

807
01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:31.440
Richelle Direny: Now are you older than your sister is your sister older than you.

808
01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:33.990
Brock Simmons: I'm the oldest I'm older than my sister.

809
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:39.420
Richelle Direny: And you guys still maintain a pretty good relationship.

810
01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:50.040
Brock Simmons: On. No, not the past year to know with me struggling with my addiction and trying to get clean. We feed on each other. We

811
01:06:51.330 --> 01:07:08.490
Brock Simmons: She sells drugs for 11 that's how she gets high every day. So it's best for me just to stay away from her to moment. So, I mean, I still over the phone and stuff like that. She but I don't hang around with her or anything like that. How

812
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.020
Richelle Direny: Does she look far or she was

813
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.200
Brock Simmons: She actually lives. Two roads down

814
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:17.070
Richelle Direny: Now, how are you able to

815
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:21.390
Richelle Direny: Get through it because she lives so close. She is a dealer.

816
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.920
Richelle Direny: And knowing that you're still very early in your recovery.

817
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.230
Brock Simmons: I pretty much stay busy with my time. I work, I come home, I

818
01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:39.390
Brock Simmons: Pretty much just focus on my kids. Instead of worrying about, you know, I used to worry about my sister all the time because that was my job.

819
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:52.500
Brock Simmons: Was to protect my sister and stuff like that. But now that I have kids of my own. I just try to focus on them instead of her and just let her live her life and I live on. So staying busy is my biggest problem.

820
01:07:53.460 --> 01:08:00.030
Brock Simmons: If I stay busy on okay but the minute I have a lot of idle time on my hands is when I started messing up so

821
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.760
Richelle Direny: Okay, and how about older ru

822
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.710
Brock Simmons: Four years.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.800
Richelle Direny: And how old are your children.

832
01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:50.700
Brock Simmons: Well, that I take that back. Yeah, he is not the mother I have full custody of him. He's to another relationship. I'm sorry.

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.730
Richelle Direny: Okay, like, Oh, you thought about her 18 years

836
01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:07.230
Brock Simmons: I'm just so used to tell them, people that just, you know, because she is his mother, he's

837
01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:13.680
Richelle Direny: Know, of course, like you said, the tool, year two daughters, even though it's there for children who refer to her as them.

Brock Simmons: Yeah. Yep. Don't. Excellent. Okay.

843
01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:50.250
Richelle Direny: Now one of the things like as you were expounding I'm trying to what helps you to maintain your recovery for right now, what tool. The tool you're using right now is for you to stay busy find something to help you stay busy. And what is that

844
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:53.130
Brock Simmons: I'm working

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.780
Brock Simmons: I know we have a lot of activities, you know, to house and hobbies that we like to do model cars we build a lot

846
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:08.820
Brock Simmons: Me and my son's do we get into that a lot. Me and my youngest son, we get into coloring a lot. We'd like to color.

847
01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:23.940
Brock Simmons: Just all kinds of stuff. I mean, we go Friday nights we have out, we'll go to the movies or something. When I get off work and just all kinds of different things, really, we do. Just stay busy and spend time together so

848
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:26.820
Brock Simmons: Actually, it works for me.

849
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:33.090
Richelle Direny: Now, and that's your does your wife smash.

850
01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:36.390
Richelle Direny: Your common law wife. That's what you're

851
01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:37.710
Brock Simmons: Right there, you oh yeah

852
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.990
Richelle Direny: Um, does she go to al anon or any kind of

853
01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:48.630
Brock Simmons: You did it one time. Yes, she did. Probably 10 years back. She we went to that course and

854
01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.670
Brock Simmons: Because

855
01:10:52.020 --> 01:11:04.080
Brock Simmons: I don't know how to explain it, and she wanted. I wanted. She wanted me to see what my Dixon did to have. So we decided to both take that together and we did, but he'll recently we haven't went back

856
01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.840
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um, but in, you're not in any kind of you don't go to any kind of meetings.

857
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.350
Brock Simmons: No, no. Not here lately. No.

858
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.490
Okay.

859
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:28.860
Richelle Direny: Um, so there's nothing like organization that you guys are a part of, or that you go, anything like that for any kind of encouragement or motivation kind of help.

860
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.760
Brock Simmons: No, we go to church every Sunday. And that's about it.

861
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.440
Richelle Direny: Well, that's an organization that's

862
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:34.890
Brock Simmons: Right, I

863
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:43.050
Brock Simmons: Was saying, yeah, we go to church once a week, Sunday that. But other than that, no meetings or anything like that, through the church or nothing.

864
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:46.920
Richelle Direny: So some churches, they do offer like recovery support.

865
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:51.540
Brock Simmons: Yeah, they do. I just tried to keep that out of the

866
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:57.300
Brock Simmons: Church life. I try not to let everybody know my business. I don't know if that makes sense to you.

867
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:07.890
Brock Simmons: And, uh, I don't know, low key drug addicts, you should say, I just, I don't like my business to be in October 720 so we just try to pretend like

868
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.480
Brock Simmons: Everything's okay. I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but

869
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:17.400
Richelle Direny: It makes sense. But I guess over time as we continue meeting.

870
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.440
Richelle Direny: Will

871
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.990
Brock Simmons: Yeah, but not at my home church. I would rather not so

872
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:26.940
Brock Simmons: Tend to others, you

873
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.320
Richelle Direny: Will be judged is

874
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.910
Richelle Direny: Part of the reason why

875
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:34.140
Brock Simmons: But yeah, I don't know what it is. It's just, I've always been like that.

876
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.600
Brock Simmons: So to keep

877
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:39.810
Richelle Direny: Keep it on the hush hush.

878
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:47.700
Brock Simmons: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I don't know. It's strange. I just I just them to

879
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:48.360
I

880
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.840
Richelle Direny: I'm now.

881
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:59.130
Richelle Direny: In you and your, your, your whole family. You're pretty active in the church, or just you just come and just go to church.

882
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:11.100
Brock Simmons: Youngest he's pretty he's after week, but the other older ones. A hitting the two girls not at all anymore 17 year old. He's hitting this probably

883
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:20.430
Brock Simmons: Have he'll go two days of the month we'll go two weeks out of a month, but he's starting to just doing his own thing. Now, too. So he

884
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:26.010
Brock Simmons: I don't showing for. I mean, if you don't want to go. He doesn't have to. So

885
01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.060
Richelle Direny: That's that's completely okay as well. Now, what is your hope.

886
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.580
Richelle Direny: In terms of

887
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.920
Richelle Direny: What would you like to, like, what is your goal. What would you like to work.

888
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.240
Richelle Direny: On

889
01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.280
Brock Simmons: During your, your rooted maintain my sobriety and then

890
01:13:54.810 --> 01:14:07.950
Brock Simmons: I mean, if we're going to continue to meet once a week. I mean another goal is I'd like to get my GED is something that me and my girlfriend's been talking about. So maybe I can strive towards that be a small goal for me and you doin i mean

891
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:23.730
Brock Simmons: Yeah, absolutely. Something that I've been wanting to do I pass the pre GD but every time I go to take that test. It's like, I can't pass. It's like, What the hell, man. I think I get nervous and I'm in a hurry. I don't know. I don't know why, but that's just how it is.

892
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:28.800
Richelle Direny: Maybe it's maybe a lot of anything is is anxiety.

893
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:40.260
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I get excited that I can't go to Walmart, unless it's later in the evening. I do have anxiety for that. And I explained that to Dr. Austin sheets.

894
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:50.490
Brock Simmons: I think we just brushed it off and got to another subject and never to talk about it, but I'm going to talk about it on the next meeting, and hopefully get something out now.

895
01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.820
Richelle Direny: Sounds like you haven't really bad if you have to go to Walmart in the evenings.

896
01:14:54.570 --> 01:15:04.110
Brock Simmons: Yeah, well, I don't know about where you live, but we're from. It's like, oh, my job. I mean, it's shoulder to shoulder with people is just bad.

897
01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.290
Richelle Direny: I go to Walmart because it's um it's cheaper.

898
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:19.770
Richelle Direny: Right Walmart does get me a little edgy sometimes because he's always packed and then the lines are never open lines are never open

899
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:27.330
Brock Simmons: Yeah, you got all them people and then they got three lines open. It's like, What in the world, man. I do the same crap.

900
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:35.130
Richelle Direny: Me go to Walmart and do I need to go to the register go work go do something

901
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:41.490
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah. I don't understand that. But we have checkout now. So we'll get to that.

902
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.010
Richelle Direny: I agree.

903
01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.180
Richelle Direny: But I love the fall, check out. I get in and out.

904
01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:54.930
Brock Simmons: Right. Yeah, as long as we don't if we got 12 items or less. I'll go do the self checkout. Now she's going grocery shopping

905
01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.600
Brock Simmons: rather have them scan it and

906
01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:09.270
Richelle Direny: Yes, but then getting your GED, it's a it's a good thing. Um, maybe just the whole idea of having

907
01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:13.230
Richelle Direny: Anxiety. It's a real thing. It does.

908
01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:35.040
Richelle Direny: See, and if you can identify how it is becoming an issue in your day to day life, then it can be a diagnosable mental illness and sometimes people like the whole stigma against mental illness like we all have mental breakdowns. We all get overwhelmed.

909
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:44.010
Richelle Direny: Where it becomes a diagnosable don't nice is when it becomes an issue or it's affecting your day to day life.

910
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.620
Brock Simmons: Knowing that considered a mental illness as a tool. Yes. Yeah.

911
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:57.720
Richelle Direny: Generalized Anxiety you you have generalized anxiety. Um, but it is considered a mental illness in there.

912
01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:05.430
Richelle Direny: Right, depending on how severe there is medication that you can take to help with it, but

913
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:20.910
Richelle Direny: It's just identifying where like their social anxiety, where there's the fear of being around people on reason the fear of being judged a fear of being looked at a certain way. So their social social anxiety. I'm

914
01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:29.940
Brock Simmons: Pretty much all of them. I mean, the way it sounds, my wife's been want me to talk to somebody about it and I just really haven't had the time to just get older.

915
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:37.380
Brock Simmons: So hopefully, uh, Miss Austin can help me on the next visit. I am going to mention it to her so

916
01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:52.410
Richelle Direny: Just talk to her about it didn't express like exactly like how is it affecting your, you know, how is it affecting you. Like, do you find yourself where like the person who has a panic attack that is a form of anxiety.

917
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:53.550
Right.

918
01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:02.130
Richelle Direny: So it's not a form of shirts, a form is anxiety. Like you just get overwhelmed. Like, you can't be around a large crowd of people

919
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:13.770
Richelle Direny: Are you feel like you can't breathe. You feel like you're being spiteful. That's where you're thinking about an anxiety attack, but their anxiety is or it isn't mental illness. It's a real thing.

920
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:14.970
Brock Simmons: Okay.

921
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:16.860
Richelle Direny: There are different forms of it.

922
01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:29.400
Richelle Direny: So if it is something that is affecting you and where you find, like you said you don't do certain things until a certain time because of the thought. But with even the test anxiety.

923
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:40.080
Richelle Direny: It's where you freeze them. It's like, even though you know the information right in that moment your heart rate increases, you get the sweaty palms and it's like, you can't focus on anything anymore.

924
01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:47.940
Brock Simmons: Yeah, and I get that quite often too. I mean I overcome it somewhat, but at the same. It's just very uncomfortable. I mean, it's

925
01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.670
Richelle Direny: It's like the fear of it.

926
01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.450
Richelle Direny: When taking a test like fear of failure. You feel like you're going to fail you feel like you're a failure. So it's the fear.

927
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:06.060
Richelle Direny: So, yeah. So is this something that you can speak to her about. Now when it comes on to maybe

928
01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:17.820
Richelle Direny: I don't know if she would be able to. Because my understanding, I think she's a nurse practitioner, she should be able to write a prescription for

929
01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:24.120
Brock Simmons: Miss Austin practitioner, I believe.

930
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.640
Richelle Direny: That's what I was told I believe so.

931
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:38.940
Brock Simmons: Okay, he might be right. I thought she was yet. My wife said that the other day and I haven't corrected her. I thought she was a doctor. Doctor psychiatrist or yeah

932
01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:47.820
Brock Simmons: Okay, yeah, I'm done. I did go through the blood work. I don't know if I should tell you until

933
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.810
Richelle Direny: When you, when you checked in and then

934
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:55.050
Richelle Direny: When you checked in. That's where they would have seen

935
01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:58.320
Brock Simmons: Okay, yeah, so

936
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:13.800
Brock Simmons: But I'm all up to date. I'll just get used to this face to face over the phone. I know the next time I want to have a little stand where I could sit my phone on and then I don't have to hold it the whole time and then

937
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:20.160
Brock Simmons: At the end, but that would be a lot better to I can share better. Okay.

938
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:28.950
Richelle Direny: Now, now I know you said that you wanted to work on, you know, your small goals is to get your GED. And then you also said that you would like

939
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:36.660
Richelle Direny: You know, maintain your sobriety. So when when a person like everyone in the program that's kind of their goal is to be

940
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:38.250
Brock Simmons: The main so it's

941
01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.410
Richelle Direny: What what our I'm

942
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:49.410
Richelle Direny: Outside of like the GED which God is more of a long term goal you kind of work towards that, because that's a long term goal.

943
01:20:52.020 --> 01:21:08.040
Richelle Direny: Short term is where you say, okay, in the next month, you're going to go take the test long term. It's like, you know what, by, let's say the summer, I want to be able to get my GED. And then you start working towards that you start making plans in preparation to doing that.

944
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.210
Right.

945
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:25.800
Richelle Direny: What are some other goals like what are some other things that you would like to get out of what in your mind when you say okay, I want to be a part of Braveheart based on what others have told me was in the program. What would you like to work on while you're in

946
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:34.710
Brock Simmons: I know my health is one. I don't know what that'd be a long term goal. Oh, can I be a short term goal as well.

947
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:38.550
Richelle Direny: It's your turn. When you say your health, what, how

948
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:42.930
Brock Simmons: Um, I actually, I have hepatitis B my use of opiates.

949
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.420
Brock Simmons: Been wanting to get the medicine that they have out for it which

950
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.850
Brock Simmons: I haven't scheduled appointment or anything like that. I've never been good at the gold thing. So this is kind of confusing today a little bit so

951
01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:57.600
But you're

952
01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:59.070
Richelle Direny: You're doing

953
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.640
Richelle Direny: That will be a long term goal because then you can make it short term in the sense that it is a long term goal over time as it's related to your health.

954
01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:17.910
Richelle Direny: Or term heart everything of goal is just something that you're working towards you say these are the things that I want. I ultimately want to have and

955
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:30.750
Brock Simmons: Keep my appointments with you guys and like to just keep make sure that I'm maintain responsibility, you know, because I've never been good at keeping appointments or anything like that. That's another goal. I mean,

956
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:38.700
Brock Simmons: I'm I have good intentions, but like I said, it's just when I have that downtime as what I really started messing up so

957
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.810
Richelle Direny: Okay, so keeping active getting involved in it sounds like you're doing pretty good getting involved with your family.

958
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:56.040
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah. They keep me saying it really the I mean they're not the only reason why I want to be clean. But, I mean, it's definitely a big motivation.

959
01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.380
Richelle Direny: Um, I mean I wouldn't let me see.

960
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:05.700
Richelle Direny: Oh you have Medicaid right

961
01:23:06.570 --> 01:23:09.480
Brock Simmons: Yes care source. Yeah, Medicaid. Yeah.

962
01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:15.540
Richelle Direny: So based on looking on your insurance and I don't see that you have a culprit.

963
01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:18.570
Richelle Direny: I would recommend

964
01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:35.670
Richelle Direny: If it is what is, you know, this is my recommendation ultimately make the decision. I would recommend, of course, outside of the weekly groups that you will attend and they haven't set that in stone is yet so they're still working on it.

965
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:41.220
Richelle Direny: But I would recommend weekly one on one individual therapy.

966
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:49.290
Richelle Direny: That would be with me. I do the individuals. And I also run the group with Miss Austin.

967
01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.510
Brock Simmons: OK. OK.

968
01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:58.500
Richelle Direny: So I would recommend that. And given that you said that your schedule is Monday or Tuesday through Saturday.

969
01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.240
Brock Simmons: Yes.

970
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:05.040
Richelle Direny: Okay, so we can meet on Monday, if that's better for you.

971
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:06.840
Brock Simmons: Sure. Do you have

972
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:10.500
Brock Simmons: Evenings available. I mean, it'd be better.

973
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:18.390
Brock Simmons: Anytime after 12 o'clock, as long as I can sleep till noon. Like, I tell my wife, I'm fine. But I like to listen.

974
01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:19.140
Richelle Direny: For you.

975
01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:26.430
Brock Simmons: Yeah, so whenever yeah evenings would be better. So, okay, let's get, let's get

977
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:36.120
Richelle Direny: And. And at that point, we

978
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.240
Richelle Direny: Will talk a little bit more about the goals. Okay.

979
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:46.890
Brock Simmons: What's that

980
01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.820
Richelle Direny: Next time we'll develop your treatment plan.

981
01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:51.810
Okay.

982
01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:25.350
Richelle Direny: We're actually gonna have to push you.

983
01:25:28.230 --> 01:25:30.390
Richelle Direny: Let's do our next session on the 10th.

984
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.100

989
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:58.200
Brock Simmons: I know you said mainly for group, but I'm gonna go ahead and get a pair of just so I can hear better because I am party here so

990
01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:02.130
Richelle Direny: Okay, do you have any other questions for me.

991
01:26:03.150 --> 01:26:03.630
Brock Simmons: Nope.

992
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:05.700
Brock Simmons: Alright.

993
01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:08.940
Richelle Direny: So do you have your when you meet again for

994
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:12.000
Richelle Direny: With Austin.

995
01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:19.050
Brock Simmons: Austin is two weeks from yesterday, so I will be me. I have it wrote down

996
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.770
Okay.

997
01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:22.440
Brock Simmons: But I do have it. Yes.

998
01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.530
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right, then. And I think bird Hartwell they will let you know when the groups will be scheduled. Okay.

999
01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.460
Richelle Direny: I think you froze.

1000
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.010
Brock Simmons: Are you there. Yeah.

1001
01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you were frozen for a second.

1002
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.550
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I don't know what yeah

1003
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:47.580
Richelle Direny: Right heart will let you know when the groups will start

1004
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:49.830
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

1005
01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:54.030
Brock Simmons: And that is what once a week as well. Oh, what did you say

1006
01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.890
Richelle Direny: Groups are once a week. The groups are

1007
01:26:55.890 --> 01:27:01.200
Brock Simmons: One one individual. And then one group, a week. Yes, yes.

1008
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:11.790
Richelle Direny: Now, not for me for the for the individual. That's what I'm recommending it every other week. I mean, it's what's best for you, but I'm recommending once a week.

1009
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:13.800
Brock Simmons: That's fine. That works for me.

1010
01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:19.980
Richelle Direny: In your recovery and, you know, like with the anxiety and just kind of whatever stressors.

1011
01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:25.290
Richelle Direny: I just based on just talking to you now outside of the anxiety.

1012
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:30.510
Richelle Direny: You have a limited ability to cope with stressors.

1013
01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:40.830
Richelle Direny: And I think individual therapy once a week, we can work on identifying those and you know getting through it and even though you've had therapy in the past.

1014
01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:54.390
Richelle Direny: Based on my assessment, just in this little time that I've spoken to you. It doesn't sound like you've ever really talked about some past hurt and things that you've gone through

1015
01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:55.980
Brock Simmons: But to

1016
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:59.430
Richelle Direny: tailspin he lacks that you've had.

1017
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:12.450
Brock Simmons: And you're right. I have my wife says the same thing. There's a lot of things that I need to talk about that all I'll mention on to her. But other than that, I'll blow it off and I don't. So if you are correct.

1018
01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:15.990
Brock Simmons: Yeah.

1019
01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:33.000
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, holding all of that in. And when it becomes overwhelming you lose, you lose all sense of control and what you use to control those thoughts and emotions that are unsettling. It's you use the the heroin or whatever it is that you use to

1020
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:33.510
Suppress

1021
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:35.550
Brock Simmons: The

1022
01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:44.940
Richelle Direny: Little time. I'm with you. It doesn't sound like you've ever really learnt to address it and work through it and get it out and talk about it in processing.

1023
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:54.510
Richelle Direny: Especially even processing, even the last, the biggest loss, you've had in life was when your parents split apart and all that was surrounding that.

1024
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.270
Richelle Direny: I think you froze again.

1025
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:12.660
As we speak, but

1026
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:14.580
Brock Simmons: You

1027
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.050
Richelle Direny: Froze for a little bit.

1028
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:27.660
Brock Simmons: Yeah, so I'm I think it's my phone not charging properly, it was close to be in debt is what I mean. So I'll make sure it starts next time and we won't have this problem.

1029
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.050

Richelle Direny: Okay, because I had sent you a

1042
01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:36.930
Richelle Direny: Message I sent you a message I sent it both by text and email that your session was at seven so

1043
01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:39.360
Richelle Direny: I was wondering if you back.

1044
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:54.090
Crystal Gatwood: Down 730 and I was writing it down as they were telling me my, I don't know how I got that mixed up. I'm sorry.

1045
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.000
Richelle Direny: I don't know. No worries. No worries.

1046
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:04.530
Richelle Direny: I think there's a delay in you hearing me

1047
01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:12.540
Crystal Gatwood: Um, I don't know how much of a big delay it is, but I can hear you just fine. Oh. Oh.

1048
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:18.990
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right. One moment. Let me open up a screen to get you started.

1049
01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.420
Richelle Direny: Your first time with bright heart.

1050
01:31:53.850 --> 01:31:55.260
Crystal Gatwood: Yes. Okay.

1051
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:56.850
Richelle Direny: How did you hear about bright hearth.

1052
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.770
Crystal Gatwood: Um, I was just googling

1053
01:32:02.970 --> 01:32:03.570
Crystal Gatwood: Or

1054
01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.290
Crystal Gatwood: At that point was kind of like in

1055
01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.410
Crystal Gatwood: A little bit of desperation.

1056
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:18.750
Crystal Gatwood: Feelings, the box doctors near me.

1057
01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.450
Crystal Gatwood: And then you can click on

1058
01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:31.800
Richelle Direny: Okay, before I move forward. Let me go over just kind of everything with you. So, typically with

1059
01:32:32.850 --> 01:32:36.240
Richelle Direny: Given that this is telemedicine are Tele you know Tele health

1060
01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:43.020
Richelle Direny: All of our sessions are going to be recorded. It will be through this

1061
01:32:44.040 --> 01:33:04.950
Richelle Direny: Platform, you will always check in, first with virtual clinic I let me check. I'm going to bring it up to see if we have the correct phone number. And if you have an email address on file with us. Because typically, that's how I try to send reminders of our schedule appointments

1062
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:11.430
Crystal Gatwood: To me just, they just my phone number with them so they might not have it in there. Right.

1063
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:14.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm gonna double check.

1064
01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:18.270
You said you did you just changed it.

1065
01:33:23.970 --> 01:33:34.740
Richelle Direny: Okay, well I'm going to double check to see what they have in here. Um, but also our sessions. I just said, our sessions are recorded so

1066
01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:45.900
Richelle Direny: You know, anything that you share that is suggesting that you are a danger to yourself or someone else then confidentiality kind of goes out the door at that point.

1067
01:33:46.410 --> 01:33:50.790
Richelle Direny: But for the most part, everything is confidential. The only thing that we asked

1068
01:33:51.420 --> 01:34:05.040
Richelle Direny: Um, it's a brave heart policy, but just even those for you know the clinician myself or, you know, for the provider that you're meeting with is that you're in a place where you have the internet connection, because of course we're doing all of this over.

1069
01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:14.160
Richelle Direny: Wi Fi. So you just have internet connection for the 45 minutes to an hour that you're me

1070
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:29.100
Richelle Direny: And that one for the group's you will be attending groups once per week on bright heart has not established when the groups will be yet. I think they're still working on ironing out everybody knows when the groups are

1071
01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:37.980
Richelle Direny: But when they tell you you will meet that same date and time every week, unless we tell you it's cancelled for whatever the reason is

1072
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:47.370
Richelle Direny: It's sometimes it gets cancelled if group just happens to fall on a holiday like a Thanksgiving or something like that, then they'll get Kim sort of course because it falls on a Thursday.

1073
01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:56.340
Richelle Direny: Um, I think that's kind of where they're heading for a Thursday. Um, but outside of that for groups, especially we do ask that.

1074
01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:07.950
Richelle Direny: Um, you have a headset in if you're not going to be in a private place and we do ask that you have headsets in just for the privacy of everybody that will be in the group.

1075
01:35:08.610 --> 01:35:21.930
Richelle Direny: So, so like when you meet with me, it will be one on one like this when you meet with Miss Austin will be one on one. But in groups, you'll see multiple people on the screen and you know there'll be sharing so they really just ask that you have in a headset. Okay.

1076
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:42.570
Richelle Direny: And the purpose of for the group's, it would be myself or miss Austin will be doing it together. Of course, it's based on our availability, what we'll be doing it together. And part of that is you're checking in to pretty much go over with her, um,

1077
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:59.940
Richelle Direny: You know the spring so she can order your prescription for the following week, um, you tell her what's been going on here, kind of like a medication check. And that's really what it is a medication, along with that I usually run a group, along with it. Okay. Yeah.

1078
01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.480
Richelle Direny: So okay, so you have any questions so far.

1079
01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.120
Crystal Gatwood: No, not yet. Okay.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:18.960
Richelle Direny: Alright, so the number I have here is 740-407-9062

1081
01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:21.060

1082
01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:24.780
Richelle Direny: Okay, and the email I have is

1083
01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.890

1085
01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:55.050
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Usually I like to send just so I don't have the issues of, you know, the no shows or what have you, because they forgot, or what have you. It's that I'll try to send a reminder through text or email.

1086
01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.580

01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:09.330
Crystal Gatwood: So I started Googling you know Suboxone doctors near me is what I think I put in and actually write our was the first thing

1108
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:22.470
Richelle Direny: Okay, and so you said it's the first thing that popped up. And so the convenience of it.

1109
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:26.280
Richelle Direny: Being telemedicine. It works for you.

1110
01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:34.860
Crystal Gatwood: Absolutely yeah like this perfect like because I have no vehicle right now.

1111
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.830
Crystal Gatwood: Like it was just like

1112
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.890
Richelle Direny: You said it was like a what

1113
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:47.550
Crystal Gatwood: Like a DOD sense, as I said, Yeah, okay.

1114
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.650
Richelle Direny: Um, now

1115
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:59.190
Richelle Direny: Now, what was your drug of choice. Was it just opiates alcohol. Like, what was your drug of choice.

1116
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.920
Crystal Gatwood: Just opiates. Yeah.

1117
01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.240
Crystal Gatwood: When did I start

1118
01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:14.370
Crystal Gatwood: Well,

1119
01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:26.610
Crystal Gatwood: I'm going to say, I very, very first started getting introduced even to opiates. When I was a

1120
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:30.810
Crystal Gatwood: Junior sophomore, junior, senior in high school.

1121
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.920
Crystal Gatwood: You got

1122
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:37.560
Crystal Gatwood: Into your very first opiate I ever took

1123
01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.380
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, and school

1124
01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:46.230
Crystal Gatwood: Very first movie I ever take that's how it all started.

1125
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:56.280
Richelle Direny: So it wasn't like anything that was going on. It was just like you were just introduced like socialization with your friends.

1126
01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:07.830
Crystal Gatwood: Say there wasn't anything going on me like just in my personal life. Mm hmm.

1127
01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:15.090
Crystal Gatwood: Oh yeah, I have a lot of my personal life just, I mean stems from childhood.

1128
01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:18.810
Crystal Gatwood: I had a really bad childhood, so

1129
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.200
Crystal Gatwood: I think that has a lot to do with it. Honestly, like

1130
01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:23.790
Crystal Gatwood: And

1131
01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:24.780
Richelle Direny: So when I

1132
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:26.700
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

1133
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:29.010
Crystal Gatwood: As I tell you to go ahead

1134
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:31.650
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, so basically

1135
01:41:31.890 --> 01:41:35.790
Richelle Direny: When you were introduced to the opiates. It was kind of

1136
01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:38.070
Richelle Direny: An escape for you.

1137
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.560
Crystal Gatwood: Absolutely, yes.

1138
01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:52.140
Richelle Direny: Um, now, what was your like for the opiate. What was your opening choice, did you do to air heroin percocet feels like. What was it for you.

1139
01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:53.970
Um,

1140
01:41:55.110 --> 01:42:08.670
Crystal Gatwood: Well, I said, I started off with the Tramadol and I just basically escalated to like it in two purposes to the oxy cotton back when they were out, you know, and

1141
01:42:10.050 --> 01:42:12.210
Crystal Gatwood: And then when those

1142
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:26.250
Crystal Gatwood: Pills get too high on the street or whatever and then comes the heroines lot cheaper and for some reason I've always steered away from heroin. Yes, I've done it like

1143
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:33.930
Crystal Gatwood: I just, I've seen too many people lose everything over that and i i don't know i just

1144
01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:36.510
I have

1145
01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:38.490
Crystal Gatwood: Been like

1146
01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:44.880
Crystal Gatwood: Heroin either on the frequent dose, like a free plan, you know, I mean,

1147
01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.880
Richelle Direny: You weren't you try you try, let's just use

1148
01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:53.250
Crystal Gatwood: Your, your goal to get like a call I would go get it.

1149
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:59.130
Crystal Gatwood: And if I couldn't find anything but it wasn't like my first get into gotcha, gotcha.

1150
01:42:59.910 --> 01:43:04.500
Richelle Direny: Um, now was alcohol ever something that you struggled with.

1151
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:09.540
Crystal Gatwood: No.

1152
01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.450
Richelle Direny: Have you ever been in any treatment programs.

1153
01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:23.520
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

1154
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:30.180
Richelle Direny: Okay, how many, how many treatment programs. Have you been in and one was your most recent

1155
01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:36.360
Crystal Gatwood: Um, are we talking about inpatient or outpatient

1156
01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:36.870
Richelle Direny: Either one.

1157
01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:37.530
Crystal Gatwood: Or the

1158
01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:41.220
Crystal Gatwood: Other so

1159
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:48.360
Crystal Gatwood: I mean my most recent one would just be, I would say my previous Suboxone doctor

1160
01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:54.450
Crystal Gatwood: They basically had a program. I had to do counseling. I just need a doctor.

1161
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:56.130
Crystal Gatwood: And

1162
01:43:57.150 --> 01:44:07.950
Crystal Gatwood: You know we are drug tested. So I would consider that a program outpatient program. And I've also tried

1163
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:10.950
Crystal Gatwood: The literal shot.

1164
01:44:12.630 --> 01:44:18.720
Crystal Gatwood: And that was back in 2017

1165
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:27.690
Richelle Direny: And so the most recent program, you said, um, how long ago was that

1166
01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:39.510
Crystal Gatwood: Um, I only went maybe two weeks, like in between my previous doctor and then getting on with you guys.

1167
01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:46.410
Richelle Direny: Okay. And so the setup was like this, but it wasn't, it was at a physical location.

1168
01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.350
Crystal Gatwood: Yes, I had to drive there. Yes.

1169
01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:56.430
Richelle Direny: Okay, but it was, it didn't. You're saying it the whole thing. You just went for a complete, total of two weeks and then that was it.

1170
01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:16.440
Crystal Gatwood: I'm well. The two weeks. And what about two weeks is what I meant was that a doctor. I'm just saying, like, that's how current like that's how previous it was, and was there for probably a year.

1171
01:45:18.810 --> 01:45:20.880
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you were with them for about a year. You're saying

1172
01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:23.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1173
01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:25.740
Richelle Direny: And how long have you

1174
01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.820
Richelle Direny: Been sober. How long have you been

1175
01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:33.900
Crystal Gatwood: Um,

1176
01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:37.650
Crystal Gatwood: I've been on

1177
01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:43.620
Crystal Gatwood: Suboxone for a little over a year now.

1178
01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:50.700
Crystal Gatwood: But

1179
01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.470
Crystal Gatwood: I had a slip almost two months now, but it wasn't obvious.

1180
01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.900
Crystal Gatwood: It wasn't my drug of choice, like it was just like a, you know, stupid.

1181
01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:05.610
Richelle Direny: What was it

1182
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:08.640
Richelle Direny: That you relapse on what was it,

1183
01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:22.440
Crystal Gatwood: It was freaking mess is what everyone call it. I hate using the word methods Mafi.

1184
01:46:25.230 --> 01:46:26.040
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know why.

1185
01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.580
Richelle Direny: So, and that was your first time trying it.

1186
01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.310
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah. Oh.

1187
01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.370
Richelle Direny: I'm

1188
01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:37.380
Richelle Direny: So,

1189
01:46:38.490 --> 01:46:42.000
Richelle Direny: So, so you've been sober for the last two months.

1190
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:45.480
Crystal Gatwood: Yes, correct.

1191
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:53.070
Richelle Direny: And what was going on at the time when you because you said it wasn't your drug of choice. So you didn't have against

1192
01:46:53.880 --> 01:47:00.810
Richelle Direny: Access to you, who is where you tried mess as a fill in as a filler. So what was going on at that time for you.

1193
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.690
Crystal Gatwood: I there was

1194
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:29.760
Crystal Gatwood: I didn't. There was something to happen with my doctor, like we sometimes my appointment and when I was out of my medicine for a few days, it was there was a long weekend. And so I went all you know four days without my meds for five days without them. And I had some pretty hard traumatic.

1195
01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:34.020
Crystal Gatwood: Like personal things going on, starting

1196
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:47.880
Crystal Gatwood: And it was just so readily like easy available. Good. I don't want just, I didn't even go out and get it. It just kind of came to me. I don't know.

1197
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:50.550
Richelle Direny: Okay, friends.

1198
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:57.900
Crystal Gatwood: And I was somebody a brand that I have not seen in a while, see me.

1199
01:47:59.100 --> 01:47:59.580
Crystal Gatwood: And

1200
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:05.580
Crystal Gatwood: Like we just kind of bumped into each other and then I didn't even know they were

1201
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:20.790
Crystal Gatwood: You know, doing anything like that. So I invited her and her daughter, because I have a little one, too. I invited them over for dinner. And that way, it's the play and

1202
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:22.650
Crystal Gatwood: Kind of

1203
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:24.630
Crystal Gatwood: She

1204
01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:34.830
Crystal Gatwood: Like she was my bathroom, which I like yellow for me and she's like, hey, do you want any of this. And for some stupid reason I did.

1205
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.190
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean I wouldn't do it so

1206
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:53.790
Richelle Direny: You know, when you say it's a stupid reason it's it wasn't stupid for you at the time because it was the answer to the way for you to cope. But what you were going through at that time.

1207
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:57.780
Crystal Gatwood: I think it was. Yeah.

1208
01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.210
Richelle Direny: Cuz you said that you were on like a

1209
01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.410
medic then

1210
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:04.440
Crystal Gatwood: The personal and

1211
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:15.840
Crystal Gatwood: So I'm kind of still going through the personal things trying to pick up, you know, put my life back together.

1212
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:20.970
Richelle Direny: So do you still think you're in a vulnerable state.

1213
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.780
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I

1214
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:31.770
Crystal Gatwood: Cut the ties there. And then I

1215
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.770
Crystal Gatwood: Spoke more talk to her.

1216
01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:44.070
Crystal Gatwood: So see it. I don't really hear about it. I don't really

1217
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:48.570
Crystal Gatwood: I don't really go big, and for that either, you know,

1218
01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:55.980
Crystal Gatwood: I usually do really good if I just have my medicine like I'm usually pretty good.

1219
01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:04.200
Crystal Gatwood: We like my vehicle. My only vehicle and

1220
01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:13.080
Crystal Gatwood: That was just like a domino effect of like everything around me like losing my whole stability.

1221
01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:22.770
Crystal Gatwood: You know, I lost my car. So I could make it to work. And if I'm not working on not have any money coming in of not having my camera down. I can't pay the rent is that, you know, just going to go on.

1222
01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:24.930
Richelle Direny: Before

1223
01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:39.810
Richelle Direny: Abdominal. It's like a catalyst. You can't pay the rent. You can't go grocery shopping. You can't money. Kind of makes us the answer to all of our problems, some degree, but it also gets us in trouble. But I definitely get what you're saying.

1224
01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:40.740
Yeah.

1225
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:47.430
Richelle Direny: I'm now. You did say do you live. Are you a single person you live alone.

1226
01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:50.610
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

1227
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:53.010
Richelle Direny: Now I did hear you say you had a

1228
01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:53.550
Son

1229
01:50:57.750 --> 01:51:00.360
Crystal Gatwood: I have a little one. Yeah, I'm

1230
01:51:02.130 --> 01:51:10.260
Crystal Gatwood: He pretty much stays between me and my dad's house because we live so close together.

1231
01:51:12.150 --> 01:51:18.720
Crystal Gatwood: Helps me with, you know, if I had to leave before he goes to school drop him off of my dad's out ideal.

1232
01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:21.600
Richelle Direny: Okay. How old is he

1233
01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:24.540
Crystal Gatwood: He's five

1234
01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:30.000
Richelle Direny: Okay, and you're not in currently in a relationship right now. Right.

1235
01:51:34.170 --> 01:51:39.300
Crystal Gatwood: I'm honestly it's really rocky right now. Father.

1236
01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:46.590
Crystal Gatwood: Think I'm just to the point where I've just had enough.

1237
01:51:48.690 --> 01:51:54.030
Richelle Direny: Is that adding to the lot of your frustration in your current stressors that's going on right now.

1238
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:59.730
Crystal Gatwood: Actually, I think it would help it like

1239
01:52:02.130 --> 01:52:06.240
Crystal Gatwood: I think it would be better if we just, you know, went our separate ways.

1240
01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:09.060
It's you.

1241
01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:12.750
Crystal Gatwood: Know,

1242
01:52:14.370 --> 01:52:16.260
Richelle Direny: Never have any history of addiction.

1243
01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.690
Crystal Gatwood: I didn't like understand what you said it kind of

1244
01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:41.610
Richelle Direny: I don't know if you're free. If I don't know if when I'm speaking like I'm delayed or freezing. But I know you're freezing like you're coming through so much happening. So your internet connection is not very stable.

1245
01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:47.100
Richelle Direny: Now is asking me, does he have a history of addiction.

1246
01:52:54.690 --> 01:52:55.650
Crystal Gatwood: No, he does not

1247
01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:59.130
Richelle Direny: You know what, do me a favor, um,

1248
01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:16.860
Richelle Direny: Let me see if this makes it better, because sometimes some for some odd reason they said it makes it better. I'm not mute your screen mute your block yourself, your turn off your camera, you know, hey, press the camera button. So it just shows your name.

1249
01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.720
Richelle Direny: Try that. And

1250
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.870
Richelle Direny: Try that. Because sometimes it makes it wait

1251
01:53:31.710 --> 01:53:32.220
Crystal Gatwood: Wait a minute.

1252
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:35.040
Crystal Gatwood: No, I'm in the big box. Oh, wait.

1253
01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:36.870
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know.

1254
01:53:38.130 --> 01:53:42.630
Richelle Direny: All I see is your name, no, yeah, no, you don't see me.

1255
01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:48.870
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, I see you but like i don't see my name. I see your name.

1256
01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:56.550
Richelle Direny: Okay, no, but on you know on your video camera touch the video camera camera it's going to take. I won't be able to see you. Once you touch the video camera touch the video camera.

1257
01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.700
Crystal Gatwood: Oh, sees a video cameras not there now.

1258
01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.940
Richelle Direny: If you touch your screen, you don't see a cop.

1259
01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:10.590
Richelle Direny: Okay, let me try to stop us. It says stop video that's

1260
01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:11.160
All

1261
01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:20.160
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right. Let me see if that makes it a little bit better. Um, so I was asking you if he had in the history of addiction.

1262
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:22.950
Crystal Gatwood: No, he does not

1263
01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:26.730
Richelle Direny: It. Oh my god, stopping the camera. Now I can hear you. You're freezing

1264
01:54:28.650 --> 01:54:37.050
Richelle Direny: If you're ever mean with anyone, and in they tell you that you're freezing a lot, try to stop your video. Sometimes, however it does sometimes that helps

1265
01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:38.940
Crystal Gatwood: Okay.

1266
01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:45.960
Richelle Direny: Okay, so. But you said that he, he, is he involved with your son as well or no.

1267
01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:57.180
Crystal Gatwood: Um, yeah, he's involved. We don't have like a court order anything. This is all fresh what's going on so

1268
01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:07.290
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Um, now let's move on to like mental health. Do you have any history of mental illness.

1269
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:10.860
Crystal Gatwood: And I do

1270
01:55:13.230 --> 01:55:13.740
Crystal Gatwood: I had

1271
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:18.390
Crystal Gatwood: I'm diagnosed with PTSD.

1272
01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:20.340
Crystal Gatwood: Anxiety.

1273
01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.750
Crystal Gatwood: Bipolar two, and then later.

1274
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:30.150
Crystal Gatwood: On but I don't know bipolar to is kind of like

1275
01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:34.200
Crystal Gatwood: Saying thing as saying I'm depressed. You know what I mean.

1276
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:37.860
Richelle Direny: You're the first person who actually said that. That is very true.

1277
01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:44.640
Richelle Direny: Everybody. Look, I have Bipolar two, and depression, it could come

1278
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.630
right up in there.

1279
01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:50.340
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so do you see a psychiatrist.

1280
01:55:53.490 --> 01:56:10.200
Crystal Gatwood: I used to which I was actually thinking about today, giving her a call. I'm like, with my PTs and I see her kind of when I need to type basis and just with everything one on one.

1281
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:13.680
Crystal Gatwood: And probably wouldn't be bad. You know, I mean,

1282
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:19.260
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, yes. Um,

1283
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:25.860
Richelle Direny: Yes, my conscious or your, are you on any kind of psychotropic medication.

1284
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:34.110
Crystal Gatwood: Or just antidepressants consider those or all of that is considered an

1285
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:40.830
Richelle Direny: Oppressive back. It's an anti depressant. What are you on anything for the PTSD.

1286
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:45.360
Crystal Gatwood: Or the bipolar goal. Let's see. I take pristiq

1287
01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:53.970
Crystal Gatwood: Um, which is kind of like a mood stabilizer anti depression and then I take Abilify

1288
01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:54.990
Mm hmm.

1289
01:56:56.190 --> 01:57:04.500
Crystal Gatwood: And then I take like a low very low dose, because I'm on Suboxone I take a very low dose Xanax one meeting.

1290
01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:09.720
Richelle Direny: Okay, yes. So because of the mood stabilizer.

1291
01:57:12.090 --> 01:57:18.240
Richelle Direny: Sounds like you're on antidepressants. And so, and who prescribes it your regular doctor or psychiatrist.

1292
01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:20.580
Crystal Gatwood: My family doctor

1293
01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:25.800
Richelle Direny: Okay. And so, you haven't seen a psychiatrist in the past.

1294
01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:29.880
Crystal Gatwood: I have seen sliders. Yes.

1295
01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:35.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I would definitely recommend you know when you're able to

1296
01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:42.630
Richelle Direny: I'm going back to senior high contrast. I know right now with transportation and everything. It makes it a little difficult, but

1297
01:57:43.710 --> 01:57:44.250
Crystal Gatwood: Ray.

1298
01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:47.250
Crystal Gatwood: Such a waiting list. It's crazy.

1299
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:56.550
Richelle Direny: It is it is anywhere that you're in is the first. I don't know why, for a psychiatrist, the waiting list. It's ridiculous.

1300
01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.160
Richelle Direny: Yes, beyond ridiculous.

1301
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.100
Richelle Direny: Now you said

1302
01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:15.300
Richelle Direny: Well, your son. He's kind of young so it's kind of young to say if he has ever had a diagnosis of mental illness, but does he have any like a DD or ADHD or a DD

1303
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.460
Crystal Gatwood: There were actually like

1304
01:58:19.410 --> 01:58:24.090
Crystal Gatwood: I'm kind of just doing a journal right now wanting like of his behaviors.

1305
01:58:25.290 --> 01:58:32.160
Crystal Gatwood: And the notes that I get back from school. I can you know take them into consideration as well.

1306
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:37.830
Crystal Gatwood: But I hadn't been some counseling before my vehicle.

1307
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:53.190
Crystal Gatwood: When Bye bye, and that was seeming to help because he does have some a little bit like of anger and ADHD odd, as well as what they were saying to but

Richelle Direny: Now,

1329
02:00:16.170 --> 02:00:22.650
Richelle Direny: Have you always been like this, or it's just kind of since the relationship between you and his dad started going downhill.

1330
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:34.290
Crystal Gatwood: I saw more of it come out. Yeah. And I have to agree with that. But it really started when he was like, sorry.

1331
02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:37.620
Richelle Direny: I wasn't relationship kind of rocky then

1332
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:39.210

Yes.

1335
02:00:44.970 --> 02:00:45.210
Crystal Gatwood: Maybe

1336
02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:46.650
Richelle Direny: Something a little bit like

1337
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:53.310
Richelle Direny: The relationship, the disturbance in the relationship is having an impact.

1338
02:00:53.850 --> 02:00:56.250
Crystal Gatwood: See, that's what I say to and

1339
02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:00.990
Richelle Direny: I don't know. I don't know if he's ready for any series diagnosis and to be put on a

1340
02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.840
Crystal Gatwood: Slide and shove it down his throat.

1341
02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:06.870
Crystal Gatwood: You know, say I want him on Adderall and all that.

1342
02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:09.120
Crystal Gatwood: I really

1343
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.740
Richelle Direny: Sounds like he's

1344
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:11.340
A little

1345
02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:17.580
Crystal Gatwood: No, I don't want to take pills, you know. Yeah.

1346
02:01:17.610 --> 02:01:21.750
Richelle Direny: Sounds like it's more the impact of the relationship, it's having on him and

1347
02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:29.850
Richelle Direny: You know, you don't. Hopefully, that is not really seeing any your dad is not seeing anything negative to him to see that into his mind and then

1348
02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:36.990
Richelle Direny: A lot of the behavioral you know children don't necessarily know how to express themselves. So how they express themselves through their behavior.

1349
02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:48.120
Richelle Direny: That's how you know something is going on and it's like finding the needle in the haystack. What is causing what is, you know, like every time you go to the doctor. They always asked his mom and dad still together, what's different in the house.

1350
02:01:48.330 --> 02:01:48.690
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

1351
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:51.330

02:01:51.450 --> 02:01:54.570
Crystal Gatwood: Around you know a lot of research. Yeah.

1353
02:01:54.630 --> 02:01:57.180
Richelle Direny: Yes, it will throw out a diagnosis, a bit much right now.

Richelle Direny: So, but now in terms of your family maternal or paternal are both your parents still alive.

1361
02:02:45.150 --> 02:02:50.520

1362
02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.320
Crystal Gatwood: But it was just

1363
02:02:53.370 --> 02:02:54.030

Richelle Direny: So you said that you're in the process of saving up money through um

1499
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.840

02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:55.920
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you're doing little odds and jobs. Is that what you're saying.

1503
02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:00.090
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay. And your son is what in kindergarten.

Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

1507
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:14.670

1514
02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:46.140
Crystal Gatwood: It's. I mean, it's basically like a meeting, but I think it's even better because I don't have to sit there and look at other people. Hi, I'm on a meeting. Does that make sense.

1515
02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:48.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

1516
02:16:48.390 --> 02:16:57.750

02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:58.380
Okay.

1546
02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:35.430

1549
02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:15.000
Richelle Direny: Three. Okay. And if

1550
02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:18.060
Richelle Direny: Time, where I can meet your during the day, I'll let you know.

1551
02:20:19.050 --> 02:20:20.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

1552
02:20:21.810 --> 02:20:27.090
Richelle Direny: So for our next session that we meet next week we will really go more into the treatment plan.

1553
02:20:28.470 --> 02:20:28.980
Richelle Direny: To

1554
02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:35.550
Richelle Direny: You know, you talk more about like your what your goals are and kind of what we will start working on as small goals.

1555
02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:42.480
Richelle Direny: But it's definitely I think that you will definitely benefit from individuals.

1556
02:20:43.350 --> 02:20:43.830
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

1557
02:20:44.310 --> 02:20:50.400
Richelle Direny: We're from a weekly standpoint, I'm like you said there is a lot going on. Um, there's a lot to address.

1558
02:20:51.570 --> 02:20:55.170
Richelle Direny: And I'm I definitely kind of the stance that I take in my

1559
02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:10.410
Richelle Direny: Model of therapy is in order for you to address the person today, you have to identify the source of the past, that is continuing to create this catalyst into the decisions that you make today currently

1560
02:21:11.730 --> 02:21:23.250
Richelle Direny: We're often don't. Well, people often don't realize how our decisions on yesterday have impacts our decisions today. We are just all in the

1561
02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:23.820
Richelle Direny: Moment with

1562
02:21:23.970 --> 02:21:31.050
Richelle Direny: Given the moment we look at things in the moment, but we don't understand that those see will to our fire were unresolved.

1563
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:36.330
Richelle Direny: Hurt pain in all of that from yesterday.

1564
02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:37.440
Crystal Gatwood: Though you can

1565
02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:48.720
Richelle Direny: Change yesterday. Yesterday has already occurred but you can become more aware of it, understand it and learn how to work through it.

1566
02:21:49.770 --> 02:21:59.280
Richelle Direny: And not allow you to, you know, not allow the situation that have taken control of who yesterday still be that determining factor today.

1567
02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:09.810
Richelle Direny: Right, so like I'm a firm believer of it. A lot of times we use we kind of suppress um different traumas and different things in our lives.

1568
02:22:11.370 --> 02:22:25.590
Richelle Direny: And we use that. What part of what fuels your active addiction is because you use, whether it's alcohol is your drug of choice. Heroin pills, whatever your drug of choice is you use it to pretty much numb.

1569
02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:42.510
Richelle Direny: Your stressors. I don't want to feel it. I don't want to know that it exists. I wanted to die. And so we use drugs to suppress it. But then eventually until the, the, whatever drugs you use it becomes your mandate, it's like this big banding.

1570
02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:59.910
Richelle Direny: But you know what, in order for the wound to heal you have to remove the mandate. And so through the Suboxone program, I believe it. It helps to stabilize you so that you can work through the issues and over time.

1571
02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:04.230
Richelle Direny: As time goes on, you learn to

1572
02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:13.050
Richelle Direny: You learn to gain control you learn to identify your stressors and work through them.

1573
02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:15.480
Crystal Gatwood: You learn to cope. Yeah.

1574
02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:21.210
Richelle Direny: In a more healthier way, um, you learn that it's not everything that you have control over.

1575
02:23:22.050 --> 02:23:42.120
Richelle Direny: And so over time. Eventually, you find that the more you learn to cope effectively and learn, you learn to pretty much stand on your own two feet and get through each stressor, as they come. The less you become dependent on whatever medication that you're taking to help you stay stable.

1576
02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:43.350
Right.

1577
02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:58.680
Richelle Direny: So, um, so that's why I recommend and I am a big advocate, not because I'm a counselor, but I'm just a big advocate overall for counseling, because each person that I need. I tried to hear what

1578
02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:00.690
Richelle Direny: You said hmm

1579
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:21.900
Crystal Gatwood: Counseling has like when I first started going to counseling all admit you know I was like everybody else, like this is this is stupid. This England to help me, you know, but honestly like you know my medicine is one thing, but it's the counseling that really

1580
02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:25.830
Crystal Gatwood: That really gets me to my addiction like

1581
02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:37.890
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. You're absolutely right. Because the counseling helps you to deal with the issue that helps you to talk through it the medication only helps to keep you stable so you can get through it.

1582
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:41.400
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like so Suboxone is so to

1583
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.100
Richelle Direny: To curve, the cravings. Right.

1584
02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:54.780
Richelle Direny: So when you have a Suboxone does. So when you're taking medication and kind of like helps you to stable the emotion. So you're not like

1585
02:24:56.370 --> 02:24:56.760
Richelle Direny: We don't

1586
02:24:56.970 --> 02:24:57.630
Richelle Direny: panic attack.

1587
02:24:58.560 --> 02:24:59.790
As you're going through

1588
02:25:01.290 --> 02:25:06.270
Richelle Direny: So that's what it helps with. It's not the fixer of all your issues or

1589
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:09.000
Crystal Gatwood: Fix your issues. It just helps you to stay

1590
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.890
Richelle Direny: Stable so you can process.

1591
02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:14.970
Richelle Direny: And claim. So, um,

1592
02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:25.920
Richelle Direny: If you ever, like you need an extra session in a week or what have you. You can always reach out to and we can just, you know, I can put you on the calendar. Okay.

1593
