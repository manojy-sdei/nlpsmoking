Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did you try it off the street.

123
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.400
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's right, it

124
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.190
Brooke Sizemore: Was prescribed. It was like

125
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:12.510
Brooke Sizemore: Before I went to impatient. It wasn't like that's like a long term management. It was just kind of like that to help with the withdrawals and then I just got off.

126
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.440
Okay.

127
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So we use this box. What I'm sorry, what's your insurance. I didn't ask that.

128
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.980
Brooke Sizemore: Territory.

129
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.930
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So okay, so we use care source wants us to use the Suboxone film.

130
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Or their

131
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.850
Brooke Sizemore: Last minute

132
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:43.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Suboxone film. So, this what the Suboxone does is it walks yourself goes from one to the heroin and so it makes yourself think that they're getting the drug that

133
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:44.820
Brooke Sizemore: Hold on.

134
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.930
Brooke Sizemore: Okay, Alan.

135
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:53.760
Brooke Sizemore: Alan, he keeps calling. I think maybe he's trying to get hold of you or is outside or something. And he's interrupting this thing.

136
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.840
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So the stop sign. Well, tell yourself that that's what you

137
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.320
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Don't make yourself think that that's what they are getting so they won't afraid that heroin anymore. Okay.

138
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:18.600
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So the Methadone that you were on and the Suboxone they work in different way, but they both can do this thing. So just like with methadone. Some people get really constipated with methadone, because of the way

139
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.500
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's action so you can get constipated with Suboxone too.

140
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:39.360
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So make sure you're drinking a lot of fluid, a lot of water, you know, increase your intake of fiber. Eat fresh fruits, fresh, fresh vegetables, that kind of thing. And you can even get a stool softener at the drugstore, or even like at a Walmart or

141
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.870
Something

142
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.190
Jill Beavers-Kirby: To help keep that keep yourself going regularly.

143
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.980
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm just

144
00:10:52.290 --> 00:11:06.600
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Alright, so we'll start you're on some Suboxone and what we need to do we need to figure out what your dose is going to be. And to do that, what I'm going to do is I'll call in the Suboxone to your pharmacy.

145
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.220
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And you will also get

146
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:14.670
Jill Beavers-Kirby: This written down from our care coordinators, because it's just so you have a piece of paper with it in front of you.

147
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:26.040
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So what you're going to do is you're gonna wait until you're in withdrawal. Okay, so, you know, you're going to feel bad, your eyes are going to water your nose is going to run

148
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.090
Brooke Sizemore: You know, you might have

149
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:35.100
Jill Beavers-Kirby: goosebumps, you know. So when you start to feel like you're in in withdrawal, not a little bit. We want you to feel and withdraw.

150
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.930
Jill Beavers-Kirby: To take a half a film. So you put it in between your cheek and gum or under your tongue and you let it dissolve.

151
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:49.620
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And it takes about 20 minutes or two for you to start feeling the effects. So after you know

152
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:56.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: 20 minutes you're going to start feeling some of the effects. And then, you know, it's going to go out through your bloodstream. So you're going to take

153
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:07.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The first half of the film. And then you're going to see how you feel and about four hours. And so in four hours if you still feel bad crappy icky.

154
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.530
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I want you to go ahead and take

155
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.910
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Take another half of film.

156
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.480
Jill Beavers-Kirby: See how you're doing.

157
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Again, same way you put it between your cheek and gum or under your tongue and let it dissolve.

158
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:34.620
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then that's kind of how we figure out the dough. So you're going to wait a few more hours. See how you feel if you still feel bad. You're going to take a half of film.

159
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:43.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And so you're going to do this for the first couple of days until you figure out that, hey, I feel good after I take one film or, you know, I

160
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.450
Jill Beavers-Kirby: After I take one and a half films or whatever that dose is going to be for you. Everybody's different. It has nothing to do with

161
00:12:52.110 --> 00:13:05.460
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How much drug you've done in the past how long you've been on medicine has nothing to do with that. It's how your body is going to metabolize this medicine. So your those might be different than somebody else's dose. Okay.

162
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:15.090
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, and that's totally fine. So the next time we meet you and I will talk about that, like, Hey, how are you doing, how, how did you do, you know, on your start

163
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:21.360
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How many films. You can a day to feel good and everything. And so you'll let me know that and that's that'll be the dose that we start

164
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.050
Brooke Sizemore: Out on

165
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:31.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So right now, and you know, I'm going to call you in some film so that you you'll have enough that we can figure that out. Going forward through the next week. Okay.

166
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:37.170
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, and then bright heart health. They do group counseling.

167
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.700
Yeah, so

168
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:51.600
Jill Beavers-Kirby: We have our counseling meetings on Wednesdays at one o'clock in the afternoon. It'll be just like this. But it'll be myself a therapist and

169
00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:06.540
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A few patients and we talked about how the week went how everybody is doing, how we're managing if there's any changes we need to make with anybody's medications, all of that information. And we talked about that during the group. Okay.

170
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.610
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Thursday Wednesday's

171
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.450

173
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.250
Brooke Sizemore: Okay, okay.

174
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:25.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, so that's kind of what we put the medicines there. There's a couple other medicines we can talk about

175
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:35.070
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Some people feel like nervous or antsy inside when they're not taking heroin like inside their, their bodies.

176
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: If you have that problem.

177
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:49.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Just let me know and we can try something called Clonidine, and even just a little Clonidine tends to work. So, um, you know, we can definitely try that. If you run into that problem.

178
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.380
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Like I said, that's kind of what we do for the medicine part

179
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.690
Brooke Sizemore: Let me

Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then are you on disability or
