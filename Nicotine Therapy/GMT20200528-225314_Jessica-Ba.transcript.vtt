00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.860

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Refresh my memory. Where's your, what's your ethnicity, where, where are you in your family.

41
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.610
Windy Borjas: I'm Native American, I was born in Idaho.

42
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.890
Windy Borjas: And I'm sure Tony and tailor.

43
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.690
Your what

44
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.610
Windy Borjas: She's shown me and

45
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, tell me more about that culture. I'm always curious to learn about the Native American culture.

46
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.900
Windy Borjas: Um,

47
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.030
Windy Borjas: Are

48
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want you can stop the video. I wonder if I hear you better. There's no video

49
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.020
Windy Borjas: Most part

50
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.160
Windy Borjas: Can you hear me.

51
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.060
Yeah.

52
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.090
Windy Borjas: Is the connection better

53
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes. Okay.

54
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:50.130
Windy Borjas: I don't know what happened there, but I just notice my Wi Fi switch about to mind, it must have switched to

55
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.880
Windy Borjas: To the hotspot on the phone. That's probably why it

56
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: will last a big different degrees so much better. Okay.

57
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you're telling me about your culture.

58
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.000
Windy Borjas: Oh yeah, I'm here.

59
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.720
Windy Borjas: Here's the phone.

60
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.630
Windy Borjas: Taylor is a tribal Indians and she showed me his Pueblo Indians.

61
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.120
Windy Borjas: So, I mean,

62
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.150
Windy Borjas: They're pretty much the same. I guess like

63
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:36.870
Windy Borjas: In Espanola where I'm from that Pueblo. That's the table. A part of me. They have like the feast days and stuff like there's one in July, or one in June and one in August and their traditional foods like the end inbred

64
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.740
Windy Borjas: Like red chili, plus all

65
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.080
Windy Borjas: That kind of stuff.

66
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.640
Windy Borjas: They're more

67
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.690
Windy Borjas: Like Spanish ethnicity. To me, like in my views. Anyways, their foods are more similar.

68
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.180
Windy Borjas: As for tribal. They're like,

69
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.170
Windy Borjas: fry bread and buffalo me like totally different.

70
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Uh, you have your part of both of those cultures.

71
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm Hmm. Interesting.

72
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.970
Windy Borjas: Yeah.

73
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.580
Windy Borjas: I'm full Native American, but totally different versions of it, I guess.

74
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:32.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Melting Pot of different values, different viewpoints. So tell me, what were some of the values or the viewpoints when it comes to women in the Native American culture.

75
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.230
Windy Borjas: From both

76
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.240
Windy Borjas: Both

77
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.440
Windy Borjas: Sides. I think they're pretty much the same.

78
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:55.230
Windy Borjas: I think about like everything I've learned on them and stuff like just the roles of each of male and female. And I mean,

79
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.570
Windy Borjas: They don't differ very much

80
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.710
Windy Borjas: Just like

81
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.950
Windy Borjas: The homemaker. The, the don't want to say provider, but in the home.

82
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.840
Windy Borjas: I mean,

83
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.360
Windy Borjas: On both sides.

84
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:19.230
Windy Borjas: I feel they view, you know, like the woman is supposed to prepare the food and keep the home clean

85
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.050
Windy Borjas: And, you know, comfortable

86
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:29.010
Windy Borjas: For the man because the man has to go out and gather the food and provides the home.

87
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.940
Windy Borjas: Very much.

88
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.070
Windy Borjas: And they don't really know

89
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.210
Windy Borjas: Too much like

90
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.610
Windy Borjas: What do you mean

91
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I'm just always curious to learn about the different cultures, because

92
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.600
Windy Borjas: Different cultures, watch the TV demon, please.

93
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:54.510
Windy Borjas: I'm sorry, but it gets his chest out when you're like mom mom mom mom mom give me. I'm sorry, a diet. I didn't have to wait.

94
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.370
Windy Borjas: Yeah.

95
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.010
Windy Borjas: Yeah.

96
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:21.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So within different cultures. There's different like your value systems and the way they view things. So this helps me to kind of understand you better, as well as, you know, cultural influences if every culture has a viewpoint, or position about, for example, views about women.

97
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: views about religion.

98
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then views, perhaps about addiction.

99
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't. That's where I was going with my question.

100
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.410
Windy Borjas: I guess I

101
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:44.760
Windy Borjas: I couldn't really, you know, say like I knew from my own experience, like they're like viewpoints, like with for my example addiction.

102
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.740
Windy Borjas: Just because

103
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.200
Windy Borjas: I guess I've never really been

104
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.120
Windy Borjas: Part of like my culture or

105
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.320
Windy Borjas: Into depth anyways. You know what I mean, like,

106
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.550
Windy Borjas: I I know about it i'm i'm

107
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.390
Windy Borjas: educated enough to know what and who I am.

108
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.360
Windy Borjas: I've just never been in that group of people. Yes, like

109
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:23.100
Windy Borjas: I remember being in school and there's always like, especially at the day school and elementary because I went to school on the football down there in SQL.

110
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.120
Windy Borjas: And there's always like a divide between like

111
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:36.510
Windy Borjas: The group of kids that were into dancing and their parents were real into our culture they spoke the language.

112
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.160
Windy Borjas: They, you know what I mean. Yeah.

113
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:52.770
Windy Borjas: They stuck together and then there was the other groups where our family families were involved in our culture, but they're more of like, like the audience, I guess you could say like

114
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He was more like second generation, you know, and

115
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.560
Windy Borjas: It could be that it's just

116
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.470
Windy Borjas: That group I fill our families, our parents just didn't practice it as much as

117
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.520
Windy Borjas: The other kids would

118
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:07.860
Windy Borjas: Like

119
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To the culture, they were learning the language and the dances and all that. And we were

120
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.710
Windy Borjas: Just viewing watching them. You know what I mean like are

121
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.630
Windy Borjas: You didn't speak it flew in.

122
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:28.950
Windy Borjas: I mean, my mom doesn't know it fluently, neither does my grandma. So it probably does have something to do with the generational

123
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.330
Yeah.

124
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.370
Windy Borjas: I mean, yeah. And now it just seems like

125
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.450
Windy Borjas: Nobody knows or nobody passes it down, anyone

126
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I agree. I agree.

127
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.740
Windy Borjas: Cuz I remember

128
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:55.350
Windy Borjas: Even when I was young and like first second grade. I always wonder why like my my cousins and my aunties and uncles and grandma and everybody didn't speak it in the home.

129
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.530
Windy Borjas: They would hear my friends say like, you know, I mean, that's all they speak in their home.

130
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.640
Windy Borjas: And that divide that divide then didn't, it didn't like

131
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:12.060
Windy Borjas: Keep us away from each other that we didn't know that. I mean, we all mix and mingle with each other.

132
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:18.780
Windy Borjas: It was just, I noticed that growing up that there was that that divide between all the kids in the school.

133
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

134
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.850
Windy Borjas: And then from

135
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.850
Windy Borjas: Pueblo day school. I went to

136
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.820
Windy Borjas: Public

137
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:45.180
Windy Borjas: So I kind of left all aspects of my culture behind. Just because when I moved to public schools. It's mostly Hispanics. I mean there is Native Americans, their books and as Viola, everybody is pretty much like

138
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.270
Windy Borjas: Hispanic cultural base.

139
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.480
Windy Borjas: Like native Native American

140
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.840
Windy Borjas: And Hispanics are pretty much like one thing in Espanol

141
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Noticing that I don't know if you remember, Wendy. I'm from Florida.

142
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:11.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Born and raised. So when I got introduced to a lot of the New Mexico patients, I would have a variety of done the hat. They were from different Native American tribes.

143
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:24.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then there were others that were Hispanics and so I was always like, wow, that's an interesting fusion of different cultures coming together and I always said I want to just learn more about

144
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:34.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mexico, so that will my my clients, talk about it. I feel like I have a better understanding so that's that's helping me to understand the culture better

145
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.130
Windy Borjas: Yeah, it is. It is pretty crazy. I guess I never really put

146
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:48.570
Windy Borjas: Any thought into it but like back in Idaho, where I was born there shown a part that side of my family, it's totally different out there, an idol.

147
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.830
Windy Borjas: Like out here, everyone's pretty much like almost you could

148
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.870
Windy Borjas: Consider everybody Hispanic almost because that's, you know, I mean, we all

149
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:10.920
Windy Borjas: Speak Spanglish we all eat the same food like there's not a big difference. But like an Idaho between like this show me like Native American to just any other ethnicity.

150
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.220
Windy Borjas: They're completely different they'd all cross that line. There's no similarities between them at all.

151
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:35.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's an interesting intersection between the cultures and I'm hearing you say that bill you have kind of like a foundation foundational understanding of what the culture is there weren't as much cultural influences within your family.

152
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:45.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because they have adapted more to, I guess, America or, you know, or maybe even just the community that you live in that place a difference as well.

153
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.650
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I think.

154
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.990
Windy Borjas: I think I'd be more community based

155
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.740
Windy Borjas: On that

156
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Point.

157
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.330
Just because

158
00:13:53.070 --> 00:14:05.370
Windy Borjas: Like, though the vibe I guess how I would describe it, the vibe of like Espanola and just New Mexico in general is like it's one big community.

159
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.070
Windy Borjas: And it seems like anywhere else. It's

160
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:16.350
Windy Borjas: Just divided like certain people just don't mix it certain people or certain cultures. It's weird.

161
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.590
Windy Borjas: Because like out here in

162
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.420
Windy Borjas: Farmington where I'm at now.

163
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:32.160
Windy Borjas: Is totally different from like this and you'll area two mile area. It seems like out here like they're mostly Navajo out here, the Native American

164
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.050
Windy Borjas: There isn't a lot of like

165
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:46.890
Windy Borjas: Like mix native or Hispanic, Native if they're just Navajo and they're, they're really, really different compared to other Native American cultures, I've

166
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:58.770
Windy Borjas: You know, been around or gotten to know they're they're real it keep to themselves. They don't mix with any other ethnicities, or any other types of people

167
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:10.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So from your standpoint. What were some of the cultural influences when it came to religion. What was your upbringing, Yvonne system with that.

168
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.880
Um,

169
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:23.850
Windy Borjas: School. The only thing I could really say influence me cultural yes is elementary school from kindergarten through sixth grade.

170
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.920
Windy Borjas: So after that.

171
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.130
Windy Borjas: There was nothing. My mom, I mean she married a Hispanic

172
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:54.330
Windy Borjas: When we moved into New Mexico, like two or three years into us being here, she met a guy and he was Hispanic. So I think that and being I left you know my elementary school after sixth grade and went to public school and Espanola it's mostly Hispanic

173
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm.

174
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.720
Windy Borjas: So I think that's where I i

175
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.780
Windy Borjas: Kind of conform more to that culture than

176
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.670
Windy Borjas: My Native American

177
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.210
And

178
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's an interesting point will be settings and your environment.

179
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:17.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Kind of influences what you're going to gravitate towards and what you will adapt to because perhaps that's why, like you mentioned early

180
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:27.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Earlier the culture kind of gets lost when it goes to different generations because now you're your influences are from all of your different chocolate experiences.

181
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:39.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're putting this together in context. And it's like, Okay, what, what value systems and icon and now relate to my child. And then that continues until different people adapt to different

182
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:51.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: settings that become more diverse, you know, as we continue to grow and evolve our communities get more diverse. So then the language and the culture kind of gets lost because then there's so many different things you can pull from.

183
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.020
Windy Borjas: And that's cool. That's crazy to think about

184
00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:09.390
Windy Borjas: I've never thought about it like I think now with my daughter. Okay, so how my surroundings my settings changed it completely changed my way of of living like it steered me away from my own culture.

185
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.670
Windy Borjas: So I adapted to

186
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:19.350
Windy Borjas: Hispanic culture. So then, Adam even not even intentionally it'll just be out of habit. I'll pass that down to my daughter.

187
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.160
Windy Borjas: Yeah, she's

188
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.380
Windy Borjas: Half Native American happens, man.

189
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

190
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.450
Windy Borjas: He's gonna gravitate

191
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.080
Windy Borjas: Toward the Hispanic way of life more than they

192
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.720
Windy Borjas: Are cancel, then there's one more person.

193
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.440
Windy Borjas: That just

194
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.620
Windy Borjas: Forgot about or didn't forget book wasn't given the chance to learn

195
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That side of

196
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.470
Windy Borjas: So there's one more person.

197
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.030
Windy Borjas: That doesn't pass it down.

198
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

199
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.310
Windy Borjas: Why they say now.

200
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.040
Windy Borjas: Like my generation was like the cutoff for like

201
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.130
Windy Borjas: People passing down our culture like

202
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.020
Windy Borjas: In the table excited

203
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:03.150
Windy Borjas: cuz nobody does no more like my generation was the last to learn it. Our parents were the last ones that were trying to

204
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.460
Windy Borjas: Put a lot of us.

205
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To me, when I think of that.

206
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:16.770
Windy Borjas: You know, it is because I mean after a certain point, I mean all of our elders will be gone. Most of them already are.

207
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.160
Windy Borjas: Like I can only think of like maybe one or two that I remember.

208
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.820
Windy Borjas: That used to go and teach us our language in in the day school

209
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.720
Windy Borjas: And there was a lot of them. Now, just to I mean they're not going to live forever.

210
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.770
Windy Borjas: Yeah, there's

211
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.510
Windy Borjas: Those two people that are gone.

212
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.640
Windy Borjas: Nobody's and these new generations, nobody's trying to learn anything like that.

213
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: seems overwhelming.

214
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.400
Windy Borjas: So it'll be it'll be gone.

215
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.660
Windy Borjas: At some point

216
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.470
Yeah.

217
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:58.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can definitely relate my my father's Jamaican. My mom is African American. And so really wanting to learn more about the Jamaican culture.

218
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:06.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But when you have parents of different ethnicities. It's like okay one parent may be better at teaching the culture, either through their cooking.

219
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:17.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or, you know, religion, values and viewpoints. And so the only real cultural influences drag out from to make a culture was really the music and food.

220
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:31.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But my mom. It was the music. It was a food. It was religion viewpoints pulls all of those things and they're like you said, when I went to school. It was very diverse so mailing patient population.

221
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:42.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So now, was that intersect of all of these different cultures and like you say your social environments, who you hang with you're going to attach to those cultures.

222
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:53.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If your parents are continuously sending the message of those cultures. So now with children. It's like, how do you, how do you integrate and kind of merge.

223
00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:14.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The importance of African American culture Jamaican culture as well as Haitian culture. It's a fusion about these things. And now all of them will stick. There's one really one culture that kind of might fall to the wayside. And so now those cultural influences kind of get lost in transition.

224
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.890
Windy Borjas: It's, it's

225
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:25.950
Windy Borjas: It's crazy, because it's almost like like if you think of that and take it and put it into thought would like your family tree.

226
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm.

227
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.690
Windy Borjas: Almost like

228
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.360
Windy Borjas: Our whole like

229
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:38.370
Windy Borjas: Family tree is pretty much made up of a bunch of different like cultural beliefs.

230
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.910
Windy Borjas: Yeah, how they're changing. You know, like how

231
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.580
Windy Borjas: About with you and then with me.

232
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.870
Windy Borjas: With my daughter, it's going to change. So it would be kind of

233
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.130
Windy Borjas: Unreal to say that our family trees are. This is one

234
00:20:54.090 --> 00:21:04.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Piece mapping. Exactly. Because it's not just the culture. It's that individual that is now relaying that. What was their interpretation of it.

235
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because of your interpretation.

236
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:18.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know the Native American tribes that you're connected with is different from someone else they may teach different things to their children as you would teach different things to your child.

237
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what what values, would you want to instill

238
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In your daughter when it relates to your cultural upbringing.

239
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.770
Windy Borjas: Honestly, I don't think I know where to begin.

240
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.510
Windy Borjas: Just because i i don't think i i

241
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:42.120
Windy Borjas: point those out for myself and my own beliefs to be able to

242
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:42.990
Windy Borjas: Pass it down.

243
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.230
Windy Borjas: I am I wouldn't really know where to start.

244
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I

245
00:21:48.510 --> 00:22:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think the reason why this conversation. I love having these conversations about culture because our value system really guides our decision making what religions, we grow up in.

246
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:15.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, social environment and how we teach our children. So because my upbringing was so diverse, of different ethnicities was always important for me that my children go into a room for not everyone looks like them.

247
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:24.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where they're exposed to different cultures, because that's how you become more connected with people and you're not stuck in your ways.

248
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:32.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I think that was instilled in me to immerse with different people because Jamaica has you know Jamaicans

249
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:50.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: African American Jamaicans Chinese Jamaicans there's a broad variety Indian Jamaicans so I remember growing up and see my dad with just like phrase that always look so different. And I think that's important for kids to see the diversity of different cultures, so

250
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.460
Windy Borjas: That we don't learn boundaries like

251
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.400
Windy Borjas: Yeah, or like

252
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.310
Windy Borjas: Levels to place people no

253
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.660
Windy Borjas: One raises better than the other, I guess.

254
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:11.100
Windy Borjas: Because it seems like everything in life is just a cycle. I mean seems that

255
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.440
Windy Borjas: It just, you know, I mean,

256
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.540
Windy Borjas: continues to grow and go so

257
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:23.370
Windy Borjas: With that said, I'm sure. Eventually, like racism would become an issue again at some point in

258
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Time.

259
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.870
Windy Borjas: And I mean,

260
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.620
Windy Borjas: I guess not everybody's introducing their kids to the diverse

261
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.310
Windy Borjas: You know, communities or group of friends or whatever it may be.

262
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.170
Windy Borjas: Eventually,

263
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.270
Windy Borjas: History will repeat itself again.

264
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:43.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, because like you said your interpretation of the Navajo culture tribe is that they are just within their own community.

265
00:23:44.580 --> 00:24:01.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So diversity may not be as relevant to them as it would be to someone like you because you come from a mixture of having a Hispanic stepfather below, and then a Native American parent mother and your fiance. What's his that mystery.

266
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:03.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

267
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.920
Windy Borjas: And spend

268
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm. With a melting pot of all those different cultures.

269
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:09.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yep.

270
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.050
Windy Borjas: That is so true. It's crazy. I think

271
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:14.850
Windy Borjas: I think I

272
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.350
Windy Borjas: I would just want to bring my daughter up

273
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:35.940
Windy Borjas: You know, I mean, diverse because I believe there isn't anybody on the earth. That's better than anybody there's nobody that's higher than anybody or more important or less important. I don't think there's a divide

274
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.860
Windy Borjas: I think we're all equal.

275
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:51.780
Windy Borjas: And there's a higher powers and that's what we know. I mean, people, I think, put a face to religion, maybe as a comfort or something to believe in someone to believe in

276
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

277
00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:00.090
Windy Borjas: I think I don't believe there's ever been anybody that has

278
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.690
Windy Borjas: solid proof that that is God, you know the the Christian version or whoever.

279
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.160
Windy Borjas: I mean,

280
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:29.430
Windy Borjas: There is a higher power as I just said, and I think that's what I want my daughter to believe I'd rather her go through life believing in a higher power that's not there. And then to go and pass on and find that there isn't, then to live like there isn't and die and find out there is

281
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:44.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a good interpretation. So giving her something to aspire something to, you know, reflect on and column on in moments of despair versus having no connection or no belief anything

282
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:52.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That could be attached to your value system as well you know if your parents have that same belief about spirituality

283
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That may have contributed to your influence as well when it comes to your viewpoint.

284
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.780
Windy Borjas: Yeah, it could have, I think, when I think back to being young and like when I first started

285
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:16.560
Windy Borjas: Thinking about anything, cultural or spiritual. I just had a lot of confusion. Just because nobody ever taught me my Native American ways

286
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:24.360
Windy Borjas: I mean, there was a little bit, but after I left elementary school. It was pretty much just nothing into in my life anymore.

287
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.890
Windy Borjas: And I attached to Christianity. I think because

288
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:35.820
Windy Borjas: My step. My mom's first husband, his mom and his family would go to any Catholic. Sorry.

289
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.500
Windy Borjas: They're Catholic so

290
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.470
Windy Borjas: I guess I kind of went that way and then

291
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:51.870
Windy Borjas: Later on in life, like, and I was almost to graduate high school. My mom started going to Christian church, like all out of the blue, and she'd make us go

292
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.580
Windy Borjas: So I think it's just been a lot

293
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.540
Of

294
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.310
Windy Borjas: I don't want to say uncertainty, but a lot of

295
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.030
Women once I got that really

296
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.150
Windy Borjas: Nothing there was no like I don't want to say permanent. There's a word for it.

297
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.890
Windy Borjas: Consistency. Consistency. There you go. There's no consistency in my religion like

298
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.240
Windy Borjas: It went from

299
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:23.010
Windy Borjas: My native beliefs and then that was forgotten to Hispanic to Catholic and then that ended because the marriage ended.

300
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:34.470
Windy Borjas: And then my mom, you know, found the church, she goes to now so I was pulled that way. I think there's just a lot of uncertainty and not understanding, any of those cultures enough

301
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.330
Windy Borjas: To know what their values are

302
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:43.770
Windy Borjas: Is why I kind of in my own mind just created the higher power, you know, I mean,

303
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.320
Windy Borjas: I believe there is something greater than us.

304
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:46.770
But

305
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.250
Windy Borjas: I don't know what it what or who it is.

306
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:58.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But that's exactly, you know what you say how your social environment kind of changes your interpretation.

307
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:11.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when your mom, you know, married someone of a different ethnicity and balance the religion. She aligned with whatever those religious values work. So kind of like adapting to this new environment.

308
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:23.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And some people are flexible with that their fluid when it comes to different cultures and values systems where some people and that's why they won't go outside their culture.

309
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:34.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because they don't want to be influenced their set more in their foundation and their beliefs. So quaint outside their culture is almost kind of like a bit spread it to their bodies.

310
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:46.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To. I see. That's probably why her interpretation of what a higher power was our definition of spirituality change contingent upon whatever relationships.

311
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.920
Windy Borjas: And it's crazy because

312
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.150
Windy Borjas: That makes me think about just like the world in general like that divide

313
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.880
Windy Borjas: Like that divide

314
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:14.220
Windy Borjas: Could I mean if you thought about it and put it into aspect of like just just as wars and fighting and all that, like throughout the world, like if people would conform to different people and different religions.

315
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:22.380
Windy Borjas: Then love would make the world go around because I think that was the original saying they say Money makes the world go down, but I just don't believe that.

316
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:31.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some of them under understanding and even if you know there may not be a personal connection. There's a respect for that.

317
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:39.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know the little different cultures that I was associated with one of Native American but

318
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That brings out that curiosity, even more so to want to learn about it so that interest in that respect for the differences in upbringings is what allows for conversations like this to happen.

319
00:29:51.900 --> 00:30:00.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because now, no one's kind of, you know, I'm not trying to convince you about my Jamaican, you know, culture, you're not trying to, we're just now in a place of educating

320
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:10.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sharing and through that were both having those aha moments like you know because when you talk about how you went to elementary school and then you think

321
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:22.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, that's probably why the Jamaican culture kind of got a little pushed to the back burner, because now my influences more Haitian culture.

322
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:30.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So sometimes I can be in a room with Jamaicans and they're speaking patois, and sometimes I don't understand everything. I'm like, trying to keep up.

323
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I feel a little guilty that I don't really understand like, this is your culture. This is within your bloodline your DNA, you don't understand everything but also my upbringing and my social interactions plays a huge part in what I will know about my culture.

324
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:51.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

325
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.720
Windy Borjas: It is

326
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: True, because

327
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.960
Windy Borjas: I remember I used to know

328
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.670
Windy Borjas: Taylor and Shawn both languages.

329
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:05.400
Windy Borjas: And I never knew Spanish. I only knew my to cultural languages, English

330
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.160
Windy Borjas: And I think that I stopped.

331
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.640
Windy Borjas: Being taught. She's shown me when I was like

332
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:12.900
Like

333
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.480
Windy Borjas: Six. I think

334
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:24.300
Windy Borjas: And it completely it completely died out. I do not know the language Omar, and that's that I used to be able to count to 100 and everything.

335
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.550
Windy Borjas: And take a walk.

336
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:38.250
Windy Borjas: I will stop learning, and being taught in sixth grade. The last year I was at the elementary school and I completely, completely forgot it. I don't know at all. No more.

337
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.070
Windy Borjas: I know numbers alphabet everything

338
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.730
Windy Borjas: And now I understand Spanish fluently.

339
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really

340
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.450
Windy Borjas: And I'm partially fluent speaking it

341
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can it for the most part, and almost right. It

342
00:31:53.430 --> 00:32:09.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hmm. So it sounds like social social interactions and engagement probably needs more to influences in life in general, then culture opinion on you know your influences

343
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:19.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because some people if that culture is continuously embedded within them, and they stay in Merced within that culture, then it doesn't get lost.

344
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:30.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But the common denominator is still being immersed still be connected with that culture when there is no connection. It's definitely going to get lots and

345
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:32.490
Windy Borjas: Yeah.

346
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:41.610
Windy Borjas: It will, and my, my daughter will probably continue on her path with more Hispanic

347
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.360
Windy Borjas: Cultural. You know what I mean, believe

348
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.490
Windy Borjas: That ground just because

349
00:32:48.360 --> 00:33:01.290
Windy Borjas: That's what she's growing up around. I mean, I'm not around my family. And when we do go I know she'll be real timid and scared. She's not going to just go jump and jump into my grandma's arms and want to stay there. You know, I mean,

350
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:09.660
Windy Borjas: My graph is the only the last one in my whole family that knows that side of our culture. I don't know anybody else.

351
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.500
Windy Borjas: She didn't pass

352
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:25.260
Windy Borjas: I mean, I don't want to say she didn't pass it down. We didn't take the time to learn. That's what it is. It's not about our elders and not doing what they're supposed to. It's just that we just the way of life completely changed in my generation.

353
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I guess they told us that my

354
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:44.550
Windy Borjas: My generation was the cutoff point our parents were the last ones. After that, we started on a new generation and we don't even know what we're supposed to be teaching so therefore it is probably died then. Yeah.

355
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:56.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. You mentioned elders, so does grandma ever might complain that, you know, there's this disconnect between the generations and and then not understanding the culture.

356
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:01.560
Windy Borjas: Not really. She's, she's said it a few times but

357
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:14.310
Windy Borjas: Like, she said, I can only do so much for what I'm responsible for. She said, I'm not responsible for the whole community. My responsibility was you guys but you guys didn't listen

358
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:32.940
Windy Borjas: She said, and I'm not going to spend my remaining years chasing after you trying to force it down your throat. If you don't want to learn, then you don't. She said, if I'm alive long enough to be able to teach my great great grandkids and start a new generation. She said, I will

359
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:34.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

360
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:41.220
Windy Borjas: If they put up a fight, and I have to force them. Then I'm just going to give up. She said, I guess it'll die with me.

361
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:54.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, that's a message that can be spread in all aspects of life, because what I heard is our responsibility is to her support network, not the overall community.

362
00:34:55.170 --> 00:35:11.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even if my responsibility is to my support network if they don't receive what I'm giving and all well so that can be applied in so many different aspects to when there's people that you know support a want to encourage they don't want it.

363
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, okay, you don't want it then.

364
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:26.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have the information I have them up to give a half the support, but if someone doesn't want it then doesn't take away any value from who I am and what I have to offer.

365
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, a very significant message that can translate it to other thing.

366
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.070
Windy Borjas: It is I never really thought about it like that, but it is

367
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.680
Windy Borjas: Because I think about like with my addiction.

368
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:53.160
Windy Borjas: I remember my grandma being the one that like I guess kind of made my mom like realize that there was nothing in this world that was going to stop me from using and

369
00:35:53.700 --> 00:36:04.410
Windy Borjas: Continuing to destroy my life and my health and everything but myself because she will tell my mom all the time. I don't know why you you

370
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:16.950
Windy Borjas: chased after her and try to force her to go to rehab and try to make her make that change in her life. She said, You can't, you're not going to change until she wants to change.

371
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:29.160
Windy Borjas: There's no point, no matter how much money you spend on rehabs matter how many times she tells you, yes, I promise. I promise not to do it in her heart. That's what she wants to do.

372
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.540
Windy Borjas: Yeah, and it was true.

373
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.460
Windy Borjas: And I told so many

374
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:51.480
Windy Borjas: You know, other fellow addicts recovering addicts that I've met throughout my recovery that same thing if you relapse and or you haven't even attempted or succeeded recovery yet, you're not going to succeed it and really do it until that's what you want to do.

375
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.460
Windy Borjas: Otherwise, I think it's a waste of

376
00:36:53.460 --> 00:37:05.310
Windy Borjas: Time. I mean, in my own experience, it has been every time, every time I was doing it to make my mom feel better or make somebody else happy, it just didn't work out. Yeah.

377
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.810
Windy Borjas: Only when I made that choice for

378
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:12.390
Windy Borjas: Myself, did I, you know, achieve it, and here I am today.

379
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what keeps you committed to the sobriety. What is your, your position.

380
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.360
Windy Borjas: Um, before

381
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.180
Windy Borjas: Before I had my daughter. I don't think I really had one, to be honest.

382
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:39.690
Windy Borjas: I mean, I was proud of myself for doing it. I didn't. It was just more of the I achieved it. Yeah.

383
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.430
Windy Borjas: And I mean, I made it through that.

384
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:53.250
Windy Borjas: Threshold and not a lot of people can do it in the time that I did myself. So I guess that was kind of the only thing that I really like took from it. And then when I had my daughter.

385
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.790
Windy Borjas: She's, she's my

386
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:14.820
Windy Borjas: Rock that yes, I try to remind myself of what it's going to do to her, or how it would affect her if I did relapse fully and when I mean put her through how like I have

387
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.280
Windy Borjas: My mom and my grandma and everybody

388
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:26.820
Windy Borjas: And I just think about the looks on their faces. They had on all the times I broke their heart like I couldn't see my daughter, looking at me like that.

389
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:36.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The prior to your daughter, it was you feeling proud of yourself that this is what I was able to accomplish in this time. So you took

390
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:43.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Pride in ownership of your sobriety. But now with your daughter. It's not only about your tribe, but it's like

391
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:55.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The impacts how my sobriety to influence someone's life how my addiction can impact someone's life. So, you know, I think all those

392
00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:08.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are a good fusion of value systems for sobriety. Because also having that self fulfillment and accomplishment that wow I'm able to maintain my sobriety.

393
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:20.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, for me, but also I'm impacting influencing MY DAUGHTER AND I'M POSITIVE WAY because of myself the discipline of my control and ability to stay sober.

394
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:21.960
Yeah.

395
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:36.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a good message for other people that are in addiction to figure out what exactly is your value. What keeps you committed to the sobriety.

396
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:44.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And oftentimes, a lot of people don't have the answers. And it's not to say that if you don't have the answers that you're going to relax the next day.

397
00:39:45.240 --> 00:40:02.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it's it's those answers is those values and those commitments that you will bring that keeps you when you're having a rough day and you think the easy thing would be to do this, but they remind yourself of this is the reason why I'm doing it first.

398
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:13.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's like those moments as a mom or you're like really exhausted and all of a sudden you get this energy to do something because

399
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:22.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The kid says something, or does something in a way that reminds you like it's not only about me. Let me get out of this. And let me do what's needed for it.

400
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:39.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I think that's that boost that that search power that people can get in there course of sobriety and they're getting lost, and they don't really know what's keeping them who need that shot me that boost that reminds you, this is why I'm committed to doing

401
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.660
Windy Borjas: I think a lot of people

402
00:40:43.020 --> 00:41:02.460
Windy Borjas: Forget like you know in recovery that it is that one little simple thought that can reverse you from making a big mistake or a relapse that you know i mean ends up destroying your entire sobriety.

403
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.980
Windy Borjas: I mean, it's something that small

404
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.130
Windy Borjas: For me, I mean, I still struggle with it, just because

405
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.880
Windy Borjas: Getting high is the only coping mechanism I have ever learned my whole life. I

406
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.220
Windy Borjas: I was never showed a different way.

407
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.220
Windy Borjas: Nor was I taught the right way to cope and I mean I didn't

408
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:34.890
Windy Borjas: I didn't get this reaction from watching anybody. It was just the only thing that I found when I was younger, that numbed it completely. I didn't have to deal with it.

409
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.020
Windy Borjas: I totally lost my point.

410
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.170
Windy Borjas: I was getting to a point and I lost it.

411
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now one fight that

412
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.690
Windy Borjas: Oh yeah, that was it. Yeah, it

413
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.020
Windy Borjas: It can be something that tiny because

414
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.760
Windy Borjas: Before my daughter.

415
00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:01.320
Windy Borjas: Just the thought of all I achieve this already. I've made it this far, am I really gonna go and throw a year down the drain for a couple hours.

416
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.000
Windy Borjas: That was a thought.

417
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:08.190
Windy Borjas: In I mean something that small can can really steer you for making a big mistake.

418
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.000
Yeah.

419
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.990
Windy Borjas: Because no matter how many times you tell yourself.

420
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:22.890
Windy Borjas: That you know one. Do I pot one little relapse isn't going to affect you. It can spiral out of control within those few minutes

421
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:31.050
Windy Borjas: It's crazy. I just now that I've gotten older, and I've paid attention like since I started with bright heart. I just

422
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:49.950
Windy Borjas: Paid real close attention to how I react to certain things and what triggers me like in depth, though not just off the top of my head. Like, I've actually sat there and thought about it. What was it that made me feel, you know, like I wanted to relax. Yeah.

423
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.690
Windy Borjas: And it's nice to

424
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.380
Windy Borjas: To be able to almost have it under control.

425
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.820

428
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:15.990
Windy Borjas: To react in a differently, like if I feel that trigger and I'm about to relapse or instead of running off and going and getting you know what bag, why don't I go get my daughter.
