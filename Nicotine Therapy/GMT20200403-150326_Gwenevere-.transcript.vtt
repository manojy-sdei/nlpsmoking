Gwenevere Abriel: Said him attacks will hopefully get a more address and emails, what we're looking for. So once we get that all figured out. And my guest. Oh, here's what I think he wants with communication.

74
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not going to talk about what we had for dinner. What he's going to want is he's going to want to know, hey, is Laura showing up for her scheduled appointments, is she working towards her treatment goals. That's probably all, Mr. Carter once well

75
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.870
Lauraluj87: The one the other night service.

76
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.270
Lauraluj87: She

77
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.190
Lauraluj87: She actually wasn't hurt at all my, I thought I was like oh crap.

78
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.030
Lauraluj87: I should cry. And I'm like, Oh, gosh.

79
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.180
Lauraluj87: I understood. Should I get it, I understand. No, you're good. I'm just gonna drop you from my side like right now. Like, you're good.

80
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.750
Lauraluj87: You know you're doing, you're good. I was like, really.

81
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.180
Lauraluj87: Like I was so boring. Oh my god.

82
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.580
Lauraluj87: So much

83
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, Laura. So this is, this is an everyday thing for professionals, we, we check in. We make sure there is. There's no conflict of interest. If there's redundant treatment.

84
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we kind of have to decide together right in what best interest. Is it and that's interesting, you were worried that she might make it personal, like you were rejecting her

85
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.470
Lauraluj87: Right, yeah.

86
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.100
No.

87
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

88
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.920
Lauraluj87: She's really nice to me know. And to be honest, I would actually prefer in person. I

89
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.030
I never

90
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.550
Lauraluj87: I like you. And like I said, the medicine to. But it's not just the medicine. I could have chosen to, you know, stay with her and just, you know, whatever.

91
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:07.530
Lauraluj87: But I don't know, I just, I guess it was more or less. I got a better vibe with you. And also, you got more in depth with my life didn't meet her, or did within two days or two.

92
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.910
Lauraluj87: Okay, Matt. Five times and it was more or less, kind of like

93
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.220
Lauraluj87: Awkward sitting there kind of childlike

94
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.960
Lauraluj87: Right so cool.

95
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're noticing that you wanted to in person you there is more connection. There's no doubt. And that's the downside of the tele health because you only get to see like my forearms up, you can't see. So it's hard.

96
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.340
To

97
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, you know, trust can sometimes be a challenge for people, but

98
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.210
Lauraluj87: Very good at, like all using your hands.

99
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:53.520
Lauraluj87: Yeah and that about you and I, that like a lot you don't understand how much I mean I know, that's why. Like you just, you know, that's why you are very, you know, you make sure it's on cameras on for to say

100
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.160
Lauraluj87: Use your hands, and I love it.

101
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.810
Lauraluj87: Good, good, good. So I go out without all the time. You know what I mean.

102
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.130
Lauraluj87: So I mean a lot to me.

103
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you like about it is I'm animated I kind of continue to to use my hands as much as I can in here and show as much as I can on the camera and

104
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like because I did that bio psychosocial upfront, you've been able to already disclose information and then we very quickly, been able to, you know, I, I'm guessing it's around that that topic of

105
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to kind of fake it a little bit with the people you're living with I'm guessing that's the part that's like

106
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right away we got to talk about that right away.

107
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.720
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

108
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard. And that's

109
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.600
Lauraluj87: To

110
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.370
Lauraluj87: Put in the position of, you know, people want to me like I didn't want you to like

111
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well here's the thing, um,

112
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's about having done this for so many years, you know, over 20 years

113
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, I trust myself. I know I trust the professional boundary part that my intentions are that you feel better.

114
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So your

115
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.590
Problem.

116
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.070

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.270
Lauraluj87: And as I said, Okay, that's different than like seeing a therapist, you know, I mean,

141
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.200
Lauraluj87: I need. Oh, yeah.

142
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.380
Lauraluj87: There should be no no issue. Go ahead and let you know.

143
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.780
Lauraluj87: Okay, so, yeah.

144
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:21.990
Lauraluj87: And yeah, I will be back on Monday through zoom. I'm the one that told people about Google little I told them by you guys right now it's

145
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.210
Lauraluj87: Like

146
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.710
Lauraluj87: When I'm like, because whenever

147
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.170
Lauraluj87: It shows them in the camera so I can show all of us right

148
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I see everybody

149
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.310
Lauraluj87: So,

150
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were on a larger screen like let's say you decide to do it on on a computer, you would actually see all the tiles, you would

151
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you were on a computer, you would see everybody all at once in a gallery view, it's just because you guys are on the little screen that you have to swipe. And you can only see. I think what four at a time.

152
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is possible if you ever want to get on like zoom on a larger screen you'll see more of us all at once. You'll have more of a group experience.

153
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.880
Lauraluj87: Yeah, because I haven't been a interesting student window.

154
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then you can see, you know, because we want to know how are people reacting to us, are they, do they seem interested in what I'm saying. Are they going me

155
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I want to know.

156
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:32.580
Lauraluj87: It yesterday in the current whenever you guys are having a conversation how everyone was like all like, I don't know. I felt like God man out of that whole thing cuz I was like

157
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, tell me.

158
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:35.880
Lauraluj87: The attic.

159
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:44.370
Lauraluj87: Is valid in the screen that I would have been able to see that was probably agreeing with that one comment and I totally was

160
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's true. So for you being able to sort of scroll back and being able to see faces might and you know how you were saying is important that you see me at my animated hands.

161
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It might really really consider either. If you know someone that has laptop or getting zoom app on your computer that might help you feel so much more immersed.

162
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: In the experience

163
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the same with your I. O. P. Because you're going to wonder, what's this person's, how are they reacting to me. I can't see their face, would it feel like it grimacing at me and I can't see them, you might want to consider getting it on a larger screen.

164
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.190
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I'm I want to do that.

165
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh, uh huh.

166
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.390
Lauraluj87: What you said that there. I missed that whenever I can. I humanoid um

167
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.050
Lauraluj87: Let's see. Okay, so there's two hours a week, right, we have to group now that window parameter

168
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you go to group.

169
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one hour and where you get. And so it's split in half that group is you check in on medication. Are you having any symptoms.

170
00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you, do you have any medication you started or stop. That's the first part of it. It's the MA ti part. That's the medication assisted therapy portion

171
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So you won't hear me talking very much during that portion and then that's when the doctor is ordering your prescription. So when you think about group. You never want to miss them, because that's when

172
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Your physician orders the medicine is when you show up.

173
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't show up there won't be an ordering so that that keeps the motivation very high for people, especially when there's not a lot of buy in.

174
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: To the therapeutic piece of it. So it's why am I going to group. I don't want to hear from these people. Oh no. Wait I need my medicine. That's why I'm going

175
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I know you guys aren't in love with me yet. I know.

176
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Patient. Oh, wait, wait.

177
00:18:47.640 --> 00:19:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so anyway, I'm very playful, but so then the second half right. And then we do the behavioral health part your other commitment piece is showing up to individual therapy with me. You're doing that right now.

178
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yep. And that's it. We're going to do that for about a month. Then you and I'll talk. And we'll say okay

179
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want, what do you need. Do you need more do you need less. How are your goals doing are you reaching the goals that you want to. I'll have some input on it too. Um, and then we'll take it from there. Okay.

180
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now tell me something, because the IoT hours if you happen to know when they are because if we have

181
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:33.180
Lauraluj87: 1pm 11 Tuesday, Wednesday.

182
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so those are I. O. P. And now currently. Is there any conflict. No, there's no conflict with group. So because it's in the morning. Right. Yeah.

183
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.640
Lauraluj87: Well, today, right. I haven't been to like at all ever. OK.

184
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.230
Lauraluj87: So now if you if you want me to

Lauraluj87: For

Lauraluj87: Thank you for doing this. Thank you.

198
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, absolutely. No, I'm excited to work with you.

199
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see we got characters. I'm trying to see what group you is in you is yet you're the early bird early bird. That's right.

200
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's when the hair is not done, that's when it's pigtail time for me.

201
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.380
Lauraluj87: So that's choosing

202
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Tuesday at seven in the morning so that

203
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it, and then you and I. It'd be nice if we cut a set schedule that

204
00:21:48.840 --> 00:22:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We didn't have to change too too too often. So let me see what I can do. I'm going to look ahead. I don't know that I'll have a set time I'll be able to commit to anything permanent next week, but I'll be able to do it in the future if it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

205
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now are you from the thought of. I need a break. And I don't want this therapy all week. So you kind of want to have like a free day when you don't have to deal with with us therapist types. Do you want like a free day

206
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.330
No.

207
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.870
Lauraluj87: No, I love it.

208
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

209
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We can play

210
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.630
Lauraluj87: We can listen this I'm thinking

211
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.960
Commit to to the nine o'clock. I'm wondering if I can commit to that used to be.

212
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see what happened. Yeah, I can do that. Okay, so you ready

213
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:47.670
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

214
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We're looking at

215
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is short term. So you're going to see consistency moving forward after next week, but we have a little, I have to, I already had someone scheduled in the spot that I think is going to be good for you.

216
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's already somebody there. So you're going to see consistency. Two weeks from now three weeks, four weeks, then it'll be in a set time but just for next week. Are you okay with 10am April.

217
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Assuming I didn't just scheduled boy. Why does that sounds familiar, so I

218
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.850
Lauraluj87: Gave that

219
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: For Friday I just

220
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:32.790
Made

221
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.160
Lauraluj87: Quite done today schedule someone that she

222
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.810
Hmm.

223
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Alright, well I'm thinking, this should be okay. Sometimes I do make a mistake, not too often, but sometimes I forget to write the darn thing down in my book, but let's go for this. Let's go for April 10 at 10am

224
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then move to the next week.

225
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's let's do this will be your set time it'll be 9am on Fridays April 17 9am and then I'm going to write you way ahead to protect the spot on the right, April 24

226
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

227
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to right

228
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: After that may 1

229
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.880
Lauraluj87: We have an April 24 is going to be the 9am when I uh huh

230
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So these are all Fridays at nine that's going to be like your when do I see my my therapist Fridays at nine. Why do I see my therapist.

231
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.470
Lauraluj87: In April, May what

232
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.580
First

233
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So here's what I have coming up, we have next Tuesday at seven in the morning.

234
00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this is the odd one out. We have FRIDAY, APRIL 10 at 10am that's where we're settling in. We don't quite have consistency and then for individual therapy. Well, you'll go to group on April 14 at 7am

235
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.140
Lauraluj87: When I before. Yeah.

236
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll be 7am group.

237
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And then individual therapy April 17 at 9am then on that week. We are set at our 9am spot.

238
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And that will be a place that I hold for you as well. On April 24 to unfold for you. On May 1. Now here's the thing. This is the sticky part if all of a sudden you dip.

239
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.740
Lauraluj87: Look,

240
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do, then I'll be like, huh, she's not showing up and you'll lose that spot which means there are people that are showing up. They're showing up to group. This may seem really weird. But what

241
00:25:59.340 --> 00:25:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you get

242
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.270

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Did that catches Disney

245
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.860
Lauraluj87: And then my question mark.

246
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Question mark.

247
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.540
Lauraluj87: So anyways,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

249
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What you already know that I'm fairly good at giving heads up the night before, but I noticed I didn't hear from you. So what happened with last night.

250
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just check on our communication through text because when they're green. I wonder if people are getting them. Are you getting my little green text because if they are green. I always wonder, did my client get this text, did you get this one. Did you get this one last night.

251
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. Oh.

257
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that weird, huh, huh. What do we do you want me to do it through. Did you check your email, all the time, or how do you check

258
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.910
Lauraluj87: I can

259
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.880
Lauraluj87: I'm trying to reset my phone, maybe

260
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.440
Lauraluj87: I don't know.

261
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your school what I was told I was told that that's like through I message or something and they don't always go through if there's not a good connection.

262
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so here's what for now what I'm going to do is if I don't hear from you. Like that day or a few hours. I may give you a quick call and say, hey, as

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.400
Lauraluj87: Crazy as

264
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be

265
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be. Hey, um. Are you going to be here tomorrow and such and such time you'll say, Yes, I'll say, Have a good night, and that'll be it.

266
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.690
Lauraluj87: That's cool. Yeah, I'm done.

267
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. It might also be coming from a care Navigator. So it might be someone like Angelina saying hi just confirming tomorrow with when at nine in the morning you'll say, okay, and then off you go.

268
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Until we get this worked out because that usually what happens is if I don't hear from people, then I offer it to someone else. So I get unconcerned I want to make sure that you're gonna

269
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.990
Lauraluj87: I'm glad that you can

270
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know. But we're here, we're okay. So we have been doing lots and lots and lots of logistics.

271
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.530
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

272
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where we're at.

273
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.870
We're at

274
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Angelina, I think, has probably SENT HIM TO SEE IF SHE SAID IT. SHE SENT YOU BECAUSE SHE GOT ice is it for her PO. Oh, so she Angelina said if it's for her to Anthony Carter, I sent it seven days ago. So you know how maybe I'll check your email, it might be sitting in there from seven days.

275
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

276
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now, now you have, you see all this all this information from his card.

277
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.630
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

278
00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: His address his proper spelling and his email when you go in the release of information and it says, To whom are you releasing the information

279
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I want his name. So you might want to write this down. I want his name. His title I want his phone number. And really, really, really important his email address on the release of information, because what that says to me, I'm very, very conservative and it says to me, my client is okay.

280
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.820
Lauraluj87: With me sending this information. And I want to show you what that is.

281
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can tell me you're probably gonna say that's fine because I rarely say anything about

282
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.240
A very conservative

283
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.200
Lauraluj87: Session.

284
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.190
Lauraluj87: Yesterday, I thought that was kind of crazy.

285
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:56.970
Lauraluj87: Your problem I yeah getting better. It's getting my script. And I'm like, why, like, I don't. I was totally against

286
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I loved it. I loved what you had to say. So where are some. I love it. Always speak your mind like that because other people might feel embarrassed.

287
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And if you say no I'm down with that you give them the courage, when you show your, your, like it's nothing but a thing when you show up like that, then they're like, haha. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of something that doesn't need to be there.

288
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.510
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

289
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

290
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.760
Lauraluj87: Like you said you weren't even saying to go that way. But everybody went that way, but

291
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, and I don't have. I don't have the street cred that you do. That's why I'd rather you guys talk than me because I might they might get as a she has to say that

292
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right going to be passing she full of it. She's going to be nice to me. She's paid to be nice. No is better if it comes from you guys see

293
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

294
00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what I'm doing right now is I'm opening up a participation letter. I'm getting names because you don't need to know that, but you're going to get an idea of what they look like. Okay, so that you know what's coming.

295
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What Mr. Carter will see. So I'm removing the names right now. And then I'm going to share my screen. Give me a second. There's about five names in here. I gotta take it out.

296
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.730
And your doctor is real. So I'll change real

297
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me see if I got names. I have a name. No name, no name no name.

298
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm actually going to start when we might as well do it now, but just write one up.

299
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:40.500
Nobody

300
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:42.360
Lauraluj87: Would you know

301
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I might as well.

302
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.980
Lauraluj87: Oh, man to man. Oh.

303
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.180
Dude,

304
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.470
Lauraluj87: Unpleasant. Okay, so you've ever had before.

305
00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and you know what this is going to blow your mind and ask the doctor about this too, because I I don't remember exactly what she was saying.

306
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.200
Lauraluj87: But

307
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Being on buprenorphine. Get ready, it messes with your dental care and messes with the health of yeah yes it does.

308
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got to talk to you about that because it's like it can keep people motivated to want to start to taper were before. Maybe they thought, oh, it's the perfect medicine.

309
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay, but it has its side effects to. So I think what she was saying was, it messes around with. Oops, I don't need the whole screen and try again.

310
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To share just want the document. Here you go, it. I think it messes with the ability of it of your mouth to

311
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.250
Lauraluj87: The way that Asters over your time.

312
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

313
00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So for example, we might say that or you might say, No, I'd rather use such and such name so it would be something like this. Look how old this one is lesser of 2018 I once I found a really open to

314
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the data here and believe it's April. Okay, so, so do so it'd be like this. Now, once your, your PO. So let's say I have a release of information, it would be

315
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony L. Whoops. Anthony L Carter and then this letter is to inform you that mess.

316
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you would tell me if you'd like. This is the name or you're under

317
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.180
Lauraluj87: Individuals from time babies.

318
00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you tell me he has to

319
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.340
Lauraluj87: What

320
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: If Mr. Carter.

321
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I can put that in here, but then you just have to make

322
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.240
Sure.

323
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

324
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If he doesn't care. Then I'm not going to change this. But if you say he really needs to be in writing that I'm attending individual therapy weekly. So I would say individual therapy sessions times very

325
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.330
Lauraluj87: Carefully

326
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:51.780
Lauraluj87: only other thing is I was doing two times a month with him. Yeah, I wasn't even a weekly learning

327
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're good.

328
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.170
Lauraluj87: I don't think it matters. I think we're good.

329
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know what

330
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.690
Lauraluj87: Fucking me to my language. Ah, OK.

331
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We started this have an idea. So now when your PO. Mr. Carter says I received your participation letter. There's no surprise to you. You know what it's going to look like.

332
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.580
Lauraluj87: Okay, thank you.

333
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Welcome, welcome. I know you you guys, especially if there's any involvement with the probation for all the judicial system. I think you guys often feel like helpless to everybody's power like you're thrown around like you got no se and

334
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.660
Lauraluj87: I guess I just leave was that people would think that was

335
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.180
Lauraluj87: Why don't mean

336
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Glad you don't

337
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:57.150
Lauraluj87: Like I said, Whenever I whenever I got rams that during those what I call it. I kind of just like I complied with, like, Okay, I have. Yeah. You got me.

338
00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:06.840
Lauraluj87: You know, I'm not gonna sit here and I do. And it was kind of a little bit like not not like that upsetting to me was I was kind of a we'd be honest.

339
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:16.470
Lauraluj87: I was like, now I don't have doing, you know, now I'm good. I know I'll be okay. Finally, I'll be good. So I don't know where it is what it is.

340
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see the blessing. And you can see the positive side.

341
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.460
Lauraluj87: Yeah, okay.

342
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's great. I like that attitude. So even as, um,

343
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at group. Let's take a look at

344
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of I felt a bit like the odd one out there was a little bit of that going on.

345
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that you have a right to your own perspective in there. You do not have to agree and see things the same way other people do.

346
00:36:59.340 --> 00:36:59.760
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

347
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There's going to be times when there's more people that kind of see the world the way you do. And other times when you might be the only one that has a thought and nobody's even said it.

348
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you to know that you can still share it.

349
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm there to protect everyone I don't want anyone saying, well, that's stupid. You shouldn't say that there's no i would mute them or kick them out.

350
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're not there for that were there for to hear our own thought process out loud to kind of bounce it off brainstorm with other people, hey, is what I said, really what I think.

351
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's a part of it, but I've got more there's more to it than that. It's these are complicated issues addictive behavior dependence.

352
00:37:50.190 --> 00:38:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Our trauma history. How does that affect how we are today. These are complex human experiences. They're not just one little thing I give you guys what 20 seconds at the end to say something that that's not enough time.

353
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know that that's why i don't i don't call it therapy. It's really, it's just medication assisted therapy and a little bit of behavioral health, education and

354
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: itty bitty miniscule little crumb of emotional check in. But there isn't much. It's not like what you're probably going to be getting in your LP, that's where you're really going to get

355
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.660
Lauraluj87: Your hands.

356
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: On, I know that. But we can take a little bit like what you said, hey, I felt like the odd one out and I can listen to you more in here. So one spend a little bit of time. What was it like to you for you to feel like the odd one out.

357
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:59.010
Lauraluj87: I expected it a little bit. Kinda like you running. I mean, I'm probably they always wanted to in there. I don't know. I don't know if I am. What am I mean I was the youngest woman she Bullitt county like you know i mean i'm

358
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.740
Lauraluj87: Also, I know that like

359
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:10.860
Lauraluj87: With the group. Um, I don't know, whenever I seek something like whenever I wanted you something like for example.

360
00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.560
Lauraluj87: I didn't have to do that. They didn't require that wasn't a requirement of getting out of reach out

361
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:27.000
Lauraluj87: It was just require that I attend there. So technically, I didn't have to do outreach i do i op, not just because of reports because. Also, I wanted to

362
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:38.220
Lauraluj87: And I'm and I actually, I actually told my POS if you know I'm if I wanted to do like anger management classes after you finish you know that to

363
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:46.440
Lauraluj87: Me was like, Well, yeah, but why. And I was like, I don't know. And he's on board. I said, Yeah, but that's not why like

364
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:56.520
Lauraluj87: I always wanted to do that so I might as well do it now let me know you know make my life better now charging like you know now doing the same silver so

365
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:05.040
Lauraluj87: But going back to like being our men out in group, it was kind of like that like I felt like it was my choice to say I

366
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:12.720
Lauraluj87: See, I said, like I didn't have to agree with them. I didn't have to follow and, like, try and make up some white lie. Oh yeah, I've always had a problem with saying I'm not

367
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:23.820
Lauraluj87: No, I'm I just didn't like it never even been a problem at all that that wasn't even like a problem to like think about to be the problem but you know I mean it was just saying

368
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have there's psychology has that word ego sin tonic.

369
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's fun. Right. I mean, I'm, I'm cool with who I am. Even my flaws, even my mistakes.

370
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.570
Lauraluj87: You know, we do see my disabilities. My ability

371
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.430
Lauraluj87: To always say so and then till death do us apart haha funny.

372
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

373
00:40:49.440 --> 00:41:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, it means where one Skill might be dialed down a little. All these 10 others other aptitudes or turn way up like your ability to recognize subtle facial expressions.

374
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or how hands can communicate something you have that attitude that other people are like, Well, I didn't even know she had hands. I don't know what you're talking about.

375
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to pick up on that, like, real fast. Yeah.

376
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.030
Lauraluj87: Wow that's so cool.

377
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, I love it. And I want you to continue with that. And of course, I'm excited. I'm a therapist. You want to learn and grow. Unlike yeah wish everybody was like

378
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:44.460
Lauraluj87: I said it was just so funny. As soon as like when I noticed, I think it was yesterday. Whenever I really noticed that the most because I was seeing everyone else talking, I realized that you were the only one that I was actually like not wanting to be honest with me.

379
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:53.310
Lauraluj87: And I was like, okay, so why am I so like, why is she the one that's catching my eye. The moment. Like, why is it that every time you talk

380
00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:00.090
Lauraluj87: I like it's like, you know what I mean. I actually been injured my my weight was just like, I didn't miss it. You know, I follow you everywhere.

381
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:16.860
Lauraluj87: I was like, what is she doing this so different. I don't get it. Well then I saw, I saw you adjust your camera or something and I saw that you just turn your hand right and then I was like hot its body language. I'm waiting, providing them with so much. I'm not just

382
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.880
Lauraluj87: Your body language and maybe in death. I've always done that. So it means a lot to me already.

383
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.750
Lauraluj87: So here's

384
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what's interesting. I heard you say I was kind of you didn't say I was bored. But you, you said I was falling asleep. But I think what that might be is I was less like connected

385
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.030
Lauraluj87: And Tim Yeah.

386
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was it, and you figured it out and you you like oh I'm Gwen's including her hands and I just did it. Just now I brought it down to the top of my head. So you can see more of my hands and I just did it in here also.

387
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do my best, right, because I'm if it works. I'm going to do it, but you can also, this is where you

388
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to stretch in group. You know how you're like, Well, I'm already chill. I already uncomfortable, these people, these will wait a minute, maybe there's a room to grow for you too. And it's like this.

389
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, y'all.

390
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can, I will feel more connected to you if I could see more of you, I can see your hands.

391
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you knew you had a right

392
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To get your communication style. The way you need it.

393
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a right to that to not just because it's convenient for us. We're not conscious. I am now more conscious because you said it out loud. I didn't know that before.

394
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact, I kind of think I'm annoying. My hands are always flopping around. I'm like, well, maybe, maybe I'm annoying.

395
00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'm too dramatic and I irritate people in their role in their eyes all the time. I can't tell because I can't watch that many screens at the same time.

396
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm so glad you said something to me because now I can hopefully continue to be mindful of that, and include that in part of my communication. Yeah.

397
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:13.920
You

398
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

399
00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no I'm glad you said it, and none of us do. Because think about it, we're all kind of wrapped up in our own little worlds, aren't we

400
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: were like, well, this is what I'm thinking. This is what I'm feeling

401
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she just do we don't spend a lot of time out there and empathy land and then come back to the self. Now some people, it's the opposite. You ever met those where they only care about other people's feelings.

402
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And they have a hard time coming back to, well, what do I want

403
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.950
Lauraluj87: What do yeah I never, I don't

404
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then we're onto something there. So that's, that's a topic of boundaries setting limits and that is one of my favorite things to talk about, because it has such a powerful impact with people.

405
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I'd like to do with the little teeny, teeny, teeny weeny bit of time that we have. Can I, can I go over one skill with you. Yeah.

406
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to my ears are congested. I'm gonna do the hair flip

407
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:16.740
Lauraluj87: Cute.

408
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: My hairspray break. I want a fluffy hair. By the end of the day. So, okay.

409
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to do the education. Some have quite enough time to do a great job of this. So I'm just going to give you. I'm going to throw some science at you. Okay. Okay.

410
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you can now. Okay, cool. I'm going to give you the the sort of biological reason why diet for matic breathing works and it's not a psychological phenomenon.

411
00:45:49.110 --> 00:46:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Diaphragm matic breathing your diaphragm right is right here cuts your body and half the reason why it works is biological. You don't have to believe it for it to work.

412
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.020
Lauraluj87: The same way where

413
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You sit right here and say, I don't have a spleen.

414
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you still going to have a spleen. So it's still going to be working for you. Okay, it's unconscious

415
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have an phenomenon going on down here in our diaphragm. Can you see my hands or no.

416
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.320
Lauraluj87: I

417
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Am My name is in the way. So I can't even see my screen.

418
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so here's the key piece. So again, I'm just doing the psychobabble part and then I'm going to go into actually teaching it on a different day. So the basic biology is this

419
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason why diet for matic breathing works is because when we use a full belly breath, which means our air goes all the way down to the bottom of our lungs.

420
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It means that my belly pushes out into this little balloon and it's pushing when I breathe a full breath in to the bottom of the lungs. See how my hands go out

421
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I'm inhaling

422
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling at the bottom of my long. So the reason why this has an effect is the following. You have a Vegas nerve and it is called so called the wandering nerve and it wanders around those who are to our eyes to the facial muscles to our

423
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Own inner ear towards heart or lungs our gut goes to the organs and the reason why this breathing helps regulate

424
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Our emotions.

425
00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is because

426
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do that breath. I'm just talking slowly because this is the key piece when I do that breath and I bring it in here it's pushing all those organs down it's going smoosh

427
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens because those organs down there are connected to the Vegas nerve. There's a message that goes

428
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It comes from the bottom right down there from my organs off the Vegas nerve up to my brain that's busy thinking

429
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What if my life will always be like this. What if I never oh my gosh what I get. What if and you're in, let's say you're in a really negative thought when you do this kind of breathing.

430
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It sends a contradictory message up that says we're fine.

431
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we're fine. You know, I know, we're fine. We're fine because if I'm breathing like that. That means nobody

432
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Has a weapon in the room, nobody's trying to punch me nobody's trying to hurt me right feeling right there's no way I'm going to be doing this this yoga breath. If I'm in danger. I would be breathing.

433
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be up here like this. Right.

434
00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what's neat is we can use our biology.

435
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell our psychology. We're okay.

436
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:06.840
Lauraluj87: Hmm.

437
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's amazing. And so we call it the bagel break, we'll put a break on it, we're using our biology to tell our psychology chill. Look around.

438
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:23.190
Lauraluj87: Yes, it's high after you know he knows, like all of these harm you guys

439
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, imagine how hard it is for me. I've been there.

440
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.750
Lauraluj87: Man I new stuff and frickin again.

441
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But guess what, what did I say you don't have to believe it for it to work.

442
00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.240
Lauraluj87: Because if it works.

443
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.790
Lauraluj87: It works. It's already. It's already there.

444
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So will we do over time. And I'll teach it to you next time when, when I can go nice and slow. And we can do it together. But I wanted to and I just told you a little piece of it.

445
00:49:51.750 --> 00:50:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't tell you about the sympathetic nervous system, a fight and flight in the parasympathetic nervous system and how they're this delicate balance that already exist and we're just using

446
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The solutions that you were already born with to your advantage.

447
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's some basic sort of biology around what to be teaching around the belly breathing. You can go YouTube. And if you want to you can get ahead of the game and you can go look up words like Daya for matic reading you can look up

448
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I think they call it square breathing. I always call it box breathing, because I like the word better but basically what I'll be teaching you is it'll be an inhale through the nose for four seconds and you hold your breath for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds you'll hold your breath.

449
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.160
Lauraluj87: My neck. Ha ha ha ha ha, a

450
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: D.

451
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Ay, ay,

452
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.650
Lauraluj87: PH are a

453
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:50.460
Message.

454
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: diaphragms we don't say the G, but it's a pragmatic. I know it's weird.

455
00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. We don't pronounce.

456
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, so that's how

457
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:03.750
Lauraluj87: Learning the art.

458
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So the reason why I call it belly breathing. Now I didn't when they first started teaching. This is because people were forgetting what

459
00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I call it belly breathing.

460
00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.250
Lauraluj87: belly breathing.

461
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Belly, that's the mechanism of change that gets the bagel break that sends the message through the Vegas nerve.

462
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to the limbic system. Right. The amygdala, the one that's like the emotional hijacker that's like, this is the end of the world. Okay, so we send the message of incomplete contradiction to the limbic system. Hey, we're okay. Look, we can be

463
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: In our body. You can stay vigilant, we can stay conscious a we can be in a relaxed body.

464
00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what we're up to.

465
00:51:55.290 --> 00:52:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm giving you just the psycho, blah, blah. And the physio blah, blah, and then I'm going to go into next time, I'm going to be doing it with you. We'll do it together. In fact, we'll do it in vivo, which means we'll get we'll bring up the in our

466
00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull it up from our hippocampus and we'll sit in and are working memorable. Think of something that's muscle Manos a little stressful and then we'll use this technique in real time.

467
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And will regulate with a real distressing thought

468
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll do it in real time. You're more than welcome. Everything I do is yours. There's no nothing hidden here, you can go look it up yourself. Go check it out. You can you can teach me your version of it next time however you want to do this.

469
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to have this because it's the one thing that of all of the cute little things that we're going to do. This is the one.

470
00:52:46.230 --> 00:53:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the one that helps your brain get blood up here in the thinking part of the brand new executive functioning the prefrontal cortex. This one, it gets the blood up there that helps you remember all the other things that we're going to do.

471
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can't remember them. When you're all stressed out. Nobody can nobody. So that's why the breath is the go to for regulating quickly and effectively.

472
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you, you already know how to breathe. So I have every bit of confidence that will will be just fine.

473
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.980
Lauraluj87: For you.

474
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're already breathing. I know you know how to do it.

475
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:32.160
Lauraluj87: Oh, so

476
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but

477
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a different, but it feels really awkward actually to be doing it in the belly. It's like what we talked about

478
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know it feels weird.

479
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but

480
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.350
Lauraluj87: You can

481
00:53:47.640 --> 00:54:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: See now I'm a teacher. Don't you worry. But, you know, know how to do it, we did when we were babies picture a little baby. How does that little thing. You can see their little Tommy's goby right yeah

482
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna be doing baby very

483
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.500
Lauraluj87: Naturally to them. The man I learned and do it will make sense.

484
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We got all uptight. As we grow older.

485
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, we did. Yeah. So okay, so what we all did that. So we're going to relearn it we're going to see the value of it. Now, we have some science to understand how we can regulate it that way.

486
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me something today.

487
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I message Dr brielle to get you medicine to get you to Tuesday, or do you have enough medication to get you to Tuesday, because we got the weekend coming up.

488
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.880
Lauraluj87: On any musician and given a writing

489
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:44.550
Lauraluj87: Group last week, whatever Mike's okay I've been out for three days. Oh my god.

490
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.370
What is

491
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.940
Lauraluj87: Real quick, I'm good. Okay.

492
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me talk for just a second. I have to run out of here. So, just listen. Don't ever go through that again.

493
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In here know you're never without medication.

494
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know you don't know that because you probably thought I screwed up. I couldn't make it or whatever you were doing in your head, you need to be on medication you are any medication assisted therapy.

495
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So a red flag needs to go off in your mind. I know. Usually it's like, oh, maybe I did something wrong. I don't ask these people are because I'm off. I don't know what went on in your head, but this is the new information. So take this in

496
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your therapist your physician does not want you off of it until you're ready, and that might be a year from now, I don't know when that's going to be

497
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you on it. So you are not risking relaxing. Here's what you do. Next time you notice something went sideways, you can call heart health, you can just straight up log into virtual clinic, like, hi.

498
00:55:49.710 --> 00:56:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a hot mess. I miss my group. What do I do. Okay. You can also after you've done those two things. You can also, if that doesn't work. Let's say someone gives you an attitude.

499
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You can text me and you can say I have called bright heart health. I have logged into virtual clinic.

500
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And they said they would reach out to my doctor, I have been minute out of medication, it's because I missed my group. What do I do and I can advise. Okay, so I don't want you to be without it. You hear that,

501
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay he will

502
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.720
Lauraluj87: Give this to say he says

503
00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. I don't have a lot of time but

504
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Here I go, going into my communication platform. I'm communicating now with Dr brielle

505
00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost there, almost there.

506
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

507
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.660
Dash, dash, dash, dash, dash

508
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.860
With for individual

509
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.720
This morning

510
00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.550
Lauraluj87: Next service is group.

511
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.650
