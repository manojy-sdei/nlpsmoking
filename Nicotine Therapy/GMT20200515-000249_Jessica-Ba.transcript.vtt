Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I started. I'm one of the therapists with by heart health. I started like in late 2018 and you are a patient with added onto my caseload.

12
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.310
Andris: No, not really.

14
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:39.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so I am going to explain that bio psychosocial is cattery past and present history that about addiction from you, family and just getting a

15
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Very detailed overview of why you're in our program and why you're seeking treatment.

16
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So typically, I do this when patients are new to the program and they've been, you know, it's like the first week.

17
00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:05.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So some of the questions I'm going to ask may seem a little awkward because you've been with us for so long. And now, and maximum. Next question. Okay, so I apologize in advance for any awkwardness that may come up. Okay.

18
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.300

20
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.000
Andris: Um, I just wanted to, you know, stop using basically I got tired of it.

21
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.150
Andris: And I knew I wasn't gonna be able to do it cold turkey. So, you know, ended up working out.

22
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. When did you first start using

23
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.830
Andris: I'm probably went when I was around

24
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 2020. What did you use it was a drug of choice.

25
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.150
Andris: I started on open. It's like a

26
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.790
Andris: Just offseason stuff. And then I started doing heroin.

27
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So your first experiment with drugs with opioids.

28
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.090
Andris: No, not really. It was actually we

29
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. How old were you when you started with the lead.

30
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.640
Andris: Say 17

31
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. So you started using lead at 17 and then you started with axes, when you were 20

32
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.830
Andris: Yeah.

33
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was there any pain or any injury or

34
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's no yeah

35
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.840
Andris: Just what the trends are doing. And no, I got into it.

36
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. All right. And then from there, what happened.

37
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.650
Andris: I started getting sick and my body knew that

38
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200
Andris: I didn't want to do that. No more.

39
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how long before realizing that this was now an addiction.

40
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.930
Andris: I'd say like two years into it.

41
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Two years were you doing autopsies and any other type of drugs.

42
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.050
Andris: No, that's

43
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.830
Andris: Talking to me, does it. Okay.

44
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when did you start to realize that this was an addition for you that she wanted treatment for

45
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.910
Andris: Like around when I was like 23 I'd say

46
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was happening around that time.

47
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.810
Andris: I was just real sick and I needed every day. You know, so I got tired of that.

48
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was there any line, aside from yourself that kind of help get you to that realization that you want it treatment.

49
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.050
Andris: Yeah.

50
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.890
Andris: My family.

51
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so did you try stopping before on your own. Did you try any other programs before coming to heart health.

52
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.770
Andris: Oh yeah, actually, I tried to stopping

53
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.360
Andris: When I was like a two or so.

54
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.420
Andris: And it only lasted like six months or something. But I wasn't doing Suboxone or nothing. So no wonder

55
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was good. So you you did your own detox and you were successful at that, for six months.

56
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.580
Andris: Yeah.

57
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's actually really good.

58
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.940
Andris: Okay, yeah.

59
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, and so you tried that on your own and then any other program. So from there, you can support her hell.

60
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.740
Andris: No, actually brought her house was my first the first time I'd ever did something like that.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.110
Andris: No, ma'am.

223
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And continue looking at areas in your life where you feel vulnerable.

224
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.980
Andris: Yes, ma'am.

225
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To have you identify currently in the areas that you do feel vulnerable.

226
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.470
Andris: No God. That's why I'm still working on

227
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What what brought you to wanting to have that as a goal. What are you thinking

228
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.890
Andris: I think we had brought it up a meeting one time and

229
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.640
Andris: It just

230
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.800
Andris: It just sat in my head for many, you know,

231
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.410
Andris: Because not most men don't show fillings, you

232
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With that, yeah.

233
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.840
Andris: Kind of, I guess, but

234
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.380
Andris: You know I'm seeing my grandpa crap. See, my dad cry, you know,

235
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.500
Andris: You know they show billings when they have two

236
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And a half, two and that is the adequate words and you have to. It's almost like you know in extreme situations with just regular. What does that look like when you're agitated and you're frustrated and how do you communicate through emotion that may feel a little uncomfortable.

237
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.950
Andris: Exactly. That's what vulnerability is. Thank you.

238
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:17.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I see you made some progress already some goals, goals that you complete it was share more open group identify interpersonal family dynamics.

Your spam.

241
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:38.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so long term goals within the program. They are continuously helping you to identify the reason for the disease increase your knowledge in that building abstinence to Bernie about long term.

242
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:49.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sobriety how the addicted brain works versus to sober and they'll use different treatment modalities. So cognitive behavioral therapy will be used.

243
00:16:50.040 --> 00:17:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know dominate does a lot of meditation and relaxation techniques within her group, yes, those relaxation skills and identify thoughts. And why do you think we

244
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:10.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are actually treatment modalities that have been proven successful within addiction sometimes motivational interviewing will be used as well.

245
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:20.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's if you're kind of in indecisive about different things, different strategies will be put in place to help get you to figure out your, your actual goals.

246
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.140
Andris: So,

247
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any other short term or long term goals that you wanted to add to your treatment plan.
