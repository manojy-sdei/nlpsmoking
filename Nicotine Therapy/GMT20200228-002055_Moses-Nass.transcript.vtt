43
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.570
Marcus Ma: I usually I usually blow a lot of money and then it's progressed into prostitution.

44
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.850
Marcus Ma: And

45
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.350
Marcus Ma: You know, just promiscuous sex like trying to find

46
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.660
Marcus Ma: People to hook up with

47
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.010
Online.

48
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.270
Marcus Ma: You know, chat rooms that sort of thing. And it's

49
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.970
Marcus Ma: So I, I did, I did a year in rehab at the Salvation Army for the crystal meth.

50
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.240
Marcus Ma: About three years ago and I was sober.

51
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.880
Marcus Ma: clean and sober from the math for over two years, up until

52
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.280
Marcus Ma: Up until November of last year, and then I relapsed

53
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.010
Marcus Ma: And typically

54
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.890
Marcus Ma: Typically what that looks like for me is I like for those two years when I was sober.

55
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.950
Marcus Ma: I was trying to have a regular relationship with somebody, but it kind of became on manageable. And so we went into breaking up, but we stayed connected, but I was

56
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.460
Marcus Ma: You know, I was acting out all the time.

57
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:14.310
Marcus Ma: With prostitution and massage parlors and hooking up with people and then it just got to the point where

58
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:24.120
Marcus Ma: You know, like the crystal meth. For me, it's, it goes hand in hand with the sexual encounters so November. November I ended up

59
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.220
Marcus Ma: meeting up with an old friend that I used to party with and you know we got high and and then from there, it's from there. It's just been

60
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.140
Marcus Ma: A downward spiral. The last few months until it

61
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.210
Marcus Ma: It's, it's just become increasingly like unmanageable. And I'm you know I'm blowing all my money.

62
00:05:46.890 --> 00:06:03.480
Marcus Ma: I'm neglecting my parental responsibilities I have a 17 year old daughter that that I've taken care of. Since her and her mom and I separated and she was a year old and I've been her primary caregiver and

63
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.780
Marcus Ma: Which I you know I've, I've managed that with the addictions, but like

64
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.830
Marcus Ma: The last few years that's become more difficult and

65
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.910
Moses Nasser: She was

66
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.850
Marcus Ma: Yeah, she was with me and

67
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.000
Marcus Ma: And

68
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.380
Moses Nasser: Most of you live with.

69
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.630
Marcus Ma: I live with my father and also my brother and his family, his wife and two daughters.

70
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:47.130
Marcus Ma: So yeah, so. So last week I just I just I just really, really checked out. And I got high on Monday, and then I ended up. I didn't, I didn't go into work. The rest of the week and

71
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:57.540
Marcus Ma: And then there was one day where nobody even knew where I was. And finally, just, you know, I reached out and

72
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.350
Marcus Ma: I was able to get help from my my girlfriend and

73
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.980
Marcus Ma: And some other friends and family.

74
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.780
Marcus Ma: And

75
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:17.970
Marcus Ma: You know, was able to kind of come up with a plan realized that I needed more, you know, more comprehensive

76
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.980
Marcus Ma: recovery program and so last Friday when I finally started sobering up

77
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.010
Marcus Ma: I started making phone calls and was referred through Dr.

78
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.190
Marcus Ma: Dr. Nan Nan, David.

79
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.830
Marcus Ma: zon or non David's on

80
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.270
Marcus Ma: And I was referred to bright heart, and it seemed like

81
00:07:47.100 --> 00:08:00.600
Marcus Ma: You know, it seemed like it had all the aspects that, you know, I've been trying for months to get into see a psychiatry is to, I had a counselor recommend any depressants for me.

82
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.560
Marcus Ma: And to kind of help, I guess.

83
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:15.060
Marcus Ma: To kind of help me start to be able to like fall through with the things that I'm trying to do in my recovery which I I tend to have a problem.

84
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:26.760
Marcus Ma: Like following through with things and staying committed to things. So yeah, so I've been trying for months to

85
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.340
Marcus Ma: To get into the psychiatrist without any success to

86
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:45.090
Marcus Ma: You know, explore the possibilities of like medication therapy. And also, like, you know, behavioral therapy addiction counseling, all that kind of stuff. So

87
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.680
Marcus Ma: So I'm yeah I mean I'm just, I'm at a point where you know I have I have support people

88
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:18.630
Marcus Ma: And I'm I'm highly motivated to make make whatever changes. I can that are going to help me to to get healthy and to find ways of managing, you know, whatever, whatever it is that's causing me to be compelled to seek these behaviors that are

89
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.030
Marcus Ma: You know, just unsafe unmanageable.

90
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.990
Marcus Ma: You know, in general, so

91
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:35.340
Moses Nasser: All right. Well, thank you for sharing. Um, I will do my best to help you. Right.

92
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.370
Moses Nasser: So let's talk about

93
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.420
Moses Nasser: First of all, your drug of choices math.

94
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.430
Moses Nasser: Yes. Okay, so for the math, how do you use it usually

95
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.810
Marcus Ma: I smoke it.

96
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.460
Moses Nasser: Smoked and how much do you use per day. Like how many grams a day.

97
00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:10.530
Marcus Ma: I mean I i'm I'm really kind of a lightweight because I, I've never, I've never gotten to the point where I use daily I all typically over the last like decade.

98
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.370
Marcus Ma: All us sporadically we're all

99
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.980
Marcus Ma: I'll just kind of go out and party for a few days.

100
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.670
Marcus Ma: And

101
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:28.290
Marcus Ma: And then I typically up and up until recently one of my main motivations for getting into

102
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:41.520
Marcus Ma: For getting into rehab was that I every time I would use when I would when I would be detoxing I would have, I would have really bad like paranoid schizophrenia episodes.

103
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:55.020
Marcus Ma: Oh, that seemed very real to me and it and it would it would scare me enough and scare me straight and then I was sober up for a while and then I eventually break down and go out again and use but

104
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.580
Moses Nasser: So, I mean, these episodes were you hearing voices are seeing things that weren't there.

105
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.480
Marcus Ma: Um, yeah, I'd like I'd see things and I you know I, I'd be really paranoid like

106
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.320
Marcus Ma: Something horrible, horrible is going to happen. There are people out after me.

107
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.560
Marcus Ma: Yeah, that's

108
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.000
Marcus Ma: The thing. So, but, but that's

109
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.540
Moses Nasser: A way that

110
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:23.880
Marcus Ma: Yeah, I mean, that hasn't this last few months that I've been using that hasn't that hasn't been happening at all and

111
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.430
Marcus Ma: So I think that that's

112
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:37.290
Marcus Ma: That's kind of made it easier for me to use is that there isn't the threat there hasn't been the threat of that happening that I don't know. I don't know what's changed.

113
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.520
Marcus Ma: But I haven't

114
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.340
Marcus Ma: I haven't had that same experience. Okay.

115
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.700
Moses Nasser: When you do use math. How much do you use like half a gram a day or a gram

116
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:49.440
Marcus Ma: Um,

117
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:56.010
Marcus Ma: I don't even. I don't even really know the amounts. I mean, I'll go and like by $20 worth

118
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.370
Marcus Ma: And that'll that could last me like a few days.

119
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:15.390
Moses Nasser: Okay so $20 every three days and like let's say it was $20 worth over three days. And then, how often is that say like once a week, three days out of the week, or is it maybe like once a month, twice a month.

120
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.150
Marcus Ma: I mean, I would say the last few months, like once a month.

121
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.570
Moses Nasser: Once a month. Okay. Yeah. And then

122
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.150
Moses Nasser: So,

123
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:32.670
Moses Nasser: You have a persistent desire to cut down, you've taken larger amounts over a longer period of time.

124
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:41.280
Moses Nasser: Have you spent a lot of time in activities to try to get math to use it or to recover from its effects.

125
00:12:43.620 --> 00:13:02.220
Marcus Ma: Um yeah i mean i i spend I spend a lot of time like cruising and trolling for like prostitution and then part of that is always the desire to to throw meth into the mix.

126
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.650
Marcus Ma: So the same neighborhoods where I

127
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:11.160
Marcus Ma: Where I go looking for, like, prostitution, I mean I can spend hours and hours just, you know, driving around

128
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.030
Marcus Ma: And, you know, to

129
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.800
Marcus Ma: You know trolling for like prostitution and and also you know the math is is always kind of in the back of my mind that

130
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.540
Marcus Ma: Yeah.

131
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.780
Moses Nasser: Have you noticed that you need to use more to go. Hi.

132
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.820
Moses Nasser: Since you started

133
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.620
Marcus Ma: Um, I mean this this last

134
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.990
Marcus Ma: Very beginning

135
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.630
Moses Nasser: The beginning, since you first used

136
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:40.980
Marcus Ma: Not

137
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.660
Marcus Ma: Not really, because I feel like the way that I use, you know, like

138
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:57.960
Marcus Ma: I'll go out and all I'll get high. And then I, you know, it might last like a couple, couple days or a few days and then I detox and then I don't use for a while.

139
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.240
Marcus Ma: Yeah, go back and I use again. So I haven't

140
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.380
Marcus Ma: Yet I haven't really got to the point where I like need more

141
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.340
Marcus Ma: To get high.

142
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.920
Moses Nasser: When you stop using then you get some withdrawal symptoms and you're really tired and all that.

143
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:11.910
Marcus Ma: Yes.

144
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.650
Moses Nasser: I said, you get the withdrawals and then hasn't interfered with your

145
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.210
Moses Nasser: With your, your ability to work or your home.

146
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.410
Moses Nasser: Life family life.

147
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.370
Moses Nasser: Yes. Okay.

148
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.780
Marcus Ma: It all it always does.

149
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.030
Moses Nasser: Yeah diagnosis. Number one is met. Use Disorder severe

150
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.250
Moses Nasser: And then

151
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:42.750
Moses Nasser: Would you say that. And so, and you've also expressed to me that the whole pornography and sex addiction, has also interfered with your family life and your obligations and things like that. Correct.

152
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.800
Marcus Ma: Yes, yes.

153
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.480

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.960

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.230
Moses Nasser: Just like me a persistent depressive disorder.

251
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:41.370
Moses Nasser: As far as the anxiety. Oh, and what is your depression level today on a scale of one to 10

252
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.910
Marcus Ma: Um, I mean, I would say today.

253
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.590
Marcus Ma: I would say today my depression was really low.

254
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.540
Marcus Ma: Okay, probably lower than it's been in a really long time. I would say maybe like

255
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.320
Marcus Ma: Maybe like a two or three

256
00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.730
Moses Nasser: Okay, excellent.

257
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:08.670
Moses Nasser: And then as far as your anxiety goes. Now, do you have anxiety, all the time, or is it just like panic attacks or if you're in certain situations.

258
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:21.690
Marcus Ma: I'm really, really, I just have the exact I've only historically had the anxiety attacks when I am when I'm coming down off of the meth, but

259
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.210
Marcus Ma: Like I like I said, I haven't

260
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.360
Marcus Ma: I haven't had that experience recently.

261
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.030
Marcus Ma: So I haven't, haven't really been feeling anxiety lately.

262
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.090
Moses Nasser: You haven't had anxiety lately. Okay, good.

263
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:36.420
Marcus Ma: Now,

264
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.590
Moses Nasser: When you do have the anxiety, then it's usually just associated coming off of that.

265
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.300
Marcus Ma: Yeah yeah

266
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.890
Moses Nasser: You're really having outside of that.

267
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:53.730
Moses Nasser: Now, so we're not going to diagnose any anxiety right now because once you're off of the math if you're off because you don't diagnose it. If it's related to the drug use.

268
00:23:54.210 --> 00:24:01.620
Moses Nasser: So we're just going to wait and see how you do. Okay. All right. Um, any other medical problems that you want to let me know about

269
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.740
Marcus Ma: I'm

270
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.160
Marcus Ma: Not really, no. I mean, I'm, I'm pretty like exceptionally healthy and fit.

271
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.200
Marcus Ma: All things considered, the only the only concern. I've had lately is the

272
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.730
Marcus Ma: The, the sexual sexual behavior lately.

273
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.180
Marcus Ma: Has been kind of risky for me so

274
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:27.900
Okay.

275
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.530
Marcus Ma: But I have. I haven't, I haven't had any symptoms.

276
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:32.670
Okay.

277
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:44.670
Moses Nasser: So I'm going to ask you just a few questions just going to go through them. Are you having right today or recently not associated with coming off of men hearing voices.

278
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.920
Moses Nasser: Body pain.

279
00:24:49.170 --> 00:25:00.570
Moses Nasser: Headache blurry vision ringing in the ears, rash, chest pain trouble breathing trouble breathing when you walk swelling in your legs stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,

280
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:07.140
Moses Nasser: No. Okay. And then you're able to feed yourself and shower and bathe yourself and take care of yourself. Correct.

281
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:07.980
Marcus Ma: Yes.

282
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.980
Moses Nasser: Okay, good. And then physical exams normal

283
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.940
Moses Nasser: I'm saying that because this is being recorded and they're going to do the

284
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:27.990
Moses Nasser: The my know for me diagnosis. Number one is going to be methamphetamine. Use Disorder severe number two is sex addiction and number three is decide me a persistent depressive disorder.

285
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.840
Moses Nasser: For the plan so

286
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.020
Moses Nasser: Today is Thursday.

287
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:43.560
Moses Nasser: We have our groups once a week where we all meet together, and most of the patients are addicted to opioids.

288
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:52.920
Moses Nasser: But you'll find that the you know the thoughts, the thought process, the behavior with all addictions is the same.

289
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.280
Moses Nasser: It's literally the same even the sex addiction.

290
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.830
Moses Nasser: It's the same experiences the same feelings you know there's triggers.

291
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:14.100
Moses Nasser: Working the steps, it's all, it's just so closely related, you know, chemically, it's the same. It's the same area of the brain. The pleasure centers, the dopamine centers in the brain.

292
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:22.620
Moses Nasser: Whether it's gambling addiction sex addiction or heroin meth. They all go to the same addiction centers in the brain alcohol.

293
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:33.750
Moses Nasser: There aren't any specific medications that are that are FDA approved to treat methamphetamine or sex addiction, but

294
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.460
Moses Nasser: There is a medicine called Naltrexone which we use for alcohol addiction.

295
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:58.590
Moses Nasser: And for opioid addiction, which helps with the cravings and what we've seen is that this medicine. Also there's promising evidence that it does help with other addictions also behavioral addictions and food addictions. Because again, it's all in the same area of the brain.

296
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.750
Moses Nasser: I would like to try some Naltrexone with you and see how you do with it.

297
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.670
Moses Nasser: Medically speaking

298
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:07.800
Moses Nasser: Um,

299
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.980
Moses Nasser: And what we could also do is a treat you for the design me out of the depression would like an anti depressant.

300
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.510
Moses Nasser: I'm but I like to do one thing at a time.

301
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.180
Moses Nasser: So,

302
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.480
Moses Nasser: I think we should start with the Naltrexone

303
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:38.910
Moses Nasser: Which is it comes in both a pill form and a monthly injectable form, but we'll just do the pills and start with a half ago, a day can make you a little tired, um,

304
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:48.870
Moses Nasser: But try it and kind of persistent and just see like how it makes you feel, and if it's if it helps you with cravings, you know, and with impulses

305
00:27:50.160 --> 00:28:04.200
Moses Nasser: Aside from that, I would say, you know, come to group will do the medication check and we're trying to work through the steps. I'm always going to encourage you to join a group not only our group, but to go to meetings like a meetings.

306
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:13.320
Moses Nasser: So you go to Narcotics Anonymous. Oh, what's your spirituality, if you don't mind sharing it with me. Do you have a spiritual belief system.

307
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.060
Marcus Ma: I do. Yeah, I'm

308
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.230
Marcus Ma: I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

309
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.490
Moses Nasser: Oh, excellent.

310
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.710
Moses Nasser: Can I just say Mormon, is that okay

311
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.550
Marcus Ma: Mormons, fine.

312
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.070
Moses Nasser: Okay, so

313
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:33.900
Moses Nasser: I would encourage you to check and see if there is an addiction recovery group through your church.

314
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.390
Moses Nasser: There are there is there is

315
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:52.350
Moses Nasser: Yeah, there's also there in the Christian Church in the Christian that's not Mormon, because I don't like to categorize Mormons as non Christians, but in the in the nondenominational Christian church. I guess you could say there's something called Celebrate Recovery.

316
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.770
Moses Nasser: So recovery is a Christ centered

317
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.610
Moses Nasser: recovery program and it is still based on the 12 steps, but we also base it on like the Beatitudes.

318
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:09.450
Moses Nasser: And instead of referring to a higher power refer to God, you know, in the name of Jesus Christ. You know, it's very, it's Christian

319
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:24.810
Moses Nasser: Is very powerful. And so that's what I that's, that's my preference. That's what I recommend. Um, so I would recommend researching or checking out a meeting it through your church through the temple or through a Celebrate Recovery meeting.

320
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:39.030
Moses Nasser: Eventually, our goal for. So our goal in recovery is to be going to meetings every week and and that could be seven meetings a week. It could be one meeting a week but plugged into meetings, having a sponsor.

321
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.640
Moses Nasser: And working the steps.

322
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:51.750
Moses Nasser: That's that's the core of recovery going to meetings consistently you're plugged into a community, you have brothers around you men.

323
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.210
Moses Nasser: Men around you that are encouraging you and helping you. You have a sponsor.

324
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:05.070
Moses Nasser: Somebody you can call and your sponsor is helping you work through the steps and you're doing the work because recovery. You have to do the work.

325
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:13.080
Moses Nasser: You know, it's, there's no shortcuts. You have to actually go through the steps and do the work you knowledge in your higher power. I was powerless over my addiction.

326
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:24.240
Moses Nasser: You know, God can restore me to sanity, you write down your character faults, you know, things you've done in the past, you make amends. I mean, the whole that whole process is really just applying

327
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:33.600
Moses Nasser: Your faith in your life and applying that process. And that's where healing happens is going through that and it also happens in the community, but having brothers around you men.

328
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:45.630
Moses Nasser: Men of god that are around you that are supporting you, you know, that are laying their hands on you praying over you. But having that support that men support group is huge.

329
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:52.530
Moses Nasser: Now, if you're not comfortable with that. Then the other option would be Narcotics Anonymous na or a

330
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:58.260
Moses Nasser: And finding a sponsor and working the steps. The same process and they'll refer to your higher power.

331
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:08.490
Moses Nasser: And then, but I mean, step one is admitted. We were powerless over our addiction, our lives have become unmanageable. Then came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.

332
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:18.300
Moses Nasser: And then made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood him. So whether you go to an A or a or you go to Celebrate Recovery or whatever they have at the temple.

333
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:29.760
Moses Nasser: No matter what has some point if you're working the steps, it's a it's an essential step is acknowledging your higher power naming get naming him, you know, and moving forward with that process.

334
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:38.310
Moses Nasser: Now, if you're uncomfortable with any of that, then you could do smart recovery which is like behaviors and triggers and, you know, kind of like I can do it myself type of thing.

335
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.860
Moses Nasser: And if, if that's what you want to do, like, I'm here to say I'm not here to judge you. I'm here to support you.

336
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:53.940
Moses Nasser: So whatever works for you and your process. Of course you know I'm Christian and and you're a Mormon or slash Christian. So for me, it's like

337
00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:00.540
Moses Nasser: You know, that's what I would, that's what I'm going to recommend and go for it because that's what he'll mean that's what worked for me, you know,

338
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:10.350
Moses Nasser: And I have my own set of, like, you know, struggles with with with sex and fornication and sex outside of marriage. And so when I went to Celebrate Recovery. That's what I, that's what I was

339
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:19.260
Moses Nasser: I went to see. I was like, wow, addiction, you know Christ centered addiction recovery. Let me go check this out. And then when I got there and praise and worship and this name was like, wow, it's great.

340
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:29.160
Moses Nasser: And so the guy that was in charge counties and I told him. Yeah, I'm here. You know, I'm a physician and this and that, you know, he's like, okay, then I was like, but you know I do kind of struggle with.

341
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:36.120
Moses Nasser: I think I do kind of struggle with, you know, this sexual sexual addiction thing, you know, because it's something that's

342
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:52.050
Moses Nasser: Been in my life and I had this girlfriend and, you know, and it just was like destructive for me, you know, and going to massage parlors between you and I and stuff like that. And he's like, he goes, we have a group for you like

343
00:32:53.220 --> 00:33:05.670
Moses Nasser: I was like, okay, we'll try it out, you know, and then it ended up being just just really amazing having these men of God, people that really love God, you know, that are struggling with the same professionals.

344
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:18.300
Moses Nasser: educated professionals struggling with the same thing that I was. And so getting my little coin and being able to call someone. I mean, it just, it was trying to he has made all the difference in the world. It's really amazing.

345
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:33.480
Moses Nasser: So it's a cool environment and you'll get that somewhat obviously you'll get that same not the same, but you'll get that in like in a Narcotics Anonymous or a you're going to get that, but it's a different. It's a different group of people, you know, with the different you know kind of

346
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:44.850
Moses Nasser: Everyone has their own belief system or whatever. And people are still supportive. You know, there's a lot of cursing and cigarettes and coffee and all that stuff. But yeah, everyone has their own style that works for them.

347
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:50.340
Moses Nasser: So for to do you have any questions about everything what I just talked about.

348
00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:58.650
Marcus Ma: Um, well, yeah. Yeah, I do. I do. I do you have some questions all also say to just as just as feedback I i

367
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:14.040
Marcus Ma: I would, I would say it's not as organized as the Celebrate Recovery seems to be, so I think I'm I think I am going to check out the Celebrate Recovery.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:19.980
Marcus Ma: Okay, because I want to, I want to get a sponsor. I've had a sponsor before in the

374
00:35:46.320 --> 00:36:03.030
Marcus Ma: But it's not the Soviet recovery sounds. It sounds like a good fit for me. So I'll, I'll try to find a group that I can plug into and see how. See how that fits and and then and then quick questions I had about the not not practicing

375
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.250
Marcus Ma: Naltrexone Naltrexone

376
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:24.120
Marcus Ma: So I one other thing is I am. I've been thinking about quitting smoking lately, but I don't know. I don't know if it's the right time for me to do that because I'm basically I'm like giving up everything and

377
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.930
Marcus Ma: And you know even giving up like

378
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:37.530

Marcus Ma: And

382
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:52.920
Moses Nasser: I would say I would say, let's see how you feel on the Naltrexone that might help with the smoking. Also, but like you said, it's not the right

383
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.790
Time.

384
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.490

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.020
Moses Nasser: Yeah, I can hear you and see you now.

442
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.840
LINDSEY: Okay, yeah, I'm almost there.

443
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.690
Moses Nasser: I can see you tomorrow. Do you want to do tomorrow at two o'clock.

444
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:21.030
LINDSEY: I won't be able to do that because I'm working, but I can hear you really well. Now if that works for you.

445
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.280
Moses Nasser: Okay.

446
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:30.510
LINDSEY: I had to have to do this meeting in my car because I really don't have any privacy where I live.

447
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.580
Moses Nasser: Alright, no problem. We'll just knock it out.

448
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:50.220
LINDSEY: Yeah, we don't have to do like the whole therapy session. If you want to

449
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:57.750
LINDSEY: Um, I know. Like I'm signed up for therapy, but I'm really just trying to get back on antidepressants.

450
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.560
Moses Nasser: Okay.

451
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.790
Moses Nasser: Shows that the main reason you're coming in.

452
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:19.110
LINDSEY: I mean, I would like to do therapy. I know I need to do it. Um, but, like, my main concern right now is getting back on my medications, because when I lost my health insurance, about a year ago.

453
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.160
LINDSEY: I thought I could

454
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.820
LINDSEY: Get off my medications and that I was good. Um, but I'm realizing that I actually

455
00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.610
LINDSEY: am struggling without medication and I was on it for a while and it really helped.

456
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:40.290
LINDSEY: Okay. And I thought I was better. But now that I'm off of it. I'm realizing that yeah it's not better.

457
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.080
Moses Nasser: Your first name is Lindsey right

LINDSEY: Give me a second. Oh, good.

463
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:11.550
Moses Nasser: And sorry about such the long delay, I was working in one place and then I went and had to pick up my daughter from school and

464
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.950
LINDSEY: It was, yeah, I totally get it.

465
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.250
Moses Nasser: long afternoon, you know, trying to get things situated.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.130

LINDSEY: Know I

475
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:55.110
LINDSEY: Know I don't actually drink alcohol. I don't like it but I do occasionally

476
00:53:56.130 --> 00:54:00.540
LINDSEY: I'm brings it to a

477
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.290
LINDSEY: Medical sometimes they do have a little bit of THC.

478
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:06.660
LINDSEY: But if

479
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:17.130
LINDSEY: I mean, I guess that's still considered a drug, but it's totally legal in California. So I definitely use that here in there as needed.

480
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.990
Moses Nasser: Okay, how often is that

481
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:20.820
LINDSEY: Um,

482
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.010
Moses Nasser: once a week, once a day.

483
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.470
LINDSEY: It just really depends. It's as needed. Um,

484
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:32.250
LINDSEY: Let's just say like a couple times a month.

485
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.200
Moses Nasser: Like twice a month.

486
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:35.790
LINDSEY: Sure.

487
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:37.980
Moses Nasser: Okay.

488
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:52.020
LINDSEY: It's nothing like it's nothing heavy it's mainly just CBD that I'm taking for anxiety because I'm trying as many things as I can try to get through the day, you know, because I'll drink caffeine to get stimulated.

489
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:58.020
LINDSEY: So I could do a good job at work and then I've got so much anxiety. So I'm just constantly like

490
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.930
LINDSEY: Just trying to like get myself to the right mood, but I never really feel like I'm there.

491
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.190
Yeah.

492
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:14.730
Moses Nasser: So the main reason that you came in is, for depression and anxiety.

493
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.560
LINDSEY: Yeah.

494
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:25.020
Moses Nasser: Okay. And so for your depression. Are you depressed, like all the time. Like most days or do you get episodes.

495
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.380
LINDSEY: Um, yeah, I would say it's always there. Um,

496
00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:41.100
LINDSEY: Yeah, I would definitely say I'm more of like the depressed person that is just kind of always depressed rather

497
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:42.960
LINDSEY: Than like

498
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.870
LINDSEY: manic or any

499
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:06.960
Moses Nasser: Are you there.

500
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.630
LINDSEY: And like

501
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.010
Moses Nasser: I can't hear you.

502
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.360
LINDSEY: Oh,

503
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:25.590
LINDSEY: I did, but I have to drink less caffeine to care about anything. And then I just feel anxious

504
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.840
LINDSEY: Okay. Um, can you hear me now.

505
00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:33.420
LINDSEY: Yeah, I'm

506
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:34.890
LINDSEY: Sorry.

507
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.140
LINDSEY: A little bit, yeah, I'm here.

508
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:44.760
Moses Nasser: Yeah.

509
00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:46.590
LINDSEY: All right.

510
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.790
LINDSEY: Are you

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.960
Moses Nasser: Are you there. What

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:58.470
LINDSEY: I've got yeah I'm here.

513
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:03.360
LINDSEY: I have four bars and service, so I don't

514
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.450
LINDSEY: Know why it's so delay.

515
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:10.740
Moses Nasser: Okay.

516
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:15.420
Moses Nasser: So you said you're usually depressed, all the time.

517
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:18.150
Moses Nasser: Every day do you get feelings of hopelessness.

518
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:26.730
LINDSEY: I just don't care.

519
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.590
LINDSEY: I would say

520
00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:33.180
LINDSEY: Oh,

521
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.270
Moses Nasser: Do you have trouble sleeping or sleeping too much.

522
00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:49.770
LINDSEY: Yeah, I definitely have gone through episodes of slowly being way too much. Um, but I'm trying to like get my

523
00:57:50.220 --> 00:58:07.410
LINDSEY: I know that's not good. I don't know. It just depends. Sometimes, I sleep. Way too much. And then there's certain things that I know I need to do to be happy. But then I get anxious about them. So then, sometimes I don't sleep very well and I wake up through

524
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:11.100
LINDSEY: The night worried about it.

525
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:18.510
Moses Nasser: Okay. And do you feel excessive guilt.

526
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.600
LINDSEY: Not really, no.

527
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:26.880
Moses Nasser: You said you have low energy right

528
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.020
LINDSEY: Yeah. The only thing I ever felt guilt.

529
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:32.850
LINDSEY: To you about this.

530
00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:37.380
LINDSEY: Time because

531
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:46.380
LINDSEY: It feels like I can't get any done or I can't like use my time wisely.

532
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.100
Moses Nasser: Do you have a normal appetite.

533
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.070
Moses Nasser: To eat. Okay. Do you have

534
00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:57.240
Yeah.

535
00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:06.270
Moses Nasser: Okay. And then, do you have any thoughts about hurting yourself.

536
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:07.740
Moses Nasser: Or hurting anyone else.

537
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:19.620
LINDSEY: Really well that's like the one thing that

538
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:20.430
Moses Nasser: You cut out

539
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:39.810

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.280
LINDSEY: Okay, I have five hours of service.

546
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:42.660
Moses Nasser: What time do you work tomorrow.

547
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:52.410
LINDSEY: I go to work in the morning, but it's more of like a project thing. So we're, we're done when we're done. Um,

548
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.930
Moses Nasser: What have you started the morning

549
01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:56.910
LINDSEY: Nine.

550
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:11.400
Moses Nasser: Well, I can actually okay let's see if we can finish really quick what medicine what medicine where you want before

551
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:16.650
LINDSEY: I was on trend telex TR i n te LL IX.

552
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:21.120
Moses Nasser: Alex

553
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:32.310
LINDSEY: Yeah, but it's really expensive. And that's that caused a whole nother or slew of issues for me as well. So I need to see if I can get it affordably.

554
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.190
Moses Nasser: Um, have you have you tried any other

555
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.950
Moses Nasser: Have you tried any other antidepressants in the past.

556
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:57.420
LINDSEY: Yeah, and the other ones kind of messed with me a bit. I tried. So loft. I tried Wellbutrin and Trent Alex was the one that like actually kind of balanced meal, and I didn't have any negative side effects.

557
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:08.040
Moses Nasser: Okay. Well, I, I just don't want to have problems with it, you know, with the with insurance and all that stuff.

558
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.470
Moses Nasser: Yeah, I'm

559
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.870
Moses Nasser: 40 ox a team. It's probably related to Paxil, have you tried Paxil

560
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:19.710
LINDSEY: Oh god yeah I don't want to take Paxil I

561
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.950
LINDSEY: Just like weight gain and like

562
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:28.620
LINDSEY: Not getting like feeling what

563
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.540
Moses Nasser: Happened when you took Wellbutrin

564
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.140
LINDSEY: Wellbutrin just made me like stop eating and

565
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:45.300
LINDSEY: I don't know how to explain it. It was just kind of like super stimulating, but in a bad way.

566
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:46.320
Mm hmm.

567
01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:48.510
Moses Nasser: Right.

568
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.670
LINDSEY: Like I get

569
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.950
LINDSEY: Prescribed prescribed

570
01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:01.830
LINDSEY: Adderall or Vive asked for my ADHD and that was nice because I could take it as needed.

571
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:21.720
LINDSEY: I'm like, if I had to go to work or something but Wellbutrin just kind of always had me on that edge where I felt stimulated, but to the point where it was like more gave me more anxiety than like ADHD drugs do towards the end of the day, you know,

572
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:31.320
Moses Nasser: Okay, let's try. Why don't we try Lexapro. Um, have you ever tried Lexapro or select, sir.

573
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:45.690
LINDSEY: Um, no. Can we, can we just maybe try for the trend, Alex. Because I know that works. And then I can just go through my insurance and see if I can afford it. And if I

574
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.020
LINDSEY: Can't then I can contact you guys

575
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:56.790
Moses Nasser: Sure what dosage. Well, let's see. Start 10 milligrams a day what dosage. Were you on before that worked for you.

576
01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:57.990
LINDSEY: I was on

577
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:07.980
Moses Nasser: Okay, so we'll start 10 milligrams a day. Make sure you're not having any side effects do that for a week or two, and then we can bump it to 20

578
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.660
LINDSEY: Okay, um,

579
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:25.800
LINDSEY: I also used to be prescribed Gabba Penton for anxiety because that was like the one that you can't get addicted to or that's like why initially wanted to try that one.

580
01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:26.730
Moses Nasser: Mm hmm.

581
01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:30.900
LINDSEY: Have you. Have you prescribed gab intention for anxiety before

582
01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:36.420
Moses Nasser: I have and you know I did. Did that work for you in the past. Did you like it.

583
01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:55.980
LINDSEY: Oh god, yeah. It really helps if I'm feeling like anxious, even if I I used to be prescribed like these. They're like horse pills, but I could break it up and take like 200 milligrams of it and it definitely took the edge off but didn't have me like sedated.

584
01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:02.550
Moses Nasser: So the Gabba Penton dosage. Usually I give like 300 milligrams three times a day.

585
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:03.930
Moses Nasser: But you

586
01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:14.490
Moses Nasser: Do 100 200 300. Where do you want to start with. You want to start on a real low like 100 or you want to just do the three hundreds take them at night and get them going.

587
01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:16.890
LINDSEY: Yeah 300 or five

588
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.520
Moses Nasser: Right on national Boulevard. Right.

589
01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:31.800
Yeah.

590
01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:33.390
LINDSEY: And

591
01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:35.280
LINDSEY: I think that

592
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:51.210
LINDSEY: I would like to get my ADHD medication back because I just do so much better at work and I feel more confident and it helps me when I'm getting like emotional like I know

593
01:06:52.500 --> 01:07:02.130
LINDSEY: I know it sounds weird but like the stimulating effects of it kind of bring me out of depression, when I'm feeling like low and I need to just, like, feel like awake.

594
01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:13.830
LINDSEY: So I have my records. I've been getting prescribed it since I was 15 and then I lost my insurance and haven't been to the doctor and over a year.

595
01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.550
Moses Nasser: Okay.

596
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.580
Moses Nasser: So ADHD since 15 years old.

597
01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:33.450
Moses Nasser: Were you on

598
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:33.810
LINDSEY: They

599
01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.010
Moses Nasser: diagnosed me with it.

600
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:35.130
And

601
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.410
LINDSEY: I was on

602
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:44.130
LINDSEY: Finance, but then not got too expensive. So I switched from by the Insta Adderall.

603
01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:57.360
Moses Nasser: I have to find out if I'm able to do that. I'm not sure if I can do that. They are all for you. Okay.

604
01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:00.030
LINDSEY: Okay.

605
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:12.210
Moses Nasser: And I especially don't want to start everything at the same time, I usually like to do just one thing at a time, but I'm okay with the trend Alex and the gap repentant at the same time.

606
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.680
Moses Nasser: The other thing that we could do is

607
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.410
LINDSEY: Sorry, go ahead.

608
01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:32.010
Moses Nasser: Everything we could do is try a really small dose of Wellbutrin and now augmented trint Alex and it will give you a little bit of that energy and the arm, it helps with ADHD Wellbutrin kind of affects the same

609
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:39.750
Moses Nasser: Process as they as like the Adderall does, but it's just at a much lower level and more consistently.

610
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:55.470
LINDSEY: Yeah, but the Wellbutrin is like constant anxiety when I feel like just taking a turn. Alex with the ADHD meds at a low dose as needed, as

611
01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:12.870
LINDSEY: Well, my doctor prescribed me 30 milligrams, so I never took that much. So I, I need as much as like five milligrams to 10 milligrams to feel

612
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:17.550
LINDSEY: Like okay, but not too much.

613
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:26.910
Moses Nasser: Hello. Yeah, I'm here. So really, just like a pirate around

614
01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:39.540
LINDSEY: Yeah, like a very low dose, just to like have me focused, but not overly drug dominant

615
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:55.620
LINDSEY: Because when I first started taking it as a kid, like it was crazy like way over the top. Um, but now it seems like it feels like an effective anti depressant, and lower doses.

616
01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.610
LINDSEY: Um,

617
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:17.910
LINDSEY: And I can send you all of my medical history from my previous doctor, I went to a neurologist in high school and then in college, I went to a general doctor and I've been it's all the paperwork is there from years of tape.

618
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:24.180
LINDSEY: And I realized that I was actually like

619
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:42.150
LINDSEY: Treating my depression with the Adderall and then like, once I got out of college, I realized that like I had been really depressed, my whole life. And I just didn't like, you know, really realized that, because I just thought that was normal.

620
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.080
Yeah.

621
01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:09.600
Moses Nasser: Medical Director. See if I can give it to you or not.

622
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:11.460

Moses Nasser: Um, do you have any thoughts about hurting yourself or anyone else.

642
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.730
Moses Nasser: Never okay um

643
01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.180

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:58.020
Moses Nasser: Never okay i sent in the trend to x to the pharmacy and the gabapentin I sent a message to my medical director to see if I can give you a little bit of Adderall to help you as needed for the

645
01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:04.470
Moses Nasser: For the ADHD just really quick for the anxiety is it every day that you have anxiety. So like

646
01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:05.220
Moses Nasser: Every time

647
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:11.820
LINDSEY: I every day all day but it gets so much worse when I have to go socialize, like I'm a hermit, as is.

648
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:25.290
LINDSEY: But then social gatherings. I, I just haven't been going out and when I was on antidepressants, I would actually not really mind talking to people, but I've been so cooped up by myself. The last year because

649
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:31.560
LINDSEY: And that's how I really realized that I am depressed is because I haven't been doing anything or going out and seeing anyone

650
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.040
Moses Nasser: Okay.

651
01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.180
LINDSEY: And it's mainly from, I guess.

652
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:49.080
LINDSEY: Yeah, it's like I always have anxiety, but I definitely have social anxiety and I like sometimes can't even speak right when I'm at work.

653
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:58.740
LINDSEY: And it's like I'm losing jobs and I haven't been making money and I just realized that like when I was medicated like everything was balanced and I

654
01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:10.260
LINDSEY: could depend, but I knew that my mood would be consistent and it wasn't like, oh, like I might be totally depressed that day. Like, I can't commit to that, you know,

655
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:13.530
Moses Nasser: Okay.

656
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:14.580
