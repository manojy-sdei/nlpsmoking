32
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.720
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

33
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.150
Richelle Direny: And you live alone right

Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, well, yeah, I would. I know you have, we have group tomorrow that is Wednesday. So tomorrow, so you can, you know,

36
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.510
Matthew Knauff: Going to appointment with my counselor, but

37
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.060
Matthew Knauff: I'm willing to pay my counter

38
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.330
Matthew Knauff: Sorry about that. It was neighbor.

39
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.310
Richelle Direny: Okay, so we haven't gone over your own goals. So that's what we'll do today.

40
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.010
Richelle Direny: Today,

41
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.750
Richelle Direny: I know moving forward. Um, what they're they're starting to do now.

42
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:49.470
Richelle Direny: Is that if you like. Okay, so let's say you have an appointment and like, so we had the appointments, a day and you weren't able to make it and you sent me a message and I can reschedule it or what have you. That will be okay in

43
00:05:50.190 --> 00:06:00.690
Richelle Direny: But like if I find that there's a whole lot of no shows or missed appointments, they're going to kind of read your script there. So they're making their kind of the rules of the program. There are somewhat

44
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.900
Richelle Direny: coming a little bit stricter with them.

45
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.670
Richelle Direny: Okay.

46
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:17.640
Richelle Direny: So just to make you aware that it's always important especially, you know, just let me know either send me a message call virtual clinics and just say, Hey, I won't be able to make it because of whatever the reason,

47
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.420
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, I will watch it and miss any after this

48
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.230
Matthew Knauff: After the last time. That's not like being at all.

49
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.910
Richelle Direny: No, I mean, like I said, it's no problem, just

50
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.700
Richelle Direny: Because I know you said that the the reminders are helpful.

51
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.260
Matthew Knauff: They are

52
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:09.780
Matthew Knauff: And I think a couple times. I don't know if I can go back and do them, but I just realized the other day that before groups. I hadn't been doing the

53
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.390
Matthew Knauff: Survey thing.

54
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.950
Richelle Direny: till tomorrow. Just tomorrow, Thursday, what time do you come to top 12 or six

55
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.790
Matthew Knauff: I'll probably come at 12 tomorrow.

56
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.330
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but I think you do them every seven days before the

57
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.890
Richelle Direny: Before the group. So just try to get

58
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.890
Matthew Knauff: Get it done tomorrow. Okay.

59
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.000
Matthew Knauff: Oh, I didn't last week and the week before it was just like before that.

60
00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.040
Richelle Direny: Oh,

61
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.880
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think I want to say it's every week.

62
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.130
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it is. It was

63
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.110
Matthew Knauff: The times before that I hadn't done the

64
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.410
Matthew Knauff: Paper that I'd done at once and I completely forgot about it like a couple of times and then

65
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:21.330
Matthew Knauff: They reminded me that like when the last time. So I didn't know if I should go back and do them for those weeks or what to do.

66
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.970
Richelle Direny: Alright so today I want to talk about your

67
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:46.080
Richelle Direny: You know, what is your treatment. We're going to go over like your treatment plans and goals like what is it that you would like to work on.

68
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.550
Matthew Knauff: Like when I get back to work about my stress management, what I need, like, the most

69
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.050
Matthew Knauff: Stuff with because I'm pretty good at my, you know,

70
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.060
Matthew Knauff: As far as my

71
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:06.900
Matthew Knauff: Yeah.

72
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.560
Matthew Knauff: Me. It's always an ongoing thing you know you some you should always work one

73
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:28.980
Richelle Direny: So, so when you say that you're you're good with your sobriety over. I mean, remember, and I think we've talked about this in our group before it's that

74
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.830
Richelle Direny: Addiction.

75
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.280
Richelle Direny: Is

76
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.800
Richelle Direny: The precursor to addiction, our

77
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:53.550
Richelle Direny: Inability to cope with whatever it is, anxiety, stress all they're all these of the precursors to when I'm if your stress level is beyond

78
00:09:54.090 --> 00:10:07.140
Richelle Direny: What you're capable of handling, um, you lose all sense of control and power and you feel so overwhelmed. You need that sense of you, you need that pressure to be released.

79
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:21.480
Richelle Direny: And what ends up happening is that, though. You've been on this journey of sobriety for so long you've been able to manage. But then life just came actually like a ton of bricks and when it came into like a ton of

80
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.320
Matthew Knauff: Bricks what happened.

81
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.470
Richelle Direny: You find something to help you in that moment. It's kind of like you go, you got to cut you have severe pain.

82
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:34.830
Richelle Direny: You need that pain is something you've done everything and it's not working. And it's like, it's really just getting to you. So what do you do

83
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.200
Richelle Direny: You find the quickest of what you know, or someone introduced us and says, Hey, take this. This will help

84
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:52.080
Richelle Direny: And so it begins this journey, again, of being addicted to something, it may not necessarily be your addiction to if it was pain pills or if it was, whatever it was.

85
00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:07.020
Richelle Direny: Now you've developed a new addiction to something else. You understand. So even though the most part, whatever your drug of choice was you have been sober from that for a while. It doesn't mean that I no longer

86
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:16.350
Richelle Direny: I'm still on this journey of recovery, because I'm no longer doing let's say heroin, whatever your drug of choice was now you're now.

87
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:27.840
Richelle Direny: Looking at one. Let's just say, or you're smoking in even though in some states marijuana maybe legal, but at the end of the day, anything becomes

88
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.750
Richelle Direny: That takes over your life and you're finding any means of what to get it, it becomes an addiction for you.

89
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:49.110
Richelle Direny: And it's something that you have lost control and now. So that's kind of how you have looked at it. Now this is a good one. You're saying that one of the things that you want to personally work on is finding effective ways to do with stress management and

90
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.400
Richelle Direny: It's looking at that.

91
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:58.740
Richelle Direny: Because if you go back to work. And depending on where you're working if the stressors are really, really high for you. What is going to happen.

92
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.130
Richelle Direny: It's going to tailspin in a downward spiral and part of so you're working

93
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:06.990
Richelle Direny: And

94
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:20.730
Richelle Direny: Let's say your manager is really just being really nasty your, your coworkers are being really nasty and you're thinking you're dealing with it. But the minute that you find out that you may lose your job if you don't

95
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:35.940
Richelle Direny: Meet their demands, or the job requirements. Um, that's not the part that's really overwhelming the part that's overwhelming is your sense of financial security been taken away from you and not having anything to replace that

96
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.650
Richelle Direny: And that's what

97
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.000
Richelle Direny: It is for you.

98
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.880
Richelle Direny: Then it's finding effective ways to cope with.

99
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:48.900
Richelle Direny: Anything that may come at you because it's all about your financial future being affected by it, it's not

100
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:58.920
Richelle Direny: Yes, this is going on at the job. But guess what, I have two other jobs if y'all want to echo fall I got two more things to fall back on. I'm okay, financially, but if this is my only thing

101
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.300
Then

102
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:14.760
Richelle Direny: I'm going to, I'm going to lose all sense of control, cuz I don't want now what to do. Okay, so, but those are just examples of in terms of when you look at your goals and what is it that whatever do you think

103
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.820
Richelle Direny: Is something that you've struggled with.

104
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:26.550
Richelle Direny: Or something that you personally know that are triggers to

105
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:35.460
Richelle Direny: A potential relapse. One of them, he said his stress for you, you identified work. What about work is a stress.

106
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.100
Matthew Knauff: It's

107
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.490
Matthew Knauff: Just when

108
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.130
Matthew Knauff: People start dying and stuff like that. I never have been able to handle that good or just

109
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.650
Matthew Knauff: Like it's never got

110
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.860
Matthew Knauff: It's never got like

111
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:04.020
Matthew Knauff: Routine to me or become like easier. I still have a lot of Gil and stuff associated with it and have a hard time

112
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.610
Matthew Knauff: You know, I always to me I it's like I failed that

113
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.950
Matthew Knauff: Person to person, and then

114
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:21.300
Matthew Knauff: When it comes along with sometimes happened to the family's there and stuff at the scene and it's then it's

115
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.750
Matthew Knauff: Good, yeah. Empty

116
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:25.680
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

117
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.630
Richelle Direny: Okay, and you said being at the scene and the families are there.

118
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.340
Matthew Knauff: Yeah.

119
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.170
Matthew Knauff: My turn to

120
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.820
Matthew Knauff: Go in and

121
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.520
Matthew Knauff: Sorry about that.

122
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.670
Richelle Direny: No problem. What you had a dog next to you.

123
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.820
Richelle Direny: You had an animal next

124
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.210
Richelle Direny: To you.

125
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.030
Matthew Knauff: In neighbor.

126
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.910
Matthew Knauff: Sorry about that. Okay.

127
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.070
Matthew Knauff: Okay.

128
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.410
Richelle Direny: So for you is, um,

129
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.660
Richelle Direny: It's the it's the last of the patients that you're working with.

130
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.520
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, I was. I can't am

131
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:25.380
Matthew Knauff: I always feel like if I can't get them back whatever I I've always had a hard time dealing with that and then that kind of

132
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.910
Matthew Knauff: Get I get real.

133
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:39.090
Matthew Knauff: Like emotional one step over it and it's just before kind of been a place where it's caused me to want to escape that like

134
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:50.040
Matthew Knauff: Especially if there's a lot of stuff like happens in a row. Like sometimes that will happen. And it's really bad like

135
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.640
Richelle Direny: Now for you.

136
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:55.620
Richelle Direny: So,

137
00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.430
Richelle Direny: What in that moment.

138
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.190
Richelle Direny: You walk me through the your most recent um

139
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:19.410
Richelle Direny: Call that you've been on that. Maybe you've lost one of the patients or, you know, because you're saying that it's in the moment of from you can call to the scene to the

140
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:35.310
Matthew Knauff: Sport. It's from when it's over, like especially like in like an accordion caress, let's say, and I always like I always study like bargaining with them, even, like, you know. Come on, buddy. Come on, you just give me a little bit of something and I got yeah you know just

141
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.820
Matthew Knauff: Give me something to work with, you're not. We got this, you know,

142
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:49.620
Matthew Knauff: I and then you'll look sometimes you're looking to fame that will be following right behind you and you're just like, and then, like, if it's if it's the parent, they make this sale. That's like

143
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:57.390
Matthew Knauff: Any way to describe it is like someone so has broken open and pain is just, it's this

144
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:05.310
Matthew Knauff: Like it's the worst I've never anything like it's the most. It almost makes you sick when you it's like

145
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.560
Matthew Knauff: It's just like someone so is screaming Akin and it that's it's the worst.

146
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:22.740
Matthew Knauff: I hate that worse than anything that really, really gets me in a bad way is when that happens and it's normally have we heard it with a parent with something with when their kids if they've

147
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:32.550
Matthew Knauff: they've died or something they've come to the scene, you have to try to tell them and keep them back. The they'll just like fall to their knees and let this ungodly sound out and it's horrible.

148
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.170
Matthew Knauff: Awful.

149
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.770
Richelle Direny: In the moment like before they pass or just as their phones for the pain.

150
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.460
Matthew Knauff: Like a parent that with their kid, like if they come to the like they don't know something's happened and they've

151
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:54.870
Matthew Knauff: Come to the scene or whatever, and they when they find out that sound like it like a better mom makes it like when you

152
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:10.410
Matthew Knauff: It's it's it's it just makes it's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life, it's this, it's just this crap. Yeah, but it's more like just from their soul like this it's it's horrible. And then some of the stuff that

153
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.830
Matthew Knauff: You seek and it can just be like,

154
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:22.950
Matthew Knauff: But I mean, I've done that so long that I can deal with that. It's just I always get will buy guilt feelings and, you know, stuff like that. But I've

155
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:31.860
Richelle Direny: Seen, where do you what. So what I want you to take. So take the term and try your best to explain because I think maybe

156
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.080
Richelle Direny: Sometimes what I don't want to say sometimes maybe what I'm hearing is that

157
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:47.040
Richelle Direny: What is it in the depth of you like when you hear in because you're, you're saying that you've been doing it for so long.

158
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.300
Richelle Direny: Doesn't sound to me like you've gotten immune to it.

159
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:52.950
Richelle Direny: Because it

160
00:18:53.190 --> 00:19:04.500
Richelle Direny: bothers you why. Yeah, because it still bothers you. But what is it about the sound because you're saying it's not identifying the sound with just the regular screen.

161
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:10.110
Richelle Direny: Or but it's it's like an internal for you. You're hearing. It's something like an internal thing.

162
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:24.930
Richelle Direny: Where, where that sound is coming from. It sounds very different from a scream or yell, whatever it is. So what about that to you think I just want you to think for I want you to tap into yourself and we're

163
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.080
Matthew Knauff: Going to explain this to is on like a row

164
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.420
Matthew Knauff: It's almost like that I

165
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.360
Matthew Knauff: Like almost like hurt for people like I it's more than what normal people do. It's like, I almost like

166
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.050
Matthew Knauff: Like if I see anyone. I can't even stand to watch a movie. It's not because something greason happens

167
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:59.340
Matthew Knauff: I can't stand it because something bad's happening to somebody and I'm like real caring about people and it's like it hurts me and I just and it's like immediately I just see that I just can't imagine what you know they're going through, and it just

168
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:12.450
Matthew Knauff: I mean sometimes I had patients died. I just wanna. I just want to hold them and tell him like, you know, it's one pick him up and hold you. I mean, hold them in because it just breaks my heart like

169
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:22.650
Matthew Knauff: Some stuff and you. I mean, you can't do that. But I, and I've gotten arguments before because I've had patients that overdosed and people that's

170
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:31.140
Matthew Knauff: On the call with me and started to say some really messed up stuff about them and I mean I've, I get really upset. They were that because I'm like they just

171
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:42.300
Matthew Knauff: Their addiction just cost them their life, they just paid their life for it and you're willing to talk. So you're gonna say something like that about somebody if they might be dead, but I'm like that's not

172
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:54.780
Matthew Knauff: Like that. So I don't know. I think it's almost I'm to hearing about stuff. And it's hard. I just can't leave it at work. Like, I'll go home and still be worrying about, you know,

173
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.570
Matthew Knauff: Patients and stuff. And I think I just need to figure out some way to

174
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.870
Matthew Knauff: Have a healthy, you know,

175
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.690
Matthew Knauff: Mindset or something about it.

176
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.990
Matthew Knauff: It's been I had been off because I had had a bad health problem with my lungs for a couple years, and then

177
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:29.100
Matthew Knauff: So I think that it's and what ended up happening was to my dad went into cardiac arrest or me and my mom and we live in a small town and we couldn't get help for like 45 minutes. And so that really

178
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:39.930
Matthew Knauff: Was bad when I couldn't say my dad, it really, really, really messed with me and I started eating a lot of windows because I had been prescribed him for years, but then I

179
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.320
Matthew Knauff: Become a problem and I had this psychiatry set told me where is when for treatment at the time that

180
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:57.180
Matthew Knauff: She thought I had PTSD and been through dazzle paint with the worst thing for it. And I thought she don't know what she's talking about. Well, it was because once I agreed to taper off of them.

181
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:12.930
Matthew Knauff: It's like I could, I finally was able to like have to deal with it. And when I did it was I had remembered it a way that it wouldn't happen. And I felt like I gave up on my dad, but then when I was able to actually set and make myself go through it. They have to deal with it.

182
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.950
Matthew Knauff: It took all this guilt away from me because I didn't

183
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:27.510
Matthew Knauff: Give up on him. I stopped because I knew that it was have been 45 minutes and doing CPR by myself, you know, your

184
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.000
Matthew Knauff: Efficiency goes down after three minutes. You want to change rescuers every two to three minutes.

185
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:41.670
Matthew Knauff: So by 45 minutes of just basic CPR. He wasn't want to, you know, his brain had been so damaged and he wasn't when they come back, but

186
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:58.020
Matthew Knauff: The way I had been dealing with it for a couple of years is that I had just gave up on him and how he could have done that and, you know, so when I done that. It's like, it made it so much better. I had to go through it because I was just taking then chose to not have to deal with the

187
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.950
Matthew Knauff: Think about it and just living in this pain. So that really

188
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:14.250
Matthew Knauff: Helps so and I've not worked since I've been off the benzo so I'm hoping maybe that it will be better that I don't have something to kind of, I have to go through it right then and then

189
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:28.560
Matthew Knauff: Deal with it. And it's over, because that's when I was in my drug use, that was always what I used for it. Any little thing went wrong, or was it perfect. I would just get high and not deal with it. I was the

190
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:38.700
Matthew Knauff: Master of not dealing with anything, if any, any little wrong thing. I would mix them up and get even higher. I didn't deal with anything.

191
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:45.000
Matthew Knauff: That was what was really, really hard, of getting used to. What's happened to experience stuff and not be able to take it away.

192
00:23:45.600 --> 00:24:02.400
Matthew Knauff: That was rough. The first little bit, you know, not being able to just blast it out of my mind. So, but I was always the professional what you know not handling anything. I just wouldn't go with it if it was the least a little bit wrong and that was really, really bad, but

193
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:17.940
Matthew Knauff: I mean, I feel I'm I think I'm better now. So I'm nervous, but I'm excited to really mean to see how for them so mentally different now with my depression that everything being so gone and everything. I'm just

194
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:19.650
Matthew Knauff: You know,

195
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.530
Richelle Direny: But, but, you use the word just now. You said, perfect. Do you

196
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.710
Richelle Direny: Would you say that you're a perfectionist.

197
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:41.820
Matthew Knauff: When it comes to that I'm obsessive perfection is like I feel like there's and I took a psych test for nursing score need even center golden that that I can be hard to work with because

198
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:51.780
Matthew Knauff: To me there's only the perfect way. Is there any way you should be able to do it. And because I take a big responsibility that you know someone's trusted me

199
00:24:52.290 --> 00:25:01.230
Matthew Knauff: With their life and to care for their families live and I take that really serious but it can be yes. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to it. I'll just say that

200
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.670
Matthew Knauff: Now,

201
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.330
Matthew Knauff: In my life. But with that, I definitely am

202
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:13.380
Richelle Direny: So your mind books home, there is this diagnosis code obsessive

203
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.870
Richelle Direny: Compulsive zone so OCD. This is which is the obsessive compulsive disorder.

204
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:25.470
Richelle Direny: Yeah, there's another one called obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

205
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:33.900
Richelle Direny: The, what do you think the difference in the two is what do you think the P. Why did they say it's a personality. What's the difference between the two.

206
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.650
Matthew Knauff: Probably the personality would be

207
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.320
Matthew Knauff: If he was like that and everything like that. You just expected everything to be

208
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.560
Matthew Knauff: Perfect, perfect, perfect. But if you

209
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.580
Matthew Knauff: If

210
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.010
Matthew Knauff: There would be just one thing. You know, like

211
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.640
Richelle Direny: Or maybe

212
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.540
Matthew Knauff: A couple things.

213
00:25:52.230 --> 00:26:00.960
Richelle Direny: It's. Yes. And so for you. I can, it sounds as if like, so the reason that the difference between the two is that you both, both of them obsessed

214
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:11.970
Richelle Direny: You're upset. You're obsessing over things. There's the routine. I think the OCD is the it's the routine. They need this routine and they have to follow this strict routine.

215
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:21.480
Richelle Direny: But the p the personality, it's because you're a perfectionist, like everything has to be perfect in your mind, whatever you set out to do. It has to be perfect.

216
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:33.990
Richelle Direny: And so if it is not the epitome of perfection of how you see the perfection. It's almost like you're losing all powers, you feel like you have no control over anything because it's what your mind.

217
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:55.020
Richelle Direny: Is defining what perfection should look like. So for you, even when you talk about your dad. And when you're talking about. It's that thing your mind maybe your mind is saying that you're set out to save everyone that you come in contact with whether save them from

218
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.650
Richelle Direny: Us that

219
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.780
Matthew Knauff: That like so right on like

220
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.380
Richelle Direny: You want to save everyone but but this is the thing.

221
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.760
Richelle Direny: You were given the gift to help you weren't given the gift to save everyone

222
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.430
Matthew Knauff: There's a different my grandma told me one time. She's like, How dare you think that you're better than God that you

223
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.440
Matthew Knauff: She's like, when he

224
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.370
Richelle Direny: You didn't give you the gift to save everybody or even save it if he

225
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:31.800
Richelle Direny: He didn't give you the gift to give life. He gave you the gift to help people make those choices and to get on the path that they need to be on but it's still there.

226
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:39.960
Richelle Direny: And so for you where this OH CPD comes in. It's that

227
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:57.210
Richelle Direny: You're basically saying, God, I hear you but I don't hear you, because I still want to do this. This is where the personality piece comes in. You're not though you're not like verbalizing it but in your actions. That's what you're saying is, like, I hear you.

228
00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.040
Richelle Direny: But

229
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:10.770
Richelle Direny: This is what I'm going to go back to I want to soul, though. Yes. You loved your dad. Yes. You wanted to help him but you even struggle with.

230
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:21.090
Richelle Direny: For him it was his time, but you didn't want to tell you're telling God no, that's not his time is time is what I say is time comes.

231
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:30.600
Richelle Direny: It's basically what without recognizing. That's what we're doing. And that's what I'm hearing. You're saying when it's all said and done,

232
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:50.820
Richelle Direny: The hardest pill to swallow is to understand people have free will, choice and what they do with their free will. Choice is hard for us to accept because now for someone who has this mind this in their mind they want to save everybody

233
00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:07.740
Richelle Direny: It's like you're taking their will, away from them, you're telling them when it's time to go. And when it's time to I can only help you as much as I have the ability to do. So I have to be okay.

234
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:18.780
Richelle Direny: When it's time to let go. I have to be okay with that. And it's what I'm hearing you say is that you haven't gotten to that place where you're okay with that.

235
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:38.160
Matthew Knauff: I'm, I'm hoping that I have when I go back to work, because I handle stuff a lot better now. And I used to handle even stuff like well like even my aging like I did not handle that. Well, like I mean that was like the worst thing in the world to me was like

236
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:52.020
Matthew Knauff: But when I got real sick after my dad died, and I got will stick with my lungs and everything I gained so much weight and was so swollen and had to be on oxygen that I kind of had to just let a lot of stuff go because

237
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.470
Matthew Knauff: I was definitely very powerless. So in that time. There's three years that I was sick.

238
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:05.520
Matthew Knauff: Is when like the depression, kind of like when I start getting better. That's been my depression had like

239
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.630
Matthew Knauff: Went away for the first time in my life. So I don't know if maybe it's

240
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.190
Richelle Direny: Because I do you think

241
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:15.840
Richelle Direny: You're just went away. Why do you think in a moment. I have no idea.

242
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.240
Richelle Direny: What you just said in my whole life.

243
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.050
Richelle Direny: No, you just said it, but I don't think you recognize that sometimes we have

244
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.060
Matthew Knauff: Because I'm handling stuff better and

245
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.700
Matthew Knauff: Not obsessing over everything just if something happened just letting it

246
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:31.320
Matthew Knauff: And not there.

247
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.100
Richelle Direny: But you said

248
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:49.920
Richelle Direny: The word you said is that I recognize I am powerless over whatever the circumstances. And when you recognize that you brought it into awareness. I am powerless over a particular situation.

249
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:58.230
Richelle Direny: I am now aware of it. Now the other piece to it is did you accept that you are powerless over it.

250
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:18.660
Richelle Direny: And if the two came together. I now i'm aware and I have accepted it. Now that feeling of depression of sadness of hopelessness to that situation. If you're saying that that went away. It is because I became aware and I accepted it.

251
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.670
Richelle Direny: I'm powerless.

252
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.040
Richelle Direny: I'm powerless over this particular situation. There's nothing I can do.

253
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.190
Richelle Direny: If we hold on.

254
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.620
Richelle Direny: To this I have power over it, no matter how much

255
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:55.290
Richelle Direny: This higher power saying no you don't. That's where your depression takes it becomes. It takes over. You're getting sad and you're tearing yourself down. You're stressing yourself out. All of these things are now your health is being affected because you struggle.

256
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.880
Richelle Direny: Think of it as you're underwater.

257
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.790
Richelle Direny: You can't breathe on the water, can you

258
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.590
Matthew Knauff: Know,

259
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.590
Richelle Direny: But then I'm saying, Matthew, you have to if you want to get a breath. You got to come up

260
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:20.940
Richelle Direny: No, I could do this. I am going to figure out a way to do it. No, Matthew, you got to come up. You want to breathe. You got to come up above water I'm telling you.

261
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:34.290
Richelle Direny: Know I'm gonna. Okay, I'm just saying you're slowly dying. If you see you can you stay down there. The minute you you are now aware that you cannot breathe.

262
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:48.570
Richelle Direny: And if you have accepted that you were not created to breathe underwater you allow yourself to rise to the top to take in that breath. Now you're no longer

263
00:32:49.830 --> 00:33:03.060
Richelle Direny: Depressed, you're no longer stress because you have accepted that I have no power and control with the ability to breathe underwater. And that's how you have to apply certain things that you're faced with in life.

264
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:14.040
Richelle Direny: You have power and control over some things you don't have power and control over everything. But you have to be able to identify what

265
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.070
Richelle Direny: It is and accepted.

266
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:25.710
Richelle Direny: You don't necessarily have to agree with it. You just have to just accept it and move on.

267
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:41.130
Matthew Knauff: But that makes that the perfect thing. Because when you said that underneath the water thing I could feel it, like, no, no. I can do this. I'll figure out some way and it's like, no, I can't. So

268
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:49.590
Richelle Direny: At some point when you start now you're getting ready to lose consciousness and that's what it is. When. Now you're getting ready to lose consciousness.

269
00:33:50.550 --> 00:34:00.630
Richelle Direny: It's like okay, like, at what point are you going to let go, like, what point are you willing to accept that you'll you'll math. You were not created

270
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:12.930
Richelle Direny: To do this, you were not created to do this. And what happens is, so this is how the addiction and everything else, like the and and and and comes along.

271
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:32.310
Richelle Direny: Because you refuse to accept that this is not what you're created to do so, then therefore now this overwhelming feeling of sadness hopelessness helplessness everything that comes up on you.

272
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:50.400
Richelle Direny: Now you're starting to supplement and you're taking these things to help you to deal with this sadness or to help you to maintain this feeling of I don't want to let go. I don't want to go to that goal. But the minute you get to that place where

273
00:34:52.230 --> 00:35:04.740
Richelle Direny: I am powerless. I'm powerless and I have to accept it. Now, like you said that depression, the need to take whatever your drug of choice was decreases.

274
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:18.000
Richelle Direny: The sadness starts to decrease all the other things that comes along with it decreases because you're now starting to teach yourself to accept the things you have no control over.

275
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.470
Matthew Knauff: And I feel more at peace to like get the perfect description of is, I feel at peace, almost like

276
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.790
Richelle Direny: You completely a piece

277
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:36.090
Richelle Direny: Because when you when you really think about depression and for you, your depression, based on what you're saying.

278
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.890
Richelle Direny: It's your depression is coming. It comes from

279
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.180
Richelle Direny: You want to help everyone you come in contact with

280
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:47.460
Richelle Direny: Can't

281
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.920
Matthew Knauff: Even when it's at my own detriment. Yeah.

282
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.920
Richelle Direny: You can. And so you end up your okay so it's kind of like

283
00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.610
Richelle Direny: You want to

284
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:12.450
Richelle Direny: Help whoever it is that you want to help, and you can't. So now to cope with this idea of thinking. You can help everyone is that you turn to these drugs.

285
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:21.630
Richelle Direny: Now, that person is killing themselves, guess what you did, without recognizing what you did, did not join the bandwagon of your now harming your own self.

286
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.960
Matthew Knauff: Right. So then I definitely can't help someone if I'm

287
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.510
Matthew Knauff: Like my own self with it so

288
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:35.310
Richelle Direny: We will go over here, die, Matthew. We both love to hear that you're trying to help me when you over here, sleeping, all in the name of helping me

289
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.740
Richelle Direny: Helping me but you know

290
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:49.110
Richelle Direny: You need to help yourself. And that's the reality. I think once we come into awareness of it all. It's one thing to be aware of it.

291
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.530
Richelle Direny: But it's a whole nother to accept it.

292
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:53.970
Richelle Direny: It's a

293
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.490
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, and I always felt like that was being selfish.

294
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:08.010
Matthew Knauff: To have like someone would say love yourself to me. That was such a foreign thing that it was to me that was someone being selfish, because what I always thought. But I mean, I see now that that's not the

295
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:17.190
Richelle Direny: Sofa, so I know you said that you grew up in the church. So there's this biblical there's this partner says love others as you love yourself.

296
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.790
Richelle Direny: Now think about it, Matthew, how can you love me. If you don't even know how to love yourself.

297
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.050
Matthew Knauff: Right, and that's true right care.

298
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.960
Matthew Knauff: Trouble with me.

299
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:46.650
Richelle Direny: How are you going to love me. If you don't even know how to love yourself, but then you want me to love you in a way that you think you want to be loved. But the question is, do you even know how to love yourself how you want me to love you, where you don't even know how to love yourself.

300
00:37:48.210 --> 00:38:03.270
Richelle Direny: So you got to look as you have to love yourself first, you have to think about yourself first, before and you have to know what you have control over and where your limits are. Because we all have a limit.

301
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.450
Richelle Direny: We all have a limit.

302
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.420
Richelle Direny: You know, and that's but it's, again, it goes back to being aware of it.

303
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.490
Richelle Direny: And then accepting it.

304
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.450
Richelle Direny: And that's where if you want to experience that.

305
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.720
Richelle Direny: On describe a little piece.

306
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:42.900
Richelle Direny: You have to first and learn what acceptance and looks like and be okay with accepting that I can't save everyone because I wasn't given the ability to save everybody. It's kind of like a doctor. Some doctors thing. Oh yeah, I could say what doctors to lose people don't make

307
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:52.500
Richelle Direny: Doctors, they lose. They try. Hey, a doctor tries to help this person with their issues, but then that person dies.

308
00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:07.800
Richelle Direny: So it goes to show you, nobody on Earth, the ability to save everyone or to save anyone I'm given the ability. I'm giving the knowledge to help a person

309
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:17.850
Richelle Direny: But it's somebody, higher, higher power than me. That does the saving. It's not me. You are good. You understand what to say. Somebody higher that

310
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.080
Richelle Direny: That does the saving

311
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:33.120
Richelle Direny: But he gives you the ability and the gift to help the person on the way. But it's giving you the knowledge to be able to assist this person, but the saving comes from someone higher than you.

312
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.080
Richelle Direny: But if you accepting that knowledge.

313
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.080
Richelle Direny: And so

314
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.550
Richelle Direny: I think it's a learning to understand what your gift is

315
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:59.790
Richelle Direny: Your gift based on what I just heard, you said that your gift is the desire to help people and you have the heart, because this is this is everybody is not everybody don't like helping others.

316
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:11.580
Richelle Direny: Don't like open others, you don't have a heart for somebody just like you say somebody could look like you and another EMT is on the truck. You're both in the same profession.

317
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:17.910
Richelle Direny: You love what you do, because it speaks to your gift of wanting to serve others.

318
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:28.440
Richelle Direny: The other person is in that truck does the same job as you are doing. It's not their gift. They're just going through the motions, hence why they prefer probably say

319
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:42.510
Richelle Direny: Oh that's they fall down because they overdose and all. And they say, all these heartstrings, and it impacts you because your gift if serving others. And once you understand that gift.

320
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:55.980
Richelle Direny: Then you can learn the other piece of it is, I understand my gift. I'm aware of my ability, and the qualifications. I've been given.

321
00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.540
Richelle Direny: I understand that I might have a limitation.

322
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:07.620
Richelle Direny: And I'm going to do as much as I can do, and I have to be okay with the outcome.

323
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.880
Richelle Direny: And I think that can help to start the journey.

324
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.010
Richelle Direny: Of

325
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:24.750
Richelle Direny: Understanding because I think that's one of in part of the steps, right, one of the steps is I'm

326
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.200
Matthew Knauff: Excited except the things that cannot

327
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.300
Matthew Knauff: Extend

328
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:36.690
Richelle Direny: Our list over you're powerless over something or forgot. Yeah, except the things that came up chain that

329
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.720
Matthew Knauff: Came to accept the things that came

330
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.510
Richelle Direny: To know the difference or something.

331
00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.790
Matthew Knauff: For each didn't get the wisdom to know the difference.

332
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:48.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah, we both start going through it, but yes.

333
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.500
Richelle Direny: But it's understanding that light and I think

334
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:59.490
Richelle Direny: Of those steps. That's where you're stuck. And that's where your depression comes in.

335
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.440
Richelle Direny: Because

336
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.480
Richelle Direny: you struggle with accepting that line.

337
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.650
Richelle Direny: Except the things I cannot change.

338
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.080
Richelle Direny: What is it though and know the you said, what about the wisdom.

339
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.790
Matthew Knauff: With the new the difference

340
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.620
Richelle Direny: And the wisdom to

341
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.310
Matthew Knauff: Talk to it that we're missing, I cannot think of it for some reason.

342
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.900
Richelle Direny: To find it because I I have I have it here somewhere. But there is

343
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.330
Richelle Direny: But, but overall

344
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:55.050
Richelle Direny: Overall it's that's that's what it comes down to its I'm for you.

345
00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.380
Richelle Direny: Have a hard time

346
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:00.870
Richelle Direny: In I'm

347
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:22.260
Richelle Direny: For you, you have a hard time in accepting the things and I think maybe that's if there was a possible diagnosis. I would say you have the OCD was the personality piece of it, it's because you're a perfectionist. You want everything to be perfect and nothing in life is perfect.

348
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:27.840
Richelle Direny: Think about him all, how can be. It's like you're a perfectionist, but are you perfect

349
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.700
Matthew Knauff: No.

350
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.920
Richelle Direny: Think about it as human beings. We're all asymmetrical.

351
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:43.740
Richelle Direny: Think about it. Each. What did they say we're a symmetrical. There's one side that's higher, there's one side of your body that's bigger than the other and

352
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:58.860
Richelle Direny: Just all of this in balancing in its you're not perfect. So then, if you think about your physical self and you're not via you are not perfect, even in your physique, and just how you are you're not perfect.

353
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:08.820
Richelle Direny: We have to redefine when we say that I'm a perfectionist, but nothing in life in the world is perfect. So I have to be okay.

354
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:21.840
Richelle Direny: If I do as much as I can and I can't go any further I asked to learn how to accept my abilities and my capabilities.

355
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:36.360
Matthew Knauff: And that that makes us as it goes a lot further to because I always had really bad self esteem issues and stuff because I always because I wasn't perfect in was it I always felt like I had to be this certain

356
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:43.680
Matthew Knauff: You know, and always tried to I think I was kind of raised that way to that like you

357
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:52.800
Matthew Knauff: I think it has a lot to do with it. And I always like tried to be this something that I wasn't in there, we still

358
00:44:53.460 --> 00:45:00.090
Matthew Knauff: hated myself so bad because I was this what I thought I should be and how I should look and how I should, because

359
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:10.890
Matthew Knauff: I would get super like controlling everything like with myself and be like, you know, I couldn't even go out to club and dance and have fun, because that would be self obsessed. The whole time like

360
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:26.010
Matthew Knauff: In my proven wrong, you know, maybe like it and it was just, it would get really bad, like, because I would be so worried about if I wasn't going to look perfect to everyone, you know. So yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. You're the only person to ever hit on that, like,

361
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:42.780
Richelle Direny: It's it's it's absolutely and, you know, even the next time that we speak, it's, it's a little bit more about like how your self esteem and how everything else ties into that because you know the reality of life and I think

362
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:52.290
Richelle Direny: The way society as a whole has taught us how to, like, we look at the world and I think

363
00:45:53.310 --> 00:46:04.320
Richelle Direny: We look at a model and for, for many years, you will always looked everybody asking, why do I have to, to be called pretty I'm like that.

364
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:19.410
Richelle Direny: Every man don't have a six pack. So why do I have to look at that individual and says that I defined my manhood and my masculinity based on who the way I talk aware who says that what book says that

365
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:31.830
Richelle Direny: And so because of the way we're taught to look upon beauty to look upon everything that we are told is right encoded

366
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:42.690
Richelle Direny: That's how self esteem, self image and everything. That's how like when you think about anorexia bulimia all these different eating disorders, all these different on like the body dysmorphia

367
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:51.570
Richelle Direny: And all of these come into play. How do you think it's coming to play, simply because of how we're taught to look at the outside world and we

368
00:46:52.050 --> 00:47:02.280
Richelle Direny: Defined how we should look how we should act based on how all these other people are doing. Then when we cannot meet those standards. Then we become super hard on ourselves.

369
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:14.430
Richelle Direny: We define, like you said, you go to places you feel awkward and dancing, because I say, Boy, Matthew that Bruce can really get down, they could do this, they could do that.

370
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:23.490
Richelle Direny: And so now, because I did not meet that standard now I have an issue. I don't know how to dance. I don't know how to sing. I don't I don't simply because

371
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:32.280
Richelle Direny: I have said, or someone has said this is how it should be. By whose definition.

372
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.730
Matthew Knauff: Right and

373
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:45.780
Matthew Knauff: Even if someone gave you, people will be like, Oh, you can dance a good I would get offended by it. Like I would always assume that they were like, trying to get a dig at me like I couldn't accept that they was

374
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.370
Richelle Direny: I think you froze.

375
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:04.230
Richelle Direny: Are you still there.
