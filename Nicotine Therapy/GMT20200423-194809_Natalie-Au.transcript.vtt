Natalie Austin: And you basically can sit with your microphone on mute, and just listen. If you don't even have to listen to them. If you don't, but Rochelle just has one topic that she covers and then she goes wrong, and I asked everybody what

274
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.010
Natalie Austin: Like a question like, how was your day, what's bothering you today, or whatever.

275
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:53.070
Natalie Austin: And if you don't have one listen to them. You don't have to. You can just do your own, you know, whatever they said your name, even

276
00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.600

Natalie Austin: That's the mute button right there. Yeah, see,

280
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:14.610
Natalie Austin: So that gives us a little privacy. If you need to, you know, do whatever you have to do. And if you're embarrassed or upset about something.
