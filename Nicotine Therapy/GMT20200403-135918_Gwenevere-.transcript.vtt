00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.719
Magan: Yeah, looks pretty

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I did, I did a do and having I'm having a girls night in I invited a bunch of girlfriends and we're gonna we're gonna sit in, zoom

4
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.800
Magan: Get it.

5
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, why not. I don't want to go nuts over here.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.550
Magan: Well, that's a good idea.

7
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. I'm telling everybody about it i'm i'm telling everybody like let's find a way that you create a new cooking class online. Let's, let's get involved in a really different way. Let's seize this as an opportunity

8
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To to use this internet stuff this teleconference and connect with people. We're normally we can't create time. Well, now we can

9
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.710
Magan: Right.

10
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.910
Magan: Right. Well, a lot of people can

11
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.270
Magan: I just wished you know I got a letter from my work and email, tell me.

12
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.770
Magan: He said that we now have to fill out a time card.

13
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.060
Magan: A part of the hours that we work during. Cool. Good night.

14
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.120
Magan: And I don't know what that means.

15
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.230
Magan: I'm a little worried about that.

16
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well what meaning what what ideas are you running through your head, what's caused

17
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.210
Magan: Is America running out of money is the city running out of money. You know what I mean. Uh huh.

18
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.610
I don't know how

19
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.020
I can

20
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How do

21
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You even figure out how you got to that one. I

22
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.040
Magan: Love.

23
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How you got to that thought.

24
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.950
Magan: I think it's because I worry too much. Well, I know I work too much, but my thought is this that

25
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.820
Magan: I know that this is a rough time for a lot of Americans. I know that I have a job still to go to. And for that I'm thankful

26
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:25.590
Magan: Because a lot of people have lost their jobs and they're waiting for unemployment to come through to feed their families. And so I have much to be grateful for at this time.

27
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.170
Magan: But

28
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.990
Magan: You know, I know a lot of the central employees with the city work in a extremely frustrated because we don't have any hazard pay they don't get anything for coming into work.

29
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:49.380
Magan: Other than the regular that we always do all the employees that are non essential get to stay at home pay for free.

30
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.880
Magan: And it's a little frustrating for central employees, like, Well, what the fuck we have no incentive for us.

31
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what's funny is our, our culture and you're you're reflecting it now doesn't still acknowledge psychiatric hazard pay like right now. Your job is

32
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychiatric hazard like

33
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.450
Straight up.

34
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.310
Magan: Like

35
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't try to say like, we still

36
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.980
Magan: Don't know.

37
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't respect.

38
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.700
Magan: The psychology yet.

39
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still a I hate to say it, this is my political

40
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Perspective, but it's a feminine art. It's a feminine profession, a teacher, a therapist. We're still it's a girly girl world and it doesn't get respected I I know I should keep my opinion to myself, but

41
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.000
Magan: No, no, it's

42
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.690
Fine.

43
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.900
Magan: But it's true.

44
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.200
Magan: Bad. No, but it's, it really is true. It really is true. And it's wow cat.

45
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.980
Okay.

46
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Kitty, but

47
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.180
Magan: He really just

48
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.180
Magan: I don't know what's wrong with her right now. Can you get your face. You see,

49
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you should see the shot. I got

50
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.660
Magan: looks funny because she doesn't usually like me, but since I don't know if I told you this below died.

51
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.200
Magan: Excuse me, doggy doggy.

52
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.980
Magan: Um, because she had lymphoma one day.

53
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:43.200
Magan: I woke up and I choose my dog. So like to my favorite don't have a whole world, and she's the first time I've had a bulldog since I got a divorce and my ex husband took the other Bulldog. So she was really special to me.

54
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.800
Magan: And she was patting her lymph nodes were all swollen. They were huge. I could feel them in her neck.

55
00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.980
Magan: And I was like, What the hell is that I thought she had like a reaction because she had allergies and she was also allergic to peanut butter.

56
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:21.120
Magan: So I started rubbing around her body and all the lymph areas around her growing her armpits, everything was all swollen and I was like, Oh, no. So it took her and I was hoping that wasn't what I thought it was but

57
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:36.720
Magan: Like I knew it was cancer because I I even said, I was like, I think she had cancer and everybody was like no, no, no. She's fine. And I took her in and the doctor. She, she is lymphoma and she's very progress. It's already in her lungs.

58
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:48.060
Magan: So I let her live for, like, I brought her back home because I wasn't ready to say goodbye. After finding that out. And so I sat with her.

59
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:59.040
Magan: In Andrews out with her for three days or two days, two days, but she couldn't even go to sleep because she was having such a trouble breathing, like she was. She couldn't even breathe.

60
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.500
Magan: So I took her in and we put her down.

61
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:13.740
Magan: So I think what since Lola has died that cat won't leave me the fuck alone, and I don't get it like that cat hated me

62
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

63
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.160
Magan: But now she just likes to come in. Just stick her ass in my face and say hello.

64
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm telling you, animals, they are smart.

65
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:49.380
Magan: Well they I know they have, they can feel things I know they can my dad, my dad's Dad always said, and I'm like, when I was putting low down. I was really upset and my dad was upset because he loves you and he told his dad his dad's like just let the animal. Go. They don't have a soul.

66
00:06:49.920 --> 00:07:03.390
Magan: And I always just agreed with that my whole life because he's always said that I remember my grandfather going out and shooting dogs in the forest, while we were there. So I really, you know,

67
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:12.300
Magan: He really doesn't he really doesn't believe that Animals Have souls and if a dog.

68
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:26.580
Magan: Is done in his opinion, or the dog bite somebody or the dog is too old and it can't take care of itself anymore he would take it outside tied to a tree and he would hear a gunshot. And it's like, Okay.

69
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.310
Magan: So,

70
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.780
Magan: But I didn't feel that way about low and

71
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.940
Magan: I really miss her a lot. So I am so sorry. Truly, I wonder

72
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.340
How we didn't end up talking about that.

73
00:07:48.600 --> 00:08:01.830
Magan: Um, I think that was the weekend where I just stopped talking and I pulled away. We didn't end our session and then over that weekend I found out what happened to her.

74
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:17.430
Magan: And so I found out that she was sick. And then I took her and put her down and all of that scan and you were trying to get ahold of me and I wasn't responding, because I just I just checked out. Yeah.

75
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, there have been times I've said, hey, just touching base, just wanted to get a little something I think you may have sort of been withdrawing at that point.

76
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:43.410
Magan: Yeah, okay. Yeah. And it's not that I'm trying to leave you out of stuff. It's just, she was very important to me. She was really, really important to me, she still is. But it's just like everything around me, guys.

77
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:58.410
Magan: So it's like really just you come in threes, because I lost my, my grandmother and I lost my mother and I lost my favorite dog. So I do believe that deaths come in threes.

78
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.820
Magan: Now after that heavy shit, what did you see me and Dr.

79
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sure.

80
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, morning

81
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, good morning. Fine. How do you do so, um, we can do whatever you want.

82
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.510
Magan: We can dye your hair.

83
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:25.770
Magan: Did you

84
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.020
Magan: You don't die it again. No.

85
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So so funny. You guys can always tell when I do something different. I must wear my hair exactly the same every day. So when what you're seeing is, I usually start my hair on the side and I and I switch it over to the side.

86
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I kind of have like a 50s little

87
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: bouffant going on and today I wanted to, to kind of do this sort of trying too hard.

88
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.010
Magan: To do.

89
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.780
Magan: So, well, it's very much god it's very complimentary

90
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:04.050
Magan: It really is. She's I was wrong with her right now. Um, but she's very

91
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: With us

92
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.660
Magan: Um, it's very different. And I think it's the volume and then

93
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.390
Magan: It looks like you're getting ready to go on a date.

94
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm having a girls night and I am

95
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.100
Magan: Yeah.

96
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.790
I'm also

97
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.270
Magan: Are you still dating your husband during this time.

98
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so cute.

99
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm also, um, I was supposed to write at this time I'll be in Seattle, Washington. I was going to be gone for a week doing a training that's going to last eight months.

100
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning every about every two or three months, I'd be traveling all the way to Washington State, which is a huge commitment. But anyway, hoping it will be amazing.

101
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But they had to cancel it. So we're having it today and I keep checking timezone because I'm like, Is the time zone really three hours difference

102
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's in Seattle and hoping I don't miss it today. So I get to still see you guys for early morning appointments. So, this wouldn't even be happening. If I was going to Washington, so I'm thrilled. In some ways that the trainings happening this way. Oh my gosh, there's kitty.

103
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And everything but

104
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.210
Magan: I'm not. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go put her outside because she's

105
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.250
Magan: Okay, okay.

106
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, whatever you want, because, I mean,

107
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to hang out with her. That's fine to

108
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.440
Magan: Come on, little one.

109
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:45.690
Magan: There we go.

110
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.080
Magan: I have to let her out the front door because

111
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.460
Magan: Apparently that's the only door that she likes it. So,

112
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.540
So where would you like to focus today. We can do whatever you want.

113
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.330
Magan: I mean, I did, I did say I wanted to do a session. Okay, then that's what I

114
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.070
Magan: Want, but I am

115
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.710
Magan: So Gandalf is not working for me.

116
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna change it.

117
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:29.070
Magan: Okay, yeah, and also has not. Yeah, it's not working for me. Okay. Um, but the dog is

118
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.110
Magan: And the kids are

119
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So for so for too protective figure I have a dragon and Gandalf the Grey is out.

120
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I have therapists, when you want to keep that or take that out.

121
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.700
Magan: Okay, so we have. What about

122
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.000
Magan: Dragon, so I think

123
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:53.970
Magan: I'm

124
00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.840
Magan: We can utilize dragon. Um, but I think the primary ones are all when

125
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.550
Magan: Kids, but the kids, the kids aren't really like

126
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.920
Magan: They're more like a guidance figure. It's kind of weird.

127
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so, but look where you have them. I'm glad you said that because what you have is there, the wise figures are your children.

128
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.470
Magan: Oh, okay.

129
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And for nurturing, I have my dog for to wanting out. So here's what the hell just show to

130
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.790
See

131
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And we and maybe visually.

132
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: We can have more more

133
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.530
To it.

134
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just this little section right here. It's the blue.

135
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Sea there.

136
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.390
So protecting me

137
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.050
Magan: So,

138
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.550
Magan: Justin said this one. Yeah, no, that's perfect. That's perfect.

139
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then my dog for nurturing

140
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now something comes up around nurturing, then we'll add it as it as it comes up. But as you're looking at it now. Does anything come up is now nurturing is wanting for you, your gross your development.

141
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.120
Magan: Mm hmm. Okay.

142
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And then for wise, my children. Do you want to add anything to that one.

143
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:29.910
Magan: Um, my sugars me children. No, I think that's actually more fitting. I do like that because when when Gandalf comes up, it's like

144
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:40.860
Magan: I don't, I'm not feeling it, you know. Yeah. Okay. And I'm all because I remember why Gandalf popped up in my brain.

145
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:59.310
Magan: Because when I had my spinal surgery and they put me on not ketamine. Yeah, I remember seeing and off the fucking guy I shit you not, I saw him. I was so high, and it was the most intense talking drugging ever had in my life and

146
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.750
Magan: It was horrible. I hated that drug that drug is bad.

147
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the second person to tell me that. And part of it is is bouncing over to this idea of why

148
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: People long term are thinking about tapering down because they don't want to be stuck with having to use the Ketamine as a pain.

149
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: reliever. So it's like okay remember how bad that was, Hey, why am I tapering. I don't want to taper. Oh, because I want if I absolutely have to. I want access to short term pain medication like everybody else.

150
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.430
Magan: Yeah.

151
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.510
Magan: You see it because what

152
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.740
Magan: No, I see it.

153
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:44.640
Magan: Going again my pain under control. And that was because my pain level my my tolerance is so high. And they were like,

154
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.390
Magan: They put me on Ketamine for three days and I was like,

155
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.190
Magan: No that drug is horrible. I don't know.

156
00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me poke around. So if you're telling me that we let me just see if I wrote a little note.

157
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There, see if I got a little something in here because I may have done some target mapping already. So we already had an idea of where to start.

158
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, definitely around. There's concepts of I'm enough

159
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: big pieces of that, if it's something I've Virginia. I have a have to accept that I need to marinate in that today, continuing power struggle will make it worse client is interested in continuing in the DR next week.

160
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It is intense. But it's helping it growth in different areas subtle but meaningful the juice is worth the squeeze. What a great phrase, man. I just love them. Oh I so want that on a t shirt.

161
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But but but but but but but but what about content stuff so boop boop boop. What if we go over here to your thermometer and let's do this together. So let's I've got my little over my knee. Are you on tablet or phone. What do you want

162
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.350
Magan: I'm on phone, but I have my water bottle.

163
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, perfect. Then I'll use I'll use my finger as the tempo for guidance there. That's beautiful. So here's what I'm saying. So let's set. Let's set our intention and I'll do this with you.

164
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of tune into my breath and I invite you to do the same.

165
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Just find that breath. It was there. It was there as we were talking, you didn't have to think about it.

166
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And then slowly making sure that air is not just staying at the top of the long but going deep down

167
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: In the bottom with along, allowing the expansion of that lower abdomen to

168
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like a balloon on the inhale.

169
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Very intentionally

170
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Turning awareness inward.

171
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: To your wisdom.

172
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To the subtle.

173
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To the shifts

174
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To awareness.

175
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: to incite

176
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just continue to stay with that breath.

177
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do some

178
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of exploring around the target that we might do some

179
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: CMDR around and you just let me know. Yeah. That's the one. Let's focus there or now that's that's a pass on that.

180
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So something. Yep. So something you've mentioned before, you have a memory of

181
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Being in the distress level of mom chewing with your mouth open, and I wanted to flick her I would ask her. Please close your mouth.

182
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And she would say, Go fuck yourself.

183
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.680
Magan: Past.

184
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about at 30 you're about in distress of about 30 kids interrupt when someone is talking. They walk up demand my full attention. Doesn't matter if you're having an adult conversation emotions irritation.

185
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.700
Magan: Pass. Okay, it's heavy.

186
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That one's

187
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:30.210
Magan: That one's heavy because I know there's so much more. I forgot to tell you

188
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What

189
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.720
So,

190
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.910
Magan: My kids have been asking me a lot.

191
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.980
Magan: About

192
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.840
Magan: Scott

193
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:51.180
Magan: Really, and yes, they know about Scott because of my mom. They know that thought because of my sister.

194
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.330
Magan: You know, like that he is

195
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.840
Magan: A. No. No. Okay.

196
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.460
Magan: There's so much wonder and curiosity as to why

197
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.860
Magan: Okay, and

198
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.190
Magan: So they watch YouTube videos.

199
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.170
Magan: And a song. You know that song. I told you about.

200
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. I know I do.

201
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.120
Magan: It comes up in that in those videos so I'm like this.

202
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.860
Magan: Oh, they're like, what the fuck is going on and they don't understand

203
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:44.790
Magan: So I finally I sat down and I talked to them. I tried to make it as age appropriate as I possibly could. Okay. And they asked me questions. Um, but I said that

204
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.560
Magan: Scott rates me. Yeah. And I said it to both of them and

205
00:20:54.090 --> 00:21:05.130
Magan: They got really defensive. They got really upset. Like, how dare he touched my mom. How dare he hurt my mom. Okay. And I just, I let them know that I am safe.

206
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.960
Magan: Yeah, the I'm safe right now.

207
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.860
Magan: And Andrew helped guide that he really did I really hope that that um

208
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.570
Magan: And

209
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.370
Magan: I

210
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:30.960
Magan: Told them. They asked me some questions like, How long did it happen for how come I didn't tell anybody. Mm hmm.

211
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.930
Magan: And I wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing or not because

212
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.250
Magan: I mean I, you know, in that situation. If you're doing the right thing by telling your children or not.

213
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.680
Magan: But

214
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:53.880
Magan: I felt like I was lying to them and hiding something from them and they kept asking me questions and

215
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.170
Magan: I know what that felt like to me as a kid.

216
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:05.670
Magan: And so I didn't want to do that to them, but I also didn't want to leave my burdens on them.

217
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.440
Okay.

218
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.640
Magan: So I just wanted to tell you that I did that.

219
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does it feel having told them.

220
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:23.640
Magan: It doesn't really feel. I mean, okay. In a moment, it was very, very, very triggering very trigger

221
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.870
Magan: But it feels like

222
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.660
Magan: They understand more.

223
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.630
Me understand

224
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.550
Magan: Why mommy freaks out with that song.

225
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:57.240
Magan: Mike came on again after we talked about this in the because they're up there a home, you know, and then when they have TV time they watch my son is obsessed with Neiman's he's obsessed with them and he

226
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.540
Magan: Watches mean videos and sometimes that song comes up in those mean videos.

227
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:17.970
Magan: And so I told he after I told him that song came up and he knew before to turn it off because it bothered me. But this time, he was like

228
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:33.510
Magan: I'm I know mom that that hurts. I'm sorry. And he turned it off. And it's not that it was his fault because he can't control it. You didn't know is going to come up right but it just like he understood

229
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.340
Magan: Why

230
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.020
Okay.

231
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice, let's just do a little observation about what just happened. So I brought up.

232
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.890
Magan: A little

233
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Little irritant around kids interrupting my pass and then something came in, you had a memory and that was

234
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: A big one. This is a that's that's the big that's the big trauma piece. It's all connected. And it's connected to the past it's connected to your relationship with your children. And so let's come back to what our objective today is to find a target.

235
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Find a focus find somewhere that you want to be less activated that you want to have a different relationship with a particular memory, the different a different relationship with

236
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: An image.

237
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, something a memory a different relationship, having a different response to something that happened. This is real can't do anything about like these things happen. Those are facts. So it's about what do you want to have a different relationship with, is it the song.

238
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.310
Magan: I do and I'm really scared on this one.

239
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.820
Magan: Okay, I do, I do, but I will try it.

240
00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.020
Magan: I just don't know how far I'm and again I'm letting you know right now.

241
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll just say that and that's all we'll do for now we'll just say, yeah, I'd like to have less reaction to that song. We'll just leave it there.

242
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just leave it in the air right there. Firstly,

243
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.710
Magan: I would like to have less reaction.

244
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:18.390
Magan: Yeah.

245
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just do let's just do a

246
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit of analysis around that and see where it takes us before we get into any kind of em er. Okay, let's just say

247
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like to have less reaction. So currently, what is the body's reaction to hearing and you know it just the first couple of beats you know it right away soon as it's there.

248
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.470
Magan: It's I've recoil.

249
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.580
Magan: I get defensive I get irritable angry.

250
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.220
Magan: Emotional

251
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:10.200
Magan: Uncomfortable uncomfortable as the biggest thing are very uncomfortable when I hear that song. Okay.

252
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.340
Magan: I feel icky.

253
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: yucky. Can we go to

254
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.690
Magan: Can we go to uncomfortable for a

255
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.350
Second,

256
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:20.820
Magan: Okay.

257
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you feel uncomfortable. Where is that

258
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.790
Magan: I'm everywhere everywhere. It's not just my jaw. It's not just my shoulders.

259
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.160
Magan: My gut.

260
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.670
Magan: my fists clenched up

261
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.790
Magan: My toes dig into the ground.

262
00:26:46.350 --> 00:27:01.920
Magan: I, the first thing I want to do is cover my ears. I want to stop it. I want to stop the sound entering my brain because as soon as the song plays it plays in my head over and over and over and over and over.

263
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.460
Magan: It's horrible. Okay, so what's happening.

264
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we worsening it by talking about it now.

265
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.960
Magan: No. Okay.

266
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.560
Magan: All right, let's keep

267
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to stop it. The body responds whole body. And specifically, we notice gut fists clenched toes clench those, those are those sort of really

268
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Seminal features of discomfort. Right.

269
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.260
Magan: Mm hmm. Okay.

270
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's anger. There's emotion and emotion. Are you talking about is that crying. What's emotion.

271
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.960
Magan: Sadness.

272
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.720
Magan: Sadness.

273
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:52.980
Magan: Disgust achy achy disgust Nikki gross, gross.

274
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.480
Oh dear. Yeah, there's

275
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry that's happening.

276
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That must be inconvenient, right, because these kids, they don't they, that sounds like that sounds like all over the place.

277
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:14.730
Magan: Yes, it is, it places the grocery stores. It plays in show it plays

278
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.270
Magan: A center tech detective detective. I can't even log on. Yeah.

279
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I can pick up

280
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.570
Magan: That can't watch it.

281
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay here. Stay here in this little space. We're not going to go expansive, we're going to stay in this one, this one little area here.

282
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go to

283
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.110
Magan: Let's see if

284
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a benefit to a different relationship with that, I'm going to say that response, and that includes the body that that's the emotional reaction. Let's see if there's a benefit if that intensity, isn't there. If you don't respond with all the discussed and it is comfort.

285
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What will be available to you. If you're no longer discussing with that song and uncomfortable with that song.

286
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What will be available to you that right now is not available.

287
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with it until it comes to there's no wrong answer, which is I can ask it again though.

288
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.490
Magan: The I guess the ability to just

289
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.120
Magan: Hear it and move past it.

290
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but what would that give you like who cares. We can't tell if you move past it. Like, what does that give you

291
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.290
Magan: The lack of everything that happens when I'm hearing it.

292
00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what does it give you, that's what you want have what is it give you. Let's narrow and you're almost there are so close. What does it give you

293
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.710
Magan: Safety. Okay.

294
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.850
I can feel safe.

295
00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.890
Magan: Yeah, I can feel safe. Okay.

296
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you look around and now you're with your children. And if you feel safe. Now, what does it give you if you're around your children.

297
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:13.560
Magan: I'm enough

298
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

299
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then how are you communicating and hanging out with your children if you're safe and enough

300
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.040
Magan: Open. Open.

301
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:32.940
Magan: pleasantly.

302
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:41.340
Magan: pleasantly. No, there's nothing hanging over my head. There's nothing

303
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.040
Magan: getting in the way of

304
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.580
Magan: Enjoying something with them. Yeah.

305
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing in the way of enjoying my children.

306
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:59.640
Magan: Yeah, and and it does that it stops me from everything but

307
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.990
Magan: It will put a complete halt and things for hours.

308
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there more. Did you say it all. These are the benefits if it's not hanging over me.

309
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's not uncomfortable and it's not disgusting anymore. I can feel safe, be enough be pleasant and open with my children, and there's nothing keeping me from enjoying my kids.

310
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.830
Magan: That's pretty much it. No, it doesn't really

311
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:49.020
Magan: I mean, I've heard it. Come on different places where it affects me like at work. If it's on the radio or something.

312
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.850
Magan: And I'll ask them to please turn it off.

313
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you're not

314
00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: They will. Yeah, you're not missing the assertiveness around self care which is hands over the ears. Please turn it off. Mommy rushes to turn it off.

315
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But the relationship is still discussed and you're still physically uncomfortable with the song.

316
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:23.250
Magan: Oh yeah, it's written all over me. Anybody can tell in that moment.

317
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:31.950
Magan: I can't hide it. They can't hide. That's probably the one thing that I noticed the most with that fucking song.

318
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:33.690
Magan: Is that

319
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.800
Magan: I can't hide the fact that

320
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.530
Magan: I

321
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.120
Magan: Okay.

322
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:50.640
Magan: I've got a comet eyes I'm I'm affected I'm and it's really like I'm fucking traumatized from that god damn song. I know.

323
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It will you because you are. There's, there's

324
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in. You are it is wired.

325
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To

326
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Get collation and

327
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Violation of your body. So that's real.

328
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So all that we can do and I have, I have some confidence about that right now. I have some thoughts about being here for you. I have some

329
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:24.870
Magan: About

330
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've given me this this privilege of being

331
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In a role of protector with you.

332
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And it suits me very well. I have a lot of confidence about that. So I feel very comfortable in that space. And all of a sudden I had this this wave of, oh, we could do a combination of

333
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be this, the old PTSD approach, which is you you spend hours desensitize you hear a sound over and over. That's the old way of doing it. Well, I know people still do it.

334
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But

335
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:07.260
Magan: I honestly don't get that. And, you know, my God.

336
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that but but people do still, they still do that approach. But people end up right repositories by it. But what I was thinking is

337
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Dr. Can view, especially attachment focus, which is sort of my approach that I do with folks is

338
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You you because you all you're doing is you're thinking about it. Now, that's all it takes. We don't have to have any additional exposure exposure is just thinking about as far as it gets. That's why this is I preferred approach then flooding people with physical exposure to the sound.

339
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It's enough for you to just pull it up from your, your memory. I think it is.

340
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.330
Magan: Oh, it is.

341
00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.370
Magan: It definitely is. Nobody needs to play it on the radio. Right now it's going in my head.

342
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got it in there too.

343
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me, let me just do some, some, am I motivational interviewing questions here. Let me just because he and I told you where to start way on the outside today, way, way, way, way on the outside. You're doing great. But let me check in with you. Are you feeling good.

344
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: tight, tight. Okay, and let's

345
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.470
Magan: Take

346
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take some time to take care of it.

347
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you're doing so at your own pace.

348
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked you how important it doesn't mean we're going to do a thing with. It doesn't mean we're going to do the MTR it's just these two questions. We're going to give a number two how important it is that you change your relationship.

349
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: With this song from zero to 10. How important is it to

350
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.560
Magan: Like a 10 okay got it really high. Yep.

351
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. I now the other one which is

352
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing to take care of the body. Remember your breath work. It is a tense. So it is so important.

353
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

354
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How confident are you

355
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.400
That can help.

356
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That song. How confident are you zero to 1010 is

357
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Three. Okay, three and confidence. Okay.

358
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.560
Magan: I'm not very

359
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not very

360
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:36.480
Magan: I mean, I believe in you, but I'm not so inclined, that is happening to me is one is one that

361
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.450
Magan: I hate this one. This one is it is a one for me.

362
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.620
Yeah.

363
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So confidence was a three. It did. It just moves down

364
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.580
Magan: Yep, just a little bit like a two.

365
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.840
Magan: To one, I'm really not confident about this.

366
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we are you seeing that I'm trying to protect you. We're not going to go somewhere, until you have more confidence.

367
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.540
Magan: You see. Yes, I see that. Okay.

368
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm doing is trying to protect it and make sure we're not just going to go in there, willy nilly, and make sure that we're not ready. Okay.

369
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to ask me a question because remember this is some interpersonal stuff and I'm the one that's kind of been taking care of you. So you have a question for me.

370
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.580
Magan: I think what comes up for me because you're not just like a protector, you're also like it.

371
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:51.150
Magan: You're a figure and it's it's really hard to explain but you're a trusted figure

372
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.070
Magan: But your acceptance and your

373
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.930
Magan: Feelings on things are important to me.

374
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:08.700
Magan: Even though you don't really share. And I think that's the whole reason why you don't share personal stuff about you.

375
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.940
Magan: It's because of that reason right there because I am the way that I am

376
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:22.200
Magan: And I understand it and and obviously been working but yeah

377
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:35.100
Magan: But my question, like, the first thing that comes up for me. It goes back into that. Am I enough. And I know it's there because I know that's why I'm even thinking this question to begin with.

378
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.740
Magan: Like, do you think that

379
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:53.280
Magan: Like this is stupid. Do you think that this is it's just a song you think like, do you know what I mean, like, that's the first thing that comes up for me. And I'm like, wait a minute, that's not her. That's me. That's me so

380
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.770
Okay.

381
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Far from it.

382
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Far from it.

383
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this is the little pedal. This is this really fragile little glass precious little thing. It's like Central. It is almost I think it is the most on I don't know only, you know, but it is one of the most important things

384
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It is it is so so no the opposite of stupid never would have occurred to me. In fact,

385
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No like more like I'm a witnessing you bring his name up on your own how brave how brave. Brave. She is

386
00:39:47.700 --> 00:40:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I sat with my children and talked about it help re help raise hell brave help raise up i i can't fathom the word stupid even on the planet in the universe just just in off of your, your courage, just

387
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I know where you've come from. I know that really what we're doing. Even though I'm saying I'm not you know this exposure therapy is too much. We've still been doing it.

388
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been doing. I don't want to say his name. Not saying his name. I said his name. Look, I said his name.

389
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I brought up with my kids I brought it up if you're not ready not ready. I brought it up now with my kids I was triggered. I live through it. I look through it. You're doing the work you are doing exposure therapy on your terms.

390
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready,

391
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're saying his name has been a step.

392
00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't used to be able to even say it.

393
00:40:48.960 --> 00:41:01.320
Magan: Yeah, well, that's something Andrew said to. He goes, he said the exact same thing to me, he said, You know, I noticed that you've actually been able to say his name.

394
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:14.070
Magan: And not respond the way that you usually do. And he goes, it's not that it's a bad thing or a good thing. He said, I just noticed that your responses different

395
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.410
Magan: When I say his name the few times I do say it.

396
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.470
Magan: You know,

397
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.470
Magan: And then automatically. I'm like, no.

398
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.950
Magan: This is him.

399
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.680
Magan: But I

400
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.040
Magan: I don't want

401
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.370
Magan: Cuz like

402
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.520
Magan: My mom.

403
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:50.160
Magan: would push him on me all the time and asked me to let it go and just move past it, get over it and

404
00:41:51.720 --> 00:42:05.520
Magan: Let him be a part of the families together. And because I wouldn't go to events, if he was going to be there when his children were born, she wanted me to go and meet the children and I did not want to

405
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.530
Magan: Cyrus.

406
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.250
She would

407
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:33.660
Magan: My like my sister was actually the only one that would say to my mom like you need to stop you're you're pushing too hard mom just because she doesn't respond I can. Okay.

408
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:37.980
Magan: Stop it.

409
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:42.180
Magan: I'm

410
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:49.740
Magan: Mom, just because she doesn't respond the way that I do.

411
00:42:51.780 --> 00:43:05.220
Magan: Doesn't mean because Alicia, can be around, and I always find that disgusting as well. Like, how would you let him like how could you be around him. How could you engage with this kid.

412
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.350
Magan: Like

413
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.840
Magan: How dare you that's honestly how I feel like right

414
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.570
Magan: How could you do that like

415
00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.570
Magan: I can't understand it.

416
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.910
Magan: But

417
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.200
Magan: Just saying his name is a problem for me.

418
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.000
Magan: Like

419
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.330
Magan: But she would say to mom like

420
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.400
Magan: You need to

421
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:45.600
Magan: Let her deal with it the way that she deals with it and the way that she deals with it. She's removed him completely from every aspect of her life and you cannot force it.

422
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.780
Magan: Or no matter how much I tried. She did.

423
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you angry that she did that.

424
00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:03.480
Magan: I am I am very angry that she did that, it just reinforced that feeling of not believing me not.

425
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:11.880
Magan: respecting me not looking out for me you didn't look out for me and now you know and you still can't look out for me.

426
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.650
Magan: He's always more important your precious little voice.

427
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.550
Magan: And Stephen, I can't blame him.

428
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:22.020
Magan: But

429
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:28.290
Magan: The relationship with her and her boys versus her and her girls.

430
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.360
Magan: It always seemed different and

431
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.780
Magan: That was the one thing

432
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.290
Magan: That bothered me the most. It was like

433
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:50.400
Magan: What, what do I need to tell you what do you need to hear to understand

434
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:57.420
Magan: What your son. It's to me like, do you want me to

435
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.900
Magan: Go into detail. Do you want me to tell you have specific events because then maybe you'll believe

436
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:16.530
Magan: But she wouldn't she wouldn't listen to me. And every time I got angry. She would just get angry too, and she'll get defensive and she would say, well, you didn't say anything. How am I supposed to know

437
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:27.060
Magan: How can I do anything if I don't even know. And she would get angry with me. But looking back at it and thinking about it right now.

438
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.670
Magan: Maybe that was her way of protecting herself. Maybe it was too much for her.

439
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there.

440
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it was about your mom's self preservation. She could not get past her own overwhelming.

441
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever helpless. I didn't

442
00:45:52.110 --> 00:46:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: My daughter, she couldn't do it. But that had nothing to do with your value that had to do with a skill that if she were here today, I would be teaching her that she is enough. And then her role as a mother is to protect her children.

443
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I would help her get her own strength so that she can be there for you and not make it about her, we would be doing some serious family therapy.

444
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry that happened and I love that you came to that conclusion on your own. And I'm letting us right stay right there. You're right. She didn't know what to do.

445
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: She couldn't and it probably happened to her and you talking about it reminds her of her on trauma.

446
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.190
Magan: That did happen to her.

447
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. She cannot handle it.

448
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:57.630
Magan: It's too much with her. It was her father and father did occur. You know what's weird. I never knew that, but one day she called me.

449
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:07.230
Magan: And she was in Walmart and she was crying and she sounded like she couldn't read, and I was like, Mom, what's going on.

450
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:25.020
Magan: And she just couldn't breathe out of where the fuck are you and she's like, I know Walmart on new bank and I fucking drove over there so fast I ran into the store to find her. I run everywhere. And I find her sitting in the section.

451
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.380
Magan: On a bench.

452
00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:35.880
Magan: Next, there's like benches, where people can sit down with take a break and she's sitting there crying like a little baby.

453
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.370
Magan: And

454
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.500
Magan: She

455
00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:43.590
Magan: I sat down next to her.

456
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.110
Magan: And I just

457
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:54.810
Magan: I held her for a moment like I asked her, you know, the hug, and I gave her a hug for

458
00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:05.580
Magan: I don't know, like maybe like two minutes before we even started talking. And then I said, what's going on. And she goes,

459
00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.080
Magan: It just everything just hit me at once.

460
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.350
Magan: And she goes,

461
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.740
Magan: She goes,

462
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.680
Magan: He hurt me too.

463
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.410
Magan: And I was like, What do you mean he hurt you to are you talking about, because she was confusing me.

464
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:30.480
Magan: And she goes, my father. He

465
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.640
Magan: He raised me he molested me and I just was like floored. And she goes, it

466
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:51.060
Magan: It's just start crying and she didn't I never knew about her. She was must look 57 years old 58 I never knew this about my mother ever

467
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:59.370
Magan: And she's sitting here like a little baby crying because it just hit her all at one time.

468
00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.040
Magan: And

469
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.120
Magan: I felt so awful for her. I felt so bad for her.

470
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.210
Magan: I felt like

471
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.380
Magan: I felt guilty.

472
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:19.380
Magan: Because I in a little bit because I brought up.

473
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:26.520
Magan: All of the things that happened to me. And I never even knew that my mother had gone through the same thing.

474
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:36.660
Magan: And nobody was there for her to hear her out she's 57 years old and she's just saying this to me her daughter for the first time.

475
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:49.410
Magan: I'm a grown woman. I have two children, I'm married, I, I had no idea. And my mother knew about what Scott it to me since I was 19 because I have when I told her.

476
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.650
Magan: And she kept it all those years.

477
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.320
Magan: And it just came out at Walmart in store.

478
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, in the baby section.

479
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.810
Magan: In the baby section is we're

480
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.370
Magan: And I was just

481
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:16.950
Magan: I didn't feel guilty, like it was my fault. I felt guilty like this poor woman.

482
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.280
Magan: Knows

483
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.530
Magan: How I feel

484
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.540
Magan: But I couldn't get I still, even with her telling me that we couldn't get on the same level.

485
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:50.910
Magan: Even after that we still kept fighting every time I tried to talk to her about Scott or bring up something that he did to me or please stop making. I don't want to go to family events with him. I don't want to meet his children. She's still kept pushing after that. But I really had thought

486
00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:57.720
Magan: That in that moment, and maybe that was my fault for putting too much hope on that moment.

487
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.360
Magan: That she understood

488
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You mean that she would take care of you. She, she

489
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.200
Magan: She yeah there it is that she would intern take care of me.

490
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: She intellectually

491
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: May have thought me to she got the. Me too. But that's really different than the ability

492
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To put

493
00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.050
Magan: Action behind

494
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Us, it's different, and she couldn't she couldn't do it. She still had to do what she was always doing which is compartmentalizing not letting it affect

495
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm not going to hold anyone accountable, she never got to hold anyone accountable. My daughter doesn't hold anyone accountable. We're just going to do the thing where we pretend it never happened. We're just going to go back to that.

496
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:56.130
Magan: And she did it because her father died like three months earlier.

497
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.430
Magan: He died and

498
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:05.070
Magan: I didn't know. I didn't have anything to do with him because

499
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:15.360
Magan: From what I gather, he was a bad man. Um, so my father and mother made it a point to keep us all away from him.

500
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.070
Magan: But

501
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:27.000
Magan: He had died and then maybe three months later, is when she had this then. And I felt privileged that she called me.

502
00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:29.880
Magan: Because

503
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.100
Magan: She has four children, you know, she called me.

504
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:48.780
Magan: And I tried to be there for her because I honestly thought she's having a fucking asthma attack. I thought something like she was physically like somebody hurt her something or robbed or something.

505
00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:57.450
Magan: And then to walk in and see her. She looked at the little girl. She literally looked like a little girl.

506
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:01.800
And then

507
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.090
Magan: And then, there I am trying to tell her.

508
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.390
Magan: It's okay, but it's not okay.

509
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:18.450
Magan: Like there's not really anything that I can say to comfort her, is there anything that she can say to comfort me. I don't know.

510
00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.020
Magan: But I felt like I was apparent.

511
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.350
Magan: In that role. Mm hmm.

512
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:28.920
And

513
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.320
Magan: After that, I was just hoping that maybe

514
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:40.980
Magan: Maybe, and that was my fault. I put hopes and ambitions on it and

515
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.250
Magan: Just feelings on it. I made it more than what it was.

516
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:52.980
Magan: She

517
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a lot. You just did a lot of work. And again,

518
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Take some time and very gently.

519
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold that space for what you just did.

520
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:13.950
Magan: Or didn't do

521
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.780
Magan: I'm sorry.

522
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.990
Magan: I said we're going to do it today, and we did

523
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we did. This is all part of it. Megan, it's all part of it.

524
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just my finger dragging in front of you. It's, it's this stuff. Okay, this is it. This is a phase.

525
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:36.720
Magan: End up

526
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Not just the bilateral movement. There's eight phases to it. This is one of them. We're getting the target and we are in the preparation phase. And we're going to take our time and be prepared.

527
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we absolutely did. Yes, we did.

528
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.240
Just a different

529
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit. See what you did just now. I'm sorry. Did you just undo the value of how hard you just worked

530
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.070
Magan: I did.

531
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:16.200
Magan: I tried to

532
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do with that you want to leave that in the air.

533
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.220
Know,

534
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to say instead

535
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.330
Magan: That was hard.

536
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Darn straight

537
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.640
Magan: I don't think I've ever told anybody that

538
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.090
Magan: Is the first person I've ever told that

539
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:38.850
Magan: In the whole world.

540
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.840
Magan: There's a lot of things that you know the first person I tell

541
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:47.100
Magan: Like

542
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This lady. There's no way she's gonna be the person. There's no way I get it.

543
00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:01.140
Magan: But you are. And there's so many things that you know that about me that nobody know

544
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:04.920
Magan: And that's

545
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.540
Magan: For some reason, that's really important to me.

546
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:15.060
Magan: Like it's important that you know

547
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.310
Magan: What have you done going

548
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.220
Magan: Your little way in

549
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: My little way in

550
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: By telling you every step.

551
00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: By being transparent and ironically I'm transparent, but I'm not making it about me. That's how we got here.

552
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do motivational interviewing and then now we're also doing this. I'm not hiding at all. I'm just going to tell you what I'm up to you ever be one asked me a question.

553
00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Go for it. We won't go. Sometimes I'll say, hey, I will be talking too much here that might be a distraction. Don't want you to start protecting me all of a sudden, so let's just keep it right. Well, ironically, it's

554
00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Transparency, but I'm not making it about me. I think that's how I wiggled my way in to earn your trust.

555
00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:36.120
Magan: I think so, too, because I did notice that. Well, I just said it earlier. That's you've kept that professional distance for a reason, not just because I mean you are perfectly capable of divulging personal 49 or we're talking a little bit more about yourself.

556
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:45.630
Magan: To where you're comfortable, but you don't go there at all. And I don't know if you do that with other people or not, but for me.

557
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:47.820
Magan: I think that

558
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.210
Magan: You chose that route because

559
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.150
Magan: I take care of everybody.

560
00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.690
Magan: And I worry about everybody else.

561
00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.430
And

562
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You might start to doubt my intentions. That's a big piece of it is, if you don't come in here knowing

563
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: He's on my side. She wants the best for me if you don't really believe that if there's doubt your, your, you don't show up.
