00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She knew that you were there.

299
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.410
Yeah.

300
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

301
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.400
Galaxy A10e: She's gone. She's gone through bunch just la

302
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's going through a bunch of stuff right now, you know,

303
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.050
Galaxy A10e: Everything she she got raised and never got dealt with she kept saying, no, it didn't happen.

304
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.730
Galaxy A10e: I'm sure and go to the hospital. That's one of the things I learned in that one class.

305
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.180
Galaxy A10e: Recap is that I should have made her go to the hospital.

306
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.560
Galaxy A10e: But you don't want to go to ship before he thought he would get it for

307
00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.890
Galaxy A10e: For what happened and that was her fault because she got drink. She asked for it.

308
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

309
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.270
Galaxy A10e: I know I told her no

310
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:14.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No she didn't ask for it, nobody ever asked to be taken advantage of.

311
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

312
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:17.640
Galaxy A10e: Yes.

313
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:20.670
Galaxy A10e: So,

314
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:37.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're gonna find out about your daughter and hopefully be able to talk to her doctor or somebody today about her progress and what she's doing. And again, I would encourage you to ask that worker if she had a conversation with your daughter. The last couple days.

315
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.010
Okay.

316
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.770

317
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because something, you know,

318
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Spike this, that's for sure.

319
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.640
Galaxy A10e: Dr. I was thinking like whoa I level in mind.

320
00:25:52.080 --> 00:26:04.530
Galaxy A10e: You know, we still are just normal, but every time she says, I'm like, when I talked to yesterday. She's like, I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm like, no. You keep saying you're fine, you're okay. But you're not like I understand, like, just have to let it all out, you know,

321
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:05.670
Yeah.

322
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or maybe

323
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:21.420
Galaxy A10e: I'm like, Oh, cool. They're going to this psychiatric want to try this one. Again, like I know she's not so good. Okay, so we totally thought she's gonna be okay and then all of a sudden you're worse if they say the 150 put her in a mental hospital that's just

324
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.410
Galaxy A10e: Scares me what threw me into our. What if a drug or something on
