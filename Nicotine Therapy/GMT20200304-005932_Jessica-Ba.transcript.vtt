21
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.500

22
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.790

24
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.640

60
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.000
Ryan Morrow: Came down to

61
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:15.330
Ryan Morrow: All of my, my family and friends wanted nothing to do with me and nobody wanted to help me and

62
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.210
Ryan Morrow: I was in a place where it was either be homeless.

63
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.810
Ryan Morrow: And can you I was doing

64
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:35.460
Ryan Morrow: As asking people for money and stuff to get, you know, get my my fix or going detox and figure this out.

65
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.930
Ryan Morrow: So,

66
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Alyssa relax a suicide.

67
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.380
Attempt

68
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.320
Ryan Morrow: I'm sorry, what was the question.

69
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was the relapses suicide attempt.

70
00:08:50.130 --> 00:09:00.450
Ryan Morrow: Oh no. Oh no. I mean, I've never tried to kill myself, but I just was like, you know, I'm gonna probably gonna die doing this, like, eventually, you know,

71
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.790
Ryan Morrow: I'm gonna do this until I die. Let's put it that way.

72
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. So you're trying to find

73
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.990
Ryan Morrow: A route to go

74
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm looking at your, your past history when you first came into the program, you said that you were in IoT program.

75
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Health Resource but I'm assuming that you're not in that anymore because

76
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're in Texas. Right.

77
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:36.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and it says that seems like the addiction started because you had an injury while riding dirt bikes age of 13 were prescribed pain meds.

78
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that I create because I don't want you to feel like you have to

79
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.990
Ryan Morrow: Go through the whole thing again. So I'm kind of

80
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.460
Ryan Morrow: What we have, yeah.

81
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.820
Ryan Morrow: I mean that that happened, but

82
00:09:49.020 --> 00:10:02.280
Ryan Morrow: The first time I tried in pills opiates was when I was like 22 or 23 at a party. One night I had a drink a couple beers and somebody gave me some Percocet and

83
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:20.490
Ryan Morrow: At that point in my life. I thought the like cocaine and ecstasy were drugs and we're okay to do recreational and the as long as I didn't do math crack or heroin that I wasn't a drug addict and so

84
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:28.980
Ryan Morrow: I just party recreational you know I'd never had a problem drinking or any, like, you know, waking up and like wanting to go get high.

85
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:40.470
Ryan Morrow: It was just a party thing well after I tried those pink pills. I was like, wow, I felt really good. And then I started doing them whenever I had a chance to get them.

86
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:50.430
Ryan Morrow: I will say like five years. It was kind of a recreational thing because I never I guess could get them enough to get addicted to them.

87
00:10:51.360 --> 00:11:07.920
Ryan Morrow: But in 2006 I tried oxy cotton for the first time, and I started snorting oxy cotton 80s and eventually I mean I was hooked on them and I got sick. And that was when I realized I was addicted, you know, an addict and so

88
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:19.530
Ryan Morrow: From there it just kind of got worse and worse and I tried heroin, for the first time at 30 and so for the past 10 years. It's just kind of been a rollercoaster ride off and on getting clean

89
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:38.550
Ryan Morrow: relapsing getting clean relapsing losing everything putting my life back together, getting a good job, you know, getting things kind of straightened out and then all I, for whatever reason, I just, I go back to, you know, using. So yeah. Anyways, I

90
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Failed over and over again.

91
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:48.210
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I mean, I'm really good at putting my life back together first day. I mean, I know how to make money and

92
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:58.110
Ryan Morrow: I just have to learn to, you know, say, no, you know, because I think I get I think I get to a point where

93
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:13.650
Ryan Morrow: I'm okay like financially all my stuff's together. And I think that it's okay to go and yeah hi and in my mind it's only going to be for a day or two and then it turns into a habit again. Yeah. And so we, I realized that I

94
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.930
Ryan Morrow: Do that anymore and

95
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.560
Ryan Morrow: I really am to a point where if I if I relapse. Again, I don't, I don't think I would

96
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.260
Ryan Morrow: I would make it out of it.

97
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:39.480
Ryan Morrow: Just because it's too much work and it's too hard to be homeless vehicle listen jobless and then try to put all those things back together. You know what I mean, it's hard.

98
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:49.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you been on my this this mindset before of, like, because I'm hearing lots of determination right now, not wanting to have to rebuild again.

99
00:12:50.070 --> 00:13:00.750
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I had a couple of years ago and and I put everything back together and and then like I just decided that it would be okay to go on us.

100
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.050
Ryan Morrow: And then that's why I went

101
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.140
Ryan Morrow: To bright heart, the first time.

102
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:18.120
Ryan Morrow: Or sought sought out by heart, because I had lost everything that I had just, you know, gained and put back together and

103
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.030
Ryan Morrow: I just thought that would be okay to go and get high for a couple of days and it turned into

104
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.120
Ryan Morrow: A month addiction.

105
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.370
Ryan Morrow: And so I lost all everything and went back to Clovis

106
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.310
Ryan Morrow: And I'm sorry working at a car wash. And that's when I got back on Suboxone

107
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.540
Ryan Morrow: And I relapse like four or five months later.

108
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is this your second time and by hell.

109
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.620
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

110
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You first join in, like last year, right.

111
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.010
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

112
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I also have the enrollment in teen challenge.

113
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.250
Ryan Morrow: Program.

114
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you were younger, all over you.

115
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:05.940
Your call

116
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.350
Ryan Morrow: It's like three, four years ago I went and stayed for 15 months and completed it. Okay.

117
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:23.730
Ryan Morrow: YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW IT team challenges. It's not for teenagers, it's just called teen challenge, because that's what it was when it originated, but it's a Christian. Yeah.

118
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.350
Let me shoot me program.

119
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.960
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, but they don't really I don't really know why they call it a substance abuse treatment program because they don't do anything. First, they just teach you the Bible and how to pray and

120
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:47.280
Ryan Morrow: Ask God to heal you. But, and I get, and I'm a Christian. I, I understand that that logic, but there's a lot more that comes to it. Yes, like, yeah, it's like

121
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.180
Ryan Morrow: So, logically, psychologically, yeah.

122
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.580
Ryan Morrow: And so I like to

123
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.580
Ryan Morrow: Like to implement

124
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.350
Ryan Morrow: A little bit of both into my recovery. So, yeah.

125
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:14.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They'll you're familiar with the program we incorporate that into all the treatment plans because it's multifaceted the recovery process, you know, spirituality component identifying triggers.

126
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, find a supportive environment.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I have here that you don't have any suicide attempts, or ideation.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.680
Okay.

193
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, what's your relationship like with your parents.

194
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:11.310
Ryan Morrow: Haven't talked to my dad and two years and it's pretty. It's really good. My mom and my sisters. They're mad at me still kind of

195
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:20.880
Ryan Morrow: But I mean I'm close with them whenever I'm not doing drugs. Yeah, and they love me. Yeah. And the same thing with my kids.

196
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:32.790
Ryan Morrow: But me and my dad. I've always issues. So I would say like, going back to when I was a kid. That would be the number one thing that I would look at and think that that might have had an effect on the outcome of my life.

197
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:47.850
Ryan Morrow: And also getting a girl pregnant as young as I did was number two and number three was when I was 13 I was in a truck accident and that girl that was in the back of the truck with me died.

198
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.410
Ryan Morrow: So those are three things that I think really have had an effect on my life. I mean, I

199
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:11.070
Ryan Morrow: I don't really, I can't say that I hate my dad or have resentment towards him. You know, it is what it is like my dad's always going to be the way that he is and and if I want to have a relationship with him. I just have to, you know,

200
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.630
Ryan Morrow: Deal with the things that he says, and the way that you

201
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:26.880
Ryan Morrow: Know, whatever, but it doesn't bother me to not have a relationship with them. It doesn't make me want to go through drugs. I don't think

202
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:28.860
Ryan Morrow: But

203
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you see the relationship and the dynamics of the relationship with your father.

204
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.250

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To build

206
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.260

Ryan Morrow: Now, I've never really

208
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.830

209
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.660
