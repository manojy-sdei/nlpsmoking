118
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.440
Amber Romero: premise that as long as I am clean and I'm able to provide a safe and stable environment for my children that they can

174
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.110

175
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.410
LIsa Anderson: Is that

176
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.100
Amber Romero: A pretty

177
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.010
Amber Romero: Good situation for you.

178
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.980
Amber Romero: Yeah, I mean, ideally, I'd rather be in my own place. But for now, it's

185
00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.220
Amber Romero: 14 and then my mom had two other kids from or second marriage.

186
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.540
Amber Romero: The sister speak of, now she's not my sister, but she

187
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.040
Amber Romero: Just really close to me. So she's my sister that way. But, um,

188
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:24.780
Amber Romero: Yeah, I mean, I was pretty spoiled kid. I got whatever I wanted. And I agree that was COLLEGE OF ABOUT YOUR SCREEN. Um, my use and stuff didn't come until afterwards.

204
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.260

209
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:22.440
Amber Romero: So I'm assuming that once this is all over, then I'll be able to to get another job that was kind of waiting around for that.

210
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:30.630
LIsa Anderson: Okay, sure. Yeah, it's a tough time right now. Okay. Are you receiving any unemployment or any, any other benefits.

217
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.720

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:58.230
LIsa Anderson: Any, anything that you feel like would be helpful for me to know as far as like your spiritual, religious background. Anything that like we could incorporate into your treatment that would be helpful to you.

224
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.620
Amber Romero: Um,

225
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:11.160
Amber Romero: I want to say no. But I don't don't know um I have heard from people that

226
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:18.840
Amber Romero: A lot of their success. Every had to do with finding a higher power.

227
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.510
Amber Romero: I will say, I don't know if it helps but

228
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.630
Amber Romero: I can't really see

229
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.300
LIsa Anderson: Maybe something we can kind of just

230
00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.610
Amber Romero: We're

231
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:08.550
Amber Romero: Halfway so relieving hospital and the requirements of that was to attend two meetings a week.

232
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.120
LIsa Anderson: Outpatient and then you maybe went to like a halfway

233
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.960
House.

234
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.670
Amber Romero: So you did impatient and then you went to the

235
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.900
Halfway House from there.

236
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:36.870
Amber Romero: Okay.

237
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.420
LIsa Anderson: Have you done any outpatient

238
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.260
Amber Romero: I'm

239
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.960
LIsa Anderson: Either in an office or like this.

240
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.370
Amber Romero: I I have, um,

241
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:59.640
Amber Romero: It was required in my parental plan to CYP so I had to do outpatient

242
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:08.820
Amber Romero: It didn't really apply myself or anything, but I just went to, they had to go, not because we wanted to go okay so

243
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.410
LIsa Anderson: So yeah, I know that I can appreciate that. So,

244
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.500
What do

245
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.240
LIsa Anderson: You feel like that was beneficial.

246
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:40.170
LIsa Anderson: Outpatient that you kind of had to go because it's the way it is there anything that you could pinpoint that was like maybe why it wasn't so much of a good fit at the time.

247
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.590
Amber Romero: It wasn't ready to stop.

248
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.190
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I gotcha. Okay.

249
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.280

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.210
Amber Romero: Yes.

251
00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:05.340
LIsa Anderson: So amber. Um, can you tell me how, how do you cope with, you know, now, now that you're kind of on this path there or in the past. How would you say that you cope with stressful situations.

252
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.130
Amber Romero: Well, usually it's been using

253
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.180
Amber Romero: Lately it's

254
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.300
Amber Romero: Really um

255
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.430
Amber Romero: We try to just keep my mind busy doing something else. I like to draw

256
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.050
LIsa Anderson: What kind of things do you draw

257
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.360
Amber Romero: Um,

Amber Romero: Anything really sceneries are like to draw my kids. His name or just like random stuff. Okay.

259
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:50.910
LIsa Anderson: Great. So kind of a creative outlet is how you and then also staying busy.

260
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.890
LIsa Anderson: And I know it's it's tough right now. What sort of things are you finding that you enjoy that that help you stay busy.

261
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.710
Amber Romero: I like to read like learn stuff.

262
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.240
Amber Romero: Okay.

263
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.550
LIsa Anderson: Great. So learning and what

264
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:19.860
Amber Romero: I mean, that's like that's the issue is like a because I feel like every using for so long. I really haven't

265
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.190
Amber Romero: found anything that I enjoy because the jokes took all that away from me and stuff but

266
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:27.840
Amber Romero: Um,

267
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.830
Amber Romero: Yeah so still kind of learning that I guess, are we learning that hey,

268
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.270
LIsa Anderson: Would you say maybe that would be one of your like a goal, we could

269
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.940
Amber Romero: Find that maybe just sort of

270
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.660
LIsa Anderson: Figuring out you know what you like to do what you're good at.

271
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.930
Amber Romero: You know, now you know.

272
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.250
LIsa Anderson: Away from the drugs.

273
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:51.780
Yeah.

274
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.780
LIsa Anderson: You know so so coping and that that would be another goal to

275
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:57.990
LIsa Anderson: Is

276
00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.490
Amber Romero: You know, helping

277
00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.810
Amber Romero: Find healthy ways

278
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.230
LIsa Anderson: So that was definitely kind of maybe put that

279
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.980
LIsa Anderson: On our

280
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.050
Amber Romero: Can't hear you.

281
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.870
Amber Romero: Like your videos work enough just they can't hear you.

282
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:27.780
Amber Romero: Tryna

283
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.470
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

284
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.030
LIsa Anderson: Real quick. Okay, I'm sorry, can you repeat that, that last thing you said

285
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.510
Amber Romero: Oh, I was saying I can't hear you.

286
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.320
Amber Romero: Okay.

287
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.730
Amber Romero: I can see your mouth moving but like there was no audio coming out. Oh.

288
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.250
LIsa Anderson: I know. I apologize. Okay. Can you hear me now.

289
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.980
Amber Romero: Yes. Okay.

290
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.070
LIsa Anderson: Good. So okay, so I don't know if you heard that.

291
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.060
Amber Romero: I was just saying

292
00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.530
LIsa Anderson: Maybe coping skills and having healthy coping skills can be something that we can

293
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.760
LIsa Anderson: Look forward to in the future as as a good goal for you.

294
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:04.980
LIsa Anderson: You know, both

295
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:15.270
LIsa Anderson: cope with the stress and, you know, identify for you. So sometimes in in treatment. You might have heard this word before, but looking at triggers and things that my

296
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:23.640
Amber Romero: You know trigger yeah seemed like I don't really. I never really agreed with the with the trigger concept.

297
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:35.280
Amber Romero: I mean I, from what I understand, people use triggers as like an excuse to us. And for me, there wasn't ever an excuse to you, they just use whatever so I

298
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.780
Amber Romero: I don't know. It could be like oh look, the sun came up. It's a trigger. So that's why I never really agreed with it. I mean, if

299
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:55.500
Amber Romero: There's three if you're going to use you're going to use. It's not going to be anything like specific as to why OR ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT WILL like push you into wanting to to you.

300
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.550
Amber Romero: So I

301
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.520
LIsa Anderson: So for you, there wasn't necessarily

302
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.970
LIsa Anderson: And and that's okay. You know, and this might be something that will will identify, but so for you. It wasn't necessarily

303
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.120
Amber Romero: Like

304
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.890
Amber Romero: Oh, I feel

305
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:09.660
Amber Romero: Upset

306
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.920
LIsa Anderson: Like for you. It was

307
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.490
Right.

308
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.920
LIsa Anderson: Or or nothing.

309
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:29.760
Amber Romero: Maybe even both just because I wanted to. It wasn't anything specific you know like as to why. It's because they want. They wanted to

310
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:38.880
Amber Romero: So, I mean, you like we could touch base on on triggers and stuff. But I don't know how much you know like

311
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.390
Amber Romero: Agree to it. So say

312
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.840
LIsa Anderson: No problem, or just kind of tax point where you're at.

313
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.180
LIsa Anderson: How long have you been clean

314
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.050
Amber Romero: Since I got my script couple days ago.

315
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:07.800
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. Um, have you had, you know, when you when you were in the impatient and the sober living. What was the longest amount of time you've been clean in the past.

316
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.470
Amber Romero: I'm

317
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.860
Amber Romero: Probably

318
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.260
Amber Romero: Close to a year.

319
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:28.350
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. Um, so you do have some, you know, some good history. And I think, you know, I would I would put that as a strength, you know, something that you know you've done it before.

320
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.990
LIsa Anderson: And that's a good amount of

321
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.310
Amber Romero: You know,

322
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.970
LIsa Anderson: Kind of clean time on your belt that you've had before. What when

323
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.840
Amber Romero: When you were able to get

324
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.400
LIsa Anderson: In in that year. You know you did.

325
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.190
Amber Romero: Some of the patient, the presidential

326
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:48.150
LIsa Anderson: Or sober living house. Um, what what works that time for you that you are able to stay clean

327
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.020
Amber Romero: What what what

328
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.370
LIsa Anderson: I'm what work.

329
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.750
LIsa Anderson: You're able to stay

330
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.790
Amber Romero: I'm just

331
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:07.290
Amber Romero: The one maybe the the people that I was associating with support system, I guess.

332
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.430
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. So you had a good support system in place.

333
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:12.870
LIsa Anderson: And

334
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.530
Amber Romero: And yes,

335
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:25.380
LIsa Anderson: All around you. Okay. Um, do you mind talking a little bit about amber. So, so then, um, then what do you remember like what happened that that led to that relapse.

336
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.870
Amber Romero: Like, guess I got bored.

337
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.020
Okay.

338
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.450
LIsa Anderson: I'm got bored with sobriety got bored with life. What do you mean by that.

339
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.400
Amber Romero: Just

340
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.920
Amber Romero: Both i mean i

341
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:54.750
Amber Romero: I just one day. One day, one day I wanted to and and I did. I mean, I felt that after but then I still continue to do it.

342
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.090
LIsa Anderson: And and I'm thinking, thinking about your use Amber I know

343
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.800
LIsa Anderson: A little bit about your kids.

344
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.150
LIsa Anderson: And, you know,

345
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.130
LIsa Anderson: You've gone through this process with CFD. Could you identify like

346
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.760
LIsa Anderson: Anything that works has happened because of your addiction.

347
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.820
Amber Romero: Can identify what

348
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.240
Amber Romero: Like in your mind like the worst thing that's happened.

349
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.830
Because of your addiction.

350
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.120
Amber Romero: The termination of parental rights.

351
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.100
LIsa Anderson: And that's, that's really what's driving down

352
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:36.720
LIsa Anderson: To get clean and

353
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.100
Amber Romero: stay clean for your kids.

354
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.140
Amber Romero: Yeah.

355
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:42.990
Amber Romero: Absolutely.

356
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.400
LIsa Anderson: That's definitely a goal that will keep at the forefront.

357
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.970
LIsa Anderson: How would you say your addiction, has

358
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.200
Children.

359
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:55.830
Amber Romero: How would I say it work.

360
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.280
LIsa Anderson: Your addiction affected your kids.

361
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.560
Amber Romero: Really negatively. I mean, the

362
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.510
Amber Romero: Witness too much and then they're not with me so

363
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.520
Amber Romero: They're not

364
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.650
Amber Romero: They're not happy.

365
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:23.070
Amber Romero: And they want to be. They want to be with their mom, of course, but

366
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.010
Amber Romero: I mean nothing good came out of

367
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.510
Amber Romero: My youth in regards to my kids.

368
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:41.130
LIsa Anderson: And what you know kind of thinking your kids to what's, what's the biggest impact your US has had on you on your life.

369
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.850
Amber Romero: The biggest impact that my uses had on my life.

370
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.860
Amber Romero: Not being with my kids.

371
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.870
Amber Romero: And it might

372
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.150
Amber Romero: Destroy relationships.

373
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.640
Amber Romero: With

374
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.110
Amber Romero: With everyone like my family, my kids.

375
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.690
Amber Romero: People that

376
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:12.300
Amber Romero: Want me to do better and I just didn't really like care to listen.

377
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:15.510
Amber Romero: So,

378
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:27.960
LIsa Anderson: You know, looking at, at, where you are now as far as clean and you know you talked about that. That time where you were clean for a year. How you like good social support, you had really good people around you.

379
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:43.620
LIsa Anderson: So I would definitely kind of put that as as another goal that you know maybe another goal for treatment is maybe rebuilding some of those relationships, you know, of course, rebuilding that relationship with your kids, your kids, rebuilding that on with them.

380
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.350
LIsa Anderson: Then be building and repairing you know

381
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.860
Amber Romero: Other

382
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.750
Amber Romero: Relationships that were provided

383
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:57.360
LIsa Anderson: By your addiction and then also kind of growing and establishing relationships that will be healthy and and supportive to you.

384
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:00.420
Amber Romero: Right.

385
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:17.700
LIsa Anderson: Or some other

386
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.280
Amber Romero: Positive people in your life right now.

387
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.450
Amber Romero: Um, my, my parents and

388
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:36.960
Amber Romero: My, my kids, of course, and then I have, I have another friend that you know always has

389
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.420
Amber Romero: Heard me out, so to say, or listen to me to guide me in the right direction.

390
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.610
LIsa Anderson: Hey. Okay, great. So, so there's definitely some people that you can reach out to

391
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.950
LIsa Anderson: In times where where maybe you need somebody to talk to or

392
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:57.990
Amber Romero: Okay, yes.

393
00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:58.650
Um,

394
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:07.110
LIsa Anderson: And you know one thing cameras were kind of talking about all of this and maybe you've, you've heard some of this in treatment before

395
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:24.990
LIsa Anderson: But a little bit of, you know, just about the way that drugs affect your body affect your brain. You know there's there's a reason that they're addicting. You know, the way they just latch on to different you know receptor sites and different things in the brain.

396
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:40.500
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, I think one of our goals, um, you know, maybe for treatment going forward with just to be kind of, you know, giving yourself just some time, you know, it does take time for your brain and your body to kind of

397
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:52.290
LIsa Anderson: You know i don't i don't want to use the word detox, but just to kind of give your brain and body time to kind of re reset itself. Does that make sense.

398
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:55.500
Amber Romero: Yeah, so

399
00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:03.480
LIsa Anderson: So maybe when people use substances over a long period of time. You know, there's a lot of ways that

400
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:06.630
LIsa Anderson: You're there.

401
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:15.240
LIsa Anderson: Way that they they're thinking the way that they process information, the way that they make decisions, the way they make decisions.

402
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:15.930
Amber Romero: And so

403
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.020
LIsa Anderson: Takes a little bit of time for

404
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:19.860
Amber Romero: The brain.

405
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.750
LIsa Anderson: To kind of almost rewire itself a

406
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:22.380
LIsa Anderson: Little bit.

407
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.480
LIsa Anderson: And takes a little bit of time for your brain to get kind of back

408
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.290
LIsa Anderson: circuited. Right. Does that make sense.

409
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:32.820
Amber Romero: Yeah.

410
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.780
Amber Romero: You know, you might

411
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.050
LIsa Anderson: Know I know for you. You said you might not have noticed

412
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.370
Amber Romero: Like specific

413
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.310
LIsa Anderson: That led you to use

414
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.280
LIsa Anderson: It, you know, of course substance is kind of

415
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.240
Amber Romero: Will

416
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.250
LIsa Anderson: Will know our ability to really feel our

417
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:53.760
Feelings.

418
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.770
Amber Romero: For people in early recovery. This

419
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.330
LIsa Anderson: First time in a long

420
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:04.560
Amber Romero: Time that their experience. Yeah, really feeling, feeling

421
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.350
Amber Romero: Yeah, so

422
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:18.240
LIsa Anderson: That is, it's going to be helpful just to kind of let you know that

423
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.740
LIsa Anderson: To be patient with yourself.

424
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.000
LIsa Anderson: You know that it's okay. And you're going to learn a lot about this.

425
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.850
Amber Romero: In groups and stuff to will, you know,

426
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.370
LIsa Anderson: Out there.

427
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.380
Amber Romero: And there's a lot happening in your

428
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:34.860
Free

429
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.240
LIsa Anderson: You know, sort of healing itself and kind of repairing itself from those substances and

430
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:45.840
So that might

431
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.770
Amber Romero: You know, just just

432
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.880
LIsa Anderson: Just thinking about things that are new to you.

433
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.120
That kind of makes sense.

434
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.360
Amber Romero: Yeah, okay.

435
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:08.430
LIsa Anderson: Some of the things that that I kind of like to do with my patients is sometimes you will think about

436
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.150
Behaviors.

437
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:10.680
Amber Romero: So,

438
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.710
LIsa Anderson: So dry and windy.

439
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.700
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, when we think about

440
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.410
LIsa Anderson: Let me think about, you know, any behavior.

441
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.450
LIsa Anderson: You know the

442
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.340
Amber Romero: Process with the

443
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.400
LIsa Anderson: phone and calling your parents or calling a friend.

444
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.020
You know, there's always

445
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.100
LIsa Anderson: Behind our, our actions because, of course, we're

446
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.110
LIsa Anderson: We're complex thinking

447
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.360
LIsa Anderson: Though

448
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.010
Amber Romero: Sometimes those thoughts can

449
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.870
LIsa Anderson: Other times, those thoughts.

450
00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.510
LIsa Anderson: Might not be actionable. So one of the things that you know will start to work together on

451
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.390
LIsa Anderson: Is how your thoughts influence

452
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.500
Amber Romero: Your behaviors and

453
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.110
Amber Romero: You know, for a lot of people I

454
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.770
Amber Romero: May be

455
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.150
LIsa Anderson: Happy to meet you know

456
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.970
LIsa Anderson: The feelings aren't there, but we'll talk about feeling bad.

457
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.710
LIsa Anderson: And we'll talk about

458
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.400
LIsa Anderson: Those

459
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.110
LIsa Anderson: How those things are connected thoughts.

460
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.370
feelings and actions.

461
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.700
Amber Romero: And and how

462
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.580
LIsa Anderson: That kind of makes sense.

463
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:55.410
LIsa Anderson: Will be things that will work on, you know, together, you know, over time. So, so I don't want to overwhelm me or throw too much at you today.

464
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:55.920
Amber Romero: Well done.

465
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.840
LIsa Anderson: Now, these will be things in group to

466
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.840
Amber Romero: Can you hear me.

467
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.100
Yes, I can hear you.

468
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.920
Amber Romero: Okay. Okay, good.

469
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:22.470
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, so, yes. That'll be all stuff that we we get into that, I just kind of want to just throw that out there as far as, you know,

470
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.550
Amber Romero: Understanding that

471
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:25.590
LIsa Anderson: Time just

472
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.250
LIsa Anderson: For just to, you know, to kind of recover.

473
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.540
But of course,

474
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:40.440
LIsa Anderson: How are you feeling physically so far since you've been on on the medication.

475
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.360
Amber Romero: I'm okay.

476
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.840
Amber Romero: My body's having to like readjust

477
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.860
Amber Romero: A lot of anxiety still

478
00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:54.510

Sure you're getting

559
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.290
LIsa Anderson: The kind of just thinking about those things that are helpful to you.

560
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.730
Amber Romero: Okay.

561
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.510

Amber Romero: Um,

564
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:48.600
Amber Romero: I mean no cuz like the weather's just barely starting to get nice outside now.

565
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.150
Amber Romero: Meaning, I don't really like to hang out myself.

566
00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:08.790
Amber Romero: Me. It's something that I can possibly integrate into my life coming to work every day saying no, but

567
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.990
Yes.

568
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.060
LIsa Anderson: It's been tough because it's been really

569
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.190
Amber Romero: Bad

570
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:45.870
Amber Romero: Any, anything else. And so, sorry, is the condition is the connection usually like this. Like it just got like really bad with the last couple minutes.

571
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.070
LIsa Anderson: You're

572
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:51.990
LIsa Anderson: Like your date.

573
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:57.030
Amber Romero: I'm going to my, to my data. I mean, I'm

574
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.490
Amber Romero: Great comfort zone.

575
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:02.850
Amber Romero: I mean, I even have

576
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.430
Amber Romero: Six bars.

577
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:17.340
LIsa Anderson: I'm sorry about that. Yeah, I know, I know my wife I cut out for a minute. But, um, but I'm back now, I'm full access so

578
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.270
LIsa Anderson: I don't know.

579
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.240
LIsa Anderson: If it's

580
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.840
LIsa Anderson: If it's the data or the Wi Fi.

581
00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.380
LIsa Anderson: So maybe

582
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:34.950
LIsa Anderson: Maybe hopefully next time. If you're at at the house. It might be better. I don't know.

583
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.580
LIsa Anderson: Um, do you have Wi Fi at

584
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:39.900
Your sister's place.

585
00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:48.780
Amber Romero: No, I know I don't usually they usually by Friday have unlimited

586
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:59.610
Amber Romero: unlimited data mean it doesn't really you don't usually have issues with with the data or connection or anything on the phone.

587
00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:09.990
Amber Romero: But I was wondering, like, maybe if if it's usually like if our audio is usually like this. I've never done anything like this. So I don't. I really don't know what to expect, you know,

588
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.710
LIsa Anderson: Or no, I hear you. It is it is different, um,

589
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:24.390
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so I, some people, you know, I don't know if they're if maybe being inside if it's a little bit quieter, or if you can get on like a mobile hotspot.

590
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:34.290
LIsa Anderson: That might be a little bit more stable connection than the, the, like, getting on a Wi Fi like jumping onto a Wi Fi.

591
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.510
LIsa Anderson: But you're going to have group soon. So see how that how that goes.

592
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:47.490
LIsa Anderson: And and I can reach out on my end and see if there's anything going on on my end. Sometimes if people use headphones.

593
00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:49.290
Amber Romero: Like if your

594
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:50.400
LIsa Anderson: Volume wise and

595
00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:59.610
Amber Romero: I can, I can hear. I can hear you just fine. And just like every couple words, it's coming out.

596
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:13.110
Amber Romero: Like computerized so to see either computerized or not at all. So like I can see your like your lips moving just every other word wasn't coming out. Gotcha.

597
00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.590
Amber Romero: Yeah, like volume is just fine. Okay. Yeah.

598
00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:27.570
LIsa Anderson: Might be the connection. So, but I know this is this is new and it's a little bit funky, you know, compared to maybe sitting face to face with somebody

599
00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:45.630
LIsa Anderson: But see how your other sessions. Go. Um, if you're using, you know, just a, like a data on your cell phone. It might be if you could try to get on like a public Wi Fi. And I know that's, you know, might not be possible.

600
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.770
LIsa Anderson: Right now, because you know of everything that's happening.

601
00:52:50.940 --> 00:53:02.970
LIsa Anderson: So, okay, I'm sorry and I you know I will check and make sure there's any nothing going on on my end. So we can we can go ahead and and wrap up amber. Do you have any questions or

602
00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:03.840
Concerns

603
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.860
Amber Romero: Not too much, um,

604
00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:30.330
Amber Romero: So I guess maybe one question I have. So how often, how often do you do or do I do individual or do I am I meeting with you every week or how does it work from here. Yes.

605
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.520

Amber Romero: So I am able to do video chat with my kids, three times a week.

613
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:37.680

LIsa Anderson: New patient seen for

678
01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:32.790
LIsa Anderson: opiate dependence and my initial bio so cool bio psychosocial assessment with her.

679
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.400
LIsa Anderson: She denied any current suicidal or homicidal ideation.

680
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.090
LIsa Anderson: Or any plans of self harm.

681
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.280
LIsa Anderson: Her history.

682
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:55.620
LIsa Anderson: Was significant for starting at the age of 12 years old, use of alcohol. She's currently using nicotine smoking cigarettes.

683
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.190
LIsa Anderson: History of marijuana use history of

684
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.120
LIsa Anderson: Cocaine crack US history of methamphetamine use

685
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.580
LIsa Anderson: And her her current

686
01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.270
LIsa Anderson: Most recent drug of choice was heroin.

687
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:11.550
LIsa Anderson: This is

688
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:20.940
LIsa Anderson: One of her second attempts at at treatment. She does have a history of a one year period of sobriety.

689
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.480
LIsa Anderson: She

690
01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:38.820
LIsa Anderson: Is currently on probation, but it appears that she is compliant with all of her current probation requirements and is set to complete her probation. In June of this year.

691
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:55.380
LIsa Anderson: Another psychosocial stress or she identified is her children being in custody of a family member her having lost custody due to her drug use.

692
01:01:55.950 --> 01:02:14.550
LIsa Anderson: But she did identify that as her her main goal for treatment and one of her main motivations for getting clean. At this time, would be to get her kids back and she identified having how were drug use damage to a relationship with them and that being a big

693
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:19.290
LIsa Anderson: Motivation factor in her getting clean at this time.

694
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:21.600
LIsa Anderson: Some of her strengths

695
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:23.910
LIsa Anderson: I think

696
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:35.370
LIsa Anderson: Live in her ability to identify some of her interests and ability, she identified good social support in the form of her parents and a good friend.

697
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:37.590
LIsa Anderson: She identified

698
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.890
LIsa Anderson: Being wanting to reconnect with some of her hobbies and some of her her interests around drawing and she recognized that

699
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.880
LIsa Anderson: Her drug use had really impacted her ability to

700
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:58.410
LIsa Anderson: Have have hobbies have interests.

701
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:09.900
LIsa Anderson: She some of her strengths include she does have a history of employment, she has a bachelor's degree her other strengths included her family support.

702
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.160
LIsa Anderson: Some of her risk factors revolved around

703
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.110
LIsa Anderson: A lack of insight around her substance use history.

704
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.770
LIsa Anderson: And in some difficulty identifying

705
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:35.160
LIsa Anderson: Triggers or her her feelings that her drug you sort of happen and that would definitely be a potential area to focus treatment on is improving insight.

706
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:54.390
LIsa Anderson: increasing awareness. She didn't have some good reflection around how her drug use impacted her life, how it impacted her family, how it, it led to her directly losing her children and how it it harms them so that would be certainly something to build upon

707
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.060
LIsa Anderson: Other treatment goals would include

708
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:12.240
LIsa Anderson: Improving her day to day functioning around structuring her day structuring healthy habits incorporating healthy coping skills and really helping her to identify what thoughts and feelings precipitated her drug use.

709
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.780
LIsa Anderson: What factors contributed to that drug use and helping her develop some insight and awareness into

710
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:24.300
LIsa Anderson: Why she used and how how she can promote using in the future.

711
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.810
LIsa Anderson: Her mental status exam. She was alert and oriented.

712
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:45.660
LIsa Anderson: She was oriented to to person, place in time. However, her attention did not seem to be focused on this session, which could have been related to maybe some of the technical technological

713
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.200
LIsa Anderson: unfamiliarity and she had mentioned that this was the first time she had used this modality.

714
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:53.970
LIsa Anderson: But

715
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:58.530
LIsa Anderson: Her her attention didn't really seem to be focused

716
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.430
LIsa Anderson: On the session. She was outside which which made it difficult

717
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:15.000
LIsa Anderson: For me to hear she she mentioned that she had some issues that I think she's having issues with her. Her Wi Fi.

718
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:22.020
LIsa Anderson: So, but that that did it didn't impact the the connection and attention to the session.

719
01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:37.800
LIsa Anderson: She was well groomed again I contact was really poor which could have been due to the technology aspect, but she she really had zero eye contact and often would even have the phone.

720
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:46.110
LIsa Anderson: Facing the top of her head or the outside environment so that that could have been a reflective

721
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:48.270
LIsa Anderson: Response

722
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.320
LIsa Anderson: You know, reflected in her behavior her motor activity was within normal limits.

723
01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:01.140
LIsa Anderson: Her permeated with youth dynamic with a congruent affect

724
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:07.980
LIsa Anderson: Her speech was within normal limits gratitude was cooperative

725
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.310
LIsa Anderson: And in normal for the

726
01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:18.150
LIsa Anderson: Setting again her engagement was a little off. But that could have been due to the

727
01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.820
LIsa Anderson: You know, just, just the setting.

728
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:28.500
LIsa Anderson: And her getting used to the use of technology of the session her thought process was linear

729
01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:32.400
LIsa Anderson: There was no evidence of loose association or

730
01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:35.970
LIsa Anderson: You know circumstantial thought

731
01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:44.250
LIsa Anderson: Her thought content was appropriate to the topic at hand. There was no evidence of delusions or hallucinations.

732
01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:47.190
LIsa Anderson: Her

733
01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:58.200
LIsa Anderson: Her impulse control was not thoroughly assessed at this time. But given her her history of drug use.

734
01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.150
LIsa Anderson: I would

735
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.530
LIsa Anderson: Assess a poor level of impulse control.

736
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:13.350
LIsa Anderson: And and and certainly her judgment in regards to her history of drug use.

737
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.420
LIsa Anderson: We've seen poor her insight.

738
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.120
LIsa Anderson: I think at this point.

739
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:38.070
LIsa Anderson: Was was porch affair. She was able to identify some of the ways in which her substance use harmed others around her and think about how it negatively impacted her life, but she was not really able to identify and it wasn't

740
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:46.830
LIsa Anderson: Would be an area for further explanation as far as her her insight into her drug use.

741
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:58.020
LIsa Anderson: attention and memory and cognition was not assessed at this encounter with patient was provided with instructions on how to access

742
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:07.770
LIsa Anderson: Future appointments with this therapist, we discuss an initial treatment plan to begin weekly therapy starting next Thursday.

743
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.170
LIsa Anderson: Beginning at 1pm

744
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:23.340
LIsa Anderson: Mountain time and that would be our initial treatment plan going forward in our next session will focus on treatment planning and she was provided with information about how to access bright heart health.

745
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:33.780
LIsa Anderson: Should you have any questions or concerns. In the meantime, she was instructed to attend group as scheduled she mentioned having

746
01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:52.170
LIsa Anderson: Visits and phone calls scheduled with her children and that will also in future treatment planning really focus on developing some good habits for her a daily schedule. I think would be really helpful. And certainly, including

747
01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:05.250
LIsa Anderson: Her time with her children on those video chats and that seemed like a big strength for her, that she's really focused on those, but she didn't really seem to have very much of any day to day

748
01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:11.280
LIsa Anderson: Schedule or or routine. And I think that would be really helpful for her.

749
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:19.380
LIsa Anderson: To get into something productive and so that next session will be next Thursday at 1pm. Thank you.
