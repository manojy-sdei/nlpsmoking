Saraniah Aston: necessarily a bad thing for me.

42
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.990
Saraniah Aston: And then the next thing is about Travis, my brother Travis.

43
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.780
Saraniah Aston: Moving to Solar City, and then I wrote equals anxiety and paranoia.

44
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.640
Saraniah Aston: He sleeps on the couch. My mom so I can't visit for a night.

45
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.170
Saraniah Aston: I can't get comfortable, like when I'm there. Yeah.

46
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.370
Saraniah Aston: He is really stressing my mother out

47
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.600
Saraniah Aston: And now she really has no room for me.

48
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.630
Saraniah Aston: And I really lonely, baby.

49
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.070
Saraniah Aston: Okay, yep. She's got no time.

50
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.470
Saraniah Aston: She's so stressed.

51
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.960
Saraniah Aston: Stressed out from someone that isn't need at least

52
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.880
Saraniah Aston: With a really

53
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.690
Hard

54
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.160
Yeah.

55
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.870
Saraniah Aston: Blows up on me and I take

56
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It out on you, instead of

57
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.250
Saraniah Aston: You know, I do what she takes it on me.

58
00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:02.400
Saraniah Aston: That will be ripped me to shreds when when she when she gets to like

59
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:19.920
Saraniah Aston: That into that zone where she pushed herself. Yeah, to pure anger and rage her whole voice changes her energy changes her posture changes.

60
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.570
Saraniah Aston: It's so it's so scary when it happens.

61
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:42.330
Saraniah Aston: And then she says mean things and she starts to call me names and then she gets closer and closer and I'm crying. And it's like, the more I cry harder. She goes at me.

62
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:53.130
Saraniah Aston: At that moment, that's me having a traumatic experience at the very moment, and she doesn't understand that and

63
00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:11.010
Saraniah Aston: She would just like Uday ins me very hard and basically like kind of bully, a little bit. I guess that would you call it, and then and then go away and then what that would do for me is

64
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:24.360
Saraniah Aston: It would give me about two to three full days of being nearly like Siri. This is very real like lethargic like

65
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:42.090
Saraniah Aston: Having a hard time walking like just shuffling, you know, and just mouth open, staring out the window like a really scary place that when I'm there. It's like oh my god this end of the world.

66
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.590
Saraniah Aston: I mean, I moved out of there and I'm so glad because I can't handle that shit anymore. I cannot take it.

67
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.280
Saraniah Aston: Um, but now it's like

68
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:05.730
Saraniah Aston: It's like a double edged sword situation because now I you know I have my own place but

69
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.470
Saraniah Aston: I'm not

70
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:22.290
Saraniah Aston: I mean, she's not always that monster that she turns into. And so I don't have her at all because my brother's there and my brothers very unstable and

71
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:32.850
Saraniah Aston: She has him to take care of, I guess, and I don't want her to take care of me. I keep telling her, how much

72
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:50.070
Saraniah Aston: how grateful I am for everything she's done me and is still doing for me and how much I'm working to get like a better place and coverage. I wouldn't get a job and that I won't be a burden for much longer.

73
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.920
Saraniah Aston: Situation. She is

74
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.700
Saraniah Aston: Because she's nice she's

75
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.460
Saraniah Aston: All I love

76
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.940
All right, sir, I'm yeah

77
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's hard to hear this but you have you and it may feel fragmented and as if it's groundless at times, but you do have you, I see you there. I know it doesn't feel like it and it's so lonely. It's

78
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost as if everything falls away so isolating and I get that.

79
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You are there, you're there.

80
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're there you're in this fight for your life. And I see you fighting

81
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I see you fighting for it.

82
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And with

83
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: This realization, your brother is now in the way of the tiny morsel in Chrome of support that you had that little string. You're holding on to this just tip the scale.

84
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:01.680
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, because I'm slightly afraid of him when I said isn't stable.

85
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.920
Saraniah Aston: When I first came back to LA.

86
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:22.740
Saraniah Aston: This my second day there he was having a moment and he he beat me up my second day there and he just beat me up and my mom when you anything about it and she blamed me for it.

87
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.080
Saraniah Aston: And she was just like, I just want to forget about it. Forget about it. Forget about it.

88
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:38.220
Saraniah Aston: And I was really traumatized by that. And every time that I mentioned that was traumatizing to me. She gets annoyed. It annoys her

89
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.250
Saraniah Aston: Blue noise.

90
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm hearing is

91
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The

92
00:09:48.090 --> 00:10:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: traumatic events. Continue. You and I meet and we start to get a little route in. It's like, well, let's explore a boundary and and we got our little right we got it in there and be like, oh, that's kind of a cool topic and let's continue that one and then more trauma.

93
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only more trauma, but relived trauma continues to intrude right

94
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

95
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't get a break.

96
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.550
Saraniah Aston: Was like the story of my life. And what do I expect besides that I'm used to it.

97
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

98
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.800
Saraniah Aston: So when you say that it's like doesn't really matter.

99
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah but out here, right, because I'm, I'm not in it. I'm not in the trenches with you. I'm back here and I can see from a distance. I can see

100
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That she's Start Right. Start to get lift your head up.

101
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, ma'am.

102
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:58.410
Saraniah Aston: Gets you again. Good. I go right backwards. Yeah. But the one thing that I've noticed that is positive, is that I am getting out of it.

103
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.580
Saraniah Aston: quicker and quicker and quicker and quicker.

104
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:28.590
Saraniah Aston: It's starting to for some reason. It's kind of sad, but for some reason. It's starting to not affect me as much and so I'm not charging for three days anymore. Now, if something happens, it's like a day. It's not three days anymore. So something is happening within me, myself, that

105
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:36.240
Saraniah Aston: That's changing. I don't know what's changing but something's changing because yeah that's that's definitely true.

106
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: ration. Now you said something interesting, and I want to check in on it.

107
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The duration is shorter where once the symptom right of the of the post trauma.

108
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yeah, they were lasting three days. We're almost it's almost sounds like you were dissociating we're in this haze on that.

109
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, and you noticed, maybe it only lasted a day and you're seeing. I don't know why and how I got here and I noticed I was able to get out. Do you know

110
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything about how you got out, was it a text. Was it something you saw something you felt something you thought of. Do you know how you got back into what I would call like a conscious mobilized state.

111
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.470
Saraniah Aston: I just, I started thinking

112
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.310
Saraniah Aston: I started thinking and

113
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:52.290
Saraniah Aston: Somehow I get to this place much quicker where I'm like, where things just start to shift a little bit in my head I have like a ha moment like and then I just kind of like roll with that and

114
00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:00.240
Saraniah Aston: I don't know when it happens, or why it happens or why it's happening faster.

115
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.840
Saraniah Aston: But happening, that's for sure.

116
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you think that it also coincidentally happened like

117
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you and I are working together. There's a little bit more like opportunity for some me to see when it might be happening. Did it happen like anytime around where

118
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: slept in, I think, I don't remember the decks was through phone

119
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: went to sleep. We liked it happen around that time.

120
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:45.360
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. Yeah, but I'm over it today. I mean, I guess I'm crying. But just because I'm emotional, but I'm not like

121
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:58.140
Saraniah Aston: I mean not really going out and doing anything because it's stupid virus. But if, if I could, I probably would go out I didn't go for a walk or go into town or something like that.

122
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.160
Saraniah Aston: So I'm not completely like bullying out from it. No, I'm and I'm not mad at my mom.

123
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.420
Saraniah Aston: And I'm just really disappointed and

124
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.700
Saraniah Aston: And it's at that point where it's okay it's move on time.

125
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.050
Yeah.

126
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.690
Saraniah Aston: So it's like, I don't know, I just start thinking and

127
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:31.320
Saraniah Aston: I just hit these different stages and then I get to this one stage where it's like, all right, move on time. Time to just

128
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:45.600
Saraniah Aston: We just dealt with that in our head. We understand what's going on now. Right. It's like I asked myself these questions and then we move on. It's crazy.

129
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.320
What

130
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how do you summarize it in a sense, what's the. I understand. Now, how does it get

131
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.660
Saraniah Aston: Summarized with that. I understand what just happened. What do you mean

132
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you go into stages start thinking, then there's an aha moment.

133
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And understand what's going on. And then it's move on time. What, what do you understand

134
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:19.410
Saraniah Aston: Oh, I understand that my mom just whatever happened probably okay. I'll use this example, my mom.

135
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.270
Saraniah Aston: Okay, my mom completely freaked out on me.

136
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:43.290
Saraniah Aston: I'm saying here. I don't think I did anything wrong. I've checked with myself on that over and over again. I feel good about myself and it comes to that damn My mom's crazy. Damn my mom's crazy. There's nothing I can do about it.

137
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:55.950
Saraniah Aston: Screw this and then maybe a little bit of any here then. And then I just start moving and I get dressed or something and clean.

138
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.050
Saraniah Aston: And then I just

139
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.240
Saraniah Aston: Get to this. That's the moving on stage. It's like

140
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.080
Saraniah Aston: It's like letting go of a bunch of rage and a place that I could go to I don't go to anymore.

141
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.540
Saraniah Aston: Or drinking or something like that. You know what I mean. Mm hmm.

142
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, I have a question about one of these spaces in here I can see my mom completely freaked out a check myself that I do anything, right, wrong. No, I really check myself. Damn my mom's crazy

143
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And then, so there's the space that I'm curious about maybe we could spend some time in this space because there was nothing. He didn't say anything. And I put this little space on my notepad here.

144
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it went so it went down my mom's crazy

145
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Gruber.

146
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. I'm angry, I start moving and cleaning

147
00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's right in here that I'm curious about. It's the my mom's crazy

148
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen.

149
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.760
Saraniah Aston: It's me. Sorry to tell myself.

150
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.820
Saraniah Aston: You're a fighter. There's no it's time to get up and fight. Yep.

151
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. I think it's right in here. So it might be this, and I might use a pencil for a reason. I can always move it.

152
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So damn. She's crazy. Wait a minute. I'm a fighter screw her and you mobilize with anger and you get it done start cleaning start moving

153
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.940
Saraniah Aston: You start it yeah okay so

154
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.510
Saraniah Aston: You are no one should be around me like I need

155
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.630
Saraniah Aston: To be in my own way. Yeah, okay.

156
00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.590
All right.

157
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so

158
00:17:50.640 --> 00:18:00.030
Saraniah Aston: Like if she were to start apologizing, at some point, like when I'm in that zone that wouldn't be a good time to start apologizing. So I would just be like, Mom, not now. I'm in my zone.

159
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So is it possible now i don't know i'm not sort of deconstructing our exchange. But is it possible that somewhere in there, our appointment fell in

160
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it was your you had been organizing cleaning and we're tired and slept through didn't hear the alarm and then so our appointment fell somewhere in that

161
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.960
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, no. Yeah.

162
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.410
Saraniah Aston: I just don't know which point I

163
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.360
Saraniah Aston: Was something was happening. Yeah, definitely.

164
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

165
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.180
Saraniah Aston: I think I was more in the moment of them.

166
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:48.780
Saraniah Aston: Like I was getting I was right, kind of in the thick of a bunch of chaos of that chaos. Actually, I don't think it was right after

167
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you.

168
00:18:52.110 --> 00:19:04.020
Saraniah Aston: The last time I spoke to you the last text I sent you was after everything when I was calm and I was thinking clearly and we'll get to that point, I think very clearly.

169
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.850
Saraniah Aston: Really weird

170
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.210
Saraniah Aston: Very weird

171
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The adrenaline that's available for mobilization is pretty cool get stuff done.

172
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's why I use the mobilize and notice how before it was you described it as lethargy, I think something where it's a real low, low, low energy and and also cognitively, you're not feeling very sharp minded and I use the worst associated now. You went

173
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.240
Yeah.

174
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. So this is interesting.

175
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The point that I'm interested in is right in here, which has to do with taking the opportunity of of the vitality of anger. What it can do to self protect to protect you physically and mentally

176
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have never used it in a way with a therapist and certainly doesn't sound like you have it available to be in communication with your mother at the time.

177
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an all or it's like you don't want to be near me, I cannot hear an apology. I don't want to have anything to do with you. I just need to kind of be in motion, but you don't really want to hear. You don't want to slow down. Once you've kind of tapped into that resource.

178
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:23.220
Saraniah Aston: You know,

179
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:24.810
Saraniah Aston: There was slowed down now.

180
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

181
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Has it ever been that it went to your assessment online.

182
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Has ever gone too far, like you took the anger and it moved to rage and you broke something. You felt bad about you hurt someone you broke some of your own stuff.

183
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.350
Saraniah Aston: Oh yeah, all the time.

184
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.080
Saraniah Aston: Like when I was in my 20s.

185
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:55.440
Saraniah Aston: And before teenager. Yeah, up until like the past

186
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.970
Saraniah Aston: Three, four years. Okay.

187
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And nothing you haven't done anything recently, you didn't break anything recently.

188
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.210
Saraniah Aston: Anything.

189
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:19.530
Saraniah Aston: Like when I get rage in and out of control that hasn't happened in such a long time, no nothing. Recently, I'm trying. I can't remember the last, the last time was like

190
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.460
Saraniah Aston: I believe it was like

191
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:33.600
Saraniah Aston: Oh no, the left. Okay, last time was like a year ago when my ex. I was dating a girl and she

192
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.080
Saraniah Aston: She was crazy. And she

193
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.810
Saraniah Aston: She was like, attacking me proverbially so I threw her across the room.

194
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:54.210
Saraniah Aston: But it was kind of self defense rage thing, but with my mom I had extremely bad through coughing on her.

195
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:55.950
Saraniah Aston: In Israel.

196
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.970
Saraniah Aston: When she visited that was like three years ago.

197
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So here

198
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:04.890
Saraniah Aston: Well,

199
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, I'm actually not digging around for those stories. Here's what I'm trying to

200
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.990
Saraniah Aston: Let them know

201
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it has to do with an interest. I love the anger for a lot of people that like have this sort of depression. I want to kind of take that juice and vitality that that we have with our anger and I want to see if we can use it in an adaptive way. So where I'm wondering is that

202
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If there is a way that you and I can

203
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Mobilize it

204
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Without it being self destructive.

205
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Mobilize it where it's not damaging relationships or your goals already like things that you already put in motion that you do like

206
00:22:49.890 --> 00:23:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This that's I just wonder if before it gets full tilt anger, all the way to rage. If you have any I would call it consciousness. I'm not saying you're asleep, it's it's tricky with words because I've only got words to work with here whether

207
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You have awareness of I have a choice right now I can either keep fueling this feeding it and it can get bigger and bigger, and this is

208
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What I've always done. I'm going to get up and this is I had it. And now I'm going to go get organized. I'm going to get cleaning and that was then and this is now so right before you get full Matt, do you have an awareness that

209
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a right to just be irritated.

210
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know just yeah

211
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You do. Okay.

212
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

213
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.260
Saraniah Aston: Did I am you know

214
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.910
Saraniah Aston: At that moment, and even when I am accepting I'm still irritated.

215
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

216
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.910
Saraniah Aston: So yeah, I do. Okay.

217
00:23:51.600 --> 00:24:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepting inherited. So that's the one I'm curious about. I like that word you use just now accepting. So here's what I'm wondering. I'm wondering if our work could be around that window. I wonder if we could see some meaningful difference meaning like long lasting and stuff you like

218
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in here in the damn. She's crazy.

219
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a fighter.

220
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: She's crazy. I'm a fighter. I don't have to fight her a fighter. What am I fighting for you come back. What am I fighting for my fighting for my guess is

221
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're cleaning and, what's the other thing moving is your way of putting that into motion, but let's add let's add a little bit more to it. Let's add

222
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.080
Saraniah Aston: Control the cleaning is making sure I have control.

223
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that makes sense. Let's put it somewhere that settles a little bit lower on the anger volume. Let's settle it down a little. Let's see if we can have a

224
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Mantra or something, you could say there's Damn she's crazy. That's true. That's, that's something to think, Oh, that's great. Damn. She's crazy. I'm a fighter and let's add I'm fighting for.

225
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get real clear on that. What are you fighting for.

226
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.400
Saraniah Aston: My freedom. Yeah, my

227
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: From crazy right

228
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.510
Saraniah Aston: Continue a pattern.

229
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.280
Saraniah Aston: Here just

230
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:27.810
Saraniah Aston: For freedom. Yeah.

231
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.220
Okay.

232
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of that freedom when you leave crazy over here. It does mean that you will be in the room alone for a moment, doesn't mean you have to feel lonely, that part is different. I'm very much alone.

233
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not lonely, right, she's not lonely. It's a different experience. There's a meaning that it has for you and you and I haven't talked at all. I, I ran across

234
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't look at your guys's I jump right in here and start talking with you right away. I don't have a chance to really look at

235
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brief, a Dutch assessment monitor the band thing.

236
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.980
Saraniah Aston: I just started writing it.

237
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: For you because I don't get to look at him. Very often, but I did get to I was looking at it. I think a couple weeks ago, maybe, and I saw want to get my daughter.

238
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

239
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It made me wonder underneath all of this right all this if underneath it, if that's part of what you're fighting for.

240
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:46.410
Saraniah Aston: That's all I'm fighting for. That's why I need to function.

241
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.590
Saraniah Aston: At all. I'm fighting for myself as well.

242
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.430
Saraniah Aston: But I'm fighting for myself because I need to fight for my daughter, you know,

243
00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.420
Saraniah Aston: That's okay in the big picture that is what

244
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. Absolutely. So the more you heal the more an island your therapist, right, I might say,

245
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: More confidence, my client has around being emotionally regulated around craziness.

246
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Closer. She's going to get hurdle.

247
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting her daughter back

248
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So what stands in the way logistically, it's probably a lot

249
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

250
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So ignorant, I have

251
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: No idea what the story is right.

252
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:52.050
Saraniah Aston: My ex owes money to Israel and visa allowed to leave the country until it's paid my mom got a really, really good, really good job and

253
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.340
Saraniah Aston: She told me to come out here and that she would pay off his debt.

254
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.360
Saraniah Aston: And that didn't happen and

255
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:11.100
Saraniah Aston: It's all pretty much on my shoulders. Now, so I'm gonna figure it out.

256
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.630
Okay.

257
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What we've broken it down to, it's a number

258
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.850
Saraniah Aston: There's, it's much it's just some money. Yeah.

259
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.070
Saraniah Aston: Like, yeah, it's like $50,000 yeah 50,000

260
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.310
Saraniah Aston: And which it could be worse. So

261
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah, so we've got 50 grand and

262
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It is not x is holding her back know if there was money and pay it, and they would both be out here.

263
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.520
Saraniah Aston: Is all right. Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no domestic violence with x

265
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And no. Okay. And she feels safe you felt safe out there.

266
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.620
Saraniah Aston: No, because he has a drug problem so

267
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:12.870
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, so that's why I want to get her. That's why I'm like yeah of course you come to

268
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.890
Saraniah Aston: Write me this and

269
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:25.380
Saraniah Aston: I just lose everybody everybody loses momentum and seems to forget about it and I don't, I'm not so

270
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: One more thing. How old is your daughter.

271
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:34.050
Saraniah Aston: She's seven okay and you

272
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: FaceTime her still meeting with her.

273
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:53.970
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, we do a Facebook video, check it has all of these games that you can apply these virtual games. Yeah, it's really important to me. I feel really good. After I speak to her, like, it's like a drug.

274
00:29:54.990 --> 00:30:19.050
Saraniah Aston: But I have to chase down my ex he refuses to like make a schedule with me. I don't think you can keep the schedule very well anyways but so I'm just going to have to call whenever I can like whenever and not wait for someone for him to say yes, she's available. I'm just gonna start calling

275
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.210
Saraniah Aston: Well, yeah.

276
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the Drudge like kind of have a sense of what's going on in his brain.

277
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:31.410
Saraniah Aston: It's called a Mr. Nice Guy It's a synthetic marijuana

278
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. It's not like spice, though, right.

279
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.200
Saraniah Aston: It is nice. Oh dear. Oh, yeah.

280
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.400
Saraniah Aston: And it's been about 66 years now.

281
00:30:49.650 --> 00:31:00.270
Saraniah Aston: And his brother to his brothers losing it mine alone. My ex isn't at all but but he's not functioning. I mean, that doesn't have a job and

282
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.130
Saraniah Aston: Trust.

283
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:04.500
Saraniah Aston: Me.

284
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:05.940
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

285
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I see that really broad sweeping sequence of things. If I'm way off, you just let me know. Obviously I'm I'm overgeneralizing is it basically this

286
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to get my self centered. I need to know how to meet life on life's terms. So I can hold a job so that I can get the $50,000 so I can get my daughter here.

287
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That basically it

288
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.800
Saraniah Aston: Nicely. Yeah.

289
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, I'm in it with you.

290
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.340
Let's do this.

291
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, a good rehearsal. It sounds like his mom because if we can figure out how to stay. How to stay in a calm body around craziness and we can handle some nut job boss, we can get through this. Right. We get because this is a probably one of the more intense people, his mom.

292
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:56.580
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

293
00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can handle that and stay in a relaxed body regulate but the body, which means the brain is going to work better, or in the body, it's going to work better, faster, stronger, I'm going to remember my skills that we're going to be learning in here. Okay.

294
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You just stay regulated and then we can use those same skills. We can use them at work.

295
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know this timing is just really a real stinker. Right now I'm

296
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:29.760
Saraniah Aston: Doing so that like skills so that I can keep myself going into that place that that difficult.

297
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking now. You didn't tell me what your work history is i don't i don't know if you ever have any

298
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: History of

299
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.560
Saraniah Aston: Fashion styles.

300
00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember what you did. My

301
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:53.190
Saraniah Aston: I have a small business that right now is doing absolutely nothing but I sell clothing online. I have inventory and I have

302
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.080
Saraniah Aston: I

303
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.230
Saraniah Aston: Am an ambassador on posh mark.

304
00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that

305
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My yeah yeah

306
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.310
Saraniah Aston: I remember that.

307
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:03.420
Saraniah Aston: My initial assessment.

308
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.770
Saraniah Aston: Is besides that I'm going to be looking for a job, just like

309
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.360
Saraniah Aston: Those like fun in a cafe around here that I really like.

310
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.650
Saraniah Aston: And making crazy tips so

311
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the one I already knew about the the the piece of the fashion part. I remember that distinctly

312
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To do with right now. I'm asking about whether you've ever

313
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: lost a job or there was such such tension in the workplace that you kind of throw your hands up and walked off and just like can't deal

314
00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:38.790
Saraniah Aston: So many times

315
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. That's my question. I just wanted to know that part. Okay, so we're on to something, if we can, if we can find a way

316
00:33:46.680 --> 00:34:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To be in a relaxed body. In other words, self regulate around people that are calling names judging impatient rude, any number of the things, those negative behaviors around us. If we can kind of keep you in a regulated body around this.

317
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That will keep the job if you want the job. In other words, when you're ready to leave on your terms, not because it's too emotionally intense but rather two week. Notice one week notice on your terms you'll leave when you're darn ready to go.

318
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because this person is just, it's too much.

319
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:25.710
Right.

320
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.500
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's it.

321
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got an idea. We've got cafe timings really just dude really right now.

322
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.480
Yeah.

323
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.700
Saraniah Aston: That will make anybody to press

324
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I have to my life. Yeah, I got you. Okay, so your business, your business is online.

325
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.810
Saraniah Aston: It's on posh Mark Yeah.

326
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.270
Saraniah Aston: When your hand and I blog.

327
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.540
Saraniah Aston: On Instagram. I'm I do photo blogging.

328
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:08.550
Saraniah Aston: I have two pages on Facebook and one is for fashion and one is for modeling I promote models and eventually

329
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.120
Saraniah Aston: I'll charge to do promotions.

330
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:21.990
Saraniah Aston: So I'm really into business, but I know that I need a paycheck as well. Something steady

331
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Money. Yeah, in the past.

332
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: In the past was all your money going to drugs.

333
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.540
Saraniah Aston: All my money was going to drop. Yes.

334
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just checking in. So if there is an income coming in. I'm just asking because sometimes people have co occurring things going on where they also like to gamble. They also like some some pornography and money's still leaking and other places or they have also those

335
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, food compulsive behaviors. There's other compulsivity components. And I just want to check in and see

336
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it is it. Are we on track with the treatment or we go okay, we're going to do this. But then if I if I ignore this other piece. And I'm like, wait, because, I mean, maybe there's a sex addiction to how do I know I gotta ask my questions. Otherwise, I'll never know.

337
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:25.260
Saraniah Aston: Actually, honestly, I've got one of those. I'm pretty much

338
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.630
Saraniah Aston: Like a blank.

339
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.110
Saraniah Aston: empty bank account, ready to be filled up

340
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So if money's coming in and you're stable on the buprenorphine and you and I are continuing to work together. It's a reasonable assumption that you can put it in an actual bank account or you like under the mattress kind of go

341
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.520
Saraniah Aston: For first trillion good matches and

342
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you don't have a checking account. Not yet.

343
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.340
Saraniah Aston: Not yet, but I will get one.

344
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason you don't have anything to do with outstanding fees to the bank.

345
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Any little it's just it

346
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:26.310
Saraniah Aston: Just has to do with I NEED A NEW MEXICO ID. And when I went to get one before they did couldn't find me in the system, nor like via social security number, they couldn't find me either. So I had to get a

347
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:33.480
Saraniah Aston: Water bill in my name and do a bunch of things. And I just lagged on it and

348
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.970
Saraniah Aston: I need to get my

349
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.850
Saraniah Aston: Tinker, okay.

350
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This is actually is. Are you feeling comfortable or uncomfortable talking about these very logistic types of tasks are you

351
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:53.100
Saraniah Aston: Good for me, actually it wakes up parts of my brain and it makes me want to do things.

352
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.650
Saraniah Aston: Every time we talk. I always end up wanting to do something with something else.

353
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.110
So,

354
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep going then.

355
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.480
Saraniah Aston: We're figuring out my life. Okay.

356
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

357
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.570
Saraniah Aston: We're getting

358
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting a little tasks organized so we're tracking backwards, right, we kind of we did the broad stroke. We looked way back

359
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And we put it into big chunks of effort and now we're doing. We're looking really closely as if, as if the map are looking at little details like this. Now we're looking really close. And what I heard you say is I need my new mexico ID. And I think I also heard

360
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something couple tasks that the you call it, it's not DMV you guys call it something else. I don't know what y'all call it, but it's always sounds, we're going to hear it.

361
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not to bother me at motor vehicles its motor vehicle department is something I like you guys call it something funny over there. But anyway.

362
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to present documentation to prove you are who you are.

363
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:56.910
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

364
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the two or three things that they absolutely have to have

365
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.100
Saraniah Aston: They have to have a bill.

366
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:26.640
Saraniah Aston: In my name, which is waiting for me at the water company, I just have to get up, which means I need my mom to take me to pick it up because there's no buses here. There's no taxis. There's nothing. And eventually, I'm going to get just a clunker car like get around. Um,

367
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.000
Saraniah Aston: So that

368
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I ask you something about the water bill. I know this might seem picky, but I have one of these brains that like focuses on minutia.

369
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's useful sometimes it's like so annoying to people.

370
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The water bill itself when you present it to to the DMV. Do they care how long your name has been in it. They want to see one month. They don't care, just one

371
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Bill, they just need one. Okay, cool. What else do they want to see.

372
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.220
Saraniah Aston: Um, I think that's actually yeah just just that and

373
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: How much does it cost.

374
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.570
Saraniah Aston: About $25

375
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so $25

376
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And the probably take your picture. Yeah.

377
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:14.760
Saraniah Aston: Don't

378
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Take any tests or anything. Right. You know,

379
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:23.550
Saraniah Aston: Actually, well, I should be able to get my driver's license. I took the driver's test the written test and I passed it.

380
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to get your driver's license. I

381
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.810
Saraniah Aston: Really do. Yeah.

382
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll rewind and scratch that now we're at driver's license. That's exciting. Okay, you've already passed the test. So you've already done that.

383
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:46.350
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, so all I do is the same thing that I would do if I were just going to get the ID so I might as well, plus, plus, I have to drive a little car for

384
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.170
Saraniah Aston: Which I can do. Okay.

385
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So driver's license. I'm

386
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Water bill. They don't want anything else. Hmm.

387
00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:58.380
Don't

388
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't first want the ID.

389
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:08.970
Saraniah Aston: Moving how they have my passport. So I love that plus the water bill.

390
00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:14.460
Saraniah Aston: Plus they have my social social security number. So that's it.

391
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.730
Saraniah Aston: That's right. And they have

392
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Another you have the passport, you'll bring it

393
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.280
Saraniah Aston: Right. Um, okay.

394
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

395
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You've said there's no over. There's no left there's no nobody right now to make this possible to make this happen to mobilize go get that water bill and it's too many miles away. Right. Too far. Too far. Too far.

396
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:59.700
Saraniah Aston: Right. Got it. But if I talk to my mom and I told her, like, Mom, I need to get done. Okay, and the green the ions and check and make sure that she understands then she'll understand and we'll figure out a date and we'll do it. I just have to do that.

397
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's where your therapist could come in handy.

398
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can help with that, that I can help. Right.

399
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't drive in there.

400
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but we can get behind. What are the barriers. What are the obstacles right now.

401
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The timing is such that you're I'm guessing. Now, I'm guessing that your mom shows her overwhelmed business.

402
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: With this crazy making and all this anger. So whatever's going on with her and Travis.

403
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: She might just be at her her wits end

404
00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:49.770
Saraniah Aston: She is she so that's what she told me yesterday and I'm the one. She'll tell that to either way. Yeah, she told me she's like I'm book lose it. I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my job.

405
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.470
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, everything she yeah

406
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This might seem like a really out of the blue question, but I am a family therapist.

407
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Really. Yeah, that's my degree.

408
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.660
I'm a nerd.

409
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I love people love lots of people more, the merrier. I get along just come on let's all get together and talk

410
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's my comfort zone. I'm not nervous not intimidated by all of it all very excited because that's where the juices. That's where we get okay there's a dynamic going on between you

411
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mother that existed long before Travis got there. So that's what's getting in the way, maybe don't know but right now with Travis on that couch it just just blowing up so bad.

412
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And she may not. You know how sometimes you might feel as if like, I can't think straight. I can't problem solve, like I usually do.

413
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You may feel that way too.

414
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, although in her core, you know, your mother, the one that that right truly wants the best for you.

415
00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: She might not be available what's available is the warrior, the one that is in self protection mode that will scratch your eyes help basically if you give her one more thing to do. So she might be in just self preservation mode.

416
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.200
Saraniah Aston: And she totally with

417
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:11.640
Saraniah Aston: You. Yeah.

418
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it's hard to ask a favor from someone when they are barely like inhaling and exhaling themselves.

419
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.140
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, right. So,

420
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ever think, well, I have a therapist. I could meet with my mother as she was in, zoom, if I could get that app on her phone. We could be in here and I could have a professional kind of navigating a conversation so that I could get to Hey mom.

421
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: May I use the car is there gas can I pay for the gas. When would it be the least inconvenient, what would work for you. We could get there.

422
00:44:46.140 --> 00:45:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're in an interesting time because we can do an intervention when someone's in one home. Another person is in another state like me and another person's in another column, we can actually have a therapeutic moment when people are indifferent home so it doesn't have that intensity

423
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.190
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

424
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the same room.

425
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.300
Saraniah Aston: And they're even thought about that. Yeah, totally.

426
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, right. And most people forget that part. And I'm like, You know what, I can even do couples therapy when y'all are in a different state.

427
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:16.410
Saraniah Aston: Really cool right

428
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's why I mentioned it because it doesn't come to mind. We don't think of it, you know, because this is so different. We're still kind of acclimating to

429
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How has this has this even work. I don't even know, honestly. She's in Florida. How is this working, but it does work. It's pretty cool.

430
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:45.090
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it does. Actually, I was a total skeptic skeptic. But no, it's actually working. I was talking to my mom about you mostly was like, I didn't like her at first, but I love her now.

431
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.150
Saraniah Aston: I look forward to those days.

432
00:45:50.280 --> 00:46:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just have to hold on tight right well that initial judgment, you're not alone. A lot of people have that same thing. Everybody thinks I'm a you know a cheerleading convertible driving little bitch.

433
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's okay. I'm used to it.

434
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, but guess what, guess what, what do we know about the bitch. We know that that part of us that gets shit done. Doesn't it

435
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.310
Saraniah Aston: Yes.

436
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

437
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.400
Saraniah Aston: I want to be more that way. So,

438
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.370
Saraniah Aston: Exactly. I want to be that way.

439
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: See right here where it says anger. You know what screw her on a fighter. I can get this done. So all we gotta do is we got to take that juice. That's going to cleaning

440
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and organizing and we've got to just really look at your goal, which is, I've got to

441
00:46:48.450 --> 00:47:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to stay emotionally regulated so that I can have a calm conversation with my mother, she doesn't feel threatened, I need to use that car. She needs to know it's safe. And it's okay, I'm going to get that car back or jobs not in jeopardy from anything. I'm going to do.

442
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not. I'm gonna I'll give her money, maybe, I don't know what the details are on this. I just need to stay in a calm body. I can do this. I can have relaxed vigilance, I can channel this anger. I can see the difference between my mom's crazy behavior.

443
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.950
I can see the difference between her craziness and who I am.

444
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.890
There is a difference.

445
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You do not have to go crazy along with her. And that's the fight.

446
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:34.350
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

447
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's quiet that's between you and I, that's inside. That's a quiet like

448
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Head yeah like defiance. I will not go crazy with you inside. We just know it. And that is what we can channel we can turn it into I'm a fighter. What am I fighting for I'm fighting for my sanity and my peace of mind.

449
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.070
Saraniah Aston: And I can get

450
00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, and I can have a relaxed body.

451
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do this belly breathing at one of your talks about

452
00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because my brain will work better and I will remember my mom is doing the best she can. And although I don't like the word. She's saying she's scared. She's helpless. She doesn't know what to do and how to solve this problem.

453
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's all possible when you're in a relaxed body.

454
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.140
Saraniah Aston: Oh, both thinking clearly it seems

455
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, yep.

456
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

457
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.260
Saraniah Aston: Look at the big picture.

458
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.410
Saraniah Aston: When you can't see straight

459
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: History and so then you calm right in that relaxed peaceful space. And guess what she sees

460
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

461
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My daughter's acting differently. I'm not threatened. Now, I noticed my eyes. I can look at her, my body's turning. I'm not as threatened, I can look at her.

462
00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. She's my daughter is not coming at me with defensiveness, she's not. She's just sitting there calmly breathing with that, that's so different. What is that now. She's curious.

463
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:07.380
Uh huh.

464
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe she starts to regulate too because we also have this thing called mirror neurons and we start to do what we see in front of us and we start to come to and all you did was brief.

465
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the brain came online. We're no longer hijacked by the amygdala, right.

466
00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're breathing and we're okay. We're okay because you know the distinction between mom's doing the best she can looks crazy. I know you stay define inside. I will not go there with her. I will not try to change her mind. I will stay in my own peace and my own quiet.

467
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: My fighting

468
00:49:52.740 --> 00:50:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And fighting for my sanity. I'm fighting to get my daughter back and this is my moment and you don't give it to anybody. Not to me not to mom out to some dude, not to some brother, not to some landlord. Nope. You, you just stay in there and not let that body right. Get out of being relaxed.

469
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I can feel my shoulders coming

470
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.260
Down.

471
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can feel my hands relaxing and slowly but surely getting a habit of doing it.

472
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The world can be completely unraveling and you stay in a relaxed state.

473
00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.830
Saraniah Aston: It's like The Matrix.

474
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:32.550
Fan

475
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.420
Saraniah Aston: We've just like

476
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You to remember it.

477
00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:39.720
And then

478
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.300
Saraniah Aston: Slowly

479
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So what a lot of times, because we are and will kind of bring it to a close, as point we're visual people we like, we take in a lot of information from what we see.

480
00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So the more that you put your stickies or a collage or something kind of cool around that tells you to do even one cycle or two cycles, MAYBE ONE IS OVER BY THE CLOSET says do belly breath once. How long does it take to do that. Watch.

481
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: TV did that take, we can do that before but our socks on got

482
00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A habit to do we do one of the closet. WE TO TO AT THE DOORS WE DO THREE right at the medicine cabinet. We do for before we go for a walk. We do five before we we turn the oven on we can play with it. This is your own place. What

483
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.070
Saraniah Aston: Is what is is that keeping yourself aware

484
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's doing so much. It's doing so much for

485
00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.580
Saraniah Aston: Us is doing more than just that.

486
00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.300
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

487
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I mean I can next time if I didn't already do it I thought already kind of gave you the science behind it.

488
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:58.920
Saraniah Aston: Oh, you did.

489
00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, but it's doing something for your brain to guess what it is changing tissue because what's up here. This mushy stuff our brain, it's much

490
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.220
Saraniah Aston: Hmm, we're

491
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing a whole neuronal connection to I have this thought, Oh my gosh, I'll never watch. I'll never get my daughter. Wait, I do my breathing. I'm standing here at the oven have this negative cognition and I'm reading

492
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to my fourth one. And I noticed my body. Oh, my shoulders just dropped down, I noticed my my George is relaxed. I can sit with a negative cognition.

493
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I can have a relaxed body. And now, guess what, I just thought of. I just, problem solved. I just remembered what am I fighting for. I need to eat healthy meal. I'm going to finish making this meal.

494
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to spend time in fueling this negative thought I'm going to go look at my list of things to do. What do I need to do I need to eat right sleep right

495
00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to hydrate. What else do I need to do. Um, I need to check my agenda, make sure I keep my appointments water bill water bill. I need to schedule something with my mom wonder when a good time would be your brain is going to work better.

496
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.680
Mm hmm.

497
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot emphasize how important this breathing is

498
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Go on a sticky frenzy. Let's get him everywhere you get in the habit of doing that, guess what's going to happen when a crisis happens

499
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And someone's coming at you with ugliness name calling distressed. You will remember that's all we need. We just need you to remember the breath. From there, we can have access to this relaxed body.

500
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: All these other things will come online. You'll just let your brain do its job. They have the campus will provide you, those, those memories of the things that we're going to do.

501
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The, the cognitive reframes like I'm a fighter. What am I fighting for will be able to remember those those pieces. But first, we've got to be able to remember the breath.

502
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have some other technique down the line. You can use that one. But for now, let's give this a try getting a habit of it. Do it the first time you wake up and put them, put them all over you get in the habit.

503
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:09.120
Okay.

504
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.910
Saraniah Aston: Right, okay.

505
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another time to meet

506
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do we have here.

507
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.210
Next week, looks like I scheduled someone else.

508
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What up,

509
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any way you would be awake at

Saraniah Aston: Um, you mean from talking to you.

521
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just didn't hear just during this hour. What did you, what did you catch

Saraniah Aston: Oh, it just, oh, it's, it's almost like a like a reset, reset my day current, you know,

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.140
Saraniah Aston: I feel recharged recharged
