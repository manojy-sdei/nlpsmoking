Trisha G: I've been at the hospital with him all night. And today, and I have to go back at 330 to take them to another doctor to see if they're going to have many more.

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.540
Trisha G: Give him some different manner or something, cuz he's already on this shots and and the myth that the shots are helping, not the meds. I don't know.

8
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.470

10
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.600
Trisha G: His own he has a lot of mental problems.

11
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.790
Trisha G: I said yes. And as he gets older, he gets younger age wise, like in his mind.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Person to help you with him once in a while so that you can get some good

26
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.930
Trisha G: He won't he won't go along with it is like he qualifies for full time.

27
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.550
Trisha G: When I even suggested to him. He gets up out of whack over and starts settle just getting real angry and stuff.

28
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what you're doing to take care of yourself when you have

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Little, little reprieves moments for yourself.

30
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.840
Trisha G: I just relax you know

31
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.820
Trisha G: That's the thing I need the most

32
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:46.260
Trisha G: when ever I get a break from him. I'll just, I'll go and lay back and relax. Yeah. Be quiet, you know, no noise.

33
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No noise.

34
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.830
Trisha G: Yeah, I can't because he's pretty noisy. He don't he doesn't never stopped talking

35
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.620
Trisha G: He's constantly talking to someone. I don't know who

36
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: does he sleep, does he sleep at night.

37
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.670
Trisha G: Well, like you said, most of the night. Not all night. Usually, but most of it, cuz he's awesome with that they do make him go to sleep at night.

38
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorrow. No.

39
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay, this is a good place for you to be able to have a release. You know what I mean.

40
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

41
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's got to be a hard situation for you.

42
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.570
Trisha G: It is, and I just some not. I don't think I'm qualified really

43
00:03:43.680 --> 00:04:01.650
Trisha G: Because I don't know how they handle a lot of things like you know it's the police bring him home all the time when he gets out illegals wandering around, and they bring home they already got to adulterous passing things on him for my neighbors around here and

44
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.260
Trisha G: I don't know. I just know how to do it really

45
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.190
Trisha G: Just trying

46
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.780
Trisha G: To like this.

47
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, just doing the best that you can.

48
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he doesn't want anybody to or he's uncomfortable or doesn't like somebody else coming in the house to help you. Yeah.

49
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.880
Trisha G: What, no one else here and

50
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:45.000
Trisha G: He's you know he's 34 years old so he's a grown man, but it's like a child. And I'll explain it yes mentality of like a 1213 year old right now that

51
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.450
Trisha G: So he's pretty difficult, you know,

52
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.710
Yeah.

53
00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, through this whole thing we've got to figure out a way for you to be able to get some kind of self care going on to, you know,

54
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I know this isn't

55
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.010
Trisha G: I'm trying to talk him into. Let me get somebody to come help me every now and then.

56
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.280
Trisha G: I know he's starting to listen more about it, but

57
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.990
Trisha G: I think maybe eventually he'll let me do that, you know,

58
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.010
Yeah.

59
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.490
Trisha G: Yes, to agree to it or they won't do it.

60
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:39.390
Trisha G: The police tell me that I should go to the courts and I don't know what they need. They say, claiming incompetent or something, I don't know, so that he doesn't get more trouble.

61
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.870
Trisha G: I don't know what that is, but I know

62
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just where you go and take basically like

63
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like power over power of attorney over his care over what he does. And so he wouldn't really have a say so in

64
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some, yeah. You just kind of take away that

65
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.300
Trisha G: Right for him to do.

66
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.540
Trisha G: He, he is already appointed a treatment guardian and pay for his disability check

67
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.260
Trisha G: So he doesn't control any of that, or neither do I. It's all done by them.

68
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.540
Trisha G: All I gotta do is really just take care of me, you know,

69
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.940
Trisha G: That's the hard sometimes because he's stubborn.

70
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And look what it's doing to you, you know, yeah.

71
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.680
It's because

72
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.770
Trisha G: I was gone, you know, and I was in prison for a couple of years and

73
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.910
Trisha G: He wasn't this bad when I left and

74
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.800
Trisha G: I don't know. So I don't know how to just jump in there and

75
00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:02.250
Trisha G: Take over everything work right you know the sees a lot worse than in so I'm not really normal to do that.

76
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is there anybody that you that you could talk to and get information friend that can kind of who took care of them. Are you were in prison.

77
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:26.670
Trisha G: Yeah, my mom took care of him. But she's 90 years old and she said she can't do it. The more she scared of me. So she said, I'm gonna have to do all of it now. So she was just waiting for the day it out so she could

78
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.070
Trisha G: That we have in you know

79
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In

80
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:37.320
Trisha G: Which I don't blame her. She's the old and she's really little, and she He scares me because he's a big guy, you know,

81
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.390
Trisha G: Yeah, and when he gets mad.

82
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:47.370
Trisha G: Like he broke all my windows out of my home twice already. And that scares her when he does stuff like that.

83
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.040
Trisha G: She thinks he's gonna hurt her, but

84
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.730
Trisha G: I DON'T THINK HE WILL THAT SHE THINKS HE WILL so

85
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think

86
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.900
Trisha G: I don't think he's like violent towards will hurt one of us.

87
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.190
Trisha G: Will destroy a lot of things he destroys a lot of stuff.

88
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.380
Trisha G: I mean, in the home that

89
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:23.550
Trisha G: He has paid is to get it replaced, that's not the answer. You know, it's just replacing it. I'm trying to get him on the right man. So that is because for under control what he does.

90
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So do. How did you get them to the hospital.

91
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:42.210
Trisha G: And I had a friend, give us a writing job so I don't have a car that I can go, but she she started by her and she just takes us and justice out whenever he like that or else I'll call it an evidence. Sometimes I

92
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.330
Trisha G: Call the police and they call an ambulance. I don't

93
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.300
Trisha G: Like they'll sit, they'll kind of see what's going on. And then they call

94
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.830
Trisha G: It's called

95
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.410
Trisha G: She's like an Uber is like an emergency care for people that are Maria

96
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got to go back up to the hospital at 330

97
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:23.790
Trisha G: Yeah well to a doctor's office and I'm just gonna, it's a different doctor, they're going to see about a Smith, maybe they can get him on something different because he takes like the hell is all shot twice a month and it takes like five other pills to but not during the trip anymore.

98
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.440
Trisha G: It's like you don't hurry take anything

99
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:37.140
Trisha G: I guess he's getting immune to it. I don't know what why it doesn't work. I really don't understand if I check all those IV not cold.

100
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I'm sure you would.

101
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.750
I wish.

102
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wish that there was an easy answer, you know, or solution for

103
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, for this because it weighs on you know on you emotionally, mentally and physically to yeah you know

104
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Having to walk through this stuff and not having, you know, really good self care really put you you know at a higher risk.

105
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.300
Trisha G: For here.

106
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, for sickness for flus for all that stuff to you know

107
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.650
Yeah.

108
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.650
So, Tommy.

109
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.040
Trisha G: Is

110
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:35.250
Trisha G: Here. So that's one of the big reasons why I'm trying to stay clean and do good myself is just saw before him, you know, you don't have anybody and

111
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.020
Trisha G: You know, he needs me.

112
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what about what you need.

113
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.340
Trisha G: I don't know. I really, there's nothing I need really

114
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.520
Trisha G: I don't have a relationship with anyone, or I really don't have friends so

115
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.350
Trisha G: My life is pretty much just whatever he needs right now.

116
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

117
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me how your recovery has been going

118
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.220
Trisha G: It's going good on that.

119
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:25.410
Trisha G: Doctor kindle up my dosage. That's another thing I was gonna see if you could do me a favor and we're, we're done. If you could have

120
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.320
Trisha G: I don't know how to get ahold of her. I asked the other lady, because I need to get my boxing and

121
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:42.750
Trisha G: She hasn't renewed my prescription. I think it's because I didn't make it to the group, yesterday I called and told them what I was whereas that was going on that. I don't know. She got the message. You're not

122
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.880
Trisha G: left a message, she never got it. So I don't know.

123
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, let me see.

124
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I can initiate that right now. Okay.

125
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kindle.

126
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.100
Trisha G: Because I'm already out of my, my, the ones that I had and

127
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.130
Trisha G: I don't know. It just makes it harder on me when I don't have nothing.

128
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.630
Trisha G: To help me with this is for notice

129
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you spell your last name, Patricia

130
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.670

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, and they see

132
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they have you had any issues with your meds.

133
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.420
Trisha G: I know after she up a dosage I'm it's working pretty good enough.

134
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:02.700
Trisha G: She put me on 12 milligrams of, you know, instead of eight and I say you

135
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.860
Trisha G: Know, instead of one.

136
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.530
Trisha G: And it's working better now.

137
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. Yeah.

138
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.440
Trisha G: I haven't had any problems there.

139
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.660
Trisha G: Today I haven't taken any bit because I ran out.

140
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:20.760
The

141
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.800
Trisha G: Referral or not. I don't know if you will, because I didn't make it through.

142
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably, yeah, that's usually kind of how they do it. If you aren't making it to

143
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To grow or

144
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.540
Trisha G: Lot did

145
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.490
Trisha G: I guess they had already finished because I just missed when I logged in.

146
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:43.980
I think

147
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

148
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I put it in the two places that

149
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need to put it

150
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:55.950
Trisha G: Thank you.

151
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that they can get that handled for you.

152
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It helps with anxiety and depression, too.

153
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.170
Trisha G: Yeah, it does. Especially my anxiety.

154
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you didn't make it to group last night because your son was in the hospital. Yeah.

155
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.800
Trisha G: Well, we were up at the hospital. He wasn't admitted or anything.

156
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:33.570
Trisha G: I gotta write up there. And I just, they were deciding what to do. They were up there for hours, but then they send us back home and said, give me a name of a new doctor, I gotta take him to to see if they can figure something out.

157
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:42.960
Trisha G: Because he's in and out of the hospital, all the time and they really can do a lot in there anyhow. It just try my numerator, whatever, you know,

158
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

159
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:57.630
Trisha G: So if I don't have to admit him. I don't, because there's it really doesn't make a difference whether he's here getting treated or they're just like a stick and monetary more there.

160
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you do when they when's the last time he was admitted

161
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:08.160
Trisha G: It's been like, oh, I'd say a couple of months now, since he was

162
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.100
Trisha G: He's been in there 18 times this year already

163
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.740
Trisha G: It's crazy.

164
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a lot for someone to handle

165
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.820
Yeah.

166
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:27.300
Trisha G: And so like is also often I don't even have to give this information they already have it all.

167
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good, so you don't have to keep repeating yourself.

168
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.640
Trisha G: Yeah, it's a

169
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.730
Trisha G: Mental like it's for

170
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:44.730
Trisha G: Hospitals for mental illness and for I think drug rehab too so

171
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.090
Trisha G: It's good, you know, it's a good hospital.

172
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:54.660
Trisha G: He goes to that one and the one domino pestle called the peak and they're pretty good to

173
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.010
Trisha G: That sounds too far. I don't have a car. So I can go to hell.

174
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

175
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, Trisha, you're going through an awful lot right now.

176
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, you know, with not having

177
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know a way for

178
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any kind of release. You've got to be able to

179
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To engage in something to keep your own sanity through this whole thing, you know.

180
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:25.920
Yeah.

181
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.470
Trisha G: I feel better now. I know that I let all my troubles out on you for you.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's a piece of it.

190
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:22.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is, you know, you have to be able to check in and to be able to handle it. And if you are

191

192
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.890
Trisha G: All right, I'll remember that I wasn't sure if I should call a little bit there.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:10.230
Trisha G: 430 or five is my quiet quite a time when he's like real successful young stuff and he is tired. That's when I can usually do something, just relax or whatever.
