He's okay.

26
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:59.370
Windy Borjas: They got tested and everybody in his pod came back negative. This was like this, a couple days ago and they called and they put them on emergence be locked down because they have two people in all of a sudden

27
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.400

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.930
Windy Borjas: I don't know.

30
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.410
Windy Borjas: But now I don't know. I mean, they're already on lockdown. They put them on your time though. You can't call throughout the day, like

31
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.440
Windy Borjas: On even number days he comes out once or twice a day.

32
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.760
Windy Borjas: morning and night, and then an odd number of days become that one.

33
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.650
Windy Borjas: Now that they had people test positive thought. I don't know if they're gonna lock them down.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, even while in the program. Matthew still been

41
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.740
Windy Borjas: My life.

42
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:24.960
Windy Borjas: I started it around the time I started the Methadone program and I struggling with it. Ever since I was clean off of it. I had finally gotten the cleaning away and everything, but

43
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.420
I

44
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Knew that

45
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you use anything after last weekend.

46
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So your last few spills over the weekend.

47
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the doctor knows

48
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.180
Windy Borjas: Oh, yeah.

49
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, so tell me what was going on. What were your thoughts.

50
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What were your thoughts on what

51
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What results to the best coping.

52
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.950
Windy Borjas: Because that's the only coping mechanism. I know.

53
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.080
Windy Borjas: Trying to learn new one. But that's what I've known for over a decade.

54
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:31.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah so that that's exactly helps me to see, okay, what can I do to help support you and learning more coping tools because this addiction.

55
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:41.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With strong right. It's not just this mine thing to knowledge, your brain SMB signals to you, your body is being activated through all of this.

56
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These anxious thoughts. I remember from our bio psychosocial how much love you have to your fiance.

57
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:57.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that that was your primary stress, then. And so now, two months later, the stresses intensified to with everything that's going on with dependent, you have to worry about your health.

58
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now hearing that your Fiance's health is also being compromised. So I want to start off by saying that

59
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:14.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want you to reach out to me too. Okay, when you when you realize that you need more coping strategies, go to the virtual clinic and say you want to schedule an appointment.

60
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:24.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With me. All right, get some therapy, get some things in place know it's easier said than done these things don't just happen overnight.

61
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:32.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're not going to just evolve into this person that automatically knows how to insert coping skills. I'm very realistic when it comes to that.

62
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:45.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I also want to give you options because what I heard you say is that I use math because I felt there were no other options to help me deal with this. Is that accurate when I heard

63
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.590
Windy Borjas: You heard it, but I mean more

64
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.320
Windy Borjas: Like I felt about

65
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.110
Windy Borjas: At that moment that

66
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.470
Windy Borjas: That's what I needed to take

67
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.360
Windy Borjas: What I was feeling

68
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.320
Yeah.

69
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:12.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Describe that feeling because it helps to say it out loud so that you can you can really understand what you're working with. So what were you feeling

70
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Empty

71
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I can see that you're still very vulnerable and thinking about everything that's going on.

72
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.410
Windy Borjas: By the rules kind of guy.

73
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.070
Windy Borjas: In the middle of everything and

74
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.510
Windy Borjas: And who's done anything can happen at any given minute

75
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.740
Windy Borjas: Everything going on. I don't know if because

76
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.230
Windy Borjas: Somebody that's effective

77
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.810
Windy Borjas: They already quarantine them for two weeks and nobody even knew they didn't even know

78
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:33.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sounds like there's some frustration to that they didn't pick up sooner on the fact that there was someone that had the virus. Now your fiance may be compromised because

79
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:45.060
Windy Borjas: I just don't understand it because like they have just told everybody they have a negative. Like, how does that, how does that happen. I mean,

80
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.460
Windy Borjas: Within a day or two. How could somebody, all of a sudden positive for it.

81
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.690
Windy Borjas: Okay, he said there was no people like yes, they came from somewhere.

82
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.150
Windy Borjas: But like

83
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.460
Windy Borjas: I mean, he's healthy and all, but it's not about that.

84
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.510
Windy Borjas: Now he's locking it down 24 seven

85
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:17.460
Windy Borjas: If they decide to lock down. No phone, no nothing is TV.

86
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.200
Windy Borjas: TV.

87
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.710
Windy Borjas: Worry about how

88
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Lots of uncertainty.

89
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How old is your daughter.

90
00:09:52.650 --> 00:10:00.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: stressors. When do you know your your concern about how he's doing what's, what's his name I rather referred to him by his name and saying he

91
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Pick up Jacob.

92
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:26.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah you're wondering how Jacob is doing, you know, what is this health is well being just being isolated and on top of that, the worried for him. You also have your concerns about what does this look like for me for me for my daughter us I'm hearing a lot of uncertainty and worries.

93
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:27.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yep.

94
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.740
Windy Borjas: I can go home, my family because of the pandemic, they have

95
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.840
Windy Borjas: Nobody

96
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Speaks of for you can't see your family. Do you live, it's just you and your daughter this together.

97
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.470
Yeah.

98
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.900
Windy Borjas: her grandparents are here. They're my in laws. I don't know.

99
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a lot.

100
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:16.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a lot to try to manage in the midst of whole global pandemic, whereby your own health. Your precious baby cells and now this

101
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when there's anxiety.

102
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:32.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We tend to adapt to certain unhelpful patterns of thinking to make our anxiety. Even worse, to tell me what sounds more like you

103
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:44.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, there are people that they do fortune telling right so they predict this might happen and and they believe that their predictions are reality.

104
00:11:45.270 --> 00:12:03.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So they get so stuck in that there's people that do emotional reason reasoning where they feel because their emotions feel a certain way in must be the truth. So that leaves very little room for facts and information because all we can focus on is there filming.

105
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:14.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then there's certain people that they catastrophizing so something small because have been very big. It's like they blow things out of proportion.

106
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:28.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then there's people that do threat scanning rather just kind of looking for anything to kind of be very anxiety to something that can be not threatening that all Gill attached to it and say, yeah, this is threatened.

107
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By yeah you think that one.

108
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, because I'm

109
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.190
Windy Borjas: I'm very, I don't want to say paranoid, I guess.

110
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.620
Windy Borjas: I'm just very cautious.

111
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:45.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

112
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.660
Windy Borjas: gone through a lot of my life. So I learned that

113
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.100
Windy Borjas: If it looks bad. To me, it probably is bad.

114
00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I guess.

115
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so, you know, don't let things that

116
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:15.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We all we have anxiety and gravitate to those forms of thinking. So it sounds like it's a little bit about right scanning, like you mentioned, as well as emotional reasoning.

117
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:33.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reasoning so what I heard you say if I feel that is that the must be terrible. So you allow your emotions to lead your thought process, hence why that very scary situation of fear, worry major emotional to the point of letting us the math.

118
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:52.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, that that's something to be mindful of that right now. I'm doing emotional reason. And so if I can escape to get out of this and do other things aside from just really focusing on my emotions. I might be able to stay sober.

119
00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:01.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what you want to do is clean to the facts right because there's so much uncertainty right now. So focus on what you do know.

120
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:17.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that makes you feel powerful, it gives you a hope on top of things that you can control. So you do know okay he's been quarantined. So he separated from those people and I heard you say earlier, he's healthy

121
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:33.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He said, but that doesn't matter. So what I heard was that was your rational brain trying to remind you, and encourage you that he's healthy but your emotional brain just pushed it out the way and then focused on everything that's not working.

122
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: During these times, the most important thing to keep in mind is that he's healthy

123
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:52.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Because yeah, he may not have TV for a week. But if he gets to live another week. You know, I think that's way more significant and and being able to watch TV. Right.

124
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.090
Windy Borjas: It's not

125
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.230
Windy Borjas: About like

126
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.960
Windy Borjas: Watching TV. It's about it how you cope

127
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, how does. I know.

128
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.950
Windy Borjas: All right now.

129
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.990
Windy Borjas: The same way I do

130
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.490
Windy Borjas: Like a four by four with another guy.

131
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.210
Right.

132
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

133
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.100
Windy Borjas: Are you watching TV or anything like that.

134
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.590
Windy Borjas: I just know here.

135
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.510
Windy Borjas: here yet.

136
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:48.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of his behaviors than his health right now because you feel comfortable knowing that he say you're thinking he might just do something that's not smart in there, huh. Yep.

137
00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:02.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is, this is going to be something hard for you to swallow and adjust, you have no control over what you'll do

138
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:04.860
I know

139
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.630
Windy Borjas: The worst part.

140
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:11.760
Windy Borjas: I want

141
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even if he was out

142
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right in your living room. Right.

143
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:37.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You still will not have control over how he behaves, you could speak to him, encourage him to tell them all the things that you feel more locate him by the end of the day, people still make the choice.

144
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in this uncertainty.

145
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can have more. What can I control my

146
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.640
Windy Borjas: Only thing I could control was just

147
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.750
Windy Borjas: Being there for him and

148
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.090
Windy Borjas: Nothing.

149
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:24.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm hearing a lot of what you can do to support him right so the focus seems that it's been a lot about being that support to him and in trying to be that strong source for him.

150
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:33.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Things like you forgot about you because you love him so much. Sounds like you're very much a protector.

151
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.470
Windy Borjas: How

152
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you protect you.

153
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.270
Windy Borjas: Making sure

154
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.450
Windy Borjas: My daughter's okay

155
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You feel okay right now.

156
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.170
Windy Borjas: I woke up today in and reading

157
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.980
Windy Borjas: I have nothing to say about that.

158
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I was a good

159
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:19.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The permitting of honey yourself in the midst of all of this negativity seeing some of the positive things that's working for you.

160
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The mother thing is maybe distraction. Will you do during the day with your daughter. How are you keeping busy throughout the day.

161
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.720
Windy Borjas: We go to her grandma.

162
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:37.170
Windy Borjas: Or with something rolled out like I've been organizing my house.

163
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.840
Windy Borjas: Trying to like put up right

164
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.140
Windy Borjas: Over that

165
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.460
Windy Borjas: Kind of hectic and loud. He just, like, come over here to

166
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.270
Windy Borjas: Unwind and watch TV.

167
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.950
Windy Borjas: All right, or

168
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.650
Windy Borjas: Whatever.

169
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:00.780
Windy Borjas: Whatever I

170
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:12.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, those are things that's within your control that routine that's going to help keep you grounded. What about eating, sleeping and exercise and how's that been for you.

171
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.210
Windy Borjas: Problem.

172
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.100
Windy Borjas: Even before I

173
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.520
Windy Borjas: get my mind off.

174
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to I

175
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:48.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wanted to start some basics with you for how to manage anxiety. It may seem silly, but these things have proven to help increase modes of calmness. Okay.

176
00:19:49.290 --> 00:20:00.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's called belly breathing and the significance of it is that when you're stressed and over time it it manifests itself within the body.

177
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:10.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's why it's hard for you to sleep and then your mind that you said I can't get my mind out of it. So right now, your body is an auto stress mode.

178
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:29.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You wake up after known night. It's like autopilot. But it's autopilot of stress and so your days probably look like if something goes wrong. It's like what else, what else below. Everything is going wrong because it's like, your body has suppressed.

179
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:43.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Receiving anything that goes right so the belly breathing helps to get some carbon dioxide into the body, knowing that blood better to elevate the mood to picture.

180
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right. Don't want you to put one hand on your chest, one hand on your stomach.

181
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And just breathe and tell me

182
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which hand rises. First one hand on your chest.

183
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me which. Which hand do you notice rises. First, as you're breathing.

184
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I see it as your chest.

185
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:41.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that means that means you're doing shallow breathing. You're taking shorter breaths and that's what people tend to do when they're anxious. So we're going to learn how to read to our belly our belly.

186
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:54.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Breathing creates that carbon dioxide. I was telling you about. So you are going to do a deep inhale. Yes. And when you exhale, slow, slow.

187
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:15.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's how you want the breathing. You want your belly to rise. When an inhale your belly to deflate. When you exhale, you wanted to continue to do this. Whenever you will activate it with stress because this is a commie recognition to your brain.

188
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:22.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To say, Okay, let's get out of this auto stress unless activate some calmness for Wendy

189
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.140
Windy Borjas: Okay.

190
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't need works if you apply it.

191
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.500
Windy Borjas: Is it kinda like how dominate does

192
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.400
The

193
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.980
Windy Borjas: Don't even know what it's called.

194
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I heard

195
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She does a lot of like yoga and mindfulness stuff. So I'm pretty sure that's a part of

196
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.640
Windy Borjas: It. She calls it finding

197
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:45.240
Out.

198
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.000
Windy Borjas: How to keep fit and stuff.

199
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.880
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I am. I am even just that breath I took. Now did help

200
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.270
Windy Borjas: I'm still trying to master, like how to

201
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.490
Windy Borjas: Take that moment.

202
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.420
Windy Borjas: In it. I mean, amid all the chaos.

203
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. Because that you have to continuously reapply it

204
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:27.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So every time you find yourself. I had to do that. Earlier today I was getting so stressed out about thinking about everything I had to do. And I realized I need to do my belly breathing and when I did it. I felt calm.

205
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:46.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I know it wasn't just I did a one time during the day I had to do it often throughout the day. So again, activate because remember your body's on that auto stress, your body has been so accustomed to being stressed out that it needs to be introduced two ways to become

206
00:23:48.810 --> 00:24:01.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it can seem a natural for you to stop in the middle of the day and put one hand on your chest and your belt loop. It might seem a natural for you start to feel the difference and okay I feel either

207
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:10.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Build a little more calm, you're going to want to do that because now it's it's creating a new sense of your body that you haven't felt in a long time.

208
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:29.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the next time you're stressed out with doing this and you're also scanning those thoughts that we talked about. So I'm going to share my screen with you so that you could see some of the things that I talked about. He told me that you think you're more of the arm.

209
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said threat scanning

210
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:40.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I thought, I thought to you have a little bit of the hypothetical worry. I'm gonna pull it up. See

211
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This yeah okay

212
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.070
Windy Borjas: Yeah. Hold on, let me go.

213
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:51.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

214
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.440
Windy Borjas: Okay. All right.

215
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:59.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, no problem. Alright, so I know so no talking but now you get to kind of see up close and zoom in for you. Alright, so I talked about the Brits scanning. Is that good enough for your resume anymore.

216
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.040
Windy Borjas: Yeah, no, I get it. Perfect. Okay.

217
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:08.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the threat scanning I talked about is you're assigning threat to harness events. Right, so

218
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You attach yourself to anything that's going on in your life. This has to be a threat. You said this is the one

219
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you tend to gravitate towards so this one is just using coronavirus as one but this applicable to any form of anxiety. So this looks like consciously or subconsciously, your mind is searching for a fear.

220
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:50.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so it went from below my fiance coronavirus to. Now, how did he react in jail to just all this stuff. So you see how in layers you have one stressor, and then you continue to build up on. Right. So things that could have been just harness events. Now you gravitated towards more

221
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:58.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Protection catastrophizing is when you make the worst case scenarios.

222
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:11.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This looks like you feel you feel different things and something that small becomes very big in this case this is this is a ballad worry so

223
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:20.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm not sure. And like you mentioned, I don't think this really applies to you in this situation, because these are things to definitely be worried about

224
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:28.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, but maybe you'll see this applied in other situations where something small. You may jump to worst case scenario.

225
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:40.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so you may call your mother, alas, you don't pick on me, like, Oh, she must hate you today. Those are people that do that catastrophizing they make something smart something big.

226
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:40.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

227
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.270
Windy Borjas: Know that window.

228
00:27:43.080 --> 00:28:01.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, the hypothetical worry, this is what I was thinking about with you because there were a lot of what ifs. Right. So these are people that I'm even though the word is normal, right. They think continue to come up with other situations that might be a possibility.

229
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:13.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's things that they have no control over. So like what we talked about when he said, You know, I'm afraid that because he doesn't have the math because you can't talk on the phone. He's going to act out

230
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if I was there I can help him right so what I heard was, what if you don't fix. And I also heard you feeling that you have some control and his behavior.

231
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.690
Windy Borjas: Yeah, that one call is more lately.

232
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so be mindful of this because the people that are hypothetical warriors there. What is is because of uncertainty. And so what what be helpful for you. Andy is to just stick to the facts. If he tells you that they have me on warranty. I'm separate from them just stick to that.

233
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:59.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't go to the whatever somebody does this in jail, and he is mad. He does agency don't allow yourself to go there.

234
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:24.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so any other things that come up as a stressor for you. You want to realize okay I'm doing my hypothetical worry I'm coming up with all these, what if scenarios. Let me just focus on the facts, what I really do know and do your deep belly breathing, all the way through.

235
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:42.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The emotional reason we talked about is when your mind tells you something and you feel like your emotion is reality. So if I'm scared. It must be because you know something bad's about happened.

236
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those are people that they just run off of their emotions alone.

237
00:29:51.870 --> 00:30:01.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's when you're addicted brain activates because the adult brain, the math is drawn to Wendy being her emotions.

238
00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the fortune teller and I don't think this applies to you, but let me know if I'm wrong, is when their mind interprets predictions as fast. So it's like, um,

239
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:28.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it's almost close to the what ifs, but it's just predicting that oh, that person. Well, you kind of did it because you said, I assume that the new person must have been the one that gave it to him.

240
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. So even though no one told you that's what it was. You kind of came up with your own prediction, because the reason you did that you want it to.

241
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:52.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: filter out some type of fact for you so that you can make sense of it all, because like you say, how does it go to know when everyone's negative, he's fine to now we have someone that's positive.

242
00:30:52.800 --> 00:31:00.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you you went into let me come up with a prediction to give myself some sense of make it make sense for me.

243
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:13.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So these are all different things, Wendy, and we all have the ability to have these type of traits, whenever we get is always

244
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:26.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. So I just want you to remind yourself of when you get to that hypothetical worried to realize okay i'm just going to focus on what I can control.

245
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:38.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Earlier you mentioned that gratitude I woke up this morning, you know, why would I complain to even start in the journal every day, just write down what you're grateful.

246
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.050
Windy Borjas: I've been trying to

247
00:31:44.820 --> 00:32:04.890
Windy Borjas: Get myself to like when I start feeling like I'm about sometimes my daughter. She uses her grandma. So I'm by myself a lot, and I've been for a while now, so it's it's nothing new. But if, when I started feeling like that. I try to tell myself just to go back over to my daughter.

248
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.510
Windy Borjas: Because I don't. He doesn't know any of that.

249
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.620
Windy Borjas: He has never ever seen me or her dad.

250
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.790
Windy Borjas: Do anything like that so

251
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.210
Windy Borjas: She's getting older.

252
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:29.460
Windy Borjas: He's like

253
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.560
Windy Borjas: He's like my rock.

254
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.190
Windy Borjas: Is my reminder of why I'm sober and why I don't

255
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.800
Windy Borjas: fall off the wagon and go back to my old way. Yeah.

256
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:49.710
Windy Borjas: But at the same time, I don't want, I mean, she's the baby because it should be your i mean

257
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.600
Windy Borjas: I support.

258
00:32:54.090 --> 00:33:01.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By you taking comfort in being able to say this by me and my fiance's past

259
00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:19.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, addiction, my child has never been exposed in witnessing us in our addiction. So I here with that to a sense of responsibility to make sure that she never has to it and

260
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:26.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that is a good motivator, right, knowing that, like you said, your protector.

261
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:27.570
Yeah.

262
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.890
Windy Borjas: I never was.

263
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.830
Windy Borjas: Okay, you don't want this. Okay.

264
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:03.270
Windy Borjas: Um,

265
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.520
Windy Borjas: I i

266
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.630
Windy Borjas: Came into the protective role.

267
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.820
Windy Borjas: After my

268
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.710
Windy Borjas: Day went to

269
00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:15.900
Windy Borjas: Jail.

270
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.470
Windy Borjas: Just because when I got my daughter back I

271
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.480
Windy Borjas: Mean I live alone with her. So I feel like

272
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.660
Windy Borjas: Like when she tells me she scared at night and I mean like

273
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.720
Windy Borjas: I can't go.

274
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.670
Windy Borjas: I guess, I guess.

275
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.240
Windy Borjas: train myself to

276
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:51.180
Windy Borjas: You only worrying about her, you know, I mean, or dad or

277
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.110
Windy Borjas: Everybody put me

278
00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:10.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, that's exactly what I was saying earlier, and I'm glad that you come, you have that that notion to realize I need the way I can best protect them is to better take care of myself.

279
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:26.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So already halfway there. You know, came in your open and honest about how you fail and you're motivated to not let it happen again. And you're open to learning the resources and skills so that you can continue working on you.

280
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.620
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I'm no good to her or him.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.290
Windy Borjas: They're just like I was reading something the other day.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:36:02.340
Windy Borjas: And even remember what it what they what it was called is about a narc narcissistic family cycle or something. Well,

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.770
Windy Borjas: With that they can I don't ask for it because I've never been one to ask for help, but I know they're there and

295
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.300

296
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.950
Windy Borjas: To answer the phone and

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.320
Windy Borjas: They're always there.

Windy Borjas: trigger a lot of

304
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.670
Windy Borjas: A lot of it is that I've been dealing with life.

305
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.690
Windy Borjas: Mm hmm.

306
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.700
Windy Borjas: I could just see like

307
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.150
Windy Borjas: A car frustration and I mean

308
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.040

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.310
Three.

312
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.430
Windy Borjas: That's not again. I mean,

313
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.300
She's a baby.

314
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.520
Windy Borjas: Out.

315
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.500

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be feeling. Yeah.

318
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.540
Windy Borjas: And not bad.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:45.930
Windy Borjas: I mean, he's in his in his dad was in prison before him, his brother, like this is a generation, the generation of

320
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.810
Windy Borjas: Just drama.

321
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.880
Windy Borjas: Me an addict alcoholic.

322
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.860
Windy Borjas: Con bit

323
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:56.280
Like

324
00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.250
Windy Borjas: It's just crazy like

325
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.200
Windy Borjas: The first time that like I'm trying to break my my cycle.

326
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.430
Windy Borjas: I mean,

327
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.890
Windy Borjas: Yeah, and I guess I

328
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:15.960
Windy Borjas: Focused on that and neglected, think about the fact that she has a whole other half.

329
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.330
Windy Borjas: That

330
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I

331
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.780
Windy Borjas: Know, I could put it, then

332
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.680
Windy Borjas: I worry about her a lot

333
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.490
Just because

334
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.410
Windy Borjas: If I, if I do or ever did.

335
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.690
Windy Borjas: Relapse like that's where she said, Nicole.

336
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.310
Windy Borjas: And her age, like in these times. Nowadays, like

337
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.740
Windy Borjas: Babies are staying baby to all their final fit in. I mean, like,

338
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.570
Windy Borjas: She already things that

339
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.600
Windy Borjas: You understand so much

340
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:48.990
And

341
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.060
Windy Borjas: I just feel like

342
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.020
Windy Borjas: From my past behaviors and

343
00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:01.500
Windy Borjas: And I mean situation. She's gonna do because of stupid.

344
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.890
Windy Borjas: Things that don't even involve her

345
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.380
Windy Borjas: She is affecting her

346
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.800
Windy Borjas: Will know how to change that are helpful.

347
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's an unspoken fear.

348
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:39.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: behind everything that you're saying you assess you say you're seeing those triggers that remind you of yourself that she's gone to your in laws and they remind me oh snap that other part is also an addict. So what is that unspoken fear and every time you see those behaviors.

349
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.660
Windy Borjas: If I don't eat her the right ways to cope

350
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.550
Windy Borjas: With the issues that I know she's going to have when she gets older.

351
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.890
Windy Borjas: Down the path I did. I mean, I'm not

352
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:06.750
Windy Borjas: Saying that I my path has been so bad I don't regret anything I've enjoyed my life I've had, I've had a great life but

353
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.860
Windy Borjas: I've also been through the clutter dealing with

354
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:19.920
Windy Borjas: Having to start from square one over and over and over again because droid everything with

355
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:23.730
Windy Borjas: Her

356
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:39.990
Windy Borjas: And I mean, go up and it's pretty much like I can predict that because I know that, what's going to happen is, those your repeat itself and those same things I see in her or that reason why I got it.

357
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Watching challenges presented itself and the anxiety.

358
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:58.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. There's a lot of children that grow up. I have pairs of addicts and they grow up so

359
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They are not added

360
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:06.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a lot of first generation sober people

361
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:17.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And with your ongoing commitment to be sober and to commit to sobriety. You might be exactly what you're wanting

362
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The person that breaks that cycle.

363
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're not responsible for breaking the cycle on his generation.

364
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're breaking your generational cycle.

365
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:37.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's too much responsibility to be responsible for your generation this generation that's a lot to unpack

366
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:53.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you think from you, what can we control. And what I'm hearing what he's doing a lot to me manage her environment to keep her child nurture safe and love.

367
00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:14.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those are key skills, that's necessary for building a thriving household or child also hear the fear of a mite relapse. Again, I'm hearing that is still on the back burner because of all the anxiety. And that's a very realistic worry

368
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:23.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What continued focus on the motivator and forget about trying to change that Emma's generation.

369
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:28.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wants you to come to a place of acceptance. That's, that's not your job.

370
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:43.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's why this may seem so unbearable. And that's why you've already predicted that she might end up like less because you're trying to take on so much responsibility. That's impossible.

371
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:46.710
Windy Borjas: All

372
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:51.420
Windy Borjas: The responsibility of keeping my daughter having still with

373
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.940
Windy Borjas: All the people that I have

374
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.610
Windy Borjas: Because that

375
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.410
Windy Borjas: Life.

376
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.670
Windy Borjas: Oh,

377
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

378
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.310
Windy Borjas: I know what

379
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:03.990
Windy Borjas: In my controller and what's not in my

380
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.020
Windy Borjas: I do feel like

381
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:16.050
Windy Borjas: Going My daughter definitely to cope with her triggers is. I mean, it's my job.

382
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.150
Windy Borjas: Mm hmm. How

383
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They doing when she has those tangents. Have you been helping her process we're called

384
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:28.710
Windy Borjas: Green.

385
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.430
Windy Borjas: Step back and calm down.

386
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.930
Windy Borjas: Her

387
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.450
Windy Borjas: Fingers

388
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.790
Windy Borjas: I don't know, I just thought even about breaking their cycles, I

389
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.300
Windy Borjas: Mean i know i i can

390
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.200
Windy Borjas: Make it

391
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.370
Windy Borjas: I also have my daughters that live there full time.

392
00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:57.240
Yeah.

393
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

394
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:08.340
Windy Borjas: I just think about them, they're older. You mean like their, their brains seem to have already been programmed

395
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.680
Windy Borjas: To that cycle.

396
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.350
Windy Borjas: About them.

397
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:16.980
Windy Borjas: Like a domino

398
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.880
Windy Borjas: My daughter watches them, you know, those are her older sister.

399
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:29.670
Windy Borjas: I just

400
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:39.570
Windy Borjas: I still ears to teach a child like all these things all these key point to everything.

401
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.980
Windy Borjas: Since the start because you can't get the

402
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not only for your

403
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a lot to Karen.

404
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:16.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you know that you can do is, whenever you're in their environment is give me an example of what you want me to do. Are you watching TV.

405
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:22.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because even if they are in an environment that

406
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You feel is not beneficial for them.

407
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:35.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can you can be that change. I'm always amazed when I hear different people's stories. People that are successful.

408
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:49.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They talked about the environments they grew up in and they still found a way to be successful. They still found a way to get education still find a way to be intellectual speakers and so

409
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're still hope.

410
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So hope.

411
00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I know right now some of the outcomes that are presented to you. It doesn't look as hopeful because you have

412
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:14.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The basics, which are very much important but there's still other things that you want. And so right now it's a lot of uncertainty and with that uncertainty is coming your worries.

413
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:26.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But think, okay, when I'm in that price and I'm just going to do the very best I can to give them an example of all the things I wish I saw growing up. And what I want for myself and this

414
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:34.020
Windy Borjas: Is just the thing though. Like when I was growing up, I was like,

415
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:35.760
Windy Borjas: I don't

416
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.350
Windy Borjas: Like is that my mom.

417
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.250
Windy Borjas: The most at anybody just because she liked my whole life instead of

418
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.250
Windy Borjas: Doing what I'm trying to do for my daughter like

419
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.000
Windy Borjas: I just remember

420
00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:03.270
Windy Borjas: Thinking of my mom, I want my daughter to think of me like a good mom always went to work or whatever.

421
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then

422
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.780
Windy Borjas: I think about when I became not it.

423
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.190
Windy Borjas: around that age like

424
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:18.150
Windy Borjas: Realizing. And finally, understanding what you know i mean what everything really was.

425
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.170
Windy Borjas: And ultimately, I guess that

426
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.200
Windy Borjas: That was where the resentment.

427
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.390
Windy Borjas: Came from with my mom.

428
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.860
Windy Borjas: Because when I became an addict. I would beat myself up.

429
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:36.840
Windy Borjas: All the time.

430
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.640
Windy Borjas: I was going

431
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.380
Windy Borjas: Because they could not understand why I was an addict, like how that happened.

432
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.700
Windy Borjas: In my mind, nobody has to my mom wasn't an addict or an alcoholic. Nobody

433
00:47:53.370 --> 00:48:00.690
Windy Borjas: And nobody told me anything until like yours, go into my life.

434
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.050
Windy Borjas: You're trying to find the right way.

435
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:20.160
Windy Borjas: To be honest and real with your kids, but also not its place or brutal

436
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.090
Yeah.

437
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:43.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a fine line because your mom day what it sounds like. You mentioned earlier that even though I relax. I try to protect my daughter so she doesn't see that so your mom thought she was doing the best parenting. She could because she did her

438
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Addiction from you.

439
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:56.220

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.280
Windy Borjas: Withdrawing from her.

444
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.220
Windy Borjas: End because

446
00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:27.180
Windy Borjas: Traits in her

447
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what what steps would you be willing to take so that that doesn't have to be the situation. You don't have to disappear because

448
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:45.690
Windy Borjas: A lot

449
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like you had an effective dose with the medication or you take hurry.

454
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:15.540

455
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:22.110
Windy Borjas: Be honest, I didn't really have anybody to help me with.

456
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.780
Windy Borjas: What I'm supposed to do or how I'm supposed to

457
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.500
Windy Borjas: Deal with life in general.

458
