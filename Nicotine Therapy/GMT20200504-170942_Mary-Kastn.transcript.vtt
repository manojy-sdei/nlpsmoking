2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
Mary Kastner: I'm Mary Kastner I'm the screw up today. Apologize for all this.

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.830
Daniel Mcquillen: Okay, you're not sure what

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.630
Mary Kastner: Is your video on

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.740
Daniel Mcquillen: Know, here it is.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.720
Mary Kastner: Okay, good, good. You know, you were on for nine o'clock, and I think for somehow when my schedule printed out it printed you out at the bottom of the list.

7
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.150
Mary Kastner: And I just took it at 1130, you know, so I apologize.

8
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.550
Daniel Mcquillen: Okay, I'm night.

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.200
Mary Kastner: I'm bringing it out from my

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.170
Mary Kastner: From my phone. Instead of, you know, from the bigger computer. And I think that kind of screws up the, I don't know.

11
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.780
Daniel Mcquillen: Graphics of it. Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
Mary Kastner: So anyway, what can I do for you today. You have been so patient

13
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.210
Daniel Mcquillen: I'm I'm interested in getting into your Suboxone program.

14
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.380
Mary Kastner: Oh, okay. Well, we can do that pretty easily.

15
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.100
Mary Kastner: Tell me why. Why do you need the Suboxone program.

16
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.900
Daniel Mcquillen: So,

17
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.870
Daniel Mcquillen: I have some issues and I broke my ankle pretty severely

18
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.660
Daniel Mcquillen: About seven years ago.

19
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.180
Daniel Mcquillen: Had a few surgeries on it.

20
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.850
Daniel Mcquillen: And I'm supposed to have another one. But I have several young children that I attend to, and

21
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:57.330
Daniel Mcquillen: I the what they had told me with the surgery is that I would be in faceted for, like, seven months from six to eight months or something.

22
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.630
Daniel Mcquillen: Where I would be mobile and then crutches on crutches and that would be pretty difficult for me right now with my young children.

23
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.740
Mary Kastner: Are you doing

24
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.620
Mary Kastner: Are you the sole parent or

25
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.730
Daniel Mcquillen: No I their mother is here, too, but she works. She works full time and I do to actually work and

26
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.400
Daniel Mcquillen: Just be really difficult to go through the surgery right now.

27
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.380
Daniel Mcquillen: But I also, I'm not sure if it's related to my ankle or not.

28
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.290
Daniel Mcquillen: Like I've been having some pretty bad back problems too.

29
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.150
Daniel Mcquillen: And I did go to my primary care for physician and

30
00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.220
Daniel Mcquillen: He prescribed me some like muscle relaxers and things and for for that. And this was probably maybe a year ago, year and a half ago, but

31
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.820
Daniel Mcquillen: I don't know, it seems to be an ongoing issue like

32
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.520
Daniel Mcquillen: I don't know how to explain it.

33
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.940
Daniel Mcquillen: Like when I when I wake up in the morning. I have a really, really hard time like getting out of bed and like

34
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.980
Daniel Mcquillen: as the day goes on, it kind of loosens up and I do feel better, but like in the morning in the evening times is really, really difficult for me.

35
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.540
Daniel Mcquillen: And

36
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:45.030
Daniel Mcquillen: In another thing is I do have a history of dependency and I wanted to be honest about that.

37
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.240
Daniel Mcquillen: I was on pain medication for several years because of my ankle.

38
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:03.690
Daniel Mcquillen: And I like I said, I have three small children in my home, and I don't want to go back to opioid use and I heard a

39
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.160
Daniel Mcquillen: Boxing program and and and I was interested in that.

40
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.620
Mary Kastner: So tell me about your history of opiate use

41
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.110
Daniel Mcquillen: Um,

42
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.830
Daniel Mcquillen: It's, it's

43
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.010
Daniel Mcquillen: I wouldn't say it was severe. I mean, I was abusing them pretty pretty well you know

44
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.080
Mary Kastner: What what opiates, were you using

45
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.800
Daniel Mcquillen: Like a lot of Percocet and

46
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.920
Daniel Mcquillen: Things like that.

47
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.390
Mary Kastner: And when was

48
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.370
Daniel Mcquillen: The last time I was prescribed him. I want to say maybe was a couple years ago.

49
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.000
Mm hmm.

50
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.340
Daniel Mcquillen: And

51
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.760
Mary Kastner: Taking taking more than prescribed

52
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.110
Daniel Mcquillen: Well, yeah.

53
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.500
Mary Kastner: Okay and so

54
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.160
Mary Kastner: What your ankle. You had a problem in with your ankle when, when did you hurt your ankle.

55
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.380
Daniel Mcquillen: Want to say it was a 2013

56
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.930
Mary Kastner: Okay.

57
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.470
Mary Kastner: And so they have recommended

58
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.720
Mary Kastner: Ever since it in. Hmm.

59
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.250
Daniel Mcquillen: Well, I did have to two surgeries done over the course of like maybe a couple years.

60
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.770
Daniel Mcquillen: There I had hardware hardware in there that they removed right for you. I'm sorry. My daughter just woke up.

61
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.030
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I'm so sorry. Cuz you would have been done by now.

62
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.240
Mary Kastner: Gosh.

63
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.930
Daniel Mcquillen: I wasn't sure what was going on.

64
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.480
Daniel Mcquillen: I was just waiting and waiting

65
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.910
Daniel Mcquillen: I wasn't sure.

66
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.000
Daniel Mcquillen: That I've never done this. Yeah. So how old are your children.

67
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.990
Mary Kastner: Should have been right.

68
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.100

Okay.

75
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.300
Mary Kastner: And what kind of work did you do

76
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.260
Daniel Mcquillen: I'm actually worked at a preschool.

77
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.660
Mary Kastner: Okay.

78
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.920
Mary Kastner: So are you working now.

79
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.820
Daniel Mcquillen: From home I'm working from home now.

80
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.090
Mary Kastner: So you have kids come to your house or what

81
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.030
Daniel Mcquillen: No, no, we're, we're

82
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:52.620
Daniel Mcquillen: Because of the current situation we're providing educational packets for, like, it's like a Dropbox kind of thing.

83
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.580
Uh huh.

84
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.520
Mary Kastner: Okay, so anyway, you had to you hurt your ankle in 2013 you had two surgeries. One of them was

85
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.860
Mary Kastner: Some hardware that they put in

86
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.020
Daniel Mcquillen: Yeah.

87
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.310
And

88
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.630
Mary Kastner: Then they are recommending more surgery.

89
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.690
Daniel Mcquillen: Yeah, they

90
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:29.070
Daniel Mcquillen: Yeah, they recommended I can't, I can't remember exactly. I think it was like a fusion they recommended a fusion or a

91
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.630
Daniel Mcquillen: Artificial bone to be put in there.

92
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.740
Mm hmm.

93
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.600
Daniel Mcquillen: So not

94
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.080
Mary Kastner: So do you think that your, your back issue is related a little bit to your

95
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.070
Mary Kastner: To your ankle.

96
00:07:48.510 --> 00:08:03.540
Daniel Mcquillen: And you know I have thought that previously because I mean I've had issues when I was younger, but they were always related to something like a strain or lifting something or pursuing something

97
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.410
Daniel Mcquillen: Um, and now it just seems like I

98
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.310
Daniel Mcquillen: I can't find an excuse for why my back hurts so bad. You know, I don't do anything out of the normal and I

99
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.420
Daniel Mcquillen: Haven't thought of that, like maybe because I walked it for, you know,

100
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:28.110
Daniel Mcquillen: A high my ankle. I don't know if it's like related that way or something. I don't, I don't know.

101
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.130
Mary Kastner: Okay, so what is your pain level today.

102
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:33.900
Daniel Mcquillen: Um,

103
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:52.050
Daniel Mcquillen: I think it varies. It varies. At times like when I wake up in the morning is it's very painful to get out of bed like extremely painful and as I move around more and more attentive were some job and then

104
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:03.540
Daniel Mcquillen: I find it like sitting for long periods of time or not moving like it's like going on a trip in a bar or something and I'm sitting in

105
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.000
Daniel Mcquillen: After sitting for a while and then trying to move around. Again, it's it's really bad.

106
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.270
Mary Kastner: Okay, so what is it

107
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.430
Mary Kastner: What is it right now.

108
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:25.590
Daniel Mcquillen: Right now it's, I would say, is like the six or something because I have been kind of barely active this morning, not very but

109
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.690
Daniel Mcquillen: In and some days are better than others like

110
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:39.750
Daniel Mcquillen: Some days it won't be as bad. And then there are days where I mean I have a lot of trouble. I have to force myself to

111
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.050
Daniel Mcquillen: Do normal everyday things, you know, like, getting up and taking a shower or

112
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:53.880
Daniel Mcquillen: Things like that, because my my bag actually starting to hurt worse than my foot on some days.

113
00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:01.500
Mary Kastner: So 10 being the worst you've ever had of pain. Where's your pain, what your pain number right now.

114
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.020
Daniel Mcquillen: Right now.

115
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.890
Daniel Mcquillen: I would say it's like at a six or seven

116
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.960
Mary Kastner: Okay, and

117
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:20.220
Mary Kastner: HAVE YOU EVER YOU SAID YOU BACK IN 2013 you were on some different pain medicines and you would overuse the Percocet.

118
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.400
Mary Kastner: Have you ever used IV opiates.

119
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.530
Daniel Mcquillen: No.

120
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.430
Okay.

121
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:35.160
Mary Kastner: Okay, and they want to do surgery right now on your ankle, but you don't quite know what kind of surgery. It is

122
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.040
Daniel Mcquillen: Yeah, they recommended it.

123
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.200
Daniel Mcquillen: They gave

124
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.180
Daniel Mcquillen: Me gave me two options. Yeah.

125
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.410
Mary Kastner: Yeah. And what would they

126
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.570
Daniel Mcquillen: Have fusion for an artificial bone.

127
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.850
Mary Kastner: Okay.

128
00:10:52.680 --> 00:11:02.520
Mary Kastner: And you just are delaying that because of the the work situation with your wife gone during the day and you have to take care of the kids especially now with the school being out

129
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:03.930
Daniel Mcquillen: Yeah.

130
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.680
Okay.

131
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.420
Mary Kastner: Do you have any depression or anxiety.

132
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.410
Daniel Mcquillen: No, really.

133
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:20.730
Mary Kastner: I don't think. Okay, okay, great, and any other medical problems other than your back in your foot.

134
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.090
Daniel Mcquillen: No. Not at the moment.

135
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.720
Mary Kastner: Do you know what the diagnosis is on your back.

136
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.240
Daniel Mcquillen: Um,

137
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:38.250
Daniel Mcquillen: I don't have the papers here with me. But the only thing I can remember is the guy said it was

138
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.640
Daniel Mcquillen: A non psychotic or something.

139
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.750
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay.

140
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.410
Daniel Mcquillen: What when I did have the conversation with him.

141
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.870
Daniel Mcquillen: At the time,

142
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:02.880
Daniel Mcquillen: I think we we had established that I might may have a strained it from mowing the lawn or something.

143
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.540
Daniel Mcquillen: And I

144
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.480
Daniel Mcquillen: Took it back and never

145
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.080
Daniel Mcquillen: haven't gone back

146
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.840
Daniel Mcquillen: To that doctor

147
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.320
Daniel Mcquillen: But I you know I can. I'm pretty

148
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.720
Daniel Mcquillen: Pretty confident

149
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.980
Daniel Mcquillen: It's an ongoing issue or not.

150
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.480
Daniel Mcquillen: Like

151
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.420
Mary Kastner: Okay.

152
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.290
Mary Kastner: So, um, what you are asking for us for this pain.

153
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.360
Mary Kastner: So I'm going to ask them to appoint you to

154
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.290
Mary Kastner: Our pain program.

155
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.740
Mary Kastner: And see

156
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.920
Mary Kastner: Where we can go from there.

Mary Kastner: Make you have an opiate use disorder. So we want to be able to help you with pain so that doesn't happen. Do you take any medication right now.

160
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.870
Daniel Mcquillen: I've been like I have like a morning routine where I have to take a lot of lot of like Tylenol.

161
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.560
Daniel Mcquillen: And it's helped from days and some days are

162
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.620
Daniel Mcquillen: Good. Like, I take Tylenol.

163
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.180
Daniel Mcquillen: Just over the counter. I've been broken like

164
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.590
Daniel Mcquillen: Some days I take two Tylenol and then

165
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.750
Daniel Mcquillen: Some days it works. And then other days, I have to take it with ibuprofen.

166
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:30.120
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay. So, some days you take two Tylenol with an ibuprofen.

167
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.560
Daniel Mcquillen: Yeah, I take them both at the same time, like every, every morning.

168
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.190
Mary Kastner: Every morning, and what are the dosages on a

169
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.320
Mary Kastner: Tylenol. Is it the extra strength or the regular

170
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.450
Daniel Mcquillen: Is the extra strength. It's actually the arthritis and get the arthritis.

171
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.690
Mary Kastner: And then what's the, what's the dosage on your

172
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.620
Mary Kastner: On your ibuprofen.

173
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:04.440
Daniel Mcquillen: Think, dude. They're 200 milligram once three three or four other time.

174
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.670
Mary Kastner: Okay. And then, how often do you do that.

175
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:17.760
Daniel Mcquillen: Um it once in the morning, for sure. And then probably later in the afternoon or or and before I go to bed.

176
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:26.790
Mary Kastner: Okay, so basically you're getting a lot of a set amount of fin so

177
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:39.030
Mary Kastner: So I'm thinking that you're you're getting you know too much you need to lower your Extra Strength Tylenol to one.

178
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.260
Mary Kastner: If you combine that with your ibuprofen.

179
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.440
Mary Kastner: Because you're taking four of those, that's an 800 which is OK.

180
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.980
Mary Kastner: And then if you took the Tylenol. That's another 500

181
00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:03.540
Mary Kastner: So that's 1300. And if you do that three times a day, you're getting you're getting your max dose.

182
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.080
Daniel Mcquillen: You don't want to cause liver problems.

183
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.270
Mary Kastner: Okay.

184
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.080

Mary Kastner: Okay. And that was very patient management kind of dictate it was sort of odd because it's three kids woke up and we he had an early appointment that I didn't catch in my schedule so

218
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:44.220
Mary Kastner: It was a little disjointed. His name is Daniel mcquillan Mr n 4168 he came to us wanting to get on Suboxone he would, he wants to do this for chronic pain. He has an ankle injury in 2013 he had a surgery and it needed to be

219
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:52.440
Mary Kastner: redone and some of the hardware taken out after he fractured his ankle at that time he had some

220
00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:06.540
Mary Kastner: Years, where he overused a prescription Percocet. He's never had a bona fide opiate use disorder with other increasing tolerance and increasing use

221
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:24.600
Mary Kastner: But he was concerned about that happening. So we would like to get on some Suboxone for the pain. So we're going to refer him to the pain program and let them do the intake. He denies any psychiatric symptoms. He has medical problems with both the ankle and back pain.

222
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:33.900
Mary Kastner: Non sciatic back pain. He has a lot of stress. He has children home from school due to the covert

223
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:46.710

224
00:19:47.310 --> 00:20:01.230
Mary Kastner: No depression or anxiety is sleepy says is adequate, but it's pain is up to seven out attend today is pH q nine was five which is mild Judy seven five mild audit see five Destin five

225
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:16.740
Mary Kastner: He is taking medication to Extra Strength Tylenol and for 200 milligrams ibuprofen up to three times a day, which would put him well over the limit

226
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:29.550
Mary Kastner: Set a mannequin and put stress on his liver. So he's advice to lower that to one Extra Strength Tylenol with his for 200 milligrams ibuprofen, if he's going to take that three times a day.

227
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:41.370
Mary Kastner: He denied any other medical or psychiatric problems. He was on time for its initial visit and was very patient waiting in the waiting room and

228
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.050
Mary Kastner: For over half an hour. By the way, which I apologize for

229
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:53.010
Mary Kastner: Mental Status. He seemed functionally independent and cognitively

230
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.460
Mary Kastner: His cognitive function intact. He's oriented place circumstance.

231
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.260
Mary Kastner: And situation in date is mood and an effect where I'm

232
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:19.080
Mary Kastner: A full and youth dynamic, he appeared to stated he was Kashi dressed with male pattern balding but well groomed.

235
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.910
Mary Kastner: I would say

236
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.390
Mary Kastner: He's a low suicide risk at know ideation no plan, no history.

237
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:55.050
Mary Kastner: So the plan is for us to refer him to our pain program and

238
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.850
Mary Kastner: Okay, that's it. Thank you very much.
