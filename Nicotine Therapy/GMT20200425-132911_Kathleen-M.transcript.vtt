Jen's iPhone: The pain in my body is just totally insane and then they refused to work with me because of my mental health, well not not refused to me. But they wouldn't send me to a psychologist or psychiatrist instead of managing my pain, which is, therefore, I tried to do this.

58
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:53.610
Jen's iPhone: Where would be, you know, under with a doctor because I am aware, you know, my limitations in life. And so I tried to do this the right way, but then

Kathleen Marshall: So,

70
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.560
Kathleen Marshall: SORRY, YOU STARTED WITH SOME DOCTORS PRESCRIBING pain medicine. What were they prescribing I just caught on.

71
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:55.050
Jen's iPhone: These are pretty severe intense surgeries and they wanted to do the other side of my body, but I, I'm not satisfied or

72
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.960
Jen's iPhone: The penis is different in different pain.

73
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.460

Kathleen Marshall: So now.

75
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.060
Kathleen Marshall: It started a much I wanted and you are prescribed by orthopedic surgeon

76
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.230
Jen's iPhone: Yes. Like I said, probably five

77
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:27.060
Jen's iPhone: Different surgeons. Um, but it was all the same, same facility. It was like, um, you know, if it was orthopedics but they make you go to. I just wanted one doctor and do all of it.

78
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:41.520
Jen's iPhone: But they may have to have many specialists, a shoulder person you'll have to have for my spine. I had surgery or the cut my neck and would need like the author uses up in the back of my neck.

79
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.590
Jen's iPhone: And then

80
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.890
Kathleen Marshall: To look to go to pain management after

81
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.970
Yes.

82
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:58.560
Jen's iPhone: Yeah, I just, I'm still in the middle but I stopped going to keep cutting me up and I like I said I'm not happy with the surgeries that I've had.

83
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:11.280
Jen's iPhone: I hadn't done when much scraping away my spine rate, the neck, the knee, the shoulder, all those I had like back to back, and then

84
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:22.890
Jen's iPhone: Anyway, that's where it was. And then I was at which I did this in management and not work. So then I just went started getting

85
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.900
Kathleen Marshall: Started to pain management when, when do you think that was

86
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.610
Jen's iPhone: Every single Sunday, the management.

87
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.120
Jen's iPhone: At least the first time I went, they had at least three surgeons refer me there.

88
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.270
Kathleen Marshall: But when was that years ago.

89
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.900
Jen's iPhone: No, no, no, it's two tops. I guess two years was the last time.

90
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.990
Jen's iPhone: That I tried a year and a half.

91
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.760
Jen's iPhone: Maybe two to obviously close

92
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.750
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, and you've ever received any pain medicine from a management group.

93
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.600
Jen's iPhone: I know I did initially, but then they got my middle history and

94
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:18.960
Jen's iPhone: They shut me down. So I'm like I said, I tried to do this the right way. But now that a place where they

95
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:30.810
Jen's iPhone: Just like don't force the worst have ever used in my life. Or it's just it's crazy effect that has on the body is very hard with the body.

96
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.880
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so

97
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.360
Kathleen Marshall: They were for you. You said to psychiatry. Then, but you weren't able to do that.

98
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:47.070
Jen's iPhone: What did they do is to me all this medicine has like $4,000 a month.

99
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.350
Jen's iPhone: And then they gave me

100
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.120
Jen's iPhone: On

101
00:10:53.970 --> 00:11:03.210
Jen's iPhone: This striking. Um, I did in the medicine and gave me they were prescribed me it was like, I think.

102
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:11.010
Jen's iPhone: Three to five different medications, it was back to back. This one was working just wasn't working. And they just kept trying different one.

103
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.130
Kathleen Marshall: Or the payment and

104
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.170
Jen's iPhone: The psychiatrist.

105
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.020
Jen's iPhone: Like I said him. He shut me down. They shut me down.

106
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:32.010
Jen's iPhone: Okay. They referred me to first psychologists and I went to them and then I went to the psychiatrists and they got lock jaw and it was like

107
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.960
Jen's iPhone: Involuntary where I had no control over my army and just flat.

108
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.060
Jen's iPhone: It's

109
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:56.940
Jen's iPhone: only way I can describe it to you. And after that I I stopped doing that medicine. That was last June, but I'm pretty sure that June or July. So it's been a year I i'm not desire to go back to the to the psychiatrist.

110
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:11.220
Jen's iPhone: Because that's all it was. They were just got me one thing and another in the medicine wasn't working. And I didn't like the fact that it was happening to my body and I don't I i'm I'm not willing to do that.

304
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.720

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.850

415
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.650
Jen's iPhone: If

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.000
Jen's iPhone: I had some kind of reaction or something to it. That's why they changed it to

417
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.930
Jen's iPhone: The hydromorphone that was basically the medicine that the stuff with through all my surgeries.

418
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.080
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. And do you feel you're

419
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.380
Jen's iPhone: Not really. I mean,

420
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:19.950
Jen's iPhone: I

421
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.320
Jen's iPhone: I don't have feeling in my fingers.

422
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.840
Jen's iPhone: I i

423
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.650
Jen's iPhone: Don't I have a hard time with my hands is so i i know that you

424
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:32.160
Why

425
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.100
Kathleen Marshall: The surgeries. The back surgery.

426
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:40.260
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, okay. All right then, Tommy. What's your height.

427
00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.630
Jen's iPhone: 595 you got

428
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.200
Your way.

429
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.280
Jen's iPhone: Down to 172 okay

430
00:38:52.230 --> 00:39:05.880
Kathleen Marshall: So that the Suboxone that we prescribe on you know you've had it occasionally off the street, it is a opioid partial what we call partial medication, so to say.

431
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:10.110
Kathleen Marshall: latches onto all those opioid receptors in your brain.

432
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:21.480
Kathleen Marshall: But doesn't cause the same high and so it helps curb cravings for the actual narcotic. The Percocet, the oxy cotton, the heroin, any of those

433
00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.500
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, and

434
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:31.200
Kathleen Marshall: And kind of keep you from having those cravings allow you to be functional in your life, it's combined with naloxone which

435
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:43.020
Kathleen Marshall: That medication if you inject it if you somehow take the Suboxone and use it to inject it that is will completely block all of the opioid receptors and it will put you into full withdrawal.

436
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:50.010
Kathleen Marshall: So that's putting the medication to prevent people from trying to get high off, off the buprenorphine part, the beauty part

437
00:39:50.040 --> 00:40:08.340
Jen's iPhone: Yeah. Doesn't they don't do needles. I never have. I don't. I just, I know a lot of people that have died and pretty much when they get to that state they die. Anybody. Yeah, that's that. Yeah, I've never, I've never, never messed with that and I have no intention.

438
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.950
Kathleen Marshall: You ever notice

439
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.090
Jen's iPhone: Until now.

440
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.710
Jen's iPhone: I've never had any overdoses in my life ever wear anything. Okay.

441
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:32.520
Kathleen Marshall: So the film that we prescribe. It's a film and you put it under your tongue and you let it dissolve completely it sometimes can take 10 to 20 minutes to dissolve, but you want to wait till it's fully dissolved and when it goes in that way.

442
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:40.320
Kathleen Marshall: You don't get it when it goes under the tongue than the buprenorphine is absorbed into your body and will work the right way, if you

443
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.600
Kathleen Marshall: Do it, it doesn't work so

444
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.550
Kathleen Marshall: Hard to take it under the tongue.

445
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:52.140
Kathleen Marshall: And then, like I said, then the last part is in it. And when that goes under your tongue. It doesn't cause a problem and it won't affect you.

446
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.410
Kathleen Marshall: It's just there for safeguarding

447
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.760
Kathleen Marshall: To keep your own, you know,

448
00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.460
Kathleen Marshall: Or from people trying to get the medicine from you.

449
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:10.500
Kathleen Marshall: So the way that you start, what we call, taking it in induction is that you want to prescribe you the film. It comes in.

450
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:18.510
Kathleen Marshall: It comes like this and you can cut it with scissors in half and in quarters, so

451
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:30.150
Kathleen Marshall: With the amount of medicine. You're on. You're at a risk of withdrawal when you start to buprenorphine because it will latch on to all those receptors and knock off the opioid

452
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.020
Jen's iPhone: Right.

453
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:38.910
Kathleen Marshall: When you first pick it. You want to be in a moderate amount of withdrawal. You want to have at least three symptoms.

454
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:51.600
Kathleen Marshall: Of withdrawal, including runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, feeling real agitated or your eyes looking your pupils looking really big you want

455
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.920
Kathleen Marshall: At least for you taking the long acting

456
00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:17.220
Kathleen Marshall: 12 to 24 hours of withdrawal. Okay, feeling those symptoms and then take the first part of the buprenorphine. You start on a quarter obviously take that two milligrams there and see how you feel after one hour, you can take another two milligrams

457
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.010
Kathleen Marshall: At that point you will have taken half of the film. Okay.

458
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:29.160
Kathleen Marshall: All right, because you want to make sure that first dose doesn't knock you into full withdraw.

459
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.140
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, because then you'll be very uncomfortable. I'm sure you know what withdrawals feel

460
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.640
Jen's iPhone: Yes, yes.

461
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:43.200
Kathleen Marshall: So a little bit you know of discomfort is OK. As you're starting it, you can take some Tylenol. If you need for headaches or body.

462
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:56.670
Kathleen Marshall: But then, you know, using the the medication. So then throughout that day you'll take continue to take that buprenorphine and you'll probably take the full amount for the day.

463
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:07.290
Kathleen Marshall: And you'll have that eight milligrams. And then the next day starts at eight milligrams a whole film in the morning and another whole film.

464
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.340
Kathleen Marshall: In the evening.

465
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:21.330
Kathleen Marshall: Most of the time. That's a good dose for people at it covers most of the receptors in the brain. But when we touch base. Again, we can see if that's working for you to curb your cravings.

466
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:22.740
Jen's iPhone: Okay, okay.

467
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.660
Kathleen Marshall: And you can check in sooner. You know, if you're having problems or issues.

468
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.730
Kathleen Marshall: Reach out right heart health.

469
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.350
Kathleen Marshall: Right. There's no way for me to see you. One more time, because I just need to kind of look

470
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.180
Kathleen Marshall: Over eyes and faith. Okay.

471
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:37.920

Jen's iPhone: Okay I can't hear you at all. So, what, what did you just say

475
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.000

Jen's iPhone: Okay. Say that one more time.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:27.120
Jen's iPhone: Yeah, they've already went to the insurance stuff and stuff. That's why I was saying, asking you to please be mindful that

532
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:35.430
Jen's iPhone: They're basically saying I have to pay $12,000 because they cover anything both insurances which I've never heard of. I've never been told that

533
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.130
Jen's iPhone: I have to do a $12,000 deductible, which I already have deductibles on both of them. It's almost

534
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:52.890
Jen's iPhone: I just down to $500 so but they're telling me I have to go through a whole 12,000 with your program before the insurance will pay anything. So that's why I was asking you, please, be mindful that have to pay

558
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:57.810
