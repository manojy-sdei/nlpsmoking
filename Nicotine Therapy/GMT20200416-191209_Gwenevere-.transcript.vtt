00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A little lightheaded. I've got to be able to eat here. So I'm just going to take a second.

10
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So our you're on a laptop that's fantastic. Does that mean that you kind of also have

11
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The setup with two containers two objects.

12
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually laptop might be big enough. I don't need those containers.

13
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. So tell me a little bit. I notice is odd, but I don't want you to see me eating and I don't want to pass out. So what I'm tell me a little bit about your stress level. You've had some history of anxiety. What's your stress level been like

14
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.260
Bianca Garcia: Oh, well, it varies today and

15
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.080
Bianca Garcia: It could vary from day to day, but yeah, I had a high stress level.

16
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.300
Bianca Garcia: In the past,

17
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:47.160
Bianca Garcia: And and now I feel, I feel a little better. I haven't had too much, just, it's just a little stressful with, you know,

18
00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:09.060
Bianca Garcia: This thing at home and and having the kids 24 seven in them not being able to go to school and interact, you know, with their friends and people so that's that's that's a little stressful for all of us. And I in, you know, have them, it's always more stressful on us and then them.

19
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.440
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, so, so it is it's it's it's not high but it's, it's, it's, I have some stress.

21
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.370
Bianca Garcia: Oh, we're fine. Everything's fine. We know there hasn't been any arguments or problems.

22
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.710
Bianca Garcia: At any recent anything like that everything's been neutral.

23
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.850
Bianca Garcia: It's just dealing with, you know, the home and keep being home.

24
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.950
Bianca Garcia: You know, safe and kids and just, you know, normal stuff.

25
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So take this time to sort of set up some privacy maybe get your daughter, something that she can do that could be kind of fun for maybe the next 45 minutes

26
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:15.930
Bianca Garcia: Oh yeah, she she's gone. They're all gone, she was just asking me for something, but I couldn't find it for her. So she left, but I was trying to grab it for her but purified

27
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to take some time to look for

28
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.130
Bianca Garcia: She's, she's got it. Thank you.

29
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on, affecting your sleep.

30
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.390
Bianca Garcia: Um, yeah, sometimes I have not. Well, sleep, but, uh,

31
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.450
Bianca Garcia: I try and get as much sleep as possible, but there is days that I can't sleep like I'm like tossing and turning, but

32
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm around I'm moving so much. I'm already kind of nauseous from not eating. Is there any way that I can stop moving for a minute. Is it is or what. Why is it so wobbly. You can't tell if that's on your side.

33
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.900
Bianca Garcia: Oh my

34
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, I don't know.

35
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.030
Bianca Garcia: I have it I it's just down the laptop. I don't have in

36
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.490
Bianca Garcia: Here, let me see if I can move in place it somewhere songs on

37
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.840
It. See, this works better.

38
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It was on your needs. Is that a possibility. Was it on your knees.

39
00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:06.420
Bianca Garcia: Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe. But I was a movie. Maybe it was just a little tremble, that was going on that you could tell. Wow, I can't. I if you could tell real everything how with with the laptop with you.

40
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell it's now stationary. Okay, excellent.

41
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. All right, because I was already kind of nauseous.

42
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.480
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, sorry. I do want to make you more.

43
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

44
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's continue to set this up. Don't get too distracted with the fact that

45
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's taking some time to get this setup. I would rather this laptop be sitting on a sink in a bathroom. Then you not be alone.

46
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that sounds really odd, but I know

47
00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So even though we're kind of clumping around this morning, don't, don't let that distract you see if you can find somewhere with this block talk concert stationary and you can be alone.

48
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.730
Bianca Garcia: I'm alone, and I am on the put it where it's not on my knees. It's down sturdy.

49
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can you turn the computer to the, what is that your left.

50
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.980
Bianca Garcia: By law,

51
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.910
Uh huh.

52
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This all the way. Let me see.

53
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your kitchen. It's pretty likely that people are going to want to go in and out of the kitchen. Don't you think

54
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.190
Bianca Garcia: Well, I'm in my living room, but that we use a kitchen.

55
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

56
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:46.500
Bianca Garcia: Right babies in my room with my husband, and so I don't know, or should I go to the bathroom. Usually I stay in here when I talk to you.

57
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.730
Bianca Garcia: You guys don't come in here. Okay. Nick Cave listening, your room.

58
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.100
Okay. All right.

59
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, a lot of our. A lot of my clients have kids and it doesn't take one effort it takes like several efforts of making sure

60
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That those kids are occupied. It takes more than it can kids are kids, they want to play with you. They want to hang out with you. So it takes a little bit of time and that

61
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Out it though.

62
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:30.810
Bianca Garcia: They're in their rooms. So this is the first time she came in and but I gave my phone to my daughter. So the little one. So she should be occupied with a little games and stuff, but usually they're very good about it. I'm always alone in the living room.

63
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, so today.

64
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry. No, it's okay. So two things. If it changes, meaning, someone comes in and just fluidly don't apologize. Just take care of it.

65
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Because no matter what you can't bypass the fact that this is your home. This is where your family is okay, your number one.

66
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that you're going to have family to take care of you don't have anything to apologize for

67
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You just say, Excuse me, and just go handle it. There's not an issue. Okay, I know we're all we have all our kids home and especially you. That's kind of that's just fine.

68
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Nothing to worry about. Um, but there's another thing that I want to do with you this morning, which has to do with i'd like to develop what's called an anchor room.

69
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that sound familiar to okay so

70
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: These rooms might take

71
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We might get done today or it might take three or four sessions it all sort of depends on what you say there's no wrong way for you to do it, but it takes as long as it takes. That's kind of the message.

72
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The way to think about an anchor room you'll hear me say, well, go to your room. You want to go to your room to go to your room. Hey, do you have a room. Where's your own. Do you ever go to it to think about it. And that's what I'll be talking about is, it's your happy place.

73
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So for a second. I want you to think about maybe some time in your life where you did have like this crate happy place. Maybe it was this closet or maybe there was this wooded area.

74
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you felt like this so amazing. So when I say happy place you're safe happy places it's something that you kind of already have and you're familiar with.

75
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.630
Bianca Garcia: Yeah definitely be my room.

76
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. So you kind of know my point right there are some rooms that we're kind of still anxious in and we're kind of not as comfortable and then there's other rooms that we kind of feel a little bit more at ease.

77
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's kind of what the point is. So this kind of room that I'm going to be developing with you is not based on memory.

78
00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This is your imagination. This is the right side of the brain that side of the brain that came up with the metaphor right of the hot air balloon for maybe letting go of a negative thought it's the same side of the brain that came up with the fault container.

79
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that creative side or the one that comes up with a cool way to do makeup. It's that part, the one that's

80
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Not stuck in memory. It can just come up with anything it wants to. It's completely free in the story. It can be creative.

81
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what this room is the only time I'm going to dip into memory on purpose. You're going to naturally do it on your own. Because I I know how the human brain works, but

82
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: As far as what I'm directing it's really only three times. I'm going to be specific about memory, memory, memory, only three times the rest of it. I'm going to be inviting your imagination.

83
00:10:52.470 --> 00:11:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way you can do this wrong. You might be tempted to say, oh, I'm doing this wrong. I want to give her this right answer. Nope. Whatever comes up for you. That's what I'm interested in. Okay.

84
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking for sort of that you know like free association, you know, whatever that first thought is that comes to mind, that's kind of the thing I'm looking for

85
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Where to start

86
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

87
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to start with.

88
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: An open ended question because we kind of need to have a place to start when you think about where you are in your self growth and your development. Where are you still feeling a little blocked on the little stuck.

89
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.500
I'm

90
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely the anxiety. Okay, you know, put it in a full sentence anxiety sits there in the middle, but it's not a full sentence. Let me hear

91
00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:04.440
Bianca Garcia: Well, I feel a little walked with God. I mean, I am a progress a little, I think. But, um, I

92
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.130
Don't know, I guess.

93
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.580
Bianca Garcia: Just not really having normal life right now with this whole pandemic, I think.

94
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the ones that I'm trying to cope with. Okay. So is this what you just said. I feel a little blocked around my anxiety.

95
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: About the pandemic.

96
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's more detail than that, see if that's not quite it

97
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be living normal you know staying at home.

98
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:55.470
Bianca Garcia: And not really able to interact with family or friends, or you just

99
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:07.980
Bianca Garcia: You know, be wanting to be when you do have to go get necessities, like, you know, you have to stay away from people. It's not like normal. So it's kind of hard to deal with.

100
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.070
Is more I'm trying to say.

101
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: When I go get to maybe make an if statement. And I know it's fuzzy, but try and again when I go get necessities. I feel when I go out

102
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.500
When I go get necessities.

103
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:46.530
Bianca Garcia: To go or when I go get necessities i don't know i i just feel this anxiety from, you know, worrying about being too close to people or, you know, who could be

104
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.680
Infected effective with the virus.

105
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And what have you tried to do to try to address your anxiety and worry

106
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.350
Bianca Garcia: Well, I just take the the safety precautions, you know, and

107
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

108
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.120
Bianca Garcia: That's it. That's all I do. I just do what I

109
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.630
Bianca Garcia: Can to stay protected.

110
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's Bridget back to

111
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That anxiety that you just described.

112
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just sort of picture that it's time you're going to go shopping. You're going to have to be around people while you get those necessities, maybe some of them are infected.

113
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you notice that in your body.

114
00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.650
I'm

115
00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to have to think about it right now in order to get that sense. So imagine, today's the day you're gonna have to go in 20 minutes

116
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens

117
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:23.340
Bianca Garcia: Well I, I think I feel it more like, Well, I just think about it i don't know if i feel that i don't know if i noticed failing or, I guess, like if you get like this, like, like when you're nervous or like those butterflies, like you're like oh my gosh, like you're anxious to get it done.

118
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so make an if statement I get nervous, kind of, own it a little bit more

119
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.370
Bianca Garcia: No more.

120
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, only because you were saying. You and I know it's not about me. And I know that's just a play on words but it makes a difference. So maybe talk more about your butterflies, not mine.

121
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it sounds really weird, but just give it a shot. Oh yeah obviously would be boring but saying it that way, feels different. When

122
00:15:53.340 --> 00:16:03.210
Bianca Garcia: I when I feel the butterflies. I just feel anxious and I feel nervous.

123
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When I feel butterflies. I feel anxious

124
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.920
Okay.

125
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a sense of almost the butterflies. There's aware of the body first butterflies and then it comes up with a label and it's anxious

126
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When trying to track it back in time member I was saying that I was going to ask a couple of history questions. There's not a lot of them. There's just a few in this exercise.

127
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But try to go back in time, let's use what's called regression. And let's go back in time feel those butterflies, maybe, maybe even close your eyes. I'm not staring at you, minor close to try to turn inward and feel that

128
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Butterfly experience and knowing

129
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All I'm going to have to go out

130
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm gonna have to get necessities and someone might have a virus. And so there there are those butterflies.

131
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And now just focus on the butterflies in the stomach, trying to see how old that is that physical feeling try to go back in time and see check in. Was it there when you were 20

132
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it there when you were 1514 1312 just keep walking back each year prior year toggling yes no yes it was there just sort of watch and see how old this is

133
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.180
I think it's like

134
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.870
In mid 20s.

135
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.740
Really remember going that far back and feeling like this.

136
00:17:54.030 --> 00:18:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's find out. So go close your eyes. Again, if you can. Let's go back and check it out to go back to 19

137
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: sheepish about life and how it felt to be you at 19

138
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know how do you know those butterflies were not there. How do you have a sense that they weren't there because I was more care. Listen, I

139
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.530
Bianca Garcia: Because I matured. I had more of

140
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:34.980
Like cautions and worries then then and I had not really that many responsibilities also

141
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.920
As a young adult

142
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you get a sense that there's caution. There's responsibility in your 20s, where there really was. You were careless at age 19

143
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.530
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, it wasn't like, no, no.

144
00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, what else happened in your 20s was a big responsibility.

145
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:14.430
Bianca Garcia: Well, at 19 yeah I wasn't a mother to 20. I think that's probably hit a little more, but not as much

146
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't remember being like, I remember just like it being more joyful and you know just more care.

147
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:32.250
Bianca Garcia: Not like careless, but how do I say like where it wasn't so much worry like now as in

148
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Explain that. So there is a term that's similar one you're using. It's called care free is that you think that's it. There you go. Okay, so we'll go carefree and joyful joyful.

149
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.240
Yeah.

150
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.190
Bianca Garcia: I mean, it's nothing. I'm not happy. You know, I just want to put that out.

151
00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:08.970
Bianca Garcia: But it's just like, I don't know. It was different than it was like you know when you're young, you're more like your prime and you're more you know carefree more happy or, you know, I don't know, it's just I don't know how to explain it. That's how I remember it.

152
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you answered the question I asked you will howdy how confidence for how do you know that it didn't exist at 19 and you're explaining. Oh, I know because I was carefree I was joyful. I was in the prime of my life and I was happier period.

153
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And we might know it if we looked at 18 as well. We might see that same description. Is that right, yeah. And 1716

154
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.110
Yeah.

155
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way back.

156
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Still carefree joyful, even though I had there was issues. I do. I don't remember like worrying about him or carry that much about them. So yeah, it was more like less worrying about it.

157
00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now. And you thought, Well, I did have issues. What age were those issues present

158
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:07.980
Bianca Garcia: Um, I think, like after 16 like 1617

159
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well where those issues.

160
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:21.540
Bianca Garcia: Wow, I was like a teenager and I was not a good teenager and mean my mom didn't get a lot, man.

161
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you want to do that. She did not want you to do like probably going now We have friends and

162
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.070
Probably smoking, we

163
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, she didn't want me to be doing this stuff. So we would clash now and how was she had communicating her beliefs, as a parent, how much, how did she communicate her preference.

164
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.170
Oh,

165
00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:06.510
Bianca Garcia: I don't remember having that much good communication. So that's why we just argue about it. Instead of talking about it. So yeah, I don't think, her, her communication was that great.

166
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so here's the neat thing about communication that word, I can be communicating something like this.

167
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not saying a word communication can also be our words but it can be the absence of words to so she was doing something. I wonder what she said back then. What did she say back then.

168
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To communicate her preference, please don't go out. I don't want you smoking. I don't want you going out, what, how would it have sound and what would have looked like on her.

169
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:55.770
Bianca Garcia: Well, I know that she she when she's mad, she doesn't say much. She keeps it in and then at one point it'll just come out and it's fighting

170
00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:09.630
Bianca Garcia: Over it. So yeah, she didn't really say much until we were like yelling and arguing over whatever it was, you know, so I don't know what exactly your words. But that's our remember it like that.

171
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you saying that weeks might go by mom can see you sneaking out staying out late, she knows you're smoking and she's not saying anything.

172
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:29.550
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, she's like yeah, she would say stuff that she she would a first it out after a while, and

173
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How long how long, how long

174
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:42.150
I don't think week so maybe like a week talks, maybe, and then it would be arguing, but

175
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So if she were to start that

176
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: How does an argument start or you come in at her, or to she typically she would have started it with something, she said.

177
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:20.370
Bianca Garcia: Probably something I was doing. And then she was finally just first out mad and angry about that because it was like repeated behavior about like going out friends and stuff and. And then finally, which is just, you know, she just finally said something

178
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, now I get it. Let's see if we can get a little closer.

179
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: She sound like this.

180
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. You're such an idiot. No, probably not.

181
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, she will

182
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:45.720
Bianca Garcia: Cost or call me names, but she would just like go out, she would. I don't know how it would sound to be honest journey. Think about it, but

183
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have a little quiet. Let's, let's just have the quiet to let that memory come up. Okay, let's just turn to that memory, pull it up a little bit. She's not here now.

184
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And just see her.

185
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of reaching that week talk out can't be quiet anymore. And now she is blowing up. Try and get a sense of what she looks like maybe even kind of where she's standing

186
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.840
I can't think of anything.

187
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:32.640
Bianca Garcia: Bad memory. I can't think of one thing of her shoe standing or how it became about

188
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.500
The argument.

189
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know it was a wall up

190
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.610
Bianca Garcia: Because that's how she was. She's always been

191
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Your hands and motion like her. What is blow up look like in her hands.

192
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: knows me, mainly or no. Okay.

193
00:25:53.970 --> 00:26:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Yeah. So it's something, she said. And there's a particular volume, probably to it. I'm try on a few will rule them out. So I noticed I did one just to see

194
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice that she probably wouldn't call you names.

195
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But she would burst out doing something I said it was

196
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Such

197
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: A not. I think it was more for boys here.

198
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.460
Bianca Garcia: Boy, do you have to go out, or why

199
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.400
Bianca Garcia: Are you doing this or

200
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that. And why do you have to go out

201
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Why are you doing this.

202
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I hear a little bit more of how it sounded

203
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.440
Um,

204
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.860
Well, I can't give you like exact

205
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.140
Okay. Yeah, really.

206
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we've gotten here. We got a lot further than we were before by doing what we're doing. Let's keep doing it.

207
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got it we got some words check on the volume. So you're just going to role play can tell your family. Hey, I'm about to shout has nothing to do with you. You can tell them if you want to

208
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it a shot. See what happens when you actually raise your voice a little bit

209
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.180
Bianca Garcia: Why are you going to worry going outside or who is a

210
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that yelling to you.

211
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.150
Bianca Garcia: Know, but I don't want to really yell.

212
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.980
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I don't know. I don't see the need for me to yell I'm explaining

213
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you froze. Oh, yeah.

214
00:27:54.750 --> 00:28:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. We got you back. Oh, how did it feel to even begin to raise your voice just now. What was that like for you.

215
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:04.710
Oh, I don't

216
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.220
Bianca Garcia: Like to raise my voice.

217
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. I know you don't like it, and what did it feel like we're in the body.

218
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now, and then you said Why don't see what the point and kind of I know what happened. I was here to what happened to you when I kind of keep pushing and I'm asking you to actually raise your voice a little bit. How did it feel to raise your voice.

219
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.630
Bianca Garcia: My heart just started pumping

220
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

221
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.210
Bianca Garcia: And I felt like embarrassed.

222
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

223
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting.

224
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Embarrassed like with a witness me as the witness or someone else are you thinking

225
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you hear me OK.

226
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

227
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So the heart was pumping a little bit of embarrassment and then you said why don't you understand what the point of this as I'm explaining it to menu. Right. Yeah.

228
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You explained. Yeah.

229
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

230
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So just kind of move between what that was just now.

231
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And get a sense of that butterfly kind of flip flop between butterfly and what just happened that embarrassment. I'm sorry, excuse me.

232
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.080
Bianca Garcia: Departure. You don't need to ask

233
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.180
You know where it is.

234
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.460
Sorry, I don't know why she asked me for charger. She knows me the charger is

235
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: She's married, they're doing their virtual process as well.

236
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Move between butterflies.

237
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And embarrassment.

238
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can distinguish in your body. The difference. Just make sure they're really different.

239
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. Got to go out and I'm

240
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be around people that may or may not have it. Okay, so there's that butterfly.

241
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then go to what just happened in here together.

242
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: See, are they the same, are they different, how are they different. How are they the same

243
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention, how they feel in your body differently or similarly

244
00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:39.660
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, in a way, embarrassment is similar, because I feel

245
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:50.730
Embarrassed to wear masks, stuff like that, even though it's for all safety. It's a little ridiculous and um

246
00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:01.830
Bianca Garcia: Yeah. And then I and then I feel the anxiousness when people are too close and don't want the personal space.

247
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is there. Stay with there for a second. Has there been a time when you wanted to tell someone or did tell them hey could you step back a little bit.

248
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:25.440
Bianca Garcia: Oh, usually I'm the one who will step back and, like, be like, like I think I feel like if I do it to be like, Oh, I remember. Let me step back, you know, when I haven't had to

249
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:33.690
Bianca Garcia: Feel do it like there'll be too close. And then if I like move up or state back or whatever, like if I'm in front of the line there behind me to close.

250
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:43.590
Bianca Garcia: And I backed up. They have to back up, obviously, but I haven't had to confront anybody because they obviously get it with the little hand side through

251
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:46.440
Yeah.

252
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: When was the last time you had to confront someone

253
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Like in Public Enemy ever

254
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:04.410
Bianca Garcia: Oh, um, no hasn't been anytime recent

255
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And when was the last time you had to contract someone

256
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see me think about this time.

257
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:25.740
Bianca Garcia: Well, actually I was a boy was like six months, like right before I like happy after I moved here.

258
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.170
The, the maintenance person. I had to go for

259
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Me here. How would you say

260
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:45.060
Bianca Garcia: Well, they just wanted to walk in my house. And I said, No, that doesn't have goes, you need to have 24 hour notice you can just walk in somebody's house because you're the maintenance.

261
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, and and he thought that

262
00:32:48.810 --> 00:33:01.920
Bianca Garcia: He could do whatever he wants his Antoni tell you, it could go in and and I had to tell the landlord, and I'm like, No, this is. And he's like, yeah, you're right. Does it go like that. So they had to put him straight but I don't know who to heat. He thought he gave them that thorny

263
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:03.840
Right.

264
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.340
Bianca Garcia: Luckily, I was here to if not even just came in my house. So I was alone during

265
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling of embarrassment.

266
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were talking about earlier was that there at

267
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Was any out there.

268
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.630
Possibly

269
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking was just just now more cuz I'm a newer things. And I don't know if it's because I'm older. Or what if, like I said back then, it was more like carefree I was embarrassed too much. Okay.

270
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a real sense that something right in that

271
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: After I gave birth. Is that what I'm hearing after I became a mother. No, I don't think it was after I think it was like after the like the third child or

272
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.710
Bianca Garcia: My second child that started

273
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So what was different, you know,

274
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.540
I don't know if I just

275
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:46.920
Were wiser about myself or or maybe it's self esteem. I don't know what it is, like, I know.

276
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.200
Bianca Garcia: I just got more shy, like you said,

277
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.750
Bianca Garcia: Or anti social. I don't know what it is.

278
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Not feeling carefree not feeling joyful. Not happier. After that, that third child something changed seems like

279
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the new happiness. It was it's more like I am not carefree anymore. I'm more like

280
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.880
Bianca Garcia: careful and cautious and

281
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:33.600
Bianca Garcia: More bears. Now, or, you know, like, like more anxious or more anxiety. It's more of all those things that stress fullness, you know,

282
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's go without them just about a day and age, after third child. How old are you,

283
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.930
Bianca Garcia: I'm

284
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.180
28

285
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have a nickname back then.

286
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What was it be be

287
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Be isn't Bianca.

288
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.340
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, the letter B as in boy. Yes.

289
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's two times I've asked you about age. I'm sorry, memory, I asked them, Is the earliest time and then I just asked him nickname number. I said, I'm going to do three

290
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So we already are already covered the history taking stuff. So the rest of this, the majority of it is really going to be developing

291
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This room. So I want you to now should kind of look around the room here and now kind of look at this place that you're in and kind of check it out.

292
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And now comes the creative stuff. I want you to imagine a room attached to this home don't block yourself with censoring

293
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Where would it be attached. How big would it be and what's in it, whatever's in it. I want to know.

294
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.260
What's this tax.

295
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

296
00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.670
This row.

297
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.320
Like, like what's in here.

298
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start over. You have all these questions when it was an invitation, but you're asking me, so let's start over. Hold on.

299
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me okay yes so you know what a fantasy is right. Mm hmm.

300
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it real.

301
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's where you're about to go okay ready

302
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like you to picture a room that's attached to this home you're in now.

303
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be any size and shape. You can be attached in any way you want. Try not to edit yourself. I'd like to know the first things that come to mind when I say you can add a room to this home what comes up.

304
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So it could be realistic or not unrealistic like it could be anything.

305
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: BIANCA put your little toe.

306
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Into trust.

307
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And just tell me what you thought of.

308
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:24.210
That

309
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.510
Bianca Garcia: Cruise that's first one I thought

310
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and tell me about it. So pictured an actual cruise what

311
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.550
Well, there's obviously a lot of things to do so.

312
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:57.960
Bianca Garcia: Well, I could picture when I was there, and it was it was actually really stunning

313
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's in there, describe what you see that is stunning.

314
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:22.050
Like this beautiful elevator and all the stores and ocean and doll fans and beautiful beaches and just these different countries or

315
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:27.030
Bianca Garcia: Countries that we went to. It was just amazing.

316
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you by crews are you referring to a ship.

317
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.350
Yeah, like a friend.

318

Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

319
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice the walls of that cruise ship just notice if there are any wall just to get a sense of where you are in that imagery, I noticed

320
00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful elevator and all the stores and you were seeing the ocean and the dolphins and is there. Are you in a room or where are you on that cruise ship.

321
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:14.100
Bianca Garcia: I think I was like in the lobby, because that's where the elevator and all the lights were at

322
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Later, and there's flights describe the lights to me.

323
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:36.840
Bianca Garcia: Well, it was like a bright yellow. It was not like the white light. It was at the yellow lights and it was like a turquoise color lights also on the elevator.

324
00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And they also had lights like on the stairs to each like like it's like a circle all the way going up, you know, you know,

325
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Floor. So I have like on the under

326
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.500
The rails.

327
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel emotionally in this space.

328
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: How does the body feel

329
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.250

331
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna put this little exercise we're going to put this as something to continue to work on and develop

332
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You did fantastic

333
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I was asking you to kind of go to that that fantasy and although there was some trepidation like, Well, I want to know the rules are you eventually you left went for it. And as soon as you left, then all these descriptions, even these

334
00:41:50.760 --> 00:42:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Adjectives just came rolling out then they just flowed. That's what I'm looking for. There's no wrong way for you to do this, I can do it wrong. So I've got to keep an eye on me, but you can't do it wrong.

335
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

336
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:21.090
Bianca Garcia: No cuz I was like wait, what does she want me to say like, I'm like, does she want me to say like I'm adding an extra room to my house or like you know me wanting that for my house. I don't know what I was thinking. But yeah, it seemed like I was trying to follow some rules you

337
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, okay. That's okay. So that's part of what the therapist is doing. I'm thinking, I'll do all that work for you. All you have to do the same. When you're in group to

338
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever this thing that comes up for you, whatever that thought is feeling, whatever the belief

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the things that we're interested in. Want to know what is coming back with that means what's coming up. Oh.

340
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I just thought of a cruise ship. Well, then we want to know. But if you scratch that down and say that's not what one. Once we just had a missed opportunity. So try not to edit yourself. Okay, good. All right. Nicely done.

341
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.470
Bianca Garcia: Do I do that a lot, though right it in myself.

342
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, um, here's what I see you ask a lot of questions to make sure you understand correctly.
