108
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:46.920
Sherrie Martinez: Putting it I have it on my knee and my hands, that's been bothering me a lot. So I've been just putting it on my hands and and they prescribed it to me.

109
00:07:48.450 --> 00:08:03.240
Sherrie Martinez: And it's just, it's everything just not the skin. It's like my hands are in my knee and it's a card like clicks. Every time I'm walking stuff that's been bugging me this why I don't know all of a sudden

110
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.380
You're

111
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.500

112
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything. It's the weather. How's the weather.

113
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.000

114
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.160
Sherrie Martinez: It's

115
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.380
Sherrie Martinez: It's really hot. We have our air conditioners on now.

116
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:33.180
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, we have to put our air conditioners, but um yeah so it bothered me this week. Big time. And I didn't like it, and it's never got back my hands up really bad. Yeah, so

117
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:34.770
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah.

118
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.540
Sherrie Martinez: Are you able to see your doctor.

119
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:46.410
Sherrie Martinez: Well, no, I have already seen him. I have seen him to like a virtual clinic like this and he gave me the cream and stuff, but I need to see him because they're hurting

120
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:57.000
Sherrie Martinez: Like they're hurting. It's not actually the the scratching and all the sort of like the sun is on it. It's they're hurting me.

121
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.730
Sherrie Martinez: Like it's hurting to pick up things now and into my knee my knee back

122
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.510
Sherrie Martinez: Net that this one but this one. It's really bad. I started respecting it so much.

123
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:18.120
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, so basically it's the way it looks ugly and I never thought that that bugs me because I never had my legs like that.

124
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's a internal right it's not external so it's not the psoriasis. It's got to be like in the bones or something.

125
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:35.940
Sherrie Martinez: I can get asked to do with bones and my skin or some reason, I don't know, I just wanted to get that ugliness off so they gave me some cream.

126
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:36.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

127
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:47.250
Sherrie Martinez: And on my hands. Oh, especially back to wear gloves out and everything that loves made it even worse, and then wash my hands too much made it oh 10 times worse.

128
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, I believe it.

129
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.910
Sherrie Martinez: That's all that's been bugging me. Is this some this week is just this

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wish there was a different kind of gloves that you could use that wouldn't affect your horizon so bad you know

154
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:24.390
Sherrie Martinez: I know yes it does in a do it affects it when I go out to the store. I have my master, we have, I have quite a few masks, even for the kids. We have them like really nicely designed

155
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:38.130
Sherrie Martinez: Uh huh. And we go out and I have been wearing gloves. I wear gloves everything and it really bothers them. I mean, that just when I take them off my hands are swollen and red.

156
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh wow, what kind of gloves news.

157
00:11:42.660 --> 00:12:00.840
Sherrie Martinez: Well, I just been using these white like I guess the surgical gloves. We got them from a website because we couldn't find any in the stores. There's none at Walgreens at Walmart, Target, anyway. So we ordered some and first pair of that came the box that came with

158
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:08.820
Sherrie Martinez: None of us could put them on our hands. We ordered another box. We got wheat. Sighs What medium, they'll fit. They really

159
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.490
Sherrie Martinez: Anything that I put on my hands.

160
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it sounds

161
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sounds like you might have an allergic reaction to latex to the gloves themselves.

162
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.270
Sherrie Martinez: I never checked that I was thinking that to my step mom was telling me on my because when I took them off. Oh my.

163
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.240
Sherrie Martinez: Goodness, you need to check that.

164
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. That's what it sounds like to me maybe try. What about some kind of there's other kinds of gloves. You can get that are latex free

165
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.350
Sherrie Martinez: And I was thinking, just to wear

166
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.990
Sherrie Martinez: Normal gloves, like, you know, like

167
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, England's or something.

168
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.410
Sherrie Martinez: Just like went to last one is awesome. I guess after

169
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.060
Sherrie Martinez: Because those don't bother me like a pair of little kind of

170
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.930
Sherrie Martinez: Like, yeah, yeah. And those don't bother me.

171
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe you should

172
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:02.790
And then

173
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:04.980
Sherrie Martinez: Next,

174
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or you could put those on and then put the latex gloves over them.

175
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.070
Sherrie Martinez: That's very smart. Yes, I have to get large

176
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:17.910
But yes.

177
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.530
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, that's, that's very true.

178
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, and safe. You know what I mean.

179
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if they get worse. I would get back in with your doctor.

180
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.220
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, and he's pretty good about

181
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.350
Sherrie Martinez: See me right away.

182
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

183
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:36.060
Yeah.

184
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. And how has your mental state been

185
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.820
Sherrie Martinez: My mental state. Oh, I think it's, I kind of have like I'm

186
00:13:49.860 --> 00:14:03.030
Sherrie Martinez: Like racing that in the night when I'm not falsely having racing thoughts about everything about my son about my life about my past everything I just think about things that feel guilty.

187
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.710
Sherrie Martinez: And then after a while, I guess I'm racing so much that I fall asleep.

188
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.940
Sherrie Martinez: But that's it. Nothing else. I don't feel

189
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:19.440
Sherrie Martinez: I don't feel sad or suicidal or anything, as long as the subject of my son, leaving comes up.

190
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:20.970
Sherrie Martinez: I'm okay.

191
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.140
Sherrie Martinez: Still has a whole year of school, so I have to always remember that he has your school

192
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.690
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, or change his mind.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.870
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, then you know yeah

194
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, and you just got to keep that in the forefront of your mind. You know what I mean, and don't give it too much space right now. You know, because he does have a year left before he goes

195
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

196
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just don't know you know his path might veer a different direction. You just, you just don't know.

197
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.240
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Sometimes

198
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:09.840
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, it seems like he's pretty getting everything done and getting ready, they're just waiting for him to graduate. But since my mother came from.

199
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.180
Sherrie Martinez: Now you see his dad more. That's what surprised me. He wasn't like that with it that

Sherrie Martinez: He wasn't like, you know, wanting to visit his data for with is that like that.

207
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:06.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is given him an opportunity. You know, when kids grow their one thing about kids as they're the most forgiving. You know what I mean. And

208
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sounds like he's given his dad an opportunity

209
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:18.240
Sherrie Martinez: I didn't know. So because he's always been close to me. Becky and but now. Wow. I'm see that just wants to be with

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is cool. Oh.

216
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:50.340
Yeah.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's your relationship with them.

Sherrie Martinez: Yeah. Oh, great. I think we're better off friends and been married

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.290
Sherrie Martinez: Go.

223
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.630
Sherrie Martinez: Oh, amazing. Okay, so I didn't drink this weekend because I have to be there.

224
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:51.420
Sherrie Martinez: Well, I drink like I think of beer not shocked I drink beer.

225
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.610
Sherrie Martinez: But it wasn't like a whole bunch of years. I wasn't chugging or anything.

226
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:06.420
Sherrie Martinez: Mom, I think, I think like one or two beers cool down and stuff. After the work. IT WAS ON SATURDAY AND THEN SUNDAY.

227
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.490
Sherrie Martinez: We had a couple

228
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.040
Sherrie Martinez: But it wasn't a whole bunch

229
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.710
Sherrie Martinez: It was beers, not my partner.

230
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.260
Sherrie Martinez: Right. And I got back into town.

231
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:24.840
Sherrie Martinez: I got back into town on Monday. And yes, I went and got up shocks right away. I went and got my spin on

232
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:40.860
Sherrie Martinez: So I didn't have it. The weekend and a half years just couple some really like on that. I'll see someone you know it was hot and we have worked Saturday. So, Saturday, Sunday, I didn't have it Monday when I got back into town.

233
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:48.840
Sherrie Martinez: I went right away and got my SPIN ON AND YESTERDAY. No today. Not yet.

234
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

235
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.450
Sherrie Martinez: But not really.

236
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cuz we're

237
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.710
Sherrie Martinez: Not coming into town with with that wanted

238
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

239
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when

240
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.440
What I want you

241
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:05.820
Sherrie Martinez: I

242
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.200
Sherrie Martinez: Want for their away.

243
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

244
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense.

245
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.640
Sherrie Martinez: I get sad for them and I missed them and so on.

246
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.260
Sherrie Martinez: But not a lot though. I don't drink bottles. I do.

247
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.000
Sherrie Martinez: And I know it's still not good for my health and everything that I do.

248
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And because you're on Suboxone

249
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

250
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So boxy and alcohol or not a good mix.

251
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:46.080
Sherrie Martinez: Tell me why, tell me, because if you give me a good reason then also looking really, I mean all if it's gonna really mess with my health, then I'll scare everything scares me. Tell me what it does something back to me.

252
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.710
Sherrie Martinez: So I might get scared and I will

253
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So, um, what happens with Suboxone is that attaches itself to the receptors that the opioids attached to. Right.

254
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.350
Sherrie Martinez: So, it blocks that piece.

255
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:13.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so there is a there is a minimal amount of opioids in Suboxone. All right, which is a depressant right alcohol is a depressant.

256
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.210
Sherrie Martinez: Oh,

257
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're adding

258
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.090
Sherrie Martinez: To depressing depressing.

259
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:24.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly. And so, hold on. I gotta my door just came open for a second, hold on me close my door.

260
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:24.900
All right.

261
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're adding two depressants in your body at the same time.

262
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, right.

263
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're not going to get the same effect taking Suboxone out of drinking because it covers those receptors alcohol and opioids attach themselves to the same receptors.

264
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.380
Okay.

265
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:03.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But with enough alcohol, you can knock it knock off the Suboxone off of those receptors and go into full blown withdrawal.

266
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

267
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.840
Sherrie Martinez: I understand it. I see sometimes

268
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.800
Sherrie Martinez: That it doesn't work.

269
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:11.790
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah.

270
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:18.990
Sherrie Martinez: That's why. Okay. And I didn't know why. And while I kind of Dean and I kind of figured

271
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:31.140
Sherrie Martinez: It doesn't seem to work when I drink, but when I don't drink it works perfectly fine. Yeah. So I did kind of notice that. Okay, so you make it. That's a lot of sense. Oh, see, yes.

272
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.330
Sherrie Martinez: Okay. All right. I didn't know that.

273
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like

274
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's dangerous because with two depressants in your system.

275
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you can

276
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go to sleep and not wake up.

277
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really know you think about it, right.

278
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so when you

279
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ever think about it, when you overdose on opioids you overdose because you take such a

280
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.960
Sherrie Martinez: Such a high amount that you quit.

281
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You quit breathing.

282
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.230
Sherrie Martinez: Your high school right

283
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your heart slows down everything slows down.

284
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.180
So,

285
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you OD everything slows down to a point that it stops.

286
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

287
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.110
Sherrie Martinez: OK, I understand.

288
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you've done yeah and

289
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:26.370
Sherrie Martinez: That's the thing that scares me and you put that in my mind and I. Other than that, things like that scares me. I will stop because

290
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.280
Sherrie Martinez: I have to be here for my children.

291
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

292
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:41.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you're you struggle too badly with it. You can always ask the doctor about medication for the cravings, because there is medication that they have for that.

293
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you are trying to stop and it's not working, talk to the doctor about that and he can put you on some temporary medication to help you with that piece of it until you, you know, are able to stop altogether. Okay.

294
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.970
Sherrie Martinez: Okay thank you know that's not nice. No.

295
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's not a good cocktail.

296
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.740
Know,

297
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:12.120
Sherrie Martinez: Now I'm worried now my mind playing along worries. Okay, this task, stop.

298
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.890
Sherrie Martinez: Yes. Oh.

299
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.340
Yeah.

300
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:28.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No idea. You know, is to get you to a point where you can be completely clean and sober. Right. And eventually, at one point, get off the box and so that you can have that clean and sober life. Right. Yes.

301
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.740
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, I would love that.

302
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.020
Sherrie Martinez: That would be awesome.

303
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's the goal.

304
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.450
Sherrie Martinez: Okay. Okay. Yes.

305
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you're this week, when you're

306
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you find yourself and you're trying not to to drink. You're trying not to drink. You're trying not to drink, and it's not working. Try your virtual group.

307
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.470
Sherrie Martinez: See if that helps to get out of

308
00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:02.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your head. See if it helps you get out of bed. All right, you're not going to do a perfect and I don't expect you to do a perfect but I

309
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do expect you to try

310
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.130
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, of course. I do track, I guess.

311
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:14.700
Sherrie Martinez: I will, and I want to I want it bad. So I do try. I want to be.

312
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.190
Sherrie Martinez: Sober right, Mom.

313
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.500
Sherrie Martinez: Mother, did you

314
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, I know you're good, Jerry, you know, and you've, you are doing what you need to do and you just got to keep doing it. You know, and it's not going to be easy. I'm not gonna lie. You know, it's not easy.

315
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's doable.

316
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:51.420
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, it is. I've tried, and I've done it before, but I just fall back into the same thing. I'm kind of because of it seems like I have to leave this town to get away from me. That's how it feels to me.

317
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.160
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, yeah. Because there's so many influences and people and friends. And so it's hard.

318
00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is hard.

319
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is hard. You've just got to be stronger than all of that.

320
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:10.890
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah, and that's why I like being home now because I don't have to, but then sometimes they come here, they

321
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:18.540
Sherrie Martinez: Don't I don't have to answer them. And a lot of times I have. I don't. So, yeah.

322
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It makes a difference.

323
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. So that's, that's kind of what I want you to try this week. All right.

324
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:35.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if it can stop it. Two out of three times or even one out of three times in the beginning, then that's that's progress.

325
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.710
Sherrie Martinez: Right. Yes.

326
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. So I just want to throw that out there, too, is that I don't expect you to do it 100% the first week that we're trying to implement this stuff. You know what I mean.

327
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not a failure.

328
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So don't even think for one second that is a failure because it's not

329
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's progress.

330
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, did you have you talked to the doctor about your racing thoughts before bed. Is it, are you having nightmares and is it disrupting asleep.

331
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:18.060
Sherrie Martinez: I'm Whoa, oh my god. One night I had a horrible like there. It was just a scariest thing and I still haven't forgotten it is still like I'm

332
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:23.610
Sherrie Martinez: messes up my sleep because I'm scared to go in that certain blown cuz of that nightmare.

333
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:31.170
Sherrie Martinez: And I won't sleep in there. I've been like sleeping on the couch and stuff cause of that nightmare. But that was the only nightmare. I have

334
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:41.790
Sherrie Martinez: No, I haven't had any usually I have great dreams. I don't know. I want to stay asleep or I want to fall back asleep to get the same dream. Just that one time that was

335
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.020
Sherrie Martinez: And I'm terrified of that will

336
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:47.970
Sherrie Martinez: I won't go in there.

337
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:52.350
Sherrie Martinez: And

338
00:26:54.210 --> 00:27:03.990
Sherrie Martinez: All these voicemails coming in whole bunch of voicemails keep coming in. Okay. Yeah, so that was the only night. It's been about a week or maybe two weeks that I've had it.

339
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:13.920
Sherrie Martinez: That night, man. I haven't had it and has happened to me again. I don't know if it was real or if it was a nightmare. I don't know, I can't, I don't know if it was well

340
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.210
Sherrie Martinez: I did. He is that real, but I don't

341
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.630
Sherrie Martinez: I don't. I just know I woke up.

342
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:31.560
Sherrie Martinez: And tears in freaking out and sat up and I couldn't even put my feet off the bed and go run to the light because I was scared.

343
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:33.990
Sherrie Martinez: But

344
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:34.440
Sherrie Martinez: Yeah.

345
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe you need to smudge the room.

346
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:50.940
Sherrie Martinez: With one of those. I have one, what's it called, it's like a little. Yes. And it's like a and it smells good, kind of like wait like take center stage.

347
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.160
Sherrie Martinez: I have one. And I have one. And I've been saving it and I bought it a long time ago.

348
00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:05.670
Sherrie Martinez: And maybe it was something holding me like down with like blankets. It was the scariest thing I've ever felt in my life.

349
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:27.300
Sherrie Martinez: And they were like cat blankets and I could see Prince on my bed like Bonnie Prince of people, the people to I think we're holding it was just the scariest thing never nothing like that ever happened to me, my entire life until that night. And so that really, really messed up my mind.

350
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:40.110
Sherrie Martinez: And I seen it about real and I remember trying to call out, but I couldn't remember I couldn't call out and I was going like that I couldn't get anything out.

351
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:49.740
Sherrie Martinez: And then finally I just said, Please stop. And I started doing my prayer say my prayers and it stopped, and then I sat up and it was so dark.

352
00:28:50.220 --> 00:29:02.910
Sherrie Martinez: pitch dark in my room. I was looking for my phone out of it. I found it and I got the light but I put it to me and I was too terrified to look around, you know, because I felt like something was still there.

353
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:14.490
Sherrie Martinez: I don't know. That was just weird. It was just the scariest thing like I would didn't want to look up or sideways, because I thought there's something still in that room with me or some it was

354
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:23.310
Sherrie Martinez: Never, never, nothing like that happened to me. I am still terrified to this day. I mean to go in that room. I will walk in that room.

355
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.360
Sherrie Martinez: I don't know if it was real.

356
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:35.550
Sherrie Martinez: Right, and that's the only time in my whole life anything's happened to me like that. And it hasn't happened since since I've never gotten that just

357
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of signifies the battle that you're going through

358

359
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:49.350
Sherrie Martinez: But I do have that sage and it's wrapped it's green, and it's wrapped in some like white bread.

360
00:29:50.490 --> 00:30:06.180
Sherrie Martinez: And but I've never, I've never been to one maybe now you're telling me before I looked it up and stuff. And I believe it, but maybe I should do it. And that yeah I maybe I'll go do it. And then you just just burn it and then just wave it around. Yeah.

361
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's one and

362
