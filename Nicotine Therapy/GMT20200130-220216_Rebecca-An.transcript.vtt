48
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:18.060

161
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.570
Dawn Ninham: Or at least I didn't notice it.

162
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And what about it's going back further. How was school for you. And did you graduate. Did you have a learning disability.

163

Dawn Ninham: I didn't graduate, I am actually I was in like the title one for reading and

165
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.670
Dawn Ninham: And then when I went to a huge goal like downtown because

172
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.800
Dawn Ninham: Let's see 2000

173
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:44.580
Dawn Ninham: I'm not sure when 15 or 1413 maybe I had gotten picked up for drinking or whatever. And I was drunk and I only remember. So, and then when I got the answer that.

174
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.560
Dawn Ninham: I had a

175
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.420
Dawn Ninham: Personality pipe on me. And I don't remember any of that either because I didn't even use that

176
00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:06.240
Dawn Ninham: But apparently that's what I had on the end. So I did a probation three years probation and I tested for, I don't even know I'm 30 times. I don't know. And so they let me off of the testing part and then I graduated that so they took off my record which was cool.

177
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is cool. I didn't remember

178
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.770

Probably my

206
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.760
Dawn Ninham: Probably just my

207
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:32.340
Dawn Ninham: To stay positive me. I gotta keep on telling myself just the right thoughts, you know, I mean, because I'm I need to get my fix, but

208
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.000
Dawn Ninham: So I can be happy if I'm happy with myself. I'll be a happier person all around.

209
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:39.840
Okay.

210
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.870

211
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.640

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And anything else.

214
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you can think of at the moment.

215
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:11.520
Dawn Ninham: No other dog. Oh, psychologist lady that I think learns or whatever in October. She said that if I can remember from 10 years old back, it's probably best that I didn't

216
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.160
Dawn Ninham: My mind probably told you. I mean, I don't remember that. It's probably better than I've been trying to dig it up.

217
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.560
Dawn Ninham: Just by better

218
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, so what we want to do.

219
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:42.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What we want to do is really treatment plan, you know, your cognitive thought process changing your thoughts from negative to positive and really kind of focus on that and building your self esteem and allowing you the forum to be able to process what you're going through with the state.

220
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that you have that support and. And the idea would be for you. The goal would be for you to

221
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:55.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: start practicing what we're what we, you and I are going to be working on in these individual sessions.

222
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To your day to day life. And so being able to notice a difference. Probably two out of three times a day with some of the things that we're going to work on and really building, you know, your self worth, and your self esteem and putting different things in place to help you work on that.

223
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will be what we, you and I do, when is the best time to meet with you and I, on a weekly basis.

224
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.260
Dawn Ninham: Morning really good, but lately. I think it's just because

225
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:41.250
Dawn Ninham: I'm an over sleeping. You know, like, well, because he gets off work at 2AM. So when he gets home. Boom. You know, he walks in and we talk of course. And then, and then. So finally we get back to sleep like 330 or, you know, three or 330 and then

226
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:53.010
Dawn Ninham: I've sleeping until like 11 because I don't have any like responsibilities. I don't you know get I usually would be getting up at five, six and take my kids to school and, you know, doing all my morning things and

227
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just sleep around the clock. Okay, so

228
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.580
Dawn Ninham: But then, my legs are so bad. So cool. Oh my god.

229
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which makes it tough, it's hard to go out and walk. Whenever you, you know, yeah, whenever you've got that issue so

230
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why don't we

231
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:20.340

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It could do it in an email fashion or they can send it directly to if you have a release of information with bright heart than they can do it directly to the courts but you actually want to copy of that yourself to hold on to.

242
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.500
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I think so. If I can send it to me. I could probably go the mail room.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.360
Dawn Ninham: Social Worker last six months.

285
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's why it's so important that you keep your documentation together.

286
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay you gather your information, you keep your documentation together, you make sure that when you go into court that you give her a copy, and that you keep a copy

287
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that she Oh no. So she can't say that things have been lost because they have big huge workloads. So, you know, you want to make sure she has that. But you have a copy

288
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that way. You've got everything that he's asked you for at hand.

289
00:25:53.130 --> 00:26:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's vitally important. And you know your worker right now. Yeah, she's an advocate for the courts and they really have this whole perception that you have to prove you're guilty until proven innocent.

290
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it. Part of it is

291
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:15.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Part of that is just because with, you know, a lot of the people that they do work. Work with that's exactly what it is is that they're playing the system and play in the system.

292
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So a lot harder for people that are actually

293
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:35.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Learning. Yeah. Yeah. And so you just know that that it's nothing personal. It's just their experience and you just you know will work on how to work with workers as well. And the other thing can be frustrating.

294
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.130
Dawn Ninham: My last one was awesome. Like everything

295
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.450
Dawn Ninham: She wrote a report was was

296
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:51.690
Dawn Ninham: Was wonderful because that's who we are, you know, like there wasn't anything negative about us just that we had that relapse relapse that actually the first six months of our RC. We got our kids back

297
00:26:52.710 --> 00:27:00.210
Dawn Ninham: But my husband went to court because you will earn my boyfriend, because my teenage daughter didn't want to come back to this little motor home.

298
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:06.180
Dawn Ninham: should want to see if she can stay in court, a state in the foster care for another week until we bought our motorhome and then tell support to our money.

299
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.700
Dawn Ninham: So he didn't get the motor on

300
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That house.
