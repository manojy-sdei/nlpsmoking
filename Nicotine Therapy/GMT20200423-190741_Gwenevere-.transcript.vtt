Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

5
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.470
Lauren Anderson: How are you

6
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Let's first, let me just run through the whole system's track here.

7
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me make sure that you are hearing me in sync.

8
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: With the video so everything I'm saying is in sync.

9
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: everything I'm saying can see my mouth and it's in sync with audio.

10
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.100
Lauren Anderson: Yep.

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and here's this too. So that's a double thumbs up. We're good.

12
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.170
Very good.

13
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not you know I had sent you a quick message saying I'm going to be five minutes late.

14
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Ended up being right on time.

15
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But so it's okay. We're here now.

16
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.920
Lauren Anderson: Okay that's I actually, I keep that advantage of that five minutes. I'm sorry. And then I'm eight minutes late, so sorry, I should be on time anyways. And then maybe I'll be on time.

17
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's look at what you did do.

18
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at because I was checking because everybody's kind of I've been sending kind of playing with different ways to kind of approach my text.

19
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How to how to encourage people to make sure they don't

20
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: wait too long to check in, because it's taking so much longer in there.

21
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just check in on how that felt

22
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: A text vs. Hey, make sure you kind of check in a few minutes early versus just hey confirming for tomorrow, do one or the other cause any distress to you.

23
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:14.580
Lauren Anderson: Know, I mean, I was I was used to the one you know where you asked me the day before that's good that we know we're on the same page. And no, I took that as like a gold star, you know, that was nice because I'm always running late. So I did all the up and down the street.

24
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so actually what I'm talking about. Let me just check myself. I gotta

25
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.620
Lauren Anderson: Make I

26
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Did this correctly. So, I mean, look at your message last night. What I'm asking, Where is it

27
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is very specific to

28
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.260
Lauren Anderson: Oh, I didn't even see your last text. Nope, I'm on times you 110 I'm sorry I did not see that I got the running five late

29
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the one I'm talking about right now is none of those none of that. What I'm doing is I'm comparing Good evening, tomorrow's individual therapy appointment for 23

30
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: When 10 please text me back right i do that one. And then I added this fit.

31
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The bit about

32
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.210
Lauren Anderson: Oh this appointment may be offered to kind

33
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.390
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, that made sure I checked in by 1245

34
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.130
Lauren Anderson: Well, I made sure I did. I didn't want you to think maybe wasn't coming. So, and then I took her up and down the street so

35
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, so when you checked in. Did you make sure you had an alarm said did you get in there by 1245

36
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. Okay.

37
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.770
Lauren Anderson: Dan rewinder

38
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.150
Lauren Anderson: Because I lose track of time.

39
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it help you show or at least side from the

40
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: When I said just ignored for a moment. The concept of my sending I'm running late. Just ignore that for a second. Did having the reminder that it takes time to check in that there's all these other little pieces that are involved in going new virtual clinic. Was that helpful.

41
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.580
Lauren Anderson: I'm just telling you they might give it away. If I didn't check in by 1245 I think it actually helped me

42
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:08.490
Lauren Anderson: Make sure I was on time, the appointment last week or the week before I think it was last week. I actually had to call a friend and have him zip me home because I lost track of time and I was with my dog with f

43
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.720
Lauren Anderson: Miles away.

44
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:27.810
Lauren Anderson: And I, I looked at my phone and my alarm went off to remind me and it was 20 minutes for my appointment. And so for example. So yeah, that was helpful. A reminder and I set alarm for myself to remind me to check in at 1245 yeah it was helpful.

45
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of us take a deep breath, because I got a question for you after that.

46
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just turn turn to this is the space is about your growth your development just getting something is of service to you.

47
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of settle into that truth.

48
00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's why we're here today. We're both just exploring different ways that we can do behavioral experiments you know just how do we want to kind of, how do you want to feel today at the end.

49
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, kind of setting setting an intention, maybe for yourself, of how you want to feel at the end of today.

50
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just give yourself permission to to want that to even consider what you want.

51
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

52
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

53
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're at the heart of this

54
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What you what you need. What you want what you prefer.

55
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The Reed. Do you know the reason why I brought up this text thing right it's it was because I had made up a story in my head. And this is the intervention right now.

56
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The what I made up in my head was

57
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Should I send texts like this to Lauren

58
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I hurt her feelings. What if I offend her

59
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that that ran through my head but I hear you now. And it, it doesn't even sound like that happened, you didn't. You didn't get offended.

60
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But can you imagine someone that could

61
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:32.730
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I think so. I understand. Yeah, the part where if you don't by 1245 I'm gonna let other people know. Yeah, I could see how it could rub someone wrong, I guess. Yeah.

62
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:42.600
Lauren Anderson: It's kind of like a threat, I guess, but for me it was helpful and the way you worded it, I don't know, like I've said before, I know your intentions are good.

63
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.990
Lauren Anderson: Which helps with the interpretation.

64
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. It helps a lot. Now flip flipping them out. Imagine that someday, you're looking to somehow our schedule gets so booked up and you're on the other end of your on the on call list.

65
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine you're on call and you actually start to dig this therapy thing you're starting to move and groove and you're like, I want to meet with you as soon as you have an opening and you're on that list.

66
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And just imagine that I send that text out and I send it the same to everyone, which I did last night I sent. I was like, Okay, I'm going to send this the same way to everybody.

67
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine that you're the one that's kind of hoping that they'll be a cancellation.

68
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:29.940
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

69
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't it be nice to know so that you'd have 15 minutes to leave a Starbucks run home, get your Wi Fi setup, real quick, use the ladies room and jump in when you want that time to do it.

70
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.200
Lauren Anderson: Right, absolutely.

71
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see that it's from all these different angles and I am learning and earning a living right and I want all of you to try and attend your appointments, obviously, but

72
00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.950
Lauren Anderson: I might as well. You know what the

73
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.870
Lauren Anderson: time wasted though either someone's not going to show up right so

74
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only that,

75
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'm experimenting with this on call list.

76
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm liking it.

77
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool, yeah.

78
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.970
Lauren Anderson: Can you think of the video therapy. Anyways, right. So it's kind of a little bit of

79
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All

80
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.770
Lauren Anderson: Let's see what works.

81
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Programs. We've gotten they've gotten a pretty good group going but now there's all these raps and personality tests all there's a lot of still new things happening. But for me.

82
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The on call list is new for me and I'm still I'm still trying to see if I like it. I'm trying to see if my clients like it, but what I can just see that the downside of it is that text.

83
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.330
Lauren Anderson: I was actually

84
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.570
Lauren Anderson: Before you sent that yesterday I was actually thinking, you know,

85
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:59.550
Lauren Anderson: I wonder how available. She would be if I'm like having a crisis moment and I get ahold go into the virtual clinic and they say, hey, could you please think of when the message, I'd probably text you to, if I were in a bad spot am in a bad spot. Please try and meet with me.

86
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:16.890
Lauren Anderson: So yeah, and I just been thinking about that yesterday afternoon. I wonder how quickly how available. She could be and just thinking how grateful I am for this video thing because I already. I've got a better track record of showing up and being closer to on time. At least I mean really.

87
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.110
Lauren Anderson: Got a really bad track record was

88
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.980
Lauren Anderson: showing up on time or at all. So, yeah.

89
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see it. I can see it. And sometimes, just little representations of that where we can see ourselves holding ourselves accountable getting managing time and they seem like oh, time management know

90
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Be having a sense of, I know, I know what I need and what right now. And also, at the same time, I've got this time thing happening.

91
00:09:48.840 --> 00:10:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an expectation out there, it's out there and and what do I need right now. It's important I don't I don't take it for granted. I think, I think it is a key piece I think of recovery, too. So I'm I think it's really admirable that

92
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You showed up because I looked in there. I was like, I wonder what time. Right. So I noticed around. I was like, I wonder, what time should check in. Now I can never see when people hit the waiting room in virtual clinic that I can never see

93
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.810
Lauren Anderson: Oh really, it's when they actually get face to face with me.

94
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes. So here's what I got for you.

95
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what it says. Lauren. Yes, I went to see they I got a message from from a fella at way. That's my time your time, your time.

96
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:51.150
Lauren Anderson: 157 157 I checked in at like about 1246 seven because my alarm went off and then I got on and check it and it always says, I don't know if it's just a generic wait time no matter what it is, but whenever I've checked in. It says 10 to 15 minute wait

97
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So no, let's use that this is good stuff.

98
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.940
Lauren Anderson: You think I should be checking in earlier. So yeah, so then I'm actually registered by 1245

99
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, think about how that could have gone wrong.

100
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if I was really watching for 1245 I might have said something like, Hey, I'm

101
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.700
Lauren Anderson: Contact you're on call person.

102
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey dude, is anybody in the waiting room is Lauren sitting in the waiting room and let's say it's

103
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right at 45. What is that right, and they'll be like, no, she ain't here. And I would be like, Oh, I'm going to call my own call person. So you had your time set for the time

104
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Be in the waiting room that's still a risky. It's risky play

105
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.520
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean,

106
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I might set it since I know it takes me a second to slash cold water. Have a sip quick run to the restroom. I might set it for five minutes just to move throughout the place and to and what if this does happen. I'm not going to kid you

107
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes zoom says, oh, yeah, we have a new version. And we're updating and so work it out and you sit there going,

108
00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.940
Lauren Anderson: Oh, gotta come back through social media.

109
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that buffer does is give you time

110
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.550
Lauren Anderson: For like yeah

111
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.860
Lauren Anderson: I'm glad you actually called me on that. I think I do that in general with things. I

112
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:27.930
Lauren Anderson: And that makes me late for things I and I intentionally Alma, I think I do it not set alarms for those times where, you know, I am all I always end up being late. I'm not giving myself that window that becomes a customer and used to being tardy, I guess.

113
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: More sometimes bigger

114
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: psychological thing than just on the surface.

115
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.150
Lauren Anderson: Right, yeah. Hey,

116
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just take a regular deadline will all come way out here and then you, you, you, you tell me what feels true for you. So, for a lot of people, they'll say to me, oh, you know what I want to work on. I want to work on my procrastination. I've been putting this thing on for so long.

117
00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And they'll say, I know it's the right thing to do. I really want it. I literally state up and lose sleep. I think about it so much. And I talked to my friends about it. I'm am

118
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I going to do this thing.

119
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't do it.

120
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we talk about what procrastination is for them and what we learn. Well, they find out what you already know about procrastination. What do you already have in your understanding about that.

121
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:32.010
Lauren Anderson: Uh, well, it was one of those like trying to think of the term, maybe you can help me at this the words where you hear them. They're like Flash words code, what's the name for that.

122
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.180
Psychology.

123
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:44.130
Lauren Anderson: Like a thurs like Flash words where you hear them and the and it automatically remind you something not pneumonic device, not a flag or a banner.

124
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.340
Like

125
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:45.600
Lauren Anderson: An

126
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Acronym like

127
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Angry lonely tired.

128
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.430
Lauren Anderson: You know, like a

129
00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.600
Lauren Anderson: Man, it's been bugging me, you know, like your mind will work on it, it'll probably come to me out of nowhere.

130
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.590
Lauren Anderson: I'll let you know the word know it's like slash words like

131
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.130
Lauren Anderson: I can't even describe right now. But anyway, that's one of the ones from my dad's house.

132
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.580
Lauren Anderson: Procrastination procrastination integrity.

133
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.210
Lauren Anderson: Being open open communication.

134
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.630
Lauren Anderson: tell it like it is. These are

135
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:29.430
Lauren Anderson: Whatever. There are words that they use all the time as employee empty platitudes in a way

136
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:43.350
Lauren Anderson: But that's the word I'm looking for is not that they were for them. They were these like slogans, almost, you know, where they use them all the time, but they go to help me that there's a particular word for

137
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Racial slogans like inspirational maybe

138
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.100
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, but for them. It was more like a

139
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.370
Lauren Anderson: Not a red flag. But like

140
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.960
Lauren Anderson: To touch tone words flag words like a

141
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.960
Lauren Anderson: Almost like there.

142
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.540
Lauren Anderson: I don't know their mascot. Okay.

143
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.700
Lauren Anderson: You say, I got to

144
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:18.300
Lauren Anderson: Describe it. It will come to me, I'll, I'll text it to you. When I think of the term because I'm sure it'll come out of nowhere. But anyways, yeah, there were these things that they always

145
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:30.420
Lauren Anderson: Would say, and basically toting touting the idea of like how great these things are as character positive character attributes.

146
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.140
Lauren Anderson: Being open telling it like it is having integrity.

147
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.180
Don't procrastinate.

148
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.520
Lauren Anderson: Don't do a half assed job I'm

149
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.910
Lauren Anderson: Sure that's like that. So let's kind of that was one of them. Procrastination procrastination.

150
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Stay there.

151
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So let's take a breath, you and I

152
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So there were those words and

153
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I've invited. Just a little exploration and I mentioned one of them and it's on that list.

154
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And

155
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How we live by it.

156
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it really right so wasn't perfect Words To Live By. But not perfectly lived by and now I brought one of them up.

157
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:28.350
Lauren Anderson: I, I'm sorry, I don't want to be distracted. I'm just my thing is it's dying. I need to plug it in for real.

158
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.800
You

159
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Can do that.

160
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:40.590
Lauren Anderson: One or even use the real power cord. I plug it into my computer and my computer's acting up

161
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.600
Lauren Anderson: Like nowhere is a plug plug. I may have to relocate here. I really gotta

162
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.550
Lauren Anderson: procrastinating my apartment. I've never been in such a state of disorder, my life. This place is a mess.

163
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.080
Lauren Anderson: Sorry, I'm getting there.

164
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: In

165
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.730
Lauren Anderson: I think that's charging now.

166
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.380
Lauren Anderson: All right.

167
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

168
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the zoom pulls a lot of juice.

169
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Run the battery pulls a lot from it.

170
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, alright see

171
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:14.100
Lauren Anderson: Ya. Oh. There, that's better. So don't don't hold it. There we go. Can you see me okay

172
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I can and how I turn my volume back up while you were moving around. I turned it down, um, let me just get back in here, we're

173
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

174
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To have fun.

175
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

176
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

177
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What's something that is important to you that you would like to do. We've probably touched a little bit on it in previous sessions as well as in group something maybe that you want to get back involved in

178
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.920
Lauren Anderson: Doing kind of like life goals or things that I want to take care of it.

179
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Either one.

180
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not particular

181
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.450
Lauren Anderson: Um,

182
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:07.830
Lauren Anderson: Well,

183
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:17.670
Lauren Anderson: My whole life I've always saying and written songs and play piano and I've always loved to perform. I always knew that was what I was supposed to do.

184
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.330
Lauren Anderson: In written songs have always been writing songs

185
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:32.070
Lauren Anderson: So, I mean, ideally, I would like to contract ties give context where I see my songs, but also classical solo piano

186
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:39.840
Lauren Anderson: And maybe on the side like part time or something, teach high school or college math.

187
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.520
Lauren Anderson: Ideally,

188
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.030
Lauren Anderson: And maybe get some more a

189
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:53.760
Lauren Anderson: Viewing of my paintings and stuff. We have some more shows and stuff. It's more of a therapy thing for me painting, but still

190
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got each college math, the part, would you like to

191
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Perform your songs

192
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.820
Uh huh.

193
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to do it publicly like in a concert setting.

194
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:22.650
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, yeah. Because so many are written on piano and Lot classical style and ideally I would be, that's probably one of the most frustrating things for me as a songwriter.

195
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:36.930
Lauren Anderson: I really want a real piano acoustic piano and preferably a really good one. Like you know concert grand. So ideally, I mean if I had the right publicity agent or something someone to kind of

196
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:50.850
Lauren Anderson: You know, get the word out because I'm I just do not want to do that myself go to tooting my own horn cheerleading to get people to come but for those agents exists right but so I guess probably ideally the same kind of venue for both things.

197
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.720
Lauren Anderson: Maybe even sometimes a little mixing, you know, a couple solo piano classical pieces.

198
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.220
Lauren Anderson: And some of my songs to I've done that, that way before.

199
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take my hands here, let's take

200
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Like see this guy.

201
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

202
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say this is the performance

203
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're this guy.

204
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I gotta tell you, I'm I can't hold them up or along so I'm got this guy. Now, if this is how far you are right now.

205
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Apartment right

206
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there a time when you were further away.

207
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: From this goal.

208
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:50.250
Lauren Anderson: Oh um yeah I think kind of more than anything. It's just kind of I put everything on hold for

209
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:50.730
Lauren Anderson: The

210
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.780
Lauren Anderson: last several years.

211
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking so you see it right you can see there's a fair amount of distance in between, right.

212
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now his whole screen to get through.

213
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So this little guy right here in my, in my left hand. I don't know how it looks on your side, but he's over here.

214
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it take for him to just

215
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be a little step for him.

216
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:31.980
Lauren Anderson: A guy really need to get some kind of talent agent or representation, because it's never been something I'm comfortable with or want to become comfortable with and do a face to promoting and you know that whole bag. Okay.

217
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And thing so

218
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if I was the challenge agent, I would be like, Okay, so you have a whole set put together.

219
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.350
Lauren Anderson: Yeah. Oh, good. Hundreds of songs written

220
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.050
Lauren Anderson: Hours and hours performance ready. Sure.

221
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said, oh, this is like Kismet it's like I can't believe I just heard from you, like, you're going to go over here and you ready. I got the mic. I already have everything ready, you could just do it.

222
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:57.450
Yeah.

223
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay. So have you ever had a talent agent.

224
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:22.380
Lauren Anderson: No, um, I mean with classical piano. I've had the opportunity to concert eyes a bunch in Europe and little bit in the States, but mostly Europe, which is really fantastic. I've just kind of confirmed that that's where I belong. Who's on the stage performing

225
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's this this blah, this little thing here. Okay, that's this right here and you just told me that is it right in the middle. Like, it's that big of a leap like getting a talent agent might get you this far, or tell

226
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:48.900
Lauren Anderson: Someone organizing the yeah to create the events and everything would be a huge thing for me. I'm right now I'm working on. For example, I mean, I've got my songs always send me those

227
00:23:49.470 --> 00:24:06.480
Lauren Anderson: It's not as much prep. I could do a concert tonight. But right now I'm actually working on a couple different concert solo piano concerts Brahms entire piano works for example to concert special so much music but so I'm preparing now ready

228
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that's actually what you just described, get talent agent, it would move you like literally halfway over

229
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.960
Lauren Anderson: Or even close, or more than half.

230
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.450
Lauren Anderson: I guess I think so, yeah.

231
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.970
Lauren Anderson: I really had a good one that would that

232
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:31.140
Lauren Anderson: That like myself and saw the potential in it and wanted you know was, like, stoked to promote me and do that, and everything. Absolutely. Absolutely.

233
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say that this guy, this little crystal here is over here and you're you're in this guy. Um, what are the steps to get you to this.

234
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.610
Lauren Anderson: What to the agent burden.

235
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is an agent.

236
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.910
Lauren Anderson: Fuck if I know

237
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:58.440
Lauren Anderson: I don't know. Um, well, I do have like a little kind of in with them. Okay. My. I mean, you went to our church growing up. He was a bass opera singer.

238
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:06.420
Lauren Anderson: Like low big booming bass voice and he's a choir director. Now, my mom's in the choir and they always have me guest.

239
00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:14.670
Lauren Anderson: They don't give a choir concert. I'm the guest artists and I'll come and do a solo piano piece of classical so um I actually have

240
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:26.310
Lauren Anderson: Been putting it off. I could call him today I wanted to see if he and his wife think he'd be my music backer but she's really good at the promoting, at least for this first one to kind of see

241
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:34.200
Lauren Anderson: How it goes to see if they could help me organize a concert or a, like I said, a double concert for the Brahms collab your stupa

242
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:45.240
Lauren Anderson: Um, so I've been meaning to call him to see if they'd be interested in organizing that in some way, even if it's has to be like this because of this current social situations.

243
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking questions.

244
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.640
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

245
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's I don't know this part about you yet.

246
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, just let me have his name.

247
00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: First name.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Wayne. OK, so now here comes my real question. What is it about Wayne

249
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That you trust.

250
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That he can represent what you want for this concert just all the way through, just all the way through what describe what you've seen and what you've heard you yourself.

251
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:31.020
Lauren Anderson: Okay um I admired him as a musician and I'm

252
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.580
Lauren Anderson: in awe of his success as a musician his touring with opera.

253
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.880
Lauren Anderson: Opera when you call them.

254
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:51.240
Lauren Anderson: Companies, we, you know, and stuff like that doing that as his career, and then basically when you were tired started doing what he's doing now tha

255
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.580
Lauren Anderson: Conducting choir.

256
00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:03.630
Lauren Anderson: But anyways, and also that he he's a fan of mine, and he really really likes my interpretations. The way I play

257
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:14.040
Lauren Anderson: Music. He said, that's the way everyone should be playing. So with their heart. It's just, I don't know. He's just really blown away by my plane which is a huge compliment because

258
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:28.680
Lauren Anderson: I look up to him as a classical artists. Also, you know. So I know a that he supports me and and knows that I'm capable of it and as a completely positive supportive

259
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:40.620
Lauren Anderson: backing for that and his wife. I know that she has successfully organized the wire concerts and I know this is like this is more like a local thing at least right now starting. But I think

260
00:27:41.730 --> 00:28:02.010
Lauren Anderson: If I'm not doing drugs fucking off all the time and actually stick with him and him regular with him. I think he would ultimately he could very well help promote my music nationally and internationally. You know, if I show the, you know, stick to it and showing up and you know

261
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what I heard you admire him.

262
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Although this word wasn't you didn't use this word, but I'd like to just for ease

263
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if you can sit with it. He you admire him he admires you let's just kind of like that like

264
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: There's actual, like I like the way she I like the way he okay now that's not that's on a professional level. So there's this. Hey, I really sort of, well, that's, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Okay, now you're in all of his success.

265
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:46.050
Lauren Anderson: And he likes your my piano professor would also completely back me and support me

266
00:28:46.890 --> 00:29:00.120
Lauren Anderson: If I were to contact him. Let him know I'm planning on doing this stuff. He would also. So just, just put that in there. I'm not like going around my actual teacher so because he doesn't back me but

267
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you

268
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Describe if you could, I'm going to write it down promoter. What are the behaviors that they do, just kind of list them out for me. They

269
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:32.100
Lauren Anderson: Well, before we get into it. I don't know for sure. I mean, this is my idea for, for starters, but I don't know, especially with my own songs and stuff if if way and everything will be the route or want to go because my songs can be so

270
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.480
Lauren Anderson: unnerving for people

271
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.160
Lauren Anderson: Maybe weird awkward. I'm

272
00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.980
Lauren Anderson: At least, for starters, that's like an ultimate and i and i don't know it could so

273
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.080
Lauren Anderson: That's the question again.

274
00:29:49.680 --> 00:30:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I need it. I hope you don't get offended, but I won't be able to control your response to it, but you are of high energy is this organic or is from a substance.

275
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.620
Lauren Anderson: I mean, I'm having my coffee.

276
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

277
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been no stimulant in the last

278
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.450
Lauren Anderson: Few hour. No, not the last couple days. Um, I

279
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:24.240
Lauren Anderson: I have been, um, so I keep my sleep months and I sleep for an hour and a half, and then, and this has been like every night. And then I'm up all night.

280
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:37.230
Lauren Anderson: And then I finally go back to bed in the morning. So that's what I did today. It was after sunrise maybe was like 8am or something went back to bed. So I think that's kind of screwing with me a little bit.

281
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you doing all night.

282
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All night.

283
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.240
Lauren Anderson: To have very tired, trying to read, but just should have been sleeping.

284
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.340
Lauren Anderson: You know, after I woke up.

285
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:54.660
Lauren Anderson: I slept for about an hour and a half woke up and then the I was just trying to read, but then successfully because I was so tired because we obviously when

286
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It shows up, I can write it has a real witness difference. I'm not able to have a pause, which therapy. Does demand a space between the notes that might be a good metaphor for us.

287
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.070
Lauren Anderson: You know,

288
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Appreciate the music right it's gotta have space between the notes. Yeah.

289
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.350
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, my heart's pounding right now. I can feel it.

290
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.130
Haha

291
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

292
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get ahead and tell you what I'm up to. There's no mystery here. All I'm doing is this what were my questions are leading

293
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're leading to me getting to know you, Lauren, trying to understand

294
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you

295
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Are registering healthy boundaries with a Wayne, in other words like

296
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because you admire his work doesn't mean he's qualified to be your promoter. That's where I'm going. There's no mystery. That's what I'm up to, just so you know.

297
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:04.140
Lauren Anderson: I don't think he really is, I would. It was just an idea for an initial contract to kind of get me. That's what I was saying when you that's

298
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.800
Lauren Anderson: The last question, it's, I don't know. That's a permanent thing, it's just

299
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.560
Lauren Anderson: I'm dying to get some concert

300
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to get something in the

301
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.890
Lauren Anderson: Work and I know his wife can do that.

302
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do this. I think we found something else. Let's do this again watch. Let's say it's not promoter, maybe this

303
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is get my tissue on the stage and do a concert. What if it's that

304
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

305
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:39.000
Lauren Anderson: It's partly. But yeah, I really I need somebody to promote it unless I'm going to be out at advertising for myself.

306
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you want to do a concert. So can we break it down into smaller steps you can see me trying, I'm doing all these little gyrations up here to try and see the next step, not 100 ahead. Just one.

307
00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we're onto something if Wayne and his wife or whoever else I'm having to work really hard to track so

308
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Wayne

309
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Wayne's the guy you want to do, and like, I'm gonna reach out to and I'm just gonna see if it's a good fit. Maybe I can set up a concert

310
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think if you ended up doing that as your first step where you call them got a feel for whether it's even possible. What if that was your first step towards this.

311
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then you did it. You might engage in some other conversation with him. He might know 510 people it might lead to

312
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: These other really big steps that could lead to a promoter, but at least right this this sense of I want to get on the stage and perform it would really wish that what if it's okay that you just start there and see how you do.

313
00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.180
Lauren Anderson: What do you mean, what does the feeling that I want to go on stage and perform

314
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you want to

315
00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:08.730
Lauren Anderson: Use yeah I'm working towards that. Like I said, now, now that I'm feeling better. I've been practicing five to seven, eight hours every day and it's real. I'm trying to prepare this music polish it and memorize it. So I'm ready for a concert

316
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.610
Lauren Anderson: So I i'm not i guess i could be

317
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:21.450
Lauren Anderson: If I could pick whatever I want. I could be ready for a classical concert tonight or whatever. But if I want to do it right and polished and perfection everything

318
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:32.100
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, that's the first step is really just to continue practicing them polishing do exercises, but also to contact Wayne and throw my idea by him run minute

319
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that you didn't quite finish the sentence. Just like if I wanted to do it in a polished way I would set it for when would that be

320
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:51.990
Lauren Anderson: Whoa, it's really a to concert long deal if we're talking about the bronze.

321
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:57.990
Lauren Anderson: Oh good opens order to make sure it's really safe.

322
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:04.230
Lauren Anderson: Um, I think three months down the line to make it really safe.

323
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So that. Okay. Could it be that that distance away three months that that I don't have a new object for my concert here. Here's a concert

324
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Concert. This is

325
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: All kinds of cool stuff here. So here's the concert. Maybe this is right. It's practicing right

326
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's also a call.

327
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:44.430
Lauren Anderson: Now, um, it's okay. I mean part. I've got to take into consideration that I just took a really long break, which I'd never taken in my life before play piano every day of my life until I started doing heroin.

328
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.090
Lauren Anderson: Every day.

329
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:56.100
Lauren Anderson: So I gotta give myself a break a little bit, but I want to perform tomorrow it's okay to eat.

330
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Every go

331
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk about what is between right now.

332
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And three months performance.

333
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about what you see as possible barriers.

334
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To being polished and ready for that concert. What might get in the way.

335
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:38.100
Lauren Anderson: I'm for some reason. Everybody went offline. And I wasn't able to continue on my route runners i i'm i'd be very concerned that would definitely interfere

336
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:56.400
Lauren Anderson: Um, and I think I know I've been playing with my mind. I ran it by my mother so and now that I verbalize it to you too. I'm going to call him today just run it by him.

337
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:08.280
Lauren Anderson: Tell him. I've been thinking about it, thinking about him and I think they're preparing a choir concert to which is going to be in the near future, even if it's just a video deal

338
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:19.530
Lauren Anderson: Like a live feed. And in that case, I would be able to get some performance in in the next month or so, just not a whole solo concert. But, you know, least go in and play a piece to

339
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.200
Lauren Anderson: My feet with

340
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The linger a little longer, you only said one and

341
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What what you said stopping different arcane

342
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:34.710
Mm hmm.

343
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unlikely.

344
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.670
Lauren Anderson: And what else. Yeah.

345
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:44.730
Lauren Anderson: Does that was the second thing I think it can interfere. And that's what I'm saying. I think now that verbalize it to watch a call when today.

346
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:55.530
Lauren Anderson: Because that's another thing about interfere, but I think it would be good to as soon as possible, actually have an actual performance state. So I have

347
00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:04.020
Lauren Anderson: A timeline and I have something to look forward to, and goals to set like two weeks before that I need to be at this point.

348
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:15.480
Lauren Anderson: And I need to have it at this point, a week before and yada yada. So yeah, it's important. I think that would interfere, if I continue to just play with it, my head, but keep getting ready. Like, I'm going to have a concert in three months.

349
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:22.020
Lauren Anderson: Is a, I don't know, it's a good way to cause a lot of stress at the very least.

350
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a deep breath together. Let's breathe. It's be aware that there's there's been a lot discussed right

351
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, everything's right on time.

352
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about it. Now we're talking about what might get in the way, even saying it out loud is a level of commitment I said it to someone else. And I'm saying it now and there's this awareness of commitment, I think, and let's go back even further.

353
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to being in group and see if you can remember what you liked about something someone said,

354
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about getting a gold sticking with it.

355
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You like that. Someone said it in group you feel when

356
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You were in group, Lauren.

357
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Talked about picking a goal and sticking to it, you've liked it, you comment.

358
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.350
Lauren Anderson: And something I'm following through.

359
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Also just quiet and quiet. Just sit with it. You liked it. Then you picked up on. You could have picked up on anything that you picked up on that.

360
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice here today. Oh, as I see it here and I say it out loud to you when I notice how I said it to someone else and maybe what I need.

361
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to set a date.

362
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Will give you something to look forward to.

363
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It will organize time

364
00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: For you because it has a deadline.

365
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What a commitment does is, it is a constraint we organize today around three months from now, we can be organized because we have a deadline and we can be grateful for it. It's not an ugly thing. In fact, we're left to ourselves will procrastinate. Is he

366
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So to have a commitment.

367
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to give clarity and organization to an otherwise disorganized free flowing

368
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm left to myself.

369
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can let myself off the hook. But now with a deadline.

370
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A constraint.

371
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, then I can organize time space energy effort. I can budget myself to that deadline.

372
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You sit with it.

373
00:40:59.220 --> 00:40:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

374
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Does anything come up where there's resistance to this idea. Does it seem hokey does it seem like boy that that might just work for you.

375
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:12.930
Lauren Anderson: Know, mix it

376
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, there's another piece. Let's not forget this one.

377
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like what happened with 1245 there might be a sense of waiting till last minute.

378
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:34.650
Lauren Anderson: Um, I don't have a history of doing that with piano. I mean, I'm practicing every day.

379
00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.520
Lauren Anderson: Was like, show up I prepared for concerts.

380
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

381
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.090
Lauren Anderson: Very, very diligently.

382
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Yep. He spoke up and he said, That's not my truth you clarify that's nicely done.

383
00:41:49.980 --> 00:42:00.060
Lauren Anderson: In general though I procrastinate like everything else. Well schoolwork. That's the other one. We're talking about that some paperwork bureaucracy housecleaning

384
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:10.230
Lauren Anderson: But schoolwork, and piano. I have never been a procrastinator on I enjoy it. I like go to it with Cousteau, I guess.

385
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's stay here in this this space of concept polished concert right there.

386
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really sit with potential challenges that might arise.

387
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:33.540
Lauren Anderson: Well, I'd be great. We're just talking about it. I mean, until I actually

388
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:43.260
Lauren Anderson: I don't know. I want to call away and then kind of get it in the works and have a date, but I mean, no matter what I'm gonna wanna give a concert so

389
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So, stay, stay a little longer with it can be uncomfortable to look at what might get in the way and if this concert in your here, but it has value, it means that you're realistic.

390
00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Like for example, let's say you don't show up for a job.

391
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you won't have an income, then you won't be able to pay for your buprenorphine. I'm not saying that about you just listen.

392
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm getting a hypothetical. For some people, that's the case that they really need to show up for their job.

393
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So that they can have money so that they can come to bright heart health, so that nothing gets in the way of their goals. So how it pulls back even it's it's it can be connected to how you're spending your days.

394
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be connected to things like that. So what I'm wondering is what else might get in the way of you. We could even do the buprenorphine.

395
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there are things you can't control like right heart health, shutting down. But let's think about the things that you can have some agency with

396
00:43:49.170 --> 00:44:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What might you do that might get in the way of the regular scheduled buprenorphine being prescribed and you taking it on a regular basis and having it work for you. What might get in the way of that.

397
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.020
Lauren Anderson: You're

398
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.080
Lauren Anderson: Saying I really have zero desire to

399
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:16.890
Lauren Anderson: Go back to ruin and I don't feel well if I don't take the buprenorphine. So it kind of seems like a

400
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.710
Lauren Anderson: moot point i mean

401
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.740
Lauren Anderson: Okay, unless the whole system.

402
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.400
Lauren Anderson: Broke down and I couldn't get with the doctor continue screw.

403
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you earn a living.

404
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.920
Lauren Anderson: I'm on disability. Okay.

405
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that require paperwork to stay updated on

406
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.640
Lauren Anderson: A for food stamps and stuff. Yeah, so that's why my interest is lapsed right now.

407
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So. Now do you see why I'm bringing these little details up. There's a you don't see the connection that this paperwork might have something to do with right got to have food. I've got to have this this this disability benefit maybe

408
00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:58.770
Lauren Anderson: Once I

409
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:07.170
Lauren Anderson: It's more expensive now because I don't have it. So once I get the insurance actual, this will be easier and much cheaper for me.

410
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might meet with me regularly like to regular yeah want to

411
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.980
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, at least a couple times a week at the

412
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:15.690
Lauren Anderson: Beginning

413
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you see why I'm nosing around and such an odd place like what does this have to do with the other. What does

414
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: My day to day have to do with this concert, but it matters how you take care of yourself and managed today affects those three months.

415
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.170
Lauren Anderson: It does. I know, be a much better environment. The practice of my

416
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:46.650
Lauren Anderson: House where in order, but it's like a 1500 dollar project. So I've had to just kind of pretend the mess, isn't there. So I can still have my

417
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:57.540
Lauren Anderson: Clean area to practice, you know, but I would be better if it were clean in here too, so I didn't have clutter everywhere. I know it's more conducive to

418
00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:58.920
Lauren Anderson: Get studying

419
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.450
Lauren Anderson: And practicing

420
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now we're just staying in the mental organization. Right now we're just staying at this idea

421
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.170
Lauren Anderson: That's the same thing, though the paperwork and all that. That's all shit my head that's cluttering my brave.

422
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:18.090
Lauren Anderson: It, but it's a little overwhelming. Like I said, like 100 hours and clicking works good. This place an order and the paperwork stuff. It's just

423
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I got you. I know. I think I know so it's

424
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You assessed.

425
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: All the hundred hours all at once. And I think what you've forgotten.

426
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what you can do with your music.

427
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.820
Lauren Anderson: Once you've forgotten forgotten. I'm playing many hours every day.

428
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.710
Lauren Anderson: In spite of the clutter everywhere because I know it's my number one therapy.

429
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.220
Lauren Anderson: When. What do you say it's not what you're saying.

430
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not

431
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: made all the way through, because then you're, you know, you're not going to benefit from this analogy here I go.

432
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You have forgotten that at one point you did not know that musical piece and all those notes collectively on that page.

433
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You hadn't played it with precision and beautifully and polished but you know you sat down.

434
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This minute you put your fingers on those keys and you played, but you didn't do was overwhelm yourself with this notion of how on earth am I supposed to do this whole piece.

435
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You have that space of faith inside of you have it there. It's isolated and sand castle it around the sense of confidence and right around this music and maybe mouth to elsewhere. You have it there. It's there.

436
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not worried that your space isn't going to get organized or that paperwork isn't going to get done I you know why I know because you already have what it takes. You have the skill.

437
00:47:52.620 --> 00:48:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the ability to you know how you went like this and you might feel I have to really like I can't, I cannot focus on all the chaos. I've got to stay on this nice clean service of my piano and here's my music and I've got to just stay right here like this right like blinders on.

438
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can practice.

439
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know everything is like that everyone has 31 flavors of ice cream, and they all look so yummy.

440
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And unfortunately, they will all be able to be tasted and enjoyed same time we're gonna have to pick one and it's a matter of just focusing and we say, you know what

441
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got the rest of my life, I've got these other opportunities, but today. Maybe I'll do it randomly, or maybe someone else pick because I really want all the flavors, but I'm just going to focus on

442
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to do that weird blue rainbow looking thing because maybe I saw someone you know how their lips all died from it. Now I see that I taste good.

443
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go for it. I'm going to see if it actually tastes good, because to me it looks disgusting.

444
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Tones all blue the lips are blue. Like what, what is that, so I'm going to try it out. But the problem is

445
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, there's no constraint, no one's telling me which one to focus on. I can take any I'm a, I'm an adult I can have whatever I'm on. There's no one telling me what to do. It is the existential burden of choice fill and still I must choose if I want to taste one and enjoy one

446
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not that much more different than

447
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

448
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

449
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to take this space here right where my chair is not going to say it's going to be this amount of space. I'm going to set myself a timer.

450
00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the constraint. Notice the word timer. That's a constraint, much like a commitment to a concert a timer is a constraint.

451
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I maybe I tell someone I put a little social pressure if you want to. If you work like that. I do if I tell people, then I hold myself accountable more and I say, I'm going to clean this area.

452
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have only this area just be reasonable, don't, don't go a whole room for goodness sake, just do like a two by two space. If you've got little, little tiny things like

453
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Paper clips and pencils and little things like that. Pick a really small space like this so much space and pick. Give yourself 10 minutes or whatever you think it might take, and all you do is that space to hit the timer and you go

454
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:44.880
Lauren Anderson: How can that be a homework for this week like 10 minutes a day cleaning my house. I know it's not a long time, but I mean, it wouldn't know.

455
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:45.930
Lauren Anderson: Who live

456
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the privileges that I have in. First of all, Lauren, you were really amazing. You let me get through several analogies all at the same time.

457
00:50:55.890 --> 00:51:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me talk about the fact that you have that skill you let me talk about how it's unfortunate that we humans, we, we have this burden of choice and yet we want it, but it's hard when we have it. Well, don't take it from me, but now I have to choose. It's this odd. It is a dilemma. So, but

458
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.720
Lauren Anderson: I liked how you said you really have to choose. Because otherwise.

459
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:26.850
Lauren Anderson: You won't enjoy it. And you're right, because as you're eating it. If you hadn't really made a choice. The whole time you're not enjoying it, you're thinking about what about all those other flavors.

460
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.410
Lauren Anderson: So it is important to actually make a choice, not just decide to do one of them, but actually

461
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.870
Lauren Anderson: choose that one consciously

462
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.490
Lauren Anderson: So you're not in the back of your head.

463
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:37.830
Lauren Anderson: cluttered with all the other crap you're not doing

464
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And enjoy that ice cream actually enjoying it.

465
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna say, I kind of like this cotton candy nonsense is Superman ice cream, whatever it is, or the cake or something. It's good. I would have never known. If I sat there wondering which is the right choice.

466
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Though is yeah let's do homework. Let's do it will say I'm 10 minutes a day and then need privilege that I have is, I have access to your home. Now you may have this

467
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Response when I say that.

468
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't dive into it. If I were you, what I would just do is I would, I don't have to see your home. I see little bits of it. You can turn around and you make a commitment to one.

469
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Area that you want to do 10 minutes

470
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it sometime today later on today. You can even do it when you're doing that awake thing or you're like, I'm up anyway. I might as well friggin get up and go do my 10 minutes now.

471
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.580
Lauren Anderson: But every day 10 minutes somehow

472
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.500
Lauren Anderson: That a timer here in the clutter.

473
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you look around your room and be reasonable.

474
00:52:52.680 --> 00:53:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't over commit to a space, maybe only pick like a two by two space. Just a little. Look around you and see

475
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What can be reasonably feel like it'll be some effort, but I won't get too wrapped up in feeling like I won't be able to accomplish. So just look around and pick maybe a two by two cube space. That's the only allowed to address. Go ahead.

476
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:38.610
Lauren Anderson: I think I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS FIRST AND I HAVE TO ADDRESS FIRST are my clothes, my clean clothes. I literally have hours and hours and hours of bags of clothes that need to be folded in or hung up.

477
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.170
Lauren Anderson: clean clothes.

478
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:41.070
Lauren Anderson: Crazy.

479
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: They probably set hours and hours and hours. I want you to succeed.

480
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:54.360
Lauren Anderson: To the 10 minutes so but can I still do that because I mean they're in some of our smaller bags. I can still set the timer and just force myself to quit after 10 minutes

481
00:53:54.420 --> 00:54:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And you go get your name. You have to see it. Can you get a small bag that you can accomplish in 10 minutes. I don't even know.

482
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go grab your bag. Now, just go grab it and put it next to wherever you see like if you woke up at two in the morning and you had to do it and you have those 10 minutes you're like, oh my, get this thing done about like 10 minutes. Got my bag ready

483
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:17.760
Lauren Anderson: All right.

484
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And how fantastic the Victoria. Victoria Secret pink bag was absolutely so I yes let's do hang homework. So when you end with me cetera. What time do you think you're going to set it for for getting these 10 minutes, then what's a reasonable time

485
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:41.700
Lauren Anderson: Um, I think I'll do it right now, since we're just talking about it to start the week off on a good foot

486
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:52.620
Lauren Anderson: And then, yeah, I was gonna ask you, do you think it's it'll be better if I do that, the same time every day, or maybe not pressure myself that way and see how it works. Whenever this week.

487
00:54:53.460 --> 00:55:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Your time at 111 O'clock set of typically a time when it makes sense that would make sense for you, let's say,

488
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:09.600
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, good. Wow, it's 213 right now. That's weird. That's like one of my special numbers. Yeah, I could do it or 213 every day.

489
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.060
Lauren Anderson: That works perfectly romance.

490
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.500
Lauren Anderson: Special number for number

491
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: How synchro mystic

492
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.930
Lauren Anderson: Answered

493
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: No. It's cool though it's fun and loving those happen so you can set. So go to 13 having a recurring

494
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Recurring reminder a recurring event and give it a fun name, give it something that doesn't feel verses and right that reminded the alarm in there. If you have that kind of fun that will let you do that. And, but only so from 213 to 223 and one that bell rings and you're done, you stop.

495
00:55:47.430 --> 00:56:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can go practice piano go take care of your animal go eat go do something else. But you are going to really be able to register time you're going to really know what 10 minutes is you're going to really have a good handle on what 10 minutes

496
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

497
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:16.920
Lauren Anderson: I was gonna ask because, you know, usually from the time the timer starts when I actually get started is going to be like a minute, maybe to some ah I extend it to 225 just to really give it a 10 minute

498
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:24.120
Lauren Anderson: Thing. Oh, let's see. This time I'm doing it right now so ready.

499
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it's okay, I'm going to sneak in a bind here. My next science here but I

500
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.620
Learned today. So I'm taking

501
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:45.930
Lauren Anderson: It doesn't bother me if you want to you can eat whenever you got to tell me I i've got a pretty fast metabolism. So I'm usually grazing every hour to minimum okay in time say to 25

502
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.680
Lauren Anderson: Okay to 13 to 25

503
00:56:53.970 --> 00:57:00.930
Lauren Anderson: Cents in day, but we don't want an end date. Oh, I guess I could the end of next week and we'll see how it goes for the week. Yeah.

504
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it for a month. Why don't we try for a month.

505
00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:07.950
Lauren Anderson: Okay, well. Today's the 23rd. Right.

506
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.940
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there an end time though that's the one I'm interested in

508
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

509
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:15.450
Um,

510
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.080
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, to 13 to 25

511
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:21.450
Lauren Anderson: For one month.

512
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.190
Lauren Anderson: A daily deal

513
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.060
Lauren Anderson: All day just

514
00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:31.680
Lauren Anderson: a one time event know daily. There we go.

515
00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:39.540
Lauren Anderson: Bailey forever. That's funny. It actually says forever here I put in daily and the writer needs. It says forever.

516
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:47.940
Lauren Anderson: Reminder, oh, I put a reminder. So, you know, I don't want to reminder, though I wanted to. Oh, I better 10 minutes before. That's good.

517
00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.490
Lauren Anderson: Because what if I'm on a walk and they don't realize it. So,

518
00:57:50.820 --> 00:58:00.180
Lauren Anderson: Hey Tim before reminder and then to 13. Okay, I gotta get geared up and by 215 I'm working on the clothes and then typically are being yeah

519
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it doesn't go dang then set. Make sure you set a timer so that it really goes off after 10 minutes okay because my phone if I have an alarm at won't do that. I'm not actually changing over to the to the stopwatch.

520
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's set another time for us to meet. I'm looking at my calendar right now.

521
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:23.970
Lauren Anderson: Okay. Oh, I was gonna ask you what we've been talking about time and everything. Do you think that might be

522
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:32.430
Lauren Anderson: Helpful for me if we have the same time every week or is that even possible talking about routine or

523
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a yes. It just can't happen because I'm so book next week, but the answer is yes, most of my clients are exactly the same time every single week. Once there's a group you're grooved in and I protect that time.

524
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we just have to get into a groove and so I haven't quite been able to do it with you yet still still trying to create that

525
00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That space.

526
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: couldn't quite pull it off last time was able to put two together.

527
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.620
Lauren Anderson: I've got a prescription things before we finish today to

528
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need me to message her doctor

529
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.390
Lauren Anderson: Yes.

530
00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:21.750
Lauren Anderson: I she gave me just a three day supply of the buprenorphine. So I need a four day supply that's three tabs, a day.

531
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:33.300
Lauren Anderson: She knows. So yeah, I need four days and then my Wellbutrin is I should have ran out a few days ago, but I forgot at a time or two. So I'm also I just took my last one this morning.

532
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I just right.

533
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I say LAR and

534
00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Attended individual counseling and I say today.

535
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: She is reporting needing view and nutrient and that's all I do. I'm

536
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.800
Lauren Anderson: Cool and yeah i'm i'm out to both of them so

537
01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.440
Lauren Anderson: Anyway, and I wanted to ask, I guess I can ask them Monday and group, but

538
01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:15.570
Lauren Anderson: Whenever I go because it's a controlled substance, I have to go into the store and with everything that's going on right now there's a week usually outside the grocery store for 30 minutes to an hour.

539
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:31.050
Lauren Anderson: And everyone's required to wear masks. At that point, and then I go in masks gloves. So I was hoping we could kind of try to keep the prescriptions. To know more frequently than once a week to try and conserve on my masks gloves and

540
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What I've done at 90 minutes I've already told my clients that I'm running late. I do need to go. What I've done is I send a message to dr up real

541
01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said, Lauren attended right now she's reporting need for buprenorphine and well Wellbutrin. I don't know, we'll take it from there. But we haven't scheduled the time I think we might end up having to do it through texts. I think we ran out of time to schedule. That's

542
01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.180
Lauren Anderson: Fine.

543
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:55.710
Lauren Anderson: Or Monday is fine to

544
01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Give you some ideas and we'll kind of work it out for next week.

545
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.850
Lauren Anderson: Thursday or Friday, be my preference to

546
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:03.750
Lauren Anderson: Keep it in the middle.

547
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 minutes. Go for it.

548
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.190
