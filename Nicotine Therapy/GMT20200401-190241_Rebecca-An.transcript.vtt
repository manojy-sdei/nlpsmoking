Ken Olsen: Yeah.

111
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:37.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know what what you're experienced with having your heart attack. Yeah, it was a wake up call. But it was also traumatic.

112
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.910
Yeah.

113
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.860
Ken Olsen: You know, I kind of, I kind of just put it aside, like, yeah, it happened.

114
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.450
Ken Olsen: But you know, it's changed my life, you know, everything's changed for me. I mean,

115
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.150
Ken Olsen: The way I look at things.

116
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:01.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I hope you look at him in a manner that says, you know, it's time to quit medicating and start living

117
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.760
Ken Olsen: Well, I still take pills asleep and muscle relaxers and

118
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.420
Ken Olsen: I don't know if I'm in the moment of time anymore, not

119
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you take your muscle relaxers

120
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.810
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I take two in the morning you prescribe to me. So I figured I'd take on that.

121
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.060
Ken Olsen: I don't know, just

122
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.490

123
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.530

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

125
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.010
Ken Olsen: Well, yesterday I think you probably needed it.

126
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.990
Ken Olsen: Us. Yeah, I took it up because they gave me 100 milligrams. I'm sorry.

127
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.320
Ken Olsen: I told him at the hospital. I wanted to get up Sarah little so they said it's taken 300 that gave me 100

128
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.020
Ken Olsen: And but at the time I was getting a shot, but out of every four hours and

129
00:08:51.900 --> 00:09:00.150
Ken Olsen: I can't sleep without him. But I think if I took 100 milligrams circle. Two years ago I would have been flat on my back, I take it, now I can actually walk around it function.

130
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.920
Ken Olsen: So I've been taking my 100 with my three hundreds of night.

131
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.450
Ken Olsen: I gotta stop doing that.

132
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

133
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:17.730
Ken Olsen: Oh, I only got one 100 left and I actually cut it in half. Last night I could, I took it. I wasn't sure if I took my medication already you know

134
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:26.160
Ken Olsen: I'll lose track and I took it because I haven't the ball rolling like my mind will be somewhere else want taking it, you know, like, Did I just take one or not, you know,

135
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:36.000
Ken Olsen: Right. It doesn't have doesn't happen all the time. But it happened last night, I can't remember if I took a sleeping pill yet. So just in case I talked to 100 and half

136
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.200
Oh,

137
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.020

Ken Olsen: You know yeah I know I'm at the same time every night.

140
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.200
Ken Olsen: Yeah, it reminds me. The last time I sobered up and

141
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.520

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.790
Ken Olsen: sitting there drinking their beer and shit.

177
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:13.830
Ken Olsen: I don't know what you know what they're going through. I mean just they're different people, you know, yeah, when they're silver. They're totally different. And when you're drinking it just

178
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.620
Ken Olsen: I can imagine when I was like, no, I thought I was hilarious. But why did everybody want to kick my ass, you know,

179
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:20.850
Yeah.

180
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.570
Ken Olsen: All that I was most fun, fun loving guy in the room and where I know if somebody's attacking me or want to kill me.

181
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.410
Ken Olsen: I'm just looking at him like, what did I do, you know,

182
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It has anybody ever recorded you under the influence.

183
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.490
Ken Olsen: Somebody recorded me sleepwalking my took Ambien that's why can't take Ambien

184
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.280
Ken Olsen: And I was so pissed.

185
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.750
You know,

186
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.500
Ken Olsen: But because I'm sleepwalking. And I didn't remember it till I you know next morning everybody laughing at me and I'm like,

187
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:03.030
Ken Olsen: So I never, I never took Ambien again, my brother did the same thing. He read this car on Ambien didn't you remember what he did.

188
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:04.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

189
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.180
Ken Olsen: Yeah, so

190
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow yeah Ambien is definitely affects people differently, that's for sure.

191
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.280
Yeah.

192
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.660
Ken Olsen: So I ended up back on Seroquel to help you sleep and

193
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:21.660
Ken Olsen: You know,

194
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So from this point forward, you got to quit overmedicating with it and just take it as prescribed. You know, and let your body get adjusted to it.

195
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.000
Ken Olsen: You know, last night I think

196
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.970
Ken Olsen: I think I needed a double dose.

197
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:38.550
Ken Olsen: No.

198
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I just want to, I want you to reiterate again. You did a lot of the right things.

199
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in a time of crisis and the time that you are feeling the way that you were feeling did

200
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of writing.

201
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:52.770
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

202
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.050
Ken Olsen: You know, yeah.

203
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be proud of that.

204
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.130
Ken Olsen: I was going bad shit crazy. I didn't know what to do.

205
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:00.900
Ken Olsen: So,

206
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you did the best thing that you could have done.

207
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.450
Ken Olsen: Well,

208
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As me

209
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.340
Ken Olsen: Oh yes i looking in your, your right. So that's what you're supposed to do.

210
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.950
Ken Olsen: Yeah, before I would think everywhere. I think it was like a weakness, like, you know, people would tell me

211
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.540
Ken Olsen: I don't know, I just thought was like kind of weak, but no.

212
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:33.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not absolutely it's not it's not at all. You know, it's, it is hard to ask for help when you're struggling, but

213
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you do it. Oh my gosh, it makes it easier for the next time you know and easier for the next time.

214
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:47.280
Ken Olsen: You know, I'm all, I'm all open for you know when I go to the hospital. I told myself, I'll do anything, anything in pretty much to offer you know

215
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

216
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.540
Ken Olsen: Yeah. Before I wouldn't have done it. I will never thought a or

217
00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:01.140
Ken Olsen: Virtual all this virtual stuff, you know, this is all new to this was kind of freaking me out all this new technology, you know,

218
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:01.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

219
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.940
Ken Olsen: I got me. I got a ride home from the doctor, with a driverless car. I mean,

220
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.910
Ken Olsen: The card turned itself. Don't know the freeway. He was took his hands off the wheel and blew me away.

221
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

222
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.910
Yeah.

223
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

224
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.420
Ken Olsen: Where have I been, you know,

225
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, times are certainly changing electronics are definitely the wave of the future.

226
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.850
Ken Olsen: Yeah, just

227
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.280
Ken Olsen: Well,

228
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And with this, you know, with this flu going around, you know, definitely. It is a good thing that we have this in place, you know,

229
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:40.920
Yeah.

230
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep people safe.

231
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.130
Yeah.

232
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So today, you're going to go to an a, a meeting at six. Yeah.

233
00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And tomorrow, you're going to have dinner with your daughter.

234
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay, good.

235
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. You're gonna rest a little bit today cuz I'm pretty sure you're a little bit emotionally drained.

236
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.660
Ken Olsen: Yeah, but I just need to get out.

237
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.200
Ken Olsen: Of my truck broke down. I had to get rid of that I had to get rid of that thing was just a money pit.

238
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.390
Ken Olsen: And like I said, I got this.

239
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:22.770
Ken Olsen: workman's comp case going on with my lawyer and I haven't heard I've left two messages. The receptionist haven't heard nothing back on them.

240
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.700
Ken Olsen: So that's like my hope that I get something from this workman's comp claim, which I think is kind of stinks because

241
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.200
Ken Olsen: You know, it was my fault. I got her here I could turn around sue somebody. But

242
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.630
Ken Olsen: That's the way it is.

243
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:47.640
Ken Olsen: I'm kind of I'm kind of glad I did get a lawyer because if I want to get the money when I did when I would have, I would have blown through it, you know.

244
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.960
Ken Olsen: Yeah, oh, maybe it was a good idea just to present a lawyer.

245
00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:01.170
Ken Olsen: Like, have a little hope that you know I'm just glad I didn't get the money when I did for sure but I my lawyer just kind of pisses me off, but

246
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.150
Ken Olsen: It's all right. I mean, he told me to be patient. Be patient.

247
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:11.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You didn't realize how stretched your patients would be

248
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.260
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

249
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.650
Ken Olsen: Yeah. Well, I mean, I just try not to think about it.

250
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.220
Ken Olsen: But you have you

251
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.130
Ken Olsen: But I do. I like, you know, come on, what's going on.

252
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can I have some answers, please.

253
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.320
Yeah.

254
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.140
Ken Olsen: I don't know, like I said, the whole I wish I never happened to be honest with you.

255
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.550
Ken Olsen: But you know what's funny is where I worked at down the street. This casino.

256
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.140
Ken Olsen: The guy that's working there still with my partner and

257
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.330
Ken Olsen: I rode by their my little route my bike rides and you want me to know if I get some cocaine.

258
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

259
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.640
Ken Olsen: Because everything's closed so there's nobody around. So you can't get dope, you know,

260
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

261
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.300
Ken Olsen: So he knew, I knew how to get it back in the day and

262
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:05.040
Ken Olsen: They asked me, and I'm like, shit. And you know i i see why. The reason I left because I was getting back into all that shit right

263
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:05.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

264
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:13.590
Ken Olsen: And I hurt my knee and the same month, I mean, thanks. Hit me all at once all the times you like I have a bad knee. My mom just passed away.

265
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:21.420
Ken Olsen: I was doing coke and crank and I knew it was going to go bad. And one morning, I just walked in and said, to hell with this is this is I'm gonna

266
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:32.430
Ken Olsen: You know, it's a good thing. I left the casino. I did because the guy that we were getting from now is critical for in the hospital and he's going to die. My old drug dealer.

267
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

268
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:41.370
Ken Olsen: And he's probably 55 and he's got problems I'm, I'm pretty sure it has to do with doing crank all your life, you know, doing math all your life.

269
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

270
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.560
So,

271
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We heart muscles.

272
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.430
Ken Olsen: Yeah, and he wanted me to give them some coke. And I'm like, Oh my God, you know, I'm like,

273
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.830
Ken Olsen: There's a reason I left.

274
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's like, Haven't you had enough. I

275
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.660
Ken Olsen: Mean I was walking

276
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.440
Ken Olsen: I was walking around. We're drinking vodka and shop and

277
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.360
Ken Olsen: You know,

278
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.550
Ken Olsen: It was just all bad.

279
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.440
Ken Olsen: For me,

280
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:17.610
Ken Olsen: Know, cuz I know once I do start doing crank. It's just gonna, it's gonna get bad because of what happened last time, so

281
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.990
Ken Olsen: $80,000 and the whole nothing to show for it.

282
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that sounds about right.

283
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.530
Ken Olsen: Definitely, yeah. But what's good is though it was

284
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:34.230
Ken Olsen: filed bankruptcy 2007 and now it's off my record and I'm I've got this

285
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:45.810
Ken Olsen: Credit sesame and all that stuff my credit scores. Excellent. Cuz I've been, you know, I didn't do too much damage to my credit, but I'm glad for that, you know,

286
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

287
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.850
Ken Olsen: My dad helped me pay off. I was a couple hundred bucks I got into and I knew I had to stop.

288
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.790
Ken Olsen: You know, but I kept thinking, oh my, my, my claim is going to come in. I'll just pay it off but

289
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.500
Ken Olsen: I wouldn't, you know, it's just way. I was thinking, you know, the addict. I guess it me

290
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

291
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.290
Ken Olsen: You know, lying to myself.

292
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:06.840
But

293
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.410
Ken Olsen: I'm glad I didn't ruin my credit, like I did last time.

294
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.190

Ken Olsen: But

301
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.860
Ken Olsen: You know, it doesn't really

302
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.010
Ken Olsen: Think it's gonna take a little time. That's all.

303
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:53.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, it does. Yeah. And you know, you just pointed out some good positive things that are, you know, still saw you still good. You know, as far as your life goes that your addiction hasn't taken from you this time, which is really, really awesome, you know,

Ken Olsen: Every boy.

305
00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.030
Ken Olsen: Or maybe I learned something from the last mistake, last time I did.

306
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.580

317
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just thinking about the risky behaviors.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that additional rings.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, in

320
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:54.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Knowing that that's not where you want to be and being able to pull yourself out you know is huge.

321
00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

322
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.380
Yeah.

323
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:11.580
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I had a nice truck and I wrecked it and that kind of halted everything for me and my dad came and got me from Southern California, and took me down there.

324
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:17.490
Ken Olsen: So I had to get away. I didn't get away. I thought, you know, the old story and be dead.

325
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.280
Ken Olsen: Yeah, probably, probably, you know,

326
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.140
Ken Olsen: I'm thinking I I did want to kill myself. Although we've been trying to kill myself.

327
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:28.710
Ken Olsen: But how are you doing

328
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.210
Ken Olsen: She's up above me. Oh.

329
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm good.

330
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm good. Just trudging along. I'm glad that you came in today. I'm glad that you are better.

331
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: makes a big difference, you know,

332
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.650
Yo,

333
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good stuff, you know,

334
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.550
Ken Olsen: The pressure

335
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:03.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, again, it's a process. You know, you got to get to the other side of this and you got to heal.

336
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and the statement that you said you've you've always been trying to kill yourself. You know, really taking a look at what is underneath that. Why, why is that so yeah you know it's maybe something that we

337
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Should start looking at

338
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

339
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.880
Yeah.

340
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.530
Ken Olsen: Well, one thing I tried to change my ex because she's not the most responsible

341
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.560
Ken Olsen: You know she's in certain way, she is. But you can't change people, you know, so

342
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.330
Ken Olsen: Yeah, and

343
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.190
Ken Olsen: I tried. I tried to make it work, man. Just

344
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.010
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

345
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.840
Ken Olsen: You know, the next guy and good luck, buddy. You know, because

346
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.150
Ken Olsen: It is anything like me, he'll see

347
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.450
Ken Olsen: We'll see. Hopefully it works out for you know

348
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.030
Ken Olsen: Especially for my daughter sake. You know, I don't want her. I hope he doesn't do bad things to her.

349
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.310
Ken Olsen: So I doubt it, but

350
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.680
Ken Olsen: You know,

351
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:18.270
Ken Olsen: My daughter doesn't know 85% of the ship that gone on with me. She just hears it from her mom or

352
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:19.950
Ken Olsen: You know,

353
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.780
Ken Olsen: Which is good. I'm glad I never really

354
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.360
Ken Olsen: Told her all this shit, you know,

355
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.620
Ken Olsen: Yeah, a lot of the shit that happened when she was younger.

356
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.740
Ken Olsen: She took me to court. She's reading words against me and I still take her back. Yeah.

357
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:40.800
Ken Olsen: So,

358
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:48.150
Ken Olsen: But he talked to her, you know, even when she took me to court. You put down that I hit her.

359
00:24:50.190 --> 00:25:02.580
Ken Olsen: All kind of shit. You know, it got blown out by the way, was he took me to court. The first time because the judge could tell that they were just trying to seek vengeance on me. So they read the they read all the shit that you wrote down

360
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.450
Ken Olsen: You need 4545 seconds later boom case dismissed.

361
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.810
Ken Olsen: I mean they're trying to get $800 a month out of me.

362
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.550
Ken Olsen: Okay, and then putting down that I beat her, but there was never any police reports and all that shit.

363
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:28.020
Ken Olsen: So one time. That's how I got anger management. She got smart. This time, and made a police report saying, you know, this and that you line over fucking teeth, but I didn't sign up and you know I just

364
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:34.890
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I thought it took, like, okay, this is what has happened, whatever. I still took her back.

365
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.490
Ken Olsen: I think it was a sex probably

366
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe

367
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:41.760
Ken Olsen: Yeah, but

368
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.370
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

369
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.980
Ken Olsen: Anyways, there you go.

370
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's true. You can't change anybody else.

371
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.220
Ken Olsen: Definitely

372
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.120
Ken Olsen: You know,

373
00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just got to be the best version of you. You can possibly be.

374
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.170
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

375
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember what do you remember we were talking yesterday about what

376
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Figuring out what you're happy looks like.

377
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.780
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I know. We're happy looks like.

378
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:30.060
Ken Olsen: Yeah, my I fell in love as like teen I blew that here, by the way, drinking and drugging but I was happy. I saw this girl in the drive through and I fell in love recite and I got a job there just to see her, and I'll be damned. I got her, you know,

379
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.600
Ken Olsen: That that was going to merrier. And man, I got her pregnant. We paid for an abortion. I'm an idiot.

380
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:44.130
Ken Olsen: And then I show up our house, three o'clock in the morning after are doing what they're banking on our front door drunk and spun out

381
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.950
Ken Olsen: I went home, came back the next day or Dad said if I ever see around here again.

382
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:57.270
Ken Olsen: That was yellow. Yeah. But that was a happy time until I blew it like I always do, but

383
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.110
Ken Olsen: That was, yeah. That was a good time. I never care in the world.

384
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.240
Yeah.

385
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.040
Ken Olsen: Love you know I was my first time ever falling in love.

386
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.350
Oh,

387
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, the first time I always get a heartbroken, you always

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:18.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go ever again.

389
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.700
Ken Olsen: You know, it took me a couple years that one.

390
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.250
Ken Olsen: And then I saw her again. She was looking for me. And then I saw her.

391
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:35.430
Ken Olsen: Talk to you for a minute. I was drunk. Of course, and then I just walked out on her. I said, I can't do this again. You can't, you know,

392
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.980
Ken Olsen: You're going to break my heart again.

393
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nah, no.

394
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.520
No.

395
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You gotta find that happy place.

396
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, not happy with other people, but happy within

397
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.000
Yourself.

398
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.100
Ken Olsen: Trying

399
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.240
You know,

400
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.480
Ken Olsen: Well, it's time. I'm kind of doing it alone. So

401
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:20.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, maybe this time. That's exactly how you need to do it. You know, you need to be okay with you and figure out why. What does underlying issue is, you know, underneath.

402
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Underneath it all so that you can change it.

403
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you got the rest of your life, whatever that looks like.

404
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

405
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:29.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We just don't know.

406
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.960
Ken Olsen: Yes, certainly. Life is what scares me because

407
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.490
Ken Olsen: I'm only trained in certain things and I hate doing what I used to do.

408
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:47.010
Ken Olsen: You know, I even looked like being a drug drug alcohol counselor. I call it a capella University first number that popped up and

409
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.260
Ken Olsen: I talked to him for a minute.

410
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.420
Ken Olsen: And he asked me, What's your highest level of graduate school. And I said, gee,

411
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:01.470
Ken Olsen: I think they kind of laugh. The St. The program for you. You got to go to college, get your BA, you probably know about. Yeah.

412
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.390
Ken Olsen: No, I don't know. I gotta find something else, different material before what I did before.

413
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.130
Ken Olsen: I'm tired of fixing shit apartments and houses and shit.

414
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe you should look into becoming a recovery mentor.

415
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.080
Ken Olsen: Once that

416
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Recovery mentor is somebody that reaches out to people, you know, in the community that struggling

417
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And walks them through the first little bit of recovery to help them get grounded in take some to meetings, you know,

418
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.160
Ken Olsen: Especially with Secretary goes a day usually

419
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: goes and picks people up and takes him to meetings and stuff.

420
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.920
Ken Olsen: Or sponsor. Mm hmm. You know,

421
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, uh, yeah. It's kind of like recovery mentor is kind of like a

422
00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of like a sponsor. They don't do step work, you know, with the client, you don't. You have to maintain an ethical you know boundary with them but

423
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.290
Ken Olsen: being around people that ruin their fucking life and

424
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.100
Ken Olsen: strung out on heroin. I could ever bought with but

425
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.700
Ken Olsen: You know, I feel surveys heroin addicts, man.

426
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:16.770
Ken Olsen: You know,

427
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.650
Ken Olsen: But I lost a friend or two with that shit.

428
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:26.100
Ken Olsen: Yeah, and I don't know being around people that kind of recover from that be hard. I think I mean

429
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's hard, but it's no more harder than somebody who's struggling with alcohol.

430
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.550
Ken Olsen: That's for sure that well I mean that, too. I mean,

431
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.170
Ken Olsen: I don't think I'm I don't know if I'm the right person for that. I don't know.

432
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One day, maybe you'll figure it out.

433
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.060
Ken Olsen: Right now I'm a fucking

434
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you have to go through the mass to get to the promises.

435
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.850
Ken Olsen: You know, yeah.

436
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

437
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.180
Ken Olsen: My sponsor said it's going to take a year of my brain to kick back on really yeah

438
00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:58.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

439
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:04.110
Ken Olsen: You know, go through this shift and hopefully come out the other side, you know, if you feel like killing yourself. Now give it a year.

440
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.030
Ken Olsen: And if you still feel it.

441
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:08.910
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

442
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

443
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: First year is the hardest.

444
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.330
Ken Olsen: And then, you know, essentially, how long do we got here.

445
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I got about, I think, five or six minutes depending on

446
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My person shows

447
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.490
Ken Olsen: You know, and

448
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.880
Ken Olsen: Another thing, it kind of freaks me out is that

449
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.270
Ken Olsen: I haven't really I don't talk to anybody about this shit but

450
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.800
Ken Olsen: When my mom passed away.

451
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.820
Ken Olsen: Last we talked about this morning but uh

452
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.100
Ken Olsen: MY DAD PUT ME LIKE in charge of everything happens to him.

453
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.730
Ken Olsen: You know what I mean, like the first on the line, or whatever you call it.

454
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.370
Ken Olsen: The executor or something.

455
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Uh huh.

456
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:55.800
Ken Olsen: And I got two older brothers.

457
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.570
Ken Olsen: And I think about that, like, what am I going to do

458
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.810
