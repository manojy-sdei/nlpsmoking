Dr. Belis Aladag: We do we do once a week visits.

175
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:32.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: And these visits are like a combination. It's a, it's a doctor visit with me to talk about your medication.

176
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:44.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: And adjusting. And if we need to. So I'll be like, Okay, you know, Valentin. Let's start with this dose, you know, whatever. We'll talk about it. And then, and then I'll see you again and then ask if you're

177
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:59.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Comfortable with that and we'll adjust if we need to. Right, so it'll be a doctor's visit so it's once a week. Practice also with me. There are therapists who will help run like a group. So this is, it's, it's kind of a

178
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Combination group therapy plus

179
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.770
Valentin perez: Docker. Okay.

180
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, so

181
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, there's other people. So you mentioned you're kind of like, I don't know.

182
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:12.570

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.070
Valentin perez: Yeah, me.

184
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just try it and I

185
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.040
Think

186
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:27.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, as a doctor for me it's a newer concept to to have doctors visits together there other other patients all together. It's kind of interesting.

187
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:34.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: But so far, it's been pretty, pretty good. Like people are respectful, you know, we have a conversation, you know,

188
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:48.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, and then it's after we talk in the therapist takes over. It's actually a good conversation. It's an hour long. And if we have time, we talk about relevant stuff and people support each other. It's a good

189
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.070
Valentin perez: All right.

190
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I think that'll be good for you so, so I think

208
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so

209
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:48.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: To start, like I said, we need you need to be in withdrawal. So you need to stop taking whatever else you have right so throw everything get rid of every supply

210
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then like

212
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:06.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: You think you'll go into withdrawal. Like if you didn't use any more today. Do you think you'll start feeling bad tonight. Yeah.

213
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: By tonight or tomorrow morning.

214
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.970
Valentin perez: Yeah, maybe tomorrow morning.

215
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:21.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, if you can last until tomorrow morning. It's better to wait because you want to feel better when you take it. You don't want to feel worse.

216
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:31.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Too soon you'll feel worse, which is okay. I mean, it's not. It doesn't feel good at all. But it goes away after like an hour to

217
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:43.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Getting better but it's I would rather you have a positive experience. So I want you to like not do anything, just kind of lay low today get, you know, keep yourself busy. If you can

218
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: And tomorrow morning. If you need to have at least two physical symptoms. So either your, your eyes are teary your noses running, you know, loose bombs or chills. You know those physical things

219
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:09.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Diarrhea or like loose stools. If you start getting one or two of those symptoms or your you look at your eyes and your pupils are really big dilated

220
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Those things will count. So they have to have those signs and then you're like, Okay, I feel pretty like I'm in moderate

221
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: To severe. You don't have to be in severe withdrawal but moderate withdrawal. Then you take it.

222
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and where you take it. It's important that you put it under your tongue.

223
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: So drink some water before. So, your mouth is moist.

224
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you put it under your tongue, you let it melt. That's how it gets into your bloodstream.

225
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.040
And then

226
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:49.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: It should kick in pretty quick. You know, like within a few minutes. Hopefully you'll start like five minutes or something, you start feeling like, Okay, I think I'm a little bit better, a little less Ruth Raleigh and then

227
00:17:50.550 --> 00:18:04.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that we can we can start with half a tab and then see how you feel. And then if you want take the other half a tablet after maybe half hour if you're still feeling like you have withdrawal.

228
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:12.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then at night before, you know, maybe around dinner time. You can take another full tablet, if you want.

229
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.400
Valentin perez: And

230
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:24.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: The next day, maybe start in the morning with one full tablet and then later towards the evening, maybe after between lunch and dinner. You can take your second tablet.

231
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So morning time when you wake up and then

232
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: In the afternoon. You don't have to wait till nighttime to take your second dose. You can take it kind of in the afternoon. Okay.

233
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:51.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so let's kind of I'm planning on that might be a good dose for you like one in the morning and one later in the day. So that's eight and eight so 16 milligrams. I think that'll be a good dose, but we'll see how you feel. Do you have

234
00:18:51.270 --> 00:19:01.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cravings the ideal dose is one where you feel normal. You feel like okay I feel normal neutral, but you don't think about

235
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Using and you're not craving all the time, not always, like, okay, okay, I need

236
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Something you know

237
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.750
Right.

238
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: So hopefully, you'll see that the obsession will stop once you get to the right dose.

239
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I'll ask you about cravings. When I see you on Friday. Um,

240
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:29.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: What else, what else. Oh, I'm also going to prescribe you've never had an overdose, but it's still something we want to give you is Narcan

241
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:41.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a nasal spray. If you were to like you can give it to your parents or keep it in the house. If you pass out and no one can wake you up, they could spray it in your nose and bring you back.

242
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: On one

243
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.030
Valentin perez: Because it's temporary. Okay.

244
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:52.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's the norm can spray. You can ask the pharmacy, how much it's going to be and

245
00:19:52.860 --> 00:20:04.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it's up to you to get it or not. You don't have to purchase it. If it's expensive, and you don't think you're going to need it, but something that's good to have. It's also something you can use on someone else.

246
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.640
Valentin perez: God forbid.

247
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: You see someone passed.

248
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: A law.

249
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.570
Valentin perez: That's true.

250
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and, and the thing is, it doesn't

251
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:19.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: hurt people. If it's not opioid overdose. Let's say they just passed out because of something else and you use it, it's okay. It won't hurt them.

252
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah.

253
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:39.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll do the nicotine patches and the candy. And with that, you just put it on like I said you avoid smoking, you know, you stop the cigarettes and instead, you take the candy as needed throughout the day you could do five attendees or six candies. If you need, you know,

254
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:58.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we'll do that. We'll do the non can spray and we'll do the the buprenorphine naloxone tablets. Now there's tablets that are combination. So don't get confused. You'll see it says buprenorphine the lock zone. So it has two things in the pill.

255
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's actually just the buprenorphine that's active so

256
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't get confused. Don't, don't worry about them, the locks on peace. That's not active. If you take it under your tongue.

257
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:18.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you're not injecting it it's not going to be active. The drug company puts that in there in case people want to, you know, abuse it, and injected

258
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:37.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: If you were to inject the the tablet, you know, melted and stuff, then you'd get the reversal agent. The antagonists effect. But if you take it like you should under your tongue. It's not active so you can ignore it. So don't get confused. Like, why is she giving me this combo pill. Okay.

259
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:45.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, it's the same thing as the regular buprenorphine. It's buprenorphine sometimes it depends on the insurance company to which they

260
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.430
Valentin perez: sound good. Okay.

261
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, do you have any questions for me.

262
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.110
Valentin perez: Know what, where do I pick up the prescription, how to do it.

263
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.730

280
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:24.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that one. The first visit is definitely required and then after that you and the therapist decide how frequently, you're going to meet

281
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:41.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: But that first visit needs to take place. So I would recommend after we hang up call back call that virtual clinic, you call the zoom number and tell them, Hey, I saw the doctor but she says I also need to schedule a individual therapy appointment.

282
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.210
Valentin perez: Okay.
