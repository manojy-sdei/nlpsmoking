Serenna Beers: On the table.

153
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.770
Serenna Beers: We're going that drawer.

154
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.400
Serenna Beers: You find one. My daughter needs a pencil. I apologize.

155
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.800
Serenna Beers: What about a pin. Okay. Your sharpener is out there.

156
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.930
Serenna Beers: Okay, let me see. It looks like.

157
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:36.390
Serenna Beers: twice a month is what it recommends on here. So, do you, do you want to meet in a couple weeks. And just kind of see where you're at. I mean, I'm more than flexible to meet with you on a weekly basis what one of my specialties. I'm

158
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:52.230
Serenna Beers: Hannah is trauma, I am actually a trauma therapist, I am em Dr certified and that wouldn't obviously be anything that I do with you right away. I'd want to get to know you, but I think there's, um, there's, there's a lot of

159
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.380
Serenna Beers: There's a lot of research behind it, have. Have you ever heard of it.

160
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:08.340
hannahcloe: Yeah, it's something that my doctors wanted me to do, actually. Wow. So I've just been kind of avoid on about it, honestly.

161
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:17.790
Serenna Beers: Yeah, well. And actually, because it is very, very powerful. I mean, I use a matter of fact, I use this one here, if you can see it. It's a

162
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:27.000
Serenna Beers: It's an Ellie led wand and I move it back and forth. They stimulate ram while you're awake, which is you know what we

163
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:36.030
Serenna Beers: Go into if we're doing some really good sleep, and that's where are some were at the most subconscious state when we're in rem

164
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.610
Serenna Beers: And with the one that pulls up those

165
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:49.110
Serenna Beers: Memories that you've suppressed and that trauma that you've lodged in your nervous system up to your working memory so that your brain can process the trauma around it.

166
00:20:49.380 --> 00:21:04.530
Serenna Beers: In the way that it that it was meant to be in an adaptive pattern route, rather than a maladaptive maladaptive so that wouldn't be like i said i mean you haven't been out of the hospital for very long. Right.

167
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:16.350
Serenna Beers: Yeah. And, and so I'm thinking like further, further down the road. My point was letting you know that you know if at some point you feel like this is something you want to explore

168
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:27.180
Serenna Beers: That as your therapist, I have the ability to do that kind of work with with you and and so maybe maybe we set out your appointment for

169
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:42.060
Serenna Beers: The seventh of May. And let me just check my calendar and then we just kind of start from there. And then if you want to meet with me more often, or you feel that it's very how helpful for you.

170
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.130
Serenna Beers: Then we can step it up some

171
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.240
hannahcloe: Okay.

172
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.170
Serenna Beers: So let me see here. What if we did

173
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:04.890
Serenna Beers: And of course, this little sucker is very slow right now. So I said, May 7 right I think is what I said.

174
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.600
Serenna Beers: Goodness gracious may

175
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.320
Serenna Beers: May 7 that ok so maybe seven that looks like I could

176
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.050
Serenna Beers: I could do

177
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.140
Serenna Beers: I could do 11 o'clock. Again, if this is something that fits

178
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.400
hannahcloe: Yeah, that work.

179
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.680
Serenna Beers: Okay, or actually I think we were scheduled for 10 but does 11 O'clock work for you.

180
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:35.880
hannahcloe: Yeah, that's fine.

181
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:42.120
Serenna Beers: Okay. So while I have you on the phone. I'm going to write that down on my own calendar so I can make sure that I get it into the book.

182
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.840
Serenna Beers: And so we said for May 7 at 11 o'clock, and it's Hannah Chloe. Right.

183
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.130

00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:03.330
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay. Hannah for follow up individual and then we can just talk about how things have gone and how you're adjusting and

186
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:18.990
Serenna Beers: And just and maybe I can also in between now and then come up with some skills you know there's Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. There's cognitive behavioral therapy, which I'm sure you've probably heard of all of it right

187
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.440
hannahcloe: Yeah, I've done a lot of CVT work and I'm past

188
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.270
hannahcloe: So,

189
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.780
hannahcloe: Familiar with DB t. So,

190
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:36.360
Serenna Beers: Okay. Well, good. So maybe we we could just do some refresher skills, you know, especially to help you around that distress.

191
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:51.900
Serenna Beers: Tolerance, which, you know, the more you bring your anxiety down the less you'll be impulsive and the more you will decrease those type of unwanted behaviors. You know what I mean.
