00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're kicked out just now he's just irritated, that's just because it's an early Sunday morning. Right.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:09:00.690
Laura’s iPhone: Sleep and Britain and he just didn't feel good. And he walked in, he mentioned morning oh my medicine. Well, the thing is like the medicine that he let him.

69
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.970
Laura’s iPhone: So he likes to

Laura’s iPhone: Meals

72
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.360

73
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:41.580
Laura’s iPhone: I just assumed that he was going to leave. Sounds like all you're gonna leave. Oh, and he was like, Oh, well, I never done that that's the case. And then it's just like a whole is, like I said, I started as soon as I knew better, and

74
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.580
Laura’s iPhone: Then at that point it was like he might even

75
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So all it started with going to the store leave means going to the store.

76
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.370
Yeah.

77
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:58.230

Laura’s iPhone: Out. Yeah.

79
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he was being passive in his communication, like, hey, I don't feel well. And the meaning was Laura go shopping for me and you didn't do it. And so maybe he got irritated and you guys yet maybe

80
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.460
Laura’s iPhone: Yeah, all right. Yeah. Okay.

81

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

118
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.100
Laura’s iPhone: I'm a woman.

119
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:37.140
Laura’s iPhone: You would like kick the cat out of the room and I just like, you know, clean drop one written box and just watch TV and

120
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.650
Laura’s iPhone: Jerry Springer.

121
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.020
Laura’s iPhone: But, you know, and those are you ready, are you at all.

122
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.310
Okay.

123
00:13:49.680 --> 00:14:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I thought we could unless you want to talk through what happened with Kyle, or even just this morning because I was able to witness some things in real time. How you to communicate.

124
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We could go there. Or we could do more long term.

125
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Preparation we do I have a whole list of things that I'd like to do with you, you know, normally we talk about current events that are going on in your life today what we could do is we could start to do some preparation things that

126
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We do that today. All right, and I and then right at the end. Don't let me forget to message, your doctor that you were here today. Okay.

127
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll review when your next appointments are

128
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:35.340
So,

129
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of things though.

130
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You do need to have those numbers written down because you are an adult, you're a young one, but you are an adult. And so you want to have those numbers written down. Don't rely on phones to remember the the virtual clinic and my number.

131
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.410
Laura’s iPhone: Number last parts of the first part of yours.

132
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Rely on memory because when we're anxious cortisol comes flooding on or hippocampus, where we keep our memory. We won't remember

133
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to write it down. That's part of what just being we go old school and we write it down. So you want to get it on a piece of paper that sits in maybe your wallet, something like that, that goes in this, you always have my number. My cell number

134
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You always have

135
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: A bright heart health number and the virtual clinic in mind if you want to memorize it mine doesn't change. So you can you can kind of have that one written down to

136
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

137
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you hear the alarm today. How did that work.

138
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.080

145
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. But you see my point. You came really close to missing today, right.

146
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's all just just saying there's a lot at stake here to your medication having short little bridge things. I think those are probably inconvenient. So we want you to attend scheduled appointments. All right. So, write it down. Next.

147
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's review our next appointment and then we'll get into the clinical stuff. Let me know if you can't hear me okay because

148
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:28.440
Okay.

149
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you looking for paper.

150
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.770
Laura’s iPhone: Yeah okay because I

155
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's early. So that means

156
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The next

157
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.430
Laura’s iPhone: Tuesday. Right.

158
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. And that means the night before a Monday night, you don't want to stay up till two in the morning. You want to go to sleep. So that, so it's not hard to get up. Okay.

159
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, and then group on June 4 at 11am

160
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.560
Laura’s iPhone: Of further

161
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:32.280
Uh huh.

162
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And then that's all I see

163
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I see for next week, once a week. So, so I have a training. I have a lot going on. So it's really important that you keep your scheduled appointments

164
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.590
Laura’s iPhone: Okay.

165
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: After this, I'm going to need to write a behavior contract if you keep missing them. Okay.

166
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it gets really risky because after that, then we're looking at maybe going somewhere else. So I don't want the I like working with you. So let's keep let's see if we can keep this going.

167
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm just saying I keep it real. I don't

168
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.090
Laura’s iPhone: I don't know. There. I know.

169
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, alright, so here we go. This is fun.

170
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This, I want to get into the creative side of your brain, the right brain. So the creative side, the part that

171
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It does all of the memory storage of emotion. It is the part where you imagine something so I'm going to be asking you to focus on fantasy and imagination today. Okay, these are not things that

172
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe really exist, but we're going to be using our creative mind. Do you like doing creative things

173
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.440
Laura’s iPhone: No try

174
00:18:51.450 --> 00:19:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, okay. So you can laugh at me. This stuff is a little silly. We're normally you know I focus on thoughts and

175
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: emotions and behaviors. This one is some kind of kooky stuff.

176
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. For but it's but it's still a thought, which is the same as thinking about something else. It's just a different part of the brain. Okay, it's still a thought.

177
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. So you can laugh at me. That's fine.

178
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do a few of them. Number one, I want to build your resource team and it's made up of three figures.

179
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: First one, and the rules are, they can be real like real people, real animals real things or they can be imagined. Maybe it's from a movie or a TV show or a fantasy, something that comes out of your imagination.

180
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to think of a protective figure someone that would keep you safe in your imagination.

181
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That has all the qualities of keeping you physically who

182
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Tinker Tinker Bell Tinkerbell. Okay, got it.

183
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful and

184
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

185
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The second one.

186
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: A nurturing figure a nurturing figure is someone, it's not necessarily affection, it's someone who wants for you, your full growth and your full potential be reached.

187
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: They want

188
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to be everything that you can be, but they don't they don't care. There's no exchange. It's just all about carrying that you grow and evolve and develop

189
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.370
Laura’s iPhone: Your treasure.

190
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Will do this one. Then we'll go get a charger. Okay.

191
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's hard for some people, when they've they've experienced

192
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of sort of physical or emotional abuse or neglect in their, in their life. This one's kind of hard for people where there's no exchange, it's just someone that wants for you to reach your full potential. Is there anyone that you saw a movie or you saw a glimpse of

193
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That all they said to you was you've got this, you can do this. I believe in you.

194
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.250
Laura’s iPhone: And yes, what it's like it's childish very appearance. I don't know.

195
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Say it one more time.

196
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.610
Laura’s iPhone: From the very odd.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, got it. And is that a movie.

199
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.310
Laura’s iPhone: With the show. It's like

200
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.440
Laura’s iPhone: It has to do with this kid that like has, like, you know, magical barons.

201
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but they're

202
00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.230
Laura’s iPhone: They're like little, like, you know,

203
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.400
Laura’s iPhone: diners or whatever. But, but, like, he never helps them. They just helped him.

204
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

205
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, cool.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. All right. Do you want to go get a battery and come back.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, go get a drink on

208
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing. You don't have to argue with anyone.

209
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just getting a charger and then I'm heading back out.

210
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:06.540
Laura’s iPhone: Yes.

211
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The third one for the third one.

212
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:18.810
Laura’s iPhone: Okay.

213
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So the third one is a wise figure someone that

214
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.290
Laura’s iPhone: Was

215
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Intelligent and know how to use their intelligence right this image of sort of this person that knows what to do KNOWS HOW DID YOU IT and does it in a really good way

216
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice like I don't know spell that though.

217
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm you f f as a, ah,

218
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knows, I'll check the spelling

219
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Perfect. So we have a sense of just for a moment. You can keep chewing, but just bring into your imagination just for a moment.

220
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Tinker Bell break kind of fluttering around, right. And what she does is she create safety for you because these are your. These are your protective figure elements. And then there's a nurturing quality of the parents in very odd parents these magical parents right

221
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And they have a nurturing because they what they want and it will ultimately be for you.

222
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That what they want for you is that you reach your potential and feel what it's like to be around right Tinkerbell around these parents that are they're wanting the best for you. They don't want anything in return. Okay.

223
00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And move fossa, right, maybe even hearing his voice.

224
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

225
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So just picture being there, being there with them, maybe on the shore of of a river, the shore of an ocean somewhere that sort of this positive imagery that makes you feel comfortable and safe, where we would all these you in these three figures be

226
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.540
Laura’s iPhone: Like the mountains, I should move

227
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Mountains. Okay. Beautiful.

228
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So just be present with them. And notice how your body feels when you're present which that imagery. Does it bring

229
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.140
Laura’s iPhone: It why I got chills.

230
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, nice.

231
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So some things

232
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a good thing. It sounds like you picked up on some good imagery ones that have meaning for you so you. Excellent. So can we keep going.

233
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got more the more we do these today. Maybe we'll just do all these creative pieces today. And then we'll have them ready for some some psychological

234
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Techniques that we do later. So next one I want to do what's called a distancing metaphor. A distancing metaphor. So I'm going to give you a few examples. You don't have to use my examples you can come up with your own, but it gets your creative mind going okay

235
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's one. So the idea is when we're in distress. Let's say we're anxious or angry or sad. We're scared and we want to get distance from it.

236
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We, we think about this imagery and we picture, for example, that stress being on a little leaf it's floating down a creek and we stay on the shore and we're watching it get further and further away.

237
00:27:52.740 --> 00:28:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And on that leaf is that anxious feeling fear, anxiety, discussed jealousy rage.

238
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I threaten jealousy, just for you.

239
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We all get it. Okay, so, so, and the idea is that

240
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it's getting

241
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting further and further away.

242
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That key. So that's one. Here's another one. We have a balloon and on it. We write frustration repulsion, something like that. And we tie it up and it just sort of floats floats up into the atmosphere to the point that we can't, we can't see it anymore. Or maybe

243
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: A balloon. Yeah.

244
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a rocket ship is on a rocket ship. And it takes off very fast and it gets out of the atmosphere or it's on a shooting star.

245
00:28:54.270 --> 00:29:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it goes slowly and it's we're on the shore, you're on the shore right with your resource team and it's on a on a race a speedboat and it's going away or or a sailboat.

246
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also someone had a gorge where they would

247
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: They would stand at the edge and drop it off of really high bridge. They would just throw it off like that and

248
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And see it fall

249
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.290
Laura’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

250
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got a given you a couple ideas. I want you to picture if you had an emotion you didn't want to deal with right then you wanted to get some distance from it. What's imagery that you like.

251
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.100
Do you like

252
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:39.600
Laura’s iPhone: Flushing.

253
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.810
Laura’s iPhone: Tell me again going to bathroom flushing.

254
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The bathroom flush it. OK.

255
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:48.870
OK.

256
00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, we will go with that one, we may do another one at a later time. But for now, that works great.

257
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, another one. This one is, have you ever heard of the word compartmentalization

258
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Know in your mind.

259
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.910
Laura’s iPhone: Are they enough

260
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, aren't you've probably had times when you you knew there was something important that you wanted to think about like a problem to solve. But you couldn't do it right then. And so you push the thought off to the side so that, let's say you could work. Let's say

261
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like let's say an argument with a boyfriend or something and you had to push it over in order to talk to a customer or something, you needed to do job.

262
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's called compartmentalization so yeah so this one is called an emotional container and I want you to think about. So, here, here are the instructions. Number one, I want you to think about a container that is big enough.

263
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And strong enough to hold all of your negative emotional stuff. It can be as big as you want, but it has to be strong and a way, keep the lid shut

264
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.300
Laura’s iPhone: And broke

265
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's the container.

266
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This comes from your imagination. What is it,

267
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.750
Laura’s iPhone: A boat.

268
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.070
A vault.

269
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.980
Laura’s iPhone: Me Your empty like

270
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Malt. Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. How big is it

271
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.560
Laura’s iPhone: nine feet right well for you.

272
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:33.930
Laura’s iPhone: Why

273
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And the locking system. Is it the big spinning thing is it like a code or fingerprint. How do you, how do you view your fingerprint. OK. OK.

274
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

275
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And

276
00:31:54.870 --> 00:32:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This is something where when you want to go in, you can go in and we could one at a time. Take it out. Talk about it. And then when you don't want to do it anymore.

277
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it away. Okay. Because there'll be times when let's say we're right at the end of a session and you're starting to maybe have

278
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A big emotion and we need to bring those emotions down as you go on for the rest of your day. I might invite you to say, well, let's let's take whatever's coming up for you. And I want you to picture taking it and taking it and throwing it in the vault or gently putting it in the vault.

279
00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then locking it okay but it does mean that we have access to it. Unlike the toilet, which we probably won't get it back with the toilet. Right.

280
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. So with the ball. We have access to it. Um, so, that's perfect.

281
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Excellent, how much time we have 10 minutes. Okay. I want to do another thing which has to do with

282
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show you

283
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure, sure, sure, sure.

284
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you see right here in the blue.

285
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: See the blue. Okay. I want to put stories in here like I'm

286
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Kyle yelled at me.

287
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to put stories in there that are important to you in your life.

288
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I can learn what a level of distress for you. That is 100 a level of distress. That is a 10 etc. Now for some people, are you able to hear me.

289
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.450
Laura’s iPhone: Yeah.

290
00:33:54.750 --> 00:34:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. For some people they have negative. They go below. They go below zero. So I'll show you. So minus 10

291
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Minus 20 and all of

292
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That is

293
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there. Have there ever been times where you have noticed that you space out lose time feel like you're having an out of body experience.

294
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Even. Yeah. Okay. That's what this is. That's called freeze. This is

295
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I can spell it. M mo bill ization with fear that's below the line. Okay, so for some people.

296
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And because of your history with your birth father

297
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, this is all they can do. They can't fight. Look, that's what this this stuff up here is our fight and our flea response, we can get angry and scare appear and we're still mobilized, we can move

298
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Around angry and scared.

299
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When you go in here and you space out and you don't remember time and you feel like you can almost see your body from outside your body that is dissociation and that is below zero.

300
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

301
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So even when I say hey how distressing with something if you tell me you know what relaxing for me is fine, but I can't get too relaxed, because maybe I start to check out and I don't really want to be to to relax some people tell me that

302
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I want to know those things too, because that would be down in here in these numbers down here below zero. Okay.

303
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So you and we, it's okay. You know, you can't do this wrong. It's just me only me, you can't do anything wrong. Laura. Okay.

304
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, yeah, it's just me learning because I'm going to need to know in the work that I'm going to do with you. I need to know

305
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressed you are because it won't be productive if you're starting to dissociate, or you're so flooded by

306
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Fear. You won't, it won't stick in your hippocampus, it won't stay there. So I want you a little bit

307
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Distressed maybe at a 30 maybe 40 but when we get up to 7080 you may be in so much distress that I need to focus on bringing that intensity down before you remember the work that we're going to do, does that part. Makes sense.

308
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.990
Laura’s iPhone: Yeah.

309
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And same thing down here if I even if I even hear that you're going down here below. I'm going to want to get you back to consciousness. Okay. Up here at at least baseline. What is this the x axis.

310
00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.020
Laura’s iPhone: Yeah, sure.

311
00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.580
Laura’s iPhone: Ever

312
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't remember if. Why is the vertical one. But anyway, so I'm going to want to get you feeling so that you're back in your body and you're using all of your brain to. So, you with me so far.

313
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start up on these. Okay. We won't go down into these these dissociation yet. Let's go to one where you were the maddest the angriest that you've ever been. Can you tell me how old you were what that story is just

314
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just tell me that thought.

Gwenevere Abriel: So now.

326
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about zero is I'm calm. I'm fine. And now 100 is just
