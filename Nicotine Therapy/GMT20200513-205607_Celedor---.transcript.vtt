52
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:30.900
jason whittemire: You know, government funded drugs and stuff. And I don't take anything like that. I don't want anything like that. That's not part of recovery. I have been in na for 10 years I have 10 years sobriety.

53
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.410
jason whittemire: off drugs. I was a facilitator and classes and whatnot at the early end of my

54
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:51.480
jason whittemire: Getting into sobriety. I just at this point, you know, drink socially and kind of got dropped off into going somewhere that I probably shouldn't have that night had some drinks.

55
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.210
jason whittemire: And like I said got pulled over.

56
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.400
jason whittemire: Not an everyday drinker. I'm not a

57
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:13.290
jason whittemire: blackout drunk. I'm not a how'd I get home last night raw. It was kind of manageable. I've got a 14 year old daughter that I'm raising. So a lot of my time is either at work or when I come home. I make dinner. I try to spend time with her. And so she starts to ignore me

58
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.250
Right now.

59
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.270
jason whittemire: But at this point, I wasn't going out to the

60
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.220
jason whittemire: Bars and things like that. I just

61
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.200
jason whittemire: I drink, you know, a few times a week on the weekends.

62
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:42.330
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so let me go ahead and follow this protocol, because we document it. And I can tell you a really good historian, so I don't want to have, have you to keep repeating everything, but I want to make certain that I am representing you will and the documentation. Okay.

63
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.230
jason whittemire: Yes, ma'am.

64
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.590
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So you have 47 year old young male that had a recent DUI. And when was that

65
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.390
jason whittemire: A few months ago, I don't know the exact date. I could look on the ticket.

66
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.680
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Oh, that's okay. A few months prior, he ended up in drug court and so you asked to come to bright heart hell.

67
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.490
jason whittemire: Yeah, they gave me three choices and I feel that

68
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:16.320
jason whittemire: You know, being able to do this via satellite or telephone or whatever, for my type of situation because in my work I have

69
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:27.360
jason whittemire: Meetings. I'm going to one place to a meeting. I'm going here. I got to meet adjuster, I need a homeowner I dropped material, so it'd be a lot easier for me to be able to do this on a telephone than it would

70
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:39.600
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so he was given the different options to address the DUI and he felt like bright heart health was the better option giving your active lifestyle. Right.

71
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.990
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Sure. Okay. Dan. So what I'll do is in terms of your

72
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.480
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Alcohol Use history. When did you start drinking alcohol.

73
00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:01.740
jason whittemire: I 1617 or so, you know, steel about bottle of Mad Dog 2020 from the dairy Mark go down to the middle Park and drink it with your buddies and then

74
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.190
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay.

75
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.190
jason whittemire: Try to understand why can't stand up under skateboarding anymore.

76
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.570
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so start at 16 years old and did that progress over time.

77
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.410
jason whittemire: I mean you know 21 when you're allowed to go to a bar, you go to a bar and be social, you try to pick up girls.

78
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:25.350
jason whittemire: I worked a lot. So, but, of course, the older men that I worked with after work, what do you do your don't get, get your bearings

79
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.750
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Bar at work. Okay.

80
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.740
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So,

81
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.300
So I

82
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:38.430
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So you say in your 20s, you continue to drink alcohol socially after work.

83
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.260
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah okay and this continue to escalate.

84
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:52.110
jason whittemire: I mean, there was a part when I, you know, started doing drugs and things like that. And that's when I passed away, years of my life. And when I finally

85
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.870
jason whittemire: Woke up and got sober.

86
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:02.520
jason whittemire: I went cold turkey, you know, for a couple of years. And after I got over the drug part

87
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:13.260
jason whittemire: I drank a little bit and then you know at this point, I've not been doing drugs again. But I have socially drink on the weekends and whatnot. Okay.

88
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:22.410
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So while you were drinking alcohol. What drugs that you have in this was this in your early 30s and 40s that you use different drugs or and you

89
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.480

92
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.410
jason whittemire: You know, and that's again. Work, work, work. Go, go, go.

170
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:39.300

jason whittemire: Okay.

239
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:25.860
jason whittemire: The whole reason that these girls are in my life is because I stopped using and I had to change who I was to get them in my life and the one or mom just happened to

240
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.380
jason whittemire: Screw up and need

241
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.030
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: To take

242
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:36.870
jason whittemire: Charge of my 14 year old and then at this point my 17 year old. Her mother had kept my a

243
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.900
jason whittemire: Existence a secret for till the time that I

244
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:56.220
jason whittemire: Went to my 17 year old 16 at the time, and said, Hey, I'm who I am. And by the way, you know, your mom has kept that effect away from you and I want you to be in my life and

245
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:02.910
jason whittemire: The more I worked and focused on the girls, the more that my life came together, the better work got better.

246
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:11.730
jason whittemire: Relationships. I got now I got both of them in my life. I'm going to be at my daughter's graduation. I'm going to her sister and her now know each other.

249
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:30.840
jason whittemire: And it's just great to have her part of my life and to have my 14 year old living in my house because

250
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:40.020
jason whittemire: I know the shithole that she came from and the type of woman that she came from and she don't have her stuff together and drugs are a part of her life and

253
00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:09.990
jason whittemire: More growth we throw away food as it rots there's more groceries and then we need we hit. She has every little thing that she could want. And all I'm trying to focus on is teaching her how to look out for the man I used to be and look for qualities in the man I am now.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:27.750
jason whittemire: It's everything now because it's been brought to my attention that I could lose everything that I just worked my ass off to have and

257
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:38.610

294
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:38.550

jason whittemire: Or even like the little date pins, but they ain't got nothing in them.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.330
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And it's easy to get to.

698
00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:57.090
jason whittemire: The hand to mouth the hand to mouth.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.560
jason whittemire: And if you just notice as soon as we started talking about cigarettes. I wouldn't get one.
