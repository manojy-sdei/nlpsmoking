Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's see, my database has been moving kind of slow here. So I want to

14
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.710
Open a note, just going to take a little bit

15
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have a chance to practice the diaphragm right die for matic breathing the belly breathing, did you get a chance to remember it. Do it.

16
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.810
Bianca Garcia: Yes, I, I tried it, I think. I think I got it. I remembered it. Yes.

17
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. Were you already in a chill mood or did you do it like when somebody said something offensive or when did what, when did you do it.

18
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:14.400
Bianca Garcia: Oh, just when I wanted. Well, when I felt like I wanted to blow up in our get like when you're overwhelmed or, you know, just, just from the kids. Cuz sometimes there. You have to control. It is I, that's what I did it.

19
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's smart.

20
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you notice that after that you could think of more things that you could do that problem solving got easier.

21
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.200
Bianca Garcia: Yes. Well, I did a chill out for sure.

22
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:44.100
Bianca Garcia: Before I blew up on them but yeah I I calmed down a lot and I did really have more ideas of, you know, how to keep them from fighting or

23
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.040
Bianca Garcia: You know, to make your worse on myself.

24
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm are you open to talking a little bit about what challenges might come up with, with the kids.

25
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.720
Bianca Garcia: Let me know.

26
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.820
Bianca Garcia: About that. Sure.

27
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.610
Bianca Garcia: Okay. Um, what challenges I've gone through with the kids.

28
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.390
Yeah.

29
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.480
Bianca Garcia: Well, I have a seven year old and a five year old. So there are two years apart and the consistently excite like

30
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:30.390
Bianca Garcia: For everything they can be around each other or if she touches one of her toys that she'll get mad or when they're sitting in the car. They're just oh my gosh it's every little thing with them, too. So

31
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.470
Bianca Garcia: Those are challenges I have with them and then the baby's not too bad. I'm sometimes she'll

32
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.000
Bianca Garcia: You know, just want something and then I won't figure out, like what it is. And then finally, I'll figure it out. But she's a lot more

33
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:57.330
Bianca Garcia: You know she's one now, so she could point like like you'll be like, Oh, you want good. He's doing his show not yes so she's not bad, it's those to that give me more challenges.

34
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But

35
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you tried to address that that behavior. What have you tried

36
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:21.210
Bianca Garcia: Well, I tried to keep them separated and I tried to talk to my older one to seven year old they are, because she's, she's so I mean, for no reason. Like my younger one go into it, Rochelle. Get out. Mike, why do you have to be so mean and they try to be nicer to her.

37
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.050
Bianca Garcia: Or play with her, or tell her you know I don't want you in my room, you know, just try to be nice and

38
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.590
Bianca Garcia: That's what I do. I tried to talk to the older one and Tyler and then the younger one I just tell her. Okay. She doesn't want to be bothered right now. Don't go to a room or

39
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.260
Bianca Garcia: You know, just come in here with me or whatever it is that's going on at that moment. So that's what I like to start talking to them as much as possible.

40
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.480
Bianca Garcia: Since they're China, you know, understanding in the younger ones going to the teacher in school, like how to adjust her feelings.

41
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:07.740
Bianca Garcia: She's mad or sad or they show her how to problem solve, as well. Okay. Um, yeah, so she's she so I tried to go off of that as well keep it as a routine from school to home. Yeah.

42
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How are they doing it and curious to hear what what teachers are doing around that.

43
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:24.450
Bianca Garcia: Well, she she has like little cards, where it says, problem solving, and it'll be like, Oh, well, take a seat. Or you could like, calm down or or how to be nice, or share

44
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:40.020
Bianca Garcia: You know, just stuff like that. And in the in the teacher always tells me, you know, and she showed me the look card. So I try to go with that too because that's actually. I like that. She says that they need to express themselves and sometimes they don't know how

45
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.060
Bianca Garcia: That's right, yeah. So, so I tried to go off on I taught me a lot with the teacher. She's actually a really awesome.

46
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Katie Yeah, that is, I LOVE THAT THIS THIS teachers aware of feelings and emotions and trying to teach them kind of what to do with them.

47
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And you were saying that you learned

48
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.690
From her

49
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.700
Bianca Garcia: I'm sorry.

50
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you learned from that teacher, too.

51
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:17.460
Bianca Garcia: Oh yes definitely. Yeah, yeah, we get along really well actually I feel like sometimes like we're friends like we talked a lot and

52
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:30.300
Bianca Garcia: I pick them up so we get to talk a lot about what's going on and she tells me about the kids or about my kid and you know so. So yeah, definitely learned a lot from her.

53
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.400
Bianca Garcia: Okay, good.

54
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, she's in good care. It sounds like during the day.

55
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.510
Bianca Garcia: Yes, I trust her with my child. I feel sorry for. Sometimes, though, because she has it with those children.

56
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

57
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.430
Bianca Garcia: Yes, I don't know how she does it.

58
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There so patient they stay deserves so much more money.

59
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:54.150
Bianca Garcia: I

60
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you. Oh yeah, it's not even fair

61
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.330
I know

62
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to try this database again. See if I can look out, it's like nothing going on just a great big spin and we'll

63
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: See, try again.

64
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

65
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: About how many years or months has this tension between your two daughters been going on.

66
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.360
Bianca Garcia: It seems like from this year.

67
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:44.730
Bianca Garcia: This. So, this year it's been getting like that. It's they don't share rooms. Everybody has their own room. So that's a plus. But yeah, it's been this whole year.

68
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:59.820
Bianca Garcia: That I've seen it more between them. And then my older daughters, there she is five years apart. So she's a little older. So I don't see that. And then my baby, she's five years from the older one so I feel like that's going to be a good

69
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:13.980
Bianca Garcia: Stretch for them. But these two two years are really close. It seems like it's constant. So I just, I just need to find other ways like I trying, but it's really hard with them to

70
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, when you do want to shape behavior, right.

71
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that

72
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Has worked in maybe not the dynamics between those two. But as worked in other areas, what, what's your approach to shaping behavior you talk to them, obviously I heard that.

73
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that worked in other areas of what you want them to do.

74
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:47.460
Bianca Garcia: Yes. Well, they have been able to talk to me and explain their feelings or what they want or why they don't want them there.

75
00:08:49.500 --> 00:09:02.250
Bianca Garcia: And sometimes it's because we're picking and nipping from one or the other. And yeah, so that's mainly it or just separate them. It's always just more talking and separating them if

76
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:17.880
Bianca Garcia: Like, you know, just give her a little break, come do this or or we'll do stuff together and that will keep everybody quiet to, you know, like reading the book or coloring or their homework that that keeps them.

77
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.850
Bianca Garcia: From fighting. Okay.

78
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you're there with them together.

79
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That that tension that bickering doesn't seem to be there.

80
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:47.040
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, well, when yeah when we're like sitting next to each other, doing so because I'll be in the kitchen, living room, my room, whatever it is, and when they're just running to to their rooms or her room. That's when it happens is when I'm not like right right there.

81
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.280
Bianca Garcia: More yeah okay

82
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:03.270
Bianca Garcia: All right, when they're playing with my older daughter with them three are playing that that to that that keeps them from fighting for some reason.

83
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: She's 12

84
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.200
Bianca Garcia: Yes. Okay.

85
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I finally got my note open here so I can see where we left off.

86
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I taught you the belly breathing and you remembered it. That is just fantastic. Keep practicing that that'll be really handy for remembering other things that you learn. Okay.

87
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.560
Bianca Garcia: Oh, definitely. It's been so far so

88
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's play a little bit with more imagery. This time let's let's do

89
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some imagination for a moment. I want you to picture three fingers.

90
00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: One is a protective figure and it can be real or imagined could be an animal could be an image of something, don't get too hung up on that it has to be the right thing people have come up with various creative combinations sort of real people.

91
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And imaginary people so it can be anything you want.

92
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So it would be a protective figure a nurturing figure

93
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And a wise figure. Let's start with the first one I want you to think about real or imagined. Who do you think of it has this quality of a protective figure

94
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.590
Bianca Garcia: I would think.

95
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

96
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

97
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So a lion.

98
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And is, is there anyone in your life that you have known or that you've seen maybe in a movie or TV show or in your real life.

99
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That really embodies a protective nature.

100
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.650
Bianca Garcia: In a movie or in my life.

101
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.280
Uh huh.

102
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:15.570
Bianca Garcia: Well, I would think, well i i know that would probably be their dad.

103
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.940
Bianca Garcia: What's his name a model.

104
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:23.730
Bianca Garcia: A

105
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.560
Bianca Garcia: A deal

106
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: A Moto moto

107
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.950
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, okay.

108
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you because their dad protective, but do you find him protective like in the

109
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel. Okay. Excellent. So let's go over to the other one which is a nurturing figure nurturing typically least for this exercise.

110
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This real or imagined.

111
00:12:54.750 --> 00:13:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: wants your growth for you wants your development really want anything in return, just really just wants you to be everything that makes you happy, and nothing holds you back and just really supportive of your growth, um, who or what real or imagined.

112
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that quality.

113
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.420
Bianca Garcia: I would definitely say my kids.

114
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.840
Bianca Garcia: Okay, they're always like supportive of me and my growth. Like, no matter what.

115
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:37.320
Bianca Garcia: I know, obviously we make mistakes. We're not perfect, parents, but, you know, they're always, you know, have that loyalty. And I just, I just love that.

116
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone else

117
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.430
Bianca Garcia: Well, I would consider myself as well.

118
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. No, I got it. I like it.

119
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And the last one is real or imagined.

120
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A wise figure what comes to mind, but a wise figure

121
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.160
Bianca Garcia: Oh,

122
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:12.840
Bianca Garcia: I have a really good friend and she's a lot older okay um and I feel like she's always gave me wise advice.

123
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.470
Bianca Garcia: So, Teresa.

124
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.850
Bianca Garcia: She's an older friend who's

125
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Often given you good advice.

126
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:34.620
Bianca Garcia: Yes, she's a lot older she's going to be my mom, my grandma. She's just an awesome lady. Yeah.

127
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.020
All right.

128
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.540
Very nice.

129
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And while we've got some time let's let's keep working on some imagery here because we'll be using these for exercises later.

130
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to think about a container.

131
00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Container in your imagination, like let's say you were feeling impatient and you didn't want to be filling it you were angry or jealous.

132
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: really scared.

133
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't find it very convenient to really

134
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Dive into those emotions and didn't want to analyze it. We wanted to kind of compartmentalize it and you would do it liberally intentionally and consciously and you would put it in this container.

135
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It could also be used. Let's say doing something very intense work and let's

136
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Say a lot sign

137
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Up for you and we need to be respectful.

138
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.740
Bianca Garcia: That we only have

139
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Like three minutes left in our session.

140
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like, what do I do, you can take that and we can put it in a container and you and I can safely and respectfully pull it back out.

141
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to kind of

142
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: revisit it again.

143
00:15:50.790 --> 00:16:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't have to be right on the surface, we're feeling the intensity of a memory or an experience. So it's kind of nice to have that that imagery available. So you can say, okay, let's put that in the container, if you want to, but here are the requirements.

144
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This container this emotional container.

145
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The only requirement bar. It's got to be big enough strong enough to hold all your all your

146
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Stuff. So again, this is right brain creativity. What do you think of when I'm saying that

147
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.970
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I don't know. I

148
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.670
Bianca Garcia: Don't really get that, like, okay.

149
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's an imagination. So, this is this is done.

150
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of cookie things that we might be

151
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.200
Doing

152
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's because I have never heard anybody say oh I compartmentalize that I don't think about that. You ever heard anybody say that expression.

153
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.060
Bianca Garcia: Know what does that word mean

154
00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: compartmentalize it means I don't think about it. I kind of shut myself off from a thought and a memory and an experience. I just don't think about it.

155
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And some people can do it really well to the point that they almost feel like

156
00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not even in touch with a lot of feelings in their life like you almost wish they wouldn't

157
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: compartmentalize it like you're cutting

158
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself off or a big piece of who you are. Other people

159
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, they need to. They feel flooded all the time. It's just like they're constantly activated by stimulation

160
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Memories in their mood is up and up and down. It's just like they're constantly being flooded with all this, this information and be nice for them to be able to

161
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Put some of those thoughts and feelings away for a little while and kind of unpack them in a slower way and feel them at a little slower pace. So this is just an imagery. Some compartmentalize means we kind of put it in a container and that's what this is called, it's called a container.

162
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll give you some examples.

163
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you have an art an artsy side to you, so this is capitalizing on the right side of the brain right side of the brain has all that creative stuff and imagination.

164
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some people, a container was

165
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: A big

166
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.690
Bianca Garcia: Storage space and they can

167
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Roll up the

168
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Big door and when they were done those has a lot of space in it, and then they take both hands and they could

169
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull it down and they could lock it.

170
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would be in there and it wouldn't come out for some people it was a box about this big. And they called it a chest and it was brown and commerce look like a treasure chest and had this lock on it and they had the key. Some people was a Jafar, they could see in it wasn't very big

171
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know everyone's imagination. So that's their own, but you

172
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Have something when I first said a container.

173
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.620
What did you think of

174
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:10.920
Bianca Garcia: Like a jar. But, uh, but when you said like people put in a storage. I was thinking more like burying it in the dirt.

175
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.930
Bianca Garcia: That's what first came to my mind. Okay.

176
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we put it in the dirt that contain

177
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The container that it might be in. We can bury it.

178
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Which might almost be like a

179
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: An additional step.

180
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What would keep it buried because you're kind of kind of

181
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got to be big enough.

182
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong enough to hold on.

183
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:49.800
Bianca Garcia: They knew it would have to be what it looks like. You know those bolts.

184
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. So it's really thick like thick metal ball.

185
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And and does it have a lock, are you the only one with the key.

186
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a combination lock. Is it a thumb print

187
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.730
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I was gonna say the handprint handprint

188
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, that's cool. I

189
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.240
Locks.

190
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're getting there. See, got it.

191
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to be silly. In

192
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's do something else. You don't have was talking about this container. Sometimes it's more than just

193
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting it in this container in this vault and blocking it right with your handprint there also might be a sense of wanting to get some distance from it. Not only that, it's contained but that

194
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.820
We're getting distance

195
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna give you some examples. So right now we're going to do. We're going to develop a distancing metaphor.

196
00:20:52.710 --> 00:21:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like a container. If the metaphor it, we're not really putting something in the ground or in a, you know, we really don't have that ball but it's our imagination. It's a metaphor.

197
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So some distancing imagery that people have come up with and you play with it, you find your own. Okay.

198
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.220
Bianca Garcia: It's

199
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: A picture. Let's say they have a unpleasant memory and we're talking about it and they don't want to think about it anymore. And we're at the end of our session, you might stand on the riverbank with

200
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The lion and a moto your kids.

201
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Teresa all on the riverbank feeling really kind of like supported and all the good stuff that comes from the quality of protection and nurturing wisdom and

202
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look down a river, you kind of see this leaf and on it is maybe a negative image of yourself licious sort of

203
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Further and further away, or like you needed to go fast. So you got a rocket ship and it goes

204
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: takes off like see you. I can't wait. I don't want to drift. A nice and slow. It

205
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: On out. So for some people, there's a sense of urgency, or it could be

206
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That you see a train and passes by is in one of those train cars and then it goes down, you can see it passing away, and so you can't even see the train anymore.

207
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I think distancing, of course of let's say you and I say, oh, we brought up some things. And maybe we could put it in that train and let's watch it now and see it distance further and further away. And notice how your body feels when it gets further and further away.

208
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, and it could be the ocean and it's still vote, I mean the imagination is limitless.

209
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you when you think something that is sort of moving away from you, or it's an image that comes up. We could use

210
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.340
Bianca Garcia: A hot air balloon.

211
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna have that one. Yeah, I like it. I like it. All right, hot air balloon. Can you guys have those whole like

212
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot of New Mexico to

213
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.450
Bianca Garcia: Yes Never got on one, but went to this show. Yes. They're also

214
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Neither I haven't gone and I've never been on one alright so hot air balloon. Yeah, I could see that. So, you know, it'd be kind of slow

215
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But then, right, and then it'd be just a little dot

216
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.830
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

217
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.750
Bianca Garcia: I don't mind watching it leave like that.

218
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.280
Bianca Garcia: Right.

219
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, as long enough, leaving

220
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.000
Beautiful.

221
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's go over to kind of getting a little bit

222
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.800
More into

223
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.260
Real History

224
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get a sense of your distress level like what upsets you, from zero to 100 and I'll show you what I'm doing. I'll share my screen you can see what I'm doing. I'm over time going to be developing this

225
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Objective unit of distress. So it's kind of like a thermometer where I can see how distressed. You get what that looks like on you. I'll hear certain stories from you and I'll be plugging things in. So let me give you an example.

226
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So see how it says it could be an event and emotion somatic means body a belief also is a cognition. That's a thought so.

227
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero for some people in distress is like none. They're happy. They're fine. They're in a relaxed body. There's just no worries way up here 90 and 100

228
00:24:52.110 --> 00:25:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Are those things that have happened to them so worst feelings, they've ever had the worst year typically it's fear sometimes for some people it's a car accident or it could be an assault. It could be

229
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you name it. Right, but

230
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Often times, it's accompanied by not able to even think at that point is so distressing. You can't even think

231
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, for some people notice that the that scale goes all the way up to 100 typically up here number. I was talking to you last time about. Thank you. I think I said it the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic

232
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So that breathing activates the Vegas break with the parasympathetic nervous system that hundred I just showed you just now.

233
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the sympathetic. It's probably the emotions that you would recognize would be anger.

234
00:25:49.770 --> 00:26:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And in fear. Um, but you would probably have this this wanting to either fight or flee. Those are up there and

235
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Now do you right now. Do you have something in mind. You don't have to tell me what it is. But do you have one that's like, Oh my gosh, it's like 100 like this was

236
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.260
Bianca Garcia: Kind of, I don't know if it's 100 though.

237
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.130
Maybe

238
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe 100 would be something imagine like what if something happened to my children, that would be

239
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.570
Bianca Garcia: Yeah yeah

240
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's for most parents so that hundred now but you register something being pretty distressing. So did you feel like

241
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Fighting

242
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you feel like running or did you feel like you were wasn't

243
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.530
Bianca Garcia: I guess a little frozen.

244
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.890
Bianca Garcia: And

245
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.640
Bianca Garcia: Both have a little frozen and a little bit of leaving. Okay.

246
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So how comfortable are you because there's no other way to do this scale which goes below.

247
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That has to do with

248
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.790
Bianca Garcia: This break

249
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: We're talking about for some people they have a history.

250
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: were fighting and fleeing

251
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:12.570
Bianca Garcia: Our

252
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Option what they ended up having to do was almost like get out of their own body was so distressing and there was such a sense of health illnesses that they

253
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Passed have seized or dissociated and that's a survival mechanism that's that's innate in our bodies to try to protect itself. So that's why I also open up this below zero option. So just now. You said it's almost a combination of freezing and almost also wanting

254
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To run

255
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to, you don't have to, but are you able to tell me a little bit about that and that's we can tease it out a little bit or no.

256
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.870
Bianca Garcia: Well, if you don't mind.

257
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd love to hear it. Yeah, if you want to, because that's up to you.

258
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.430
Bianca Garcia: Know, well, yeah, I know I can. I really don't want to

259
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then.

260
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You may down the line, because we're just getting started and no reason to trust me yet but down the line, you may decide I want to witness. I want to hear myself say I want someone to know this happened.

261
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But for now, the work that we're going to do if you're, you know, have to tell me the story. All you need to do.

262
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Into your work. That's what's neat about some of the exercises will do. Okay.

263
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:32.580
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

264
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so let's turn it down. Let's bring it down to

265
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, actually, let me check in on something without even telling me what the story is. Did you notice that your body got activated. In other words, did you have a rapid heart rate. Did your stomach turn. Did you just get tight. Did you just start to clench, what did you notice in the body.

266
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.300
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I just started moving my leg faster.

267
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So something important is going on on the body's like oh he's thinking about it. And isn't it interesting. You remember what you said there was a little bit of I want to run away and look at your friends just did they got all like bouncy.

268
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.340
Bianca Garcia: That's, yeah. Wow. Now,

269
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So the body keeps the score the party members, you know, you think, how is that that's a sounds ridiculous, but oftentimes if we have an event that happens. Let's say I'm in a car accident or I'm being assaulted.

270
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's

271
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, and I don't get it completed. I don't get to protect the body and I only get this far. And then let's say the windshield comes in and it hits my face to this much.

272
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where

273
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I wanted to do was this

274
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And have run away. And so what's

275
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.730
Bianca Garcia: Interesting is there.

276
00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be an opportunity for us down the line to have complete back

277
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: To discharge, it can be done folks that have traumatic incidences in their life when they

278
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Did the regulation, the one where there's

279
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The

280
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: symptomatology, sometimes it's a little

281
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Bit more

282
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Ones that go to actually fight or run if they went to the free stuff that we're stuck and couldn't action those symptoms as a result of them. Sometimes I'll do them and they'll identify as I have post traumatic stress disorder. That's how the label.

283
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone has along the line diagnose them with that they continue to have anxiety.

284
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So sometimes that's a way for us to work through those those symptoms because still stuck in there.

285
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to 50 let's go to something that

286
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You can think straight, whatever that event was just now at that 9080 somewhere in there. Don't know what it was, but those legs were starting to move a little bit

287
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to think at an event that not that distressing much much much much lower. It's about a 50, you can still think straight. You can still reason you know you were upset and mad.

288
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can still think

289
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You have one of those in your head.

290
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:30.900
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, well, yeah, probably be like, just like arguments between us, or, you know,

291
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.160
Bianca Garcia: That's a great one.

292
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So, now notice if you're a little bit more willing to talk about that one, like, oh, my husband and I, we go through this, he has this habit of doing this and I feel really ignored and I'm in something. Oh, I'm

293
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.420
sick of it.

294
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you comfortable talking a little bit about that event like when you guys argue, what happens

295
00:31:53.340 --> 00:32:05.820
Bianca Garcia: Well, we can't really come to a solution and then the more I poke at it and be like, Okay, let's come down and talk about it more, he gets back like instead of

296
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:15.330
Bianca Garcia: You know, listening. He just wants to talk and keep going and saying the same stuff over and over. And I'm like, wait, like that's not gonna, you know,

297
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:16.170
Right.

298
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.360
Bianca Garcia: So, yeah.

299
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So even as you say, Let's calm down. Let's come to a solution, he just kind of keeps escalating right

300
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

301
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

302
00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotion that you're feeling when your efforts to try to get to a solution you're trying to solve the problem you're like, well, let's keep talking about it. Let's not yell or something.

303
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion that you have when you're sitting there in an argument with him. What, what's the emotion. What do you label that

304
00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:03.420
Bianca Garcia: Well, was, well, it starts off first, where I am, as well, yelling and then I realized I'm like wait, let me, you know, turn it down a notch.

305
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:13.650
Bianca Garcia: After I feel just overwhelmed from trying, I guess to to solve it and road I rather

306
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:26.040
Bianca Garcia: Just like just not not like angry I'm not angry anymore because I was angry, and then I get to the point where I'm called but I'm still like stressed about it or

307
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.770
Bianca Garcia: I don't know. Is that a good emotion.

308
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

309
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people can identify, they can usually find anger, most people can find that one in themselves. So you can notice you are you are angry and was it. Oh.

310
00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.520
The topic.

311
00:33:46.380 --> 00:34:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it overwhelming your core values yourself. I can't budge like this is about safety maybe or something. One of those core values that you have that this is like, I'm not budging. From here, or was it something

312
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Not quite as critical to your identity and your, your core values was the topic.

313
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You almost forgot what it was or

314
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:24.570
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, sometimes these arguments are just, you know, it's over nothing. It's just needs a little talking communicating. But yeah, I don't really remember what the topic was to be honest.

315
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're pretty common. Most people have, you know, they were reading that kind of communication skills that really would be handy to have as adults from burnout difficult

316
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: All these big emotions. Okay, so really the topic is secondary to how you're communicating

317
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:44.970
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

318
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:46.410
And you

319
00:34:48.900 --> 00:35:03.240
Bianca Garcia: Go. I know they have we can resolve it no matter what it is, it just doesn't like it has. It's that little that we can resolve it simply but for some reason we can't get there. Okay.

320
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.050
Okay.

321
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

322
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've identified that it starts. Maybe you're angry and you did sort of I yell to and all snap to realize okay, what am I doing okay let's try this differently. Let's just, you know, do you invite look calmly about it typically

323
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.460
Bianca Garcia: Am I going to say says it

324
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.260
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

325
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And then he says

326
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

327
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:46.260
Bianca Garcia: He thinks that if we just leave it alone. It's just going to go away. Nice. I know it'll come up again just about the same issue with another issue where we could resolve that issue, you know. So yeah, that's what he thinks.

328
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to

329
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: talk it through and he wants to, like, let's just drop it.

330
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.100
Yeah.

331
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.260
Bianca Garcia: You say a lot better than I do.

332
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, I love it. So I'm there. You are you having this and you register the anger, you've tried and tried and tried and now you're overwhelmed. It's like

333
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but you know you want to solve it, there's still this intent this good intention. Want to get clear so that doesn't keep up. And again, these misunderstandings happening again and again. Right.

334
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep. So just heard you were talking about that and we don't even know what the content. The content is because it's kind of irrelevant. Right. It's going to happen over something silly.

335
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice what was going on body when you're thinking about that kind of communication.

336
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.640
Bianca Garcia: No, I just, I really noticed, I guess, I don't know. Okay.

337
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you might notice if you start to tell me an actual story. This time, pay attention to what gets what gets charged sometimes as we start to tell the actual story where

338
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We're having to bring it up into our working memory. We're going to have the emotions that are connected to it. So you might start to feel just

339
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:23.520
Bianca Garcia: A little

340
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.320
Bianca Garcia: Bit of that stress.

341
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like to continue to learn like what parts of

342
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:30.990
Bianca Garcia: Kind of

343
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Old some of that. So see if you can tell, maybe a recent silly. It was over something silly like tell me a story about something that happened between new to

344
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.260
Bianca Garcia: Me.

345
00:37:50.940 --> 00:38:02.400
Bianca Garcia: I can't think of one recent anyways. These ones were past. So I can't think of what exactly happened, but we haven't had a recent fight so I don't. Okay, think of it.

346
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.520
Bianca Garcia: I'm going to start writing them down, though.

347
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you don't have to. That's okay. All right. But I'm getting a sense of things you know you haven't really had in the sense these big

348
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: 100 events to you anyway. A pie in the anger and the fear doesn't sound like it never bow, there might have been fear, but you are remembering something about some freezing experience that happened.

349
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, not something you're ready to talk about. There's an awareness. When I said dissociation are now going to be conscious right in your body. Maybe there's some awareness to

350
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm looking for is separate events, while you were using

351
00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Opiates

352
00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: They do that they get you out of your body. Right. They just do. So these events that are talking about our

353
00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.280
Bianca Garcia: We're not

354
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: impaired by a substance. So we're talking about the same thing, right, we're talking about maybe a traumatic event something either developmental trauma or a shock. Is that what you're putting in mind. Okay.

355
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.170
Yeah.

356
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I thought I just double checking on the substance use, because it's like, well, then we know

357
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We know if we go with an opiate you know

358
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll get right and so it's not uncommon for people that have those kind of events in their history and remember we're talking about heart medicalization. The mind will do it on itself, it will try to protect you from it.

359
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If an event was so significantly negative. I was just this massive flood of emotion, you can have this memory and it's really like doesn't have all these little on

360
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other networks and it's sort of sitting there all by itself. It's a little harder to get

361
00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.010
Bianca Garcia: A little hard to pull up those

362
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: May not have a timestamp on it either.

363
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.550
Bianca Garcia: Through feel like you're

364
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Living it if you were to bring it up. It also has maybe some corrupted pieces important parts of it might even be forgotten.

365
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But oftentimes in the work that people do with me is we integrate access to it by including some positive neural networks so that there's flow and it's not, you're not completely cut off to a part of you because that memory is a part of history and your relationship with it.

366
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.600
Is a pretty important one.

367
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes people have intrusive.

368
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Nightmares, they have right night terrors and or these emotions can feel like they're coming out of nowhere and they feel completely hijacked by them.

369
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And they'll describe a panic attack kind of feeling like they're coming. They're intruding

370
00:40:52.740 --> 00:41:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Intensity doesn't match someone just ran across the street. Why am I having this huge reaction, like what's what. What the what now so that's that's a pretty common experience. So there, there's an truth of some of those

371
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Those emotional experiences.

372
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.110
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

373
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So all I think for you. It sounds like I need to include

374
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the negative numbers like negative 110 negative right even going below.

375
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I

376
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: say words like associate, is that a term you've ever used before.

377
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:37.470
Bianca Garcia: Associate

378
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so C.

379
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.740
Bianca Garcia: O D associate

380
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.890
Bianca Garcia: Is that a term that I've used

381
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, is it one, you kind of have used or know what it is, because I can talk about it. If you know if I don't want these words that right. You're like, this is what are you talking about

382
00:41:55.410 --> 00:42:05.250
Bianca Garcia: Well, you just told me that it's coming out of your body or emotion or you want it. Yeah, but that's that day. I've never heard it before. I don't think okay

383
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's good for me to know right I gotta be. I got to be careful.

384
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: use words that are useful.

385
00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Useless.

386
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.600
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

387
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Include that that sort of being aware that although relaxation for some people is positive is pure and clean. It's positive for some people, relaxation, believe it or not, can be activating like I don't want to be too relaxed.

388
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.190
Bianca Garcia: Some people don't want to be too relaxed.

389
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the trauma happened.

390
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And they had associated in that trauma. Does that make sense.

391
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:49.590
Um,

392
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've got to be kind of kind of aware of that. Is it isn't always fight or flight, sometimes it's I need to escape. I don't even want to be in this

393
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Body. So for some people it's

394
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

395
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we've made some good progress here. I've got lots of preparation things here.

396
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's cover at least one area of that I can kind of make a little note of in the past when you notice that you were losing you remember, was there a theme to it all. I was scared at the time I was in a negative relationship, um,

397
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know was there.

398
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I really kind of get some of

399
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The triggers that were the reason we're using do you kind of have that knowledge.

400
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.100
Bianca Garcia: I'm like, kinda like what got me started as you

401
00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Started. Sure.

402
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:08.280
Bianca Garcia: I think about that. See, because it's been a while. But, um, I don't know, I guess it's probably the people I was hanging around with

403
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

404
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That way, we're partying. Um, but for other people that same substance that maybe you like

405
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This you'll uncover out of control.

406
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Remind me

407
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you like about your experience like

408
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:38.250
Bianca Garcia: That I had like body high and you know nobody knew I was I was normal.

409
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.060
Bianca Garcia: You know, nobody could tell like I was on anything.

410
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:56.610
Bianca Garcia: You know with with other stuff. You can tell if somebody's drunk or, you know, other substance but that you nobody can notice and you can just be a normal person. So that was one thing that I liked a lot about it.

411
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Specifically, who didn't

412
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:13.020
Bianca Garcia: Try to say oh god I'm Erin's you know spouse or whatever store is in the random people

413
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:21.660
Bianca Garcia: You can't go run your errands and you're, you know, just like nobody knew just know everybody

414
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Did the reason you were using

415
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Change and you are using, not only for a body harbor to avoid feelings.

416
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:55.710
Bianca Garcia: I believe saw it to numb whatever I was going through then

417
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what

418
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: If those same things were happening. Would you know what to do differently now.

419
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:20.910
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, definitely. The only thing I well what I know now, I didn't know then just don't do it.

420
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:31.680
Bianca Garcia: I mean, it brings more problems. Anyways, you're trying to numb your problems failings, whatever. But it all it does cause more problems.

421
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What were some of those feelings that you were numbing

422
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:59.940
Bianca Garcia: Oh I guess just everyday life in general or every day motions just any emotions, even to be happy. It was just like, that was the happiness or that was the cure to any emotion, I guess, I don't know, I just didn't really care to be happy or sad or yeah

423
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not aware of.

424
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I was angry, and I didn't want to be angry. I was scared and nervous and anxious to not aware of.

425
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of

426
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: not aware of any in particular.

427
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was a sense of I didn't care to be to have any

428
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:27.600
Bianca Garcia: Much

429
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.310
Bianca Garcia: That's what that was all about.

430
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.460
Even the good ones. Even the happy.

431
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And anything

432
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a particular relationship, sometimes they can be negative ones, and we don't want to actually leave the person or solve

433
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.320
Problems so

434
00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there anything kind of going on back then inactive use were you in a toxic relationship or anything.

435
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.790
Bianca Garcia: Well, I've been in San relationship for years.

436
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:19.920
Bianca Garcia: A decade over a decade, but no i i was the problem of being on substance. So yeah, I was, I was a toxic person.

437
00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I was okay.

438
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is the, is this the first looking at your bio psychosocial right now. Is this your first treatment with me.

439
00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:37.710
Bianca Garcia: Um, what do you mean, is this my first treatment with you, counseling.

440
00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.460

443
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

444
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, I think you you

445
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: shared a lot. You did a lot of work, a

446
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:11.940
Bianca Garcia: Lot of imagery

447
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Or what I call the sourcing part the preparation part I think we'll make some use of that in the future so nicely done.

448
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably like I get it. What are we doing for some people.

449
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: They can take if they want to just this imagery. We just did and you can add

450
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To that breathing that you're doing. Let's say your sweetheart is continuing to right to be upset about it and we're normally keep talking and keep talking, you might do it a little differently. You could use the imagery

451
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm gonna kind of have it sent away on that air balloon.

452
00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The astronomers probably a pretty heavy container.

453
00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

454
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:07.050

455
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, the don't have to some other right now I can put some time in there. What's the urgency have some time to reflect and maybe

456
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:19.230
Bianca Garcia: At the moment, we'll kind of

457
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All understanding will happen.

458
00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.390
Bianca Garcia: For

459
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For, for some people take

460
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Vacation or hair or breath work that you just learned and then incorporate some of the imagery

461
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I don't have to solve it right now. What if I just get some distance between it and see what happened.

462
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just even for the moment we give you give yourself a little break for 20 seconds or five minutes, whatever the amount of time that you might need to just sort of

463
00:50:49.020 --> 00:51:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Create a relaxed body just to sort of bring that heart rate down and bring the respiratory demand down. So if you're wondering, Well, what are some of the imagery, for it's really
