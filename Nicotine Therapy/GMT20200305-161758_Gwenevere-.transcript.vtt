00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.640
Hi.

2
00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.470
Jen: Craziness. It was so funny because it just went to my own face big and was like, You are the host now and so

3
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.730
Jen: I thought you were doing it for effect like like stream of consciousness. And I was like, okay, so I kept me and then I was like, wait, are you there.

4
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.650
Jen: Yeah. Okay, nevermind.

5
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I it's something profound

6
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.960
Is happening to this big fancy computer and I'm a little like

7
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I froze you froze and then literally my whole computer went black

8
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.560
Jen: Oh my god.

9
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm a little freaked out. So I it's rebooting but whatever. Let's just stay here. This seems like

10
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to hear me pretty well. Yeah.

11
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.170
Jen: You're great will stay here.

12
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All the times, right, you're like,

13
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like how messed up, was that

14
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

15
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know if you can bring yourself back, but I was at

16
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness of that after

17
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That

18
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Particular president is in place something shifted

19
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.120
Jen: Yeah.

20
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Missy, you re reconnected there. But something about that's happening with this play, something's there's something going on.

21
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you're having trouble naming it exactly when you're there. How do you feel physically when you're watching the intensity of this show.

22
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.850
Jen: Um, it's a pit in my stomach.

23
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.360
Jen: I'm

24
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.650
Jen: That actually well that's interesting because even beyond

25
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.880
Jen: That there's this monologue that

26
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.930
Jen: The, the woman has where she says she's talking about, um,

27
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.960
Jen: How the panel is asking her, did you say no. And she has this whole monologue where she's like, I didn't say no when

28
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:24.960
Jen: I lost my virginity exactly remain in it hurt and I didn't say no when the girls in elementary school. We're pulling my hair and trying to get me to cry, and I didn't say no when

29
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.060
Jen: She says this very particular thing when Robbie O'Neill in the eighth grade fingered me and had a hangnail and it killed

30
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.170
Jen: Because that's something that actually really happened to me. Oh, and

31
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.960
Jen: When I told the boy he got really

32
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:57.600
Jen: shamed about it and like that was where he went. It wasn't about me being like, Oh my god out like your nail.

33
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.050
Jen: It was that he like hadn't pleasured me. And so that was what he focused on

34
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.430
Jen: And so there was something about that that like brought that up that I had forgotten.

35
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.580
Jen: Because it had been so long ago. And that was even

36
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:34.080
Jen: When I was younger, before whatever I did, um, but as far as it coming up for me. Now, I don't think I've really

37
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:44.160
Jen: Totally dealt with the affairs that I had in the sex that I had and what happened there with some of those men.

38
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.190
Jen: And

39
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:59.340
Jen: I don't know if I want to, okay. I'm okay, because even the about it sounds so scary and a hard and

40
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:11.670
Jen: And also really I think art and scary because it was something that I sought out myself. And at the time I thought I really wanted, and it's hard. Looking back, and feeling really

41
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.870
Jen: frustrated and angry with myself.

42
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.770
Jen: Um, that I did want it.

43
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.380
Jen: And the I actively wanted to be treated like that and that I found that a Loring

44
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.710
Jen: This is very complicated. Would you agree. Yeah, super

45
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let let me guide a little and let's let's do time slowing just nice and slow. Number one, we don't decide or fetish. We don't decide that that comes about.

46
00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: On its own, the fact that something turns us on it just, it's just our own thing doesn't belong in shame.

47
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This is there's additional pieces that have to do with this weight loss. Yeah, I'm I'm hearing other pieces right. This gets

48
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Worrying about someone else's. Okay. And in in a in a rape.

49
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Without the

50
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Criminal part of it. It's just pure and simple right they want you. Mm hmm. Is that true

51
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:53.820
Jen: No. Okay. I think probably the part, they don't. And I don't think any of them did they wanted someone who would let them do what they wanted, and

52
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.060
Jen: Also

53
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.230
Jen: I think i think that i mean

54
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.660
Jen: For the most part, I think that they wanted a willing participant.

55
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.120
Jen: Who

56
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.340
Jen: Also could like

57
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.090
Jen: renege in the middle of she wanted to

58
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.890
Jen: Um,

59
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.890
Jen: But no, they didn't want me

60
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.230
Jen: And I think that

61
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:37.020
Jen: That was such a huge part of it for me because I never felt that kind of power. When I was younger, and I wanted it and

62
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.520
Jen: And having it felt addictive.

63
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me just check in.

64
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the skip was the missing piece is the missing piece of this puzzle.

65
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel hot I feel sexy.

66
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am pleasured I'm getting my needs met sexually

67
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that piece right there skipped. Did you get the I feel sexy and

68
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That means I have to

69
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: tolerate this version of someone coming towards me, which is really close to almost a violation, but I wasn't hearing that you are gratified and they're just now, it surprised me it I am surprised because I thought I was going to hear from you a story about

70
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You really loved it.

71
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm confused. So, see if we can

72
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: See what's in there. What am I missing. Does it sound like I'm missing.

73
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.380
Jen: No, I think that I did love it. Um,

74
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Which part the them coming toward you, the actual act.

75
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm trying to see which part felt good.

76
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.640
Jen: Ya know it all felt good. Um,

77
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had orgasms. They had orgasms. Okay. Okay, now, now the puzzle. Now it's making sense you I wasn't wearing that part. Okay, so, so here's what I'm thinking discarded if you want. But remember, it's just pointed departure. So for me if I'm watching this play.

78
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The people in the audience with me.

79
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the messages.

80
00:09:48.270 --> 00:10:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to say no rape is rape. We all know what that line is. And I'm just wondering if you bring in the audience, a well what if she actually wanted it.

81
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am just saying, I'm wondering if you're having this this weird sort of dissonance because questioning whether rape really occurred because there are times when we do want to be meaning you did, meaning

82
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Ended she are you passing doubt on your own victim you questioning her. I know that's so you go where you want with it. I'm just throwing out a little something. See what see what what comes up for you.

83
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.590
Interesting.

84
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.220
Jen: I guess I'm not sure. I guess I'm

85
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.700
Jen: The first thing that comes up in me is

86
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.800
Jen: Well, I mean, I think that that's what the whole the play. Definitely lends itself to is that

87
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.380
Jen: There probably will be people

88
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.080
Jen: Who

89
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.320
Jen: I don't think that there will be people who think that she wanted it. And I don't think that she did.

90
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.230
Jen: Top the case complicated oh my god so complicated.

91
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:52.170
Jen: But there's a really big complication with this one because the perpetrator is a big black man and and so from the beginning. I've really wanted to make sure that that part of the story doesn't get lost and how racial bias affects how we make sexual decisions.

92
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.730
Jen: That patriarchy breaks, men and women, or rather breaks, women and men.

93
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.570
Jen: As far as expectations are concerned, and I think that part of me.

94
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.450
Jen: Worries because

95
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.710
Jen: I very much come from the camp of always believe women.

96
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.320
Jen: And I think that

97
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.250
Jen: Because of the nature of the show.

98
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:29.040
Jen: I have empathy for the perpetrator in the show. Yeah.

99
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:35.280
Jen: And I think that the audience will too. And I think it's important we do. Um,

100
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:50.190
Jen: But I am having trouble reconciling that with the other part of me that is like no, fuck that rape is rape. We said we have to side with with the woman.

101
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But okay, if I'm, if I'm the male and we're playing a game and the game is this fantasy.

102
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How clear in without even that agreement is consent. It's already hard Oh, she wants it. Just push. She doesn't mean no that's already there. And then you're playing a next level game, which is this fantasy piece, but you still have the right to say no. Well,

103
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It adds, like, Well, how is he supposed to read the know

104
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When does it become right. How is he supposed to interpret what that is.

105
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.160
Jen: Indeed,

106
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And the person that when he's enjoying it. What do we think of him.

107
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.250
Right.

108
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.600
Jen: We think of him as being a typical dude, or at least I think that's where

109
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.330
Jen: I assume people go

110
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So in just pure animalistic intercourse, there's

111
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There's not that same intimacy that you were talking about with your husband. It's not the same.

112
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.140
Jen: It's not

113
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's not better. It does.

114
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Move different

115
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.350
Jen: Yeah, well, actually.

116
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.570
Jen: I think the more I talk about it, the more I feel

117
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.960
Jen: I feel guilty for not feeling more guilty.

118
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.300
Jen: Oh, and if that makes sense. Like,

119
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it doesn't, it doesn't make sense. So

120
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a partner that wasn't willing to do that in its simplest form, you went outside of it to get it.

121
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:09.810
Jen: Yeah. And ultimately, I got my Phil and at a point when I realized that it wasn't what I wanted anymore. I stopped doing it right.

122
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

123
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:30.720
Jen: But within. I'm like, I think that there were there were a couple of interactions that I look back on and I'm angry at myself for the way I responded like you know the guy who like wanted me to suck him off until he came

124
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:42.030
Jen: But didn't want to return the favor. And, you know, like gilded me by saying I was giving him blue balls. And so I did it with this assurance that we were going to have another date. And then he goes to me.

125
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.690
Jen: Or like

126
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.250
Jen: A couple of others that weren't

127
00:15:51.780 --> 00:16:00.210
Jen: Okay, but there was also like there were men that I was like, I'm not into it. Sorry, it's not there.

128
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.780
Jen: There was

129
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:18.210
Jen: One who I stopped in the middle. I was like I was really not into this and he was like, no, like, you're going to do this. We talked about this, or he was like, why or something. And I was like, because I know my work.

130
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:26.370
Jen: Ah, I remember feeling really empowered by that and his peak really non blessed um

131
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:35.760
Jen: But yeah, I think that um I think that what I'm realizing through this live stream of consciousness is that

132
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:49.140
Jen: It's never been something that my husband and I have ever been able to put to bed like it's never been something that he's ever been able to just be like, I hear that that's what

133
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:59.070
Jen: You get like gets you off, and I don't judge you for it or think that you are a product of being brainwashed.

134
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.980
Jen: By society.

135
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.750
Jen: And I think it was easier once I stopped wanting that seemed

136
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Obvious

137
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:25.680
Jen: Yeah. Um, and so I think that I think that's where some of the shame comes from is looking back on more of those and not feeling more ashamed. Yeah.

138
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.660
Jen: Because I think that when I talk about it. And when I get like

139
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:38.550
Jen: Very non judgmental reaction from you. It reminds me that I don't have to judge myself for it.

140
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.930
Jen: Right, and I don't have to assign a negative meaning to it.

141
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know if you've done any reading

142
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how we miss a step girls work at this point.

143
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Go check it out.

144
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.690
Jen: Okay.

145
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to hear what you will. What you need to hear

146
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.560
Jen: How do you, how do you spell.

147
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but she's like, What the heck is she, she's I'll just, I have

148
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Around. Yeah, right.

149
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's one of them. So it's E s th er.

150
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So she is

151
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I wish it could be her like that's how good and I don't admire people

152
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, I don't. And I hate to be insulting, but a lot of therapists are not out

153
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.090
Jen: I feel like

154
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to be glad when you get a good one. Let's put it like that. Yes, wish they went into research. I don't know if you were in school with some of those people, but

155
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, I was. Anyway, I've listened to her political views. I've listened to everything she does. There is not one second, that I am not an admiration. Well, it's so rare.

156
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: She's humble so generous she'll put out on her on her videos and her website everything she doesn't hold back as if I'm gonna, it's this thing that I'm going to sell and market. It's all yours. And she's so sharp and off she goes, she talks about this concept of

157
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Desire.

158
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And that it's the fact that she can't have it.

159
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

160
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.250
Jen: Oh, snap.

161
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

162
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.780
Jen: Exactly. You can't have it. Wow.

163
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we have a husband who loves you so much and you such a sweetheart, and you would never want to hurt you. You're like, well,

164
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.180
But

165
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right. We're not supposed to say that I know. But this woman sets you free. Yeah. Woman sets you free and. She's so beautiful to look at. She's got these great little cricket funny little teeth and just cricket little face and you're just like, I want to hear everything you know

166
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And she has this gorgeous accent. She's like, I don't, I can't remember where she's from

167
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And. She's so smart, and she's so confident and she's so socially aware culturally aware like intelligent

168
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.980
Jen: Wow.

169
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're just like, Oh really,

170
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool.

171
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's out there. Yeah, she and she um

172
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: If you go to her. Her site. She has all of these

173
00:20:46.410 --> 00:21:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: webcasts of all of these conversations that she's had with these couples and they're not your average. They're not your housewife and the man that's making the money. No, no, no. These are homosexual data does there's there's a Bisexual, Trans this and

174
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: funky little thing that you're like, Oh, wow. Interesting. And it's not it's not your Wonder Bread stuff.

175
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:14.430
Jen: That's awesome. I could use that for some of my couples clients, I bet. Yeah.

176
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's, she's very generous and super smart her writing is simple, she's not an author, author, so she takes the way she talks and it lands on the page, but so be it.

177
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, she's a good clinician and her work clearly comes from lived experience. And there's no way she could know this stuff. There's no way unless she did. I swear.

178
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:36.720
Like

179
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see how it's possible. That's just my personal. Yeah, literally. There's that one. There's the state of affairs rethinking infidelity. Um, there's another one probably somewhere in this room, or maybe it's elsewhere in another room. This one I don't have

180
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.200
Jen: She's from Belgium and it looks like she's done a TED talk.

181
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, goodness. Has she ever she's done lots and lots and lots of stuff you'll be you'll, you'll get lots of good stuff from her. One of my favorites is she's talking. She's in this room, she just dominates.

182
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:09.960
Jen: It.

183
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't even see she's just like she has no ounce of insecurity. It's such a relief to be around.

184
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They got three men like these, just like this panel thing she's just leaning in her chair and rattling off her truth, just like what, up, up, up, up, and you're like these guys are just, they're just a bunch of idiots.

185
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, they're just there. They can't believe

186
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She's telling the truth. She's naming it as if like, No kidding. And there it completely it. They have nothing to say there's nothing to say they can't believe she's saying this stuff out loud.

187
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think they're thinking like there's there's nothing they can say they're like checking their notes and you know she's just excited about all of it and just think it's invested

188
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.570
Jen: And, wow.

189
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very rare that I he like I hear something that completely changes like the way I see something and I, she's done that. That is so cool. That is so cool.

190
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: See, so right, that, that, that desire comes from this you know I can't have it and have it totally. Yeah. Interesting. So there's a lot. She's got a lot of nuggets in there that are that are worth looking at.

191
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it. Mm hmm. Yeah, I figured. Figured you you might have already known. But that you haven't is pretty cool because you're gonna go find out some interesting stuff.

192
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.780
Jen: Oh my god. Totally, yeah.

193
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right away to like I said very generous with her information. Nice. Nice. So for you, right, as you're kind of hearing yourself talk. What you landed on was seeing me not have this judging kind of reaction was useful. Yes.

194
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.090
Jen: Well, because I feel it helped me remember

195
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.030
Jen: That my feelings are my own

196
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.770
Um,

197
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.220
Jen: And, you know,

198
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:26.250
Jen: As, as long as I've been a mental, or rather, for as long as I've been a mental health therapist, I

199
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.560
Jen: I still

200
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:38.580
Jen: FIND MYSELF IN A SHAME SPIRAL sometimes based on the assumptions and the expectations of others.

201
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

202
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.600
Jen: That irritates me to no end.

203
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, if we say that our sexual development is a thing like

204
00:24:52.410 --> 00:25:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: My career. I'm family relationship and I'm a daughter, and I'm a sister, and I'm this and I'm adapt, but I'm also this sexual creature and have I evolved, have I reached my full potential. Is that underdeveloped.

205
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I just wonder if you had you had a growth spurt there that was you may be getting into your sexuality. Maybe during that period.

206
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And if the layer that you're lifting is you're supposed to feel bad about it. I mean, ultimately, I know we're in union with other people. And we're married to them, but um

207
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, individual, you know, and I hate to say that

208
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:45.720
Jen: Absolutely. Well, I'm like, I would, I would never judge a client if if they said, Exactly what I said, and I think that I'd handle it in much the way you did.

209
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:55.020
Jen: Because I think we, you know, I actually have a client who she's 63 she's never had an orgasm.

210
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:55.500
Jen: And

211
00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:10.770
Jen: just told me that in our last session. And she was like, and so I want to. She was like, I want to see what I've been missing out on. And I was like, All right, well, first of all, so do you masturbate. And she was like, oh my god. No, no, no, no.

212
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.280
He

213
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:19.110
Jen: says she's never she's 63 and she has never touched herself once

214
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a God thing.

215
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Oh boy.

216
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.460
Jen: Very, very Catholic

217
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:44.040
Jen: And yeah, she was. And so then it broke my heart because I was like, okay, so how do we move forward. And she was like, I don't know, like, I don't know how to find a man and I don't know if I want to find a man and I was like, why do we need a man

218
00:26:46.230 --> 00:27:00.360
Jen: And she was like, well, because I don't, I don't want to do it myself. And I was like, got it. But it sounds like you've been with men before but still haven't gotten there. And she was like, oh, yeah, no, that's a good point.

219
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so right if you rewind. It's like, well, if it's a sin. Maybe my wanting it at all is a sin. So we have not. Okay. So we're already past the point of being in trouble. Yeah.

220
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, uh, you know, let's let's see if we can figure out a way and and we're talking about an hour you really supposed to do that. Maybe you're sending right now. No.

221
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:36.240
Jen: Yeah, and that's what I'm saying, too, is like, is it because you really wanted, or is it because it's something of an experience like that you feel that

222
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:47.460
Jen: Other people are expecting you to anyways. It just, it reminds me that we just as a culture, we have a lot tied up in sex and it's very complicated complicated. So, yeah.

223
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:58.050
Jen: So let's talk about you. Let's see how you're doing around this will just sort of go nice and light kind of turn inward and

224
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:04.890
Let's see what comes up. See if there's new new connections new story new narrative.

225
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.040
Jen: I have a lot on my plate right now.

226
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.710
Jen: I have

227
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.810
Jen: Had some really great sexual experiences in the past that.

228
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.710
Jen: Some people would definitely judge on paper.

229
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.030
And

230
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.200
Jen: Ultimately, I think that they were really important for me to have

231
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:54.420
Jen: To feel guilty right now. I do not feel guilty right now.

232
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:05.550
Do you think that the fact that you did this development has brought as quirky as it may be more love and intimacy to your relationship with your husband.

233
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:16.890
Jen: I don't have any doubt about that. That ironic. Yeah, well, and it's in it. We actually had a really interesting conversation about it a few months ago.

234
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:39.390
Jen: Where we both talked about how though it was really hard, there is something to be said for wandering out and remembering how good. You've got it. And also, like appreciating the things in your partner that you've come to take for granted.

235
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.550
Would be nice for us. And I know remind wants to land on right and wrong.

236
00:29:48.900 --> 00:30:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It loves the organization of that. Yeah. However, life is not fashion never everywhere. It is a contradiction. It is the yang, yang business all the time. Yeah.

237
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's exciting. Though we get to be surprised.

238
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It reminds us right we get a nice little judgment. We think that's it. And then we're reminded

239
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let go again loose attachment. Check it out. How does it feel and detach again. You can't hold on to it. You know, this notion

240
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you studied any of Pema showed run

241
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: She does. Oh my gosh, that's dating myself but anyway.

242
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.220
Jen: No, I've, I've read them permission.

243
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so she talks a lot about ground listeners and that there's really just nothing

244
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To

245
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's like next level stuff that

246
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: When they, you know, I know, DDT talks about, you know, radical acceptance. Well, this is really radical. Yeah.

247
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:57.390
Well,

248
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not really mine. No, he's my husband, but he's not mine. I'm not is I

249
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's not for everyone because we do have the choice. I do decide to live. I do decide I do decide that if you can tolerate that amount of freedom. It's a burden.

250
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But

251
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It means you're, you know, kind of evolved. If you can

252
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: See those truce.

253
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:26.700
Jen: Yeah.

254
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.300
Jen: You know yeah well and I feel like um

255
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:39.510
Jen: I don't know so often in our society, especially when it comes to relationships. There are so many assumptions as far as what a relationship should be

256
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: As

257
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:50.430
Jen: Far as like I should be his. He should be mine. We should be everything for each other at all times. That just is so utterly unhealthy.

258
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna love what a stare at says

259
00:31:54.030 --> 00:32:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so glad I did. It's exactly what you just said she speaks to we were putting way too much pressure on our spouse has to be our everything or best friend are everything she says it she says ridiculous. It wasn't like that before we were more in the community. We had these

260
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Those pressures of those expectations and relationships elsewhere. Now, now it's this and they disappoint us. And then what do we do, you know, so she talks right about it. It's really she's

261
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: She I like her.

262
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.660
Jen: So she sounds rad, she said.

263
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.240
Jen: Yeah, but

264
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, if you, if you haven't done some obviously you've done a lot of self reflection and self growth, but it's not for everyone, it can be like, what do you need. That's cheating. You're bad. Okay. Well, that's, that's not for you.

265
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:52.320
Jen: Yeah. Well, it's funny. There's a sex and love podcast guide called Dan Savage, who I've listened to a lot and he has this thing where he says,

266
00:32:52.740 --> 00:33:07.020
Jen: Every healthy relationship is built on a solid foundation of lies and that sounds really terrifying to a lot of people, but I find it so comforting, because the truth is, is that

267
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:13.440
Jen: There are just things that I don't need to share with my partner because it is not helpful.

268
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:15.930
Jen: It is not

269
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Who is it serving. Exactly.

270
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:33.750
Jen: One of my clients actually said something so beautiful. The other day I had to when when my client say something really awesome. I'll write it on a post it, and it goes up on my wall and she said the truth should be used to reduce pain not increase it.

271
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh, yeah, I love that.

272
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.030
Jen: Oh my god, I was like,

273
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.660
Jen: That that's so profound. I love that. Yeah.

274
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.960
Jen: Um, I digress.

275
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:50.580
Yeah.

276
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.560
So you know you wandered around in in a

277
00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: In a space. It'll be interesting to see how you feel, how that gut feels. You know when you're

278
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Around your folks.

279
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right.

280
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.290
Jen: A lot better about it.

281
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.930
Jen: Now just feeling like I understand what I'm feeling

282
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what it was about hearing it for me.

283
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you feel what that is.

284
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.950
Jen: You know, I'm not sure. I think it's, um,

285
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.380
Jen: I've never had a therapist that I respected as much as you

286
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.170
Jen: And

287
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:57.690
Jen: Within this safe within this space that we've been able to create I feel

288
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:09.810
Jen: Like I can question things that I haven't questioned before. Um, I feel this need to be super transparent.

289
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.290
Jen: And I think that sometimes

290
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:23.160
Jen: In searching for transparency, I'm searching for the deception in myself to see if it's there and

291
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.420
Jen: Something about the way you responded and ask the questions.

292
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.230
Jen: May just got me to a place where

293
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.230
Jen: I remember that I am being transparent and that

294
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.410
Jen: It's okay to feel

295
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.740
Jen: Sad satisfied with what happened and okay with it.

296
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:48.870
Yeah.

297
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You value someone's opinion. Mm hmm. You gave that to me.

298
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

299
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:04.890
Jen: And I

300
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.100
Jen: What I really appreciate about you is that

301
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.660
Jen: I think that if it came down to opinion.

302
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:28.500
Jen: You would hold that, if that makes sense. Like, I don't feel like you would let your opinion come into our practice together, it was more about the objective

303
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.610
Jen: Non judgment within a clinical setting, I think.

304
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So wait, let's see if this is if this is a piece of it. Yeah.

305
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you say the mechanism of impact was on my putting you first.

306
00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:02.220
Jen: Yeah, well, especially the fact that you, as always, you go slow.

307
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:23.130
Jen: And you take it apart, bit by bit, making sure you understand as you go. And so that gives me the chance to reflect on what I've said and really dig and see if that is how I feel, or if that's coming up for some other reason.

308
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Part. I'm curious about is if, again, it was more about this sense

309
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: This person that I have

310
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Some respect for

311
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't make it about her. She made it about me.

312
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But my question and maybe this is a selfish curiosity is or was it that

313
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone that looks like me.

314
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm actually believes what you believe.

315
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I was curious because they're not the same.

316
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:15.180
Jen: No, you're right. And actually, yes 100% I think that there was definitely a part of me that thought.

317
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.970
Jen: That you wouldn't respond that way. Yeah.

318
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.770
Jen: Yeah. And so when you did it.

319
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.790
Jen: Made it so much simpler.

320
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, if

321
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What I get the benefit of is, I imagine that I look like I right was a cheerleader, and drove a convertible and all those things.

322
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get to show up talking about Pema I get to talk about existential dilemma. And people are like, how can that be

323
00:38:50.130 --> 00:39:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you have these squares on your side. Everything square your whole life. How can that be that you can have this, how can you, how can that those two things coexist. So I think if that's what that is. I'm excited because

324
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like I can present that

325
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: In real time.

326
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've tried it the other way. Yeah, dyed my hair cut it off, made it brown

327
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.860
Jen: Eating

328
00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah tried it to not I overdress you wouldn't know that, but I do, but that doesn't work. There's a real sense when you're a therapist, of how projection works and it has nothing to do with what I like.

329
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And

330
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, I might as well just bleached my hair.

331
00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:44.820
Jen: Totally

332
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Jacked on to me anyway. Doesn't matter.

333
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:50.880
Jen: It doesn't matter.

334
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So, all right, so I'm glad I asked that second piece.

335
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And it could be, it could be a flow of both

336
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you also mentioned this. I can't remember if you said the Pentecostal piece. I can't, I can't remember if you mentioned

337
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That maybe that's getting to be represented here maybe looking on the outside. Very linear and like it should be right, wrong but also being accepted that can parallel what you were talking about with your mom. Yeah, maybe. Maybe we got have a little bit of that too. Yeah, that space of

338
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.240
Acceptance completely maybe

339
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.930
Jen: Sit with a little bit, maybe. That sounds good.

340
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What's next for us as far as scheduling. What would you like

341
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.790
Um,

342
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.940
Jen: Would you be okay with

343
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.860
Jen: Doing three weeks.

344
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:13.080
Yeah.

345
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. And do you need anything for me as far as you know I message doctors in Slack all day long. If there's missing medication or people are running out. I just send a quick message. Do you need anything for me.

346
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.260
Jen: I'm all good. Thank you.

347
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, I look. I look forward to seeing you in group and in our individual you going get some good work today work real hard.

348
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a good day. All right. Good to see you too.
