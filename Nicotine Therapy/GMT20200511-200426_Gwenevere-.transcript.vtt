31
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: My attention. I like to tell people you know in here. It's kind of like a phone call like even their silence on a phone. You're like, Hello, is anyone there.

32
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'll feel a little awkward, sometimes in here when there's silence.

Gwenevere Abriel: But I think we both kind of will get used to it. I'm my attention right now is trying to open up a note for us so that I can kind of keep track of things.

cherrie lamparelli: No, he was we were friends. First, and he you don't know this person until you were married. But even still, it's all the friends and he still looks the same way I thought he was. But once you're with them. Once you're married. It's totally, totally different.

56
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.620
cherrie lamparelli: You know, it's not the same person.

57

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

67
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:11.970
cherrie lamparelli: I block them from every social meter. I took all all of my old my friends from that city. I took them off my Facebook. I don't even go on a post anything on my Facebook anymore and I

68
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.780
cherrie lamparelli: Watch him, his whole family any of his close friends.

69
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.860
cherrie lamparelli: I have a problem about going home and July.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, is there some required attendance some

71
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.140
cherrie lamparelli: My daughter's graduation from high school.

72
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.180
cherrie lamparelli: I really don't even want to go. That's how bad I just don't want to go back there.

73
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You think that if it's part of the disrupted. Sleep is that fear around maybe going back

74
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:54.930
cherrie lamparelli: Some of it. Also I change my medication and it's off.

75
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.360
cherrie lamparelli: So I don't know if that has anything to do with it or

76
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.530
cherrie lamparelli: Do you want to think it's all just being worried about everything just

77
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.030
cherrie lamparelli: Unable to sleep.

78
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.320
cherrie lamparelli: I don't know why I try to sleep.

79
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.340
Yeah.

80
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you mind saying a little bit more about the change in medication.

81
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.030
cherrie lamparelli: Well, they went from two strips to one and a half.

82
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:42.150
cherrie lamparelli: Pills, which she did Dr change to one strip. And last time we had the meeting. You said you'd mention it in a note or something and I haven't heard back from anybody.

83
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. So right every time I meet

84
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: With a client I message, the physician. So let's go see

85
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I tend to I say out loud, what I'm writing

86
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.760
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah. Now you said though.

87
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.450
Yeah.

88
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So just looks like sherry attended her bio psychosocial for next bright heart health session is Tuesday at 12 I don't see anything about medication.

89
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So that would be odd of me to bring up a medication.

90
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.290
cherrie lamparelli: That thought that's what you said you were going to write it in the notes.

91
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like we had a misunderstanding. I don't know where it happened, but I can see

92
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It not know I don't actually know what to do with

93
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, since I'm not a physician, I don't do the prescribing

94
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.940
cherrie lamparelli: I know, I know that you're at this point I just thought you were gonna write it in the notes. And then they see it.

95
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.370
cherrie lamparelli: And so I assume somebody would have called me or said something or whatever. I don't know.

96
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's start from scratch, because I will tell you one thing.

97
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If

98
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If what's happening right now is you and your doctor have agreed that this is let's say one and a half pills a day is what the prescribed amount is. Yeah. And you're not taking that

99
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.370
cherrie lamparelli: Taking it because it wasn't prescribed to me so

100
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for this one piece. Let me get this whole thought out, ready. So if my client isn't taking the medication as prescribed. Sometimes it's insurance pharmacy doctor

101
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Care navigators, sometimes it's the client didn't go pick it up and their subscription or there's 10 or 20 other reasons, there's a lot of variables that go on into why it's not being taken, but what I'm hearing you say is the prescription itself. When a whole half and

102
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a whole, I don't know how many milligrams around half a tablet, but

103
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.840
cherrie lamparelli: I could just tell you, you don't have to go over it. All of it with me.

104
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:10.320
cherrie lamparelli: So the doctor prescribed me a pill and I have to take with this white, little pill.

105
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:22.440
cherrie lamparelli: And I said, What the heck is this white, little pill. I've never taken these in my life, but don't watch them either. I tried it. The first day because obviously I didn't have any. So the next day.

106
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:31.830
cherrie lamparelli: I called and she said, I don't know why I wrote that. But, um, I said, I've always taken the film's so

107
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:48.390
cherrie lamparelli: She, she made sent a prescription over to my pharmacy for a strip a day. So when from a day before that she sent me a pill and a half, which is the same milligrams is once you know so

108
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:56.580
cherrie lamparelli: So she went she sent over the prescription for the films. She didn't put a half. She just did one film.

109
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like a prescription error happened.

110
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like likely. Yeah.

111
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.620
cherrie lamparelli: Nobody happen.

112
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so the confusion is

113
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you go into virtual clinic and tell a Karen Albert or my physician.

114
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.590
cherrie lamparelli: Sent I didn't because I thought you were going to put it on the

115
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:31.230
cherrie lamparelli: Notes and that somebody would have called me back. So I don't want to be calling and bugging anybody thinking that I'm seeking drugs or something.

116
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so I've got to be able to explain this.

117
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just the therapist. I'm the heart. I know, but there's a misunderstanding of God. Let me get this all out. Okay, so

118
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This is common for people when they're first starting because they can see me quicker because they have access to me the belief is

119
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say that a doctor is going to go review my note. For example, it might be in there. We could go look at it together. And I'd probably see a little something that was transcribed.

120
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't speak for what a doctor does when they're reading which because she's but she's not going to take action on something, you and I didn't hear it would take me scheduling an appointment with her.

121
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is information for everyone. This is the advocacy that I do for everyone. And it sounds like this. If something goes sideways, which it did. You can tell something went really wrong here with you with this medication.

122
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

123
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a complainer, you're not drug seeking the focusing in virtual clinic won't see you that way they know

124
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That when something happens with a client. They want you guys to show up so that you can address the issue. So I hope that gives some relief that you're welcome to go there. In fact, yes. Call in fact just log right into virtual clinic.

125
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of a cool thing that there's people there, like all the time.

126
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is pretty neat. You won't be viewed as drug seeking and i and i want to reassure you that that that's not the case.

127
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:14.520
cherrie lamparelli: Well, I figured I just talked. I just wait to see what you said today. And then so seeing that

128
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:28.500
cherrie lamparelli: I know that it's not. I understand everything you're saying, so I'll just gonna wait till tomorrow, like soccer. There's no point in bothering her today when I'm just going to be talking tomorrow. She's comes in the clinic to ask her based on right

129
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, oh yeah.

130
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.000
cherrie lamparelli: So I'm just wait till then.

131
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot of medication to be short on are you experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

132
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:56.340
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, I think that's a hard time sleeping, and I am really, really tired and I have no motivation. I think it's more of my mind to just, you know, knowing that I've gone down a whole strip and that you know in a while because I was on two steps a day.

133
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:09.360
cherrie lamparelli: And then I have them here for ice saved enough for six weeks when I'm for two when I moved out. And then I was, I couldn't find a doctor. So I was shortening them.

134
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.830
cherrie lamparelli: And so when I finally found you guys, um,

135
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:24.960
cherrie lamparelli: I told them what I took. I took two a day. And then when I talked to her. She I don't feel like she listened to me. I feel like she just kept trying to correct me.

136
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:36.720
cherrie lamparelli: Like when I was telling her, I take two a day one in the morning and one in the afternoon. And she's like, Well, you shouldn't be taking them what the doctors that were given them to you are not

137
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:48.630
cherrie lamparelli: I'm not educated on them because when you take in one, two or three strips at the most of the day, you should be taking them all at the same time. Not all at once, but within the first hour when you wake up.

138
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:58.020
cherrie lamparelli: So I don't feel like she listened to me. I feel like more she was trying to tell me something. So she I told her today. I don't know gene and heard it, but

139
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:08.430
cherrie lamparelli: So when she finally sent me the prescription. She sent me pills for so that venues wasn't listening. And then it was one and a half.

140
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:26.190
cherrie lamparelli: So then when I told her I don't take pills and then she sent me over the next day the subscription. She only 71 so I went down on Vol one, which I'm, I'm not. I'm okay with the half but because of every this whole big change in my big life. I mean,

141
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.010
cherrie lamparelli: I feel I can go through a midlife crisis.

142
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:45.720
cherrie lamparelli: My I have so much going on. So I just want to make sure that I'm not feeling this anxiety anymore. So I know it's more my mind. So I don't mind going down a half right not to start off, I can do that.

143
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.860
Yeah.

144
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.330
cherrie lamparelli: Sound like somebody just walked in.

145
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at what you originally identified as schools you wanted to work on and just to since this is

146
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.470
cherrie lamparelli: The to get off of these

147
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.320
cherrie lamparelli: But as I said, though not right now.

148
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, you said you're taking Adderall. Right.

149
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:32.970
Yes.

150
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So with telemedicine. There are a lot of instances where you and I will accidentally speak over each other, but we just kind of gotta go slow.

151
00:17:51.090 --> 00:18:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me start over. I want to say I want to look at your goals we develop them, we first met, let's refine them if they need kind of tweaking kind of shifting

152
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: refine them maybe make some something maybe you're like, oh, that I said that. But that isn't really kind of what I want to do. So I'm going to just share with you.

153
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When we first met, what you identified was first one I want to eventually get off of buprenorphine. Okay, so that was still feels spot on for you.

154
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Beautiful. And then the second one was, I want a healthy relationship.

155
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you eventually

156
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, eventually. Um, and so, but those are big ones, notice that they're both he eventually. So those are big, broad stroke goals.

157
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you and I today could find some that are more about the next 30 days for the next week that feel like they are a step in the direction towards these bigger goals.

158
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about what's difficult for you. I heard about the medication and

159
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that once that gets resolved, you're going to feel better.

160
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So aside from the medication which I just don't have that piece, but the behavioral part. What's something you could do, let's say more of or less of, let's say, over this coming week a goal that you want to see.

161
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.000
cherrie lamparelli: No sleep better

162
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:31.980
cherrie lamparelli: I don't know. I really don't have anything in my life that I need to work on me right now because things are things are good. That's why I made this change to move on here.

163
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was a huge benefit getting away from your X was just that you notice immediately a huge change.

164
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.460
cherrie lamparelli: Oh, gosh. Oh.

165
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.210
Yeah.

166
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:57.330
cherrie lamparelli: I have no I've done it a few times I've left I've moved. I moved out here. Once a few years back, but I went back after three months because I wasn't ready, but this time I say I know I'm gone. I know I'm done.

167
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.710
cherrie lamparelli: I don't even have a thought to even think of them.

168
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.120
cherrie lamparelli: Is the dog moving around him. Like I feel like somebody gives walking in.

169
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you let's just start kind of right around relationship for just a moment.

170
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't, you know, we want to get you stable on the buprenorphine first and that sounds like hasn't quite happened yet.

171
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, aside from the, the obvious this abuse that was going on with your husband.

172
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that came before that some of the things you mentioned in your initial assessment were

173
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Around feelings of anger.

174
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had identified having symptoms of ADHD. Where does that play in your day to day life, where does anger show up when you don't want it, or where does in attention show up where you don't want it, let's say,

175
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.520
cherrie lamparelli: Not really much and here life's been pretty normal, boring.

176
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:24.360
cherrie lamparelli: Which is fine, not boring because I'm busy, but I don't talk to anybody except for my sisters or my daughters are my son, but I'm usually busy working and by the time I'm done, I'm so exhausted. I'm two guys even take a shower.

177
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:41.970
cherrie lamparelli: So I really don't have any anger non like I talked to my sisters two or three times a day, and I've never said I love you more in a day than I hadn't like a whole year, because every time I sisters hang up the phone, they always do.

178
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.270
cherrie lamparelli: Well they she doesn't everybody. Well, all of us sisters and all our kids.

179
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.110
cherrie lamparelli: So not just friends or clients or anything.

180
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is

181
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Dawn.

182
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

183
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, what a change to be around violence and now around this affection and tenderness.

184
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:19.410
cherrie lamparelli: And I got to see it on my my niece came over yesterday for Mother's Day my system is working that her daughter, my niece, who has cancer came over yesterday to bring the mother figure

185
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:30.990
cherrie lamparelli: To me, I made my daughter one because my grandkids made my daughter one my sister's my I made all my family who are mothers.

186
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.850
cherrie lamparelli: Gifts and made them yesterday.

187
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But you make

188
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.280
cherrie lamparelli: Me shirts and totes with iron on pictures.

189
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:45.180
cherrie lamparelli: Like all of us, and I made my oldest assertion and I said the matriarch

190
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.520
cherrie lamparelli: Of all of us.

191
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.440
cherrie lamparelli: And that was my first time doing it you know the words all came out backwards.

192
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.150
cherrie lamparelli: So,

193
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:08.010
cherrie lamparelli: My for my sister and my niece, who have the babies web kids like small ones. I mean little capes I put pictures of the mother mom my niece and the baby.

194
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.680
cherrie lamparelli: And my sister and her son, and then I put

195
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.420
cherrie lamparelli: My mommy is my superhero

196
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.010
cherrie lamparelli: He loves it.

197
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's

198
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:23.220
cherrie lamparelli: That's really sweet. So it's been really, it's been rewarding living up moving out here. It definitely was for the positive

199
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.190
cherrie lamparelli: So,

200
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And

201
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is part of the disrupted sleep, you said you were worrying.

202
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Is there a frequent thought that comes through over and over and over.

203
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:50.640
cherrie lamparelli: I don't want to go home in July and hopper. How would I tell my daughter. I'm not going to go to a graduation.

204
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.140
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, so I can't

205
00:23:52.350 --> 00:24:02.220
cherrie lamparelli: That's my daughter, my mother never came to mind. So I don't want to be like my mother. So I put my my feelings aside to be my daughter.

206
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, is your safety or your daughter safety. No.

207
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's really an artist that the yuck, of being

208
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All yeah

209
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you, I got you. Okay. Alright, so we've got we've got until July, which gives me some a little bit of time, actually, if it turns out. So a couple of things. This is not your normal moment of graduation like people's graduations have been canceled because of what's going on so

210
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.140
cherrie lamparelli: I so I read

211
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:46.260
cherrie lamparelli: Her her graduation was sooner but they've made it for like her problem was cancelled. I spent over $1,000 on this prom dress and the shoes that jewelry.

212
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.450
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, they were making the mom and the graduation from high school on the same weekend in

213
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:57.600
cherrie lamparelli: July. By July 17 18th and 19th at night 1920 I forget, but

214
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:09.240
cherrie lamparelli: That's it. You know that if obviously if Nothing's gotten worse. Hopefully, it hasn't been Massachusetts is pretty bad.

215
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.280
cherrie lamparelli: So,

216
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, yeah, there's a lot of pieces to this because it has historical meaning for you and sentimentality like your mom wasn't there for years. You are positive, you're going to be there for your daughter not not repeat that pattern.

217
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It means a lot to you.

218
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That you'd be there.

219
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. Yeah, and

220
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're thinking, it'll actually happen. You're pretty confident, since it was already rescheduled

221
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:37.710
Yeah.

222
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.690
cherrie lamparelli: There was a letter with it. That said, for any rain days it will be held the weekend after

223
00:25:51.390 --> 00:26:03.090
cherrie lamparelli: But nobody even knows that, you know, it probably a guarantee that after this covert right now as there's going to be a second a second spread of it.

224
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:12.630
cherrie lamparelli: My sister, the one who's a nurse practitioner thinks that it's going to be around October know September, October when it hits again.

225
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of going because your. Would you drive. Would you fly.

226
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just curious why you would fly. Okay.

227
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you already have tickets. No. Okay. Is that part of the thinking like, that's also part of the worry is when you were not know. Okay, I cannot about. Okay.

228
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:46.170
cherrie lamparelli: No more about where am I going to stay in and who's going to pick me up and nobody is going to know

229
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:47.970
cherrie lamparelli: That

230
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:57.060
cherrie lamparelli: But I think my biggest worry is is my x will know that she's going to be grad, you know, at some point, I'm going to go there to see a graduation, so

231
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:11.370
cherrie lamparelli: It'd be finds out when for high school because it's not like he's going around asking, but I'm sure you know his friends have kids or whatever. And then they hear, Oh yeah, my kids graduation. This day he's going to know he he will know that I'm not

232
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.140
cherrie lamparelli: So that's what I'm scared of, I think, yeah.

233
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your fear is that he might unexpectedly show up.

234
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the big one. That's the big fear.

235
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.090
cherrie lamparelli: Well, yeah.

236
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Was he ever abusive in public. Was he just had no problems doing it in public as well.

237
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.650
cherrie lamparelli: No, no problem.

238
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No problem.

239
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.650
cherrie lamparelli: In front of his friends or people who knew him.

240
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah, right, because he wants to preserve the image that He's the hero and

241
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a narcissist. Yeah.

242
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.440
cherrie lamparelli: And I'm not joking. I believe people just you know say their, you know, their exes are nurses, but

243
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.690
cherrie lamparelli: He, he is

244
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe you. I believe you. So probably was this sort of predictable pattern of he was fantastic. And he was so romantic. And he was just this perfect like man, and then once married

245
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.390
Was

246
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Once that changed.

247
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.240
It.

248
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.430
cherrie lamparelli: Changed exactly seven days after we got married. He didn't come home for a week.

249
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:42.090
cherrie lamparelli: And then accuse me of being with somebody, while he was gone. I was like, thrown back about it because I've never experienced anything in my life like that.

250
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.160
cherrie lamparelli: Why I stayed. I don't know if somebody even called me a bad name. I'd rather I'd say, See ya.

251
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.740
cherrie lamparelli: I think was because I married them.

252
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:52.170
cherrie lamparelli: So,

253
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.570
cherrie lamparelli: I don't know.

254
00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And marriage in your family is does that, how does like a powerful meaning.

255
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:08.400
cherrie lamparelli: Well, no, that's the problem. It has no meaning. So that's why I was trying to make it something

256
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. So, much like the graduation, like you want

257
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You want these seminal events to mean something. These traditions, these, these Mark points in our lives and

258
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, and here you are faced with

259
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Immediately having to consider that this isn't, this isn't what you thought it was no

260
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.170
cherrie lamparelli: My mother was married three times. So I was thought she's pretty shitty for it.

261
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And did your ex ever get taken into custody for his, his abusive behavior was he pulled into jail.

262
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:58.950
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, few times, not for me. But with his other X axis.

263
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:00.540
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah.

264
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:15.180
cherrie lamparelli: I never would call the cops on him as much as he's gotten in my face. And, you know, done some pretty horrible things and broken everything in the house. I just walked. I learned to walk away so de escalate it

265
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:22.230
cherrie lamparelli: That's where, that's where I started going down hill is when I just stopped fighting back.

266
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of your past and yet the fear is still there and it's in your way of doing the thing that means so much to you, which is going to this graduation.

267
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.570
Mm hmm.

268
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you open to I'm kind of exploring some different techniques that might help with that.

269
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:56.190
cherrie lamparelli: Oh no. Well, a lot of it is my daughter's lies me. So that's the big thing.

270
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what that means.

271
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.840
cherrie lamparelli: Because I she lies to me about talking to him and talking to my mother.

272
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that part of what's keeping you awake is also wondering, what can I rely on as fact. I don't know what the truth is like part of it.

273
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.510
cherrie lamparelli: As the biggest part I think

274
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:34.230
cherrie lamparelli: I had found out that she had called him. And so I called her out on it. And she's like, How did you know

275
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.360
cherrie lamparelli: DOESN'T MATTER HOW I KNOW WHY ARE YOU CALLING THEM. She goes, Well, I didn't have a problem with them.

276
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.140
cherrie lamparelli: Wow. So, okay.

277
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:56.340
cherrie lamparelli: So I tended to step back and kept myself busy. When I go out when I get up in the morning I leave my phone in my room. I know I don't tend to use it anymore.

278
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your daughter gets it lying also about her relationship with your mother to

279
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:08.520
cherrie lamparelli: Get it.

280
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Set. Okay.

281
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:23.070
cherrie lamparelli: Well, last time I was here visiting my sister and she wanted to go to sell them for Halloween. And I said, as Chad, which is a

282
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:30.360
cherrie lamparelli: Is my one of my best friends, and he's known her since she was in my belly, I guess. And, um,

283
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:43.350
cherrie lamparelli: So she said, I did. And then I haven't. I did. I was with my sister here. I was here for a week and then I was telling my sister that you know so we kept pestering me she kept calling me was here just for a week.

284
00:32:44.190 --> 00:33:02.910
cherrie lamparelli: But want to sound and I finally said, What do you want me to do. I'm out here in Albuquerque, you know, figure it out. If not, don't go stop stop doing that. I was so mad at her. So, um, and the intention, the whole thing with my mother was she went to court with my daughter's father

285
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

286
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.890
cherrie lamparelli: So what mother does that I've never even done anything to her and so

287
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:18.090
cherrie lamparelli: My mother has no morals, whatever. So anyway, so I took a picture of it and I showed Zoe.

288
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:27.420
cherrie lamparelli: And Zoe's like I can't believe she would do that even know mothers should do that even if she didn't like it wouldn't go, you know, whatever, blah, blah, blah. But I've never even done anything to her.

289
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:34.050
cherrie lamparelli: I didn't even swear on them in my whole life. I've never done of course I've done teenage things where I live with her.

290
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:41.910
cherrie lamparelli: Then, you know, yeah, we have some disagreements. I haven't always made the best choice was obviously talking to. So it's

291
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:55.290
cherrie lamparelli: So she chose to turn against me rather than be a mother. So it doesn't matter. None of us only one of my sisters talks to her and if she takes pity on. I think that's why she talks to her and so

292
00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:10.710
cherrie lamparelli: So, Zoe when. So anyway, back to sorry my sister. I was telling her that she's like what he's talking about. So we posted pictures of her and we call my mother, Pam. We don't call her mom. Okay.

293
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:21.780
cherrie lamparelli: So she's like, so we went with Pam to sell them. I said what I said I why happened. I'm sorry my computer just popped up with some pop up thing. Sorry.

294
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.630
cherrie lamparelli: And so on.

295
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:38.790
cherrie lamparelli: She goes, she posted on Facebook, Pam did some really so when I called my daughter, she's like I said, you go to sound. She's like, Yeah, so, but she wasn't a couple friends. So really, uh huh.

296
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.930
cherrie lamparelli: So she likes me about it.

297
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.080
cherrie lamparelli: I said,

298
00:34:46.380 --> 00:35:00.120
cherrie lamparelli: She got it. She said, I don't want to yell at me as if you don't want me to do. You don't do things behind my back. Don't. Don't lie to me, but just don't do the things that I asked you not to do. And one of them was not talking. She's like, well, I need rides.

299
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.940
cherrie lamparelli: So as you're going to use her or you just gonna lie to me which one. Which way do you want to go up, you know, so

300
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:18.390
cherrie lamparelli: I chose not to fight that battle said find you want to talk to me. Talk to her, but when she heard you do not come crying to me.

301
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.220
cherrie lamparelli: Well, of course you can come to Christ.

302
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:24.780
cherrie lamparelli: Is

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.130
cherrie lamparelli: This you know

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I get your

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:32.190
cherrie lamparelli: Way I told you the shoes like this, but you want to learn on your own. Fine. I was just trying to protect you.

306
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.140

Gwenevere Abriel: No, these are, these are the stories. I want to hear. I didn't. I couldn't do that before I couldn't write a time to hear them. So I understand.

310
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What it was like being you growing up what it was like to be with a mom. The way you're describing a mom.

311
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:07.110
cherrie lamparelli: She's very cool. How did she is very much on my parents president is she is all about. If you don't make enough money, then she wants nothing to do with you.

312
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stick

313
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.810
cherrie lamparelli: Yes, my daughter's father we bought a house.

314
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.800
cherrie lamparelli: But a mile from my mother's house and

315
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:32.310
cherrie lamparelli: He makes at least six figures in here. So she's all lovey W with them. But my mother, like I gave her mother's day ever. And for Christmas one year not most daring, but a mother's ringing or with other zones.

316
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.360
cherrie lamparelli: Yes, like

317
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.630
cherrie lamparelli: Oh, thank you. And then put it aside, you know,

318
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:47.040
cherrie lamparelli: Oh yeah. Then try it on. Did he take it out of the box that. Thank you. I spent a good 400 something dollars on it and I had two kids, you know,

319
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That hurts.

320
00:36:50.040 --> 00:37:11.460
cherrie lamparelli: And to get that that time I mean I had three now but um yeah she's just she's very materialistic and very snotty. The problem is, is, you know, that's her. She's a hypochondriac. So like when my niece was diagnosed with cancer. My, my sister decided to call her to tell her, and my mother says

321
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:13.980
cherrie lamparelli: No, it's

322
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:29.010
cherrie lamparelli: WHEN JOHN WHEN JOHN calls my lesson I suppose you're calling to tell me diamond has cancer. And my sense is like, yeah, why would you say like that. She goes, well, you don't even call it asked me about how I'm feeling. I have some problems going on right now.

323
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:38.250
cherrie lamparelli: Whoa, that's how my mother is when I was in high school, she put me in a foster home while she signs a chin report.

324
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:49.080
cherrie lamparelli: And then the chins put me in a foster a group like a foster home with that. Just a couple and I lived there and then during poet to go to the court with

325
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:57.900
cherrie lamparelli: The foster mother to the courthouse whatever my mother showed up and was talking to the fast lane name is Pat

326
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:09.960
cherrie lamparelli: And Pat and I guess, Pam told path that she's like, I gotta some lumps on my breast. They might be breast cancer. So I just don't want to tell sherry before, so we don't make her upset.

327
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:25.080
cherrie lamparelli: And so this is what she had told Pat. So I was going to the bathroom and Pam gone down the stairs and goes, Can you just start to behave now because I might have breast cancer. Pat virtus she has two seconds ago. You just pulled me aside and said, let's not tell her.

328
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.000
cherrie lamparelli: She goes, What kind of, what are you, what are you doing to your child who washes off.

329
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.960
cherrie lamparelli: So I never forget that. But, um, so I was emancipated

330
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: At 16

331
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.020
Yep.

332
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.050
cherrie lamparelli: I'll be real. This isn't, then I got pregnant. So I'm a bad mother.

333
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh geez.

334
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This

335
00:38:53.130 --> 00:39:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is hard. That's a lot. I mean, even as a little girl was there ever a time when your mom really saw you.

336
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.560
Know,

337
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

338
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.190
cherrie lamparelli: Never

339
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.330
cherrie lamparelli: Even you know she's never even met my grandchildren.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:17.490
cherrie lamparelli: So my mother wrote this on the GoFundMe page never wants to she didn't put any money in there, but she had wrote that. So my sister Dawn's that I'm done.

348
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:28.140
cherrie lamparelli: Blocker and my mother had told my sister, the illnesses that talks to her that she was going to come out here and she asked my daughter to come out here with it because that was the one excuse that

349
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:37.080
cherrie lamparelli: Everybody loves my daughter and they my mother was going to kind of use my daughter out here so that nobody would be mean to her because my daughter would be other

350
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:51.240

351
00:40:51.870 --> 00:41:02.280

352
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:09.570
cherrie lamparelli: You know she has cancer and all of us have been here all all along. Anyways, because I've always wanted back and forth on here.

353
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:18.810
cherrie lamparelli: So why are you going to come out here. Now you have needed never met your grandson, you weren't there when she had the miscarriages with the prince and then

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:30.330
cherrie lamparelli: Everybody else you know all that you've never been on here. Why are you going to come out here now. So I guess I'm Mother's Day. She was crying to my little sisters and I don't understand why nobody taught me.

355
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.560
cherrie lamparelli: She

356
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.150
cherrie lamparelli: She doesn't even acknowledge me

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.180
cherrie lamparelli: She put on Facebook.

358
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:42.450
cherrie lamparelli: I just, you know, I love my my three girls and they're working really hard out there.

359
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

360
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:51.000
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, but it used to be used to bother me doesn't bother me anymore.

361
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:53.340
Yeah.

362
00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that wounding that happens when you're little like that. Just over and over what we would call sort of developmental trauma when

363
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: She is truly narcissistic now I

364
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.350
cherrie lamparelli: Sort my house was in the hospital dying.

365
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.110
cherrie lamparelli: My first house. Yeah. After my best friend just passed away.

366
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She's, she's a special one and change.

367
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:20.430
cherrie lamparelli: Some of you have no idea.

368
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:31.710
cherrie lamparelli: I ran away when I was little, because she beat me with the belt with the leather belt and I had like 12 bruises on me and they were up and down my arm from blogging. So I like to the police station.

369
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:51.000
cherrie lamparelli: Go tell to go tell them. And so my mother goes into the police station, saying, I'm just worried about her because she doesn't come home at night, I was raped at that age, and I may have cancer. So I'm just looking out for her. So was it to be on the show is bullshit. She was good.

370
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.200
Wow.

371
00:42:54.210 --> 00:43:01.050
cherrie lamparelli: None of us want to turn out like her. So if, if any one of us want to make a joke will say, Hey, you look like him.

372
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:05.280
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah.

373
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the ultimate insult.

374
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.520
cherrie lamparelli: Yep. Yes.

375
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.610
cherrie lamparelli: It is thank you that I didn't know how to say that. Yeah.

376
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

377
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.790
cherrie lamparelli: I'm the only one. It doesn't look like

378
00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know, seeing, seeing your daughter.

379
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: stay in contact with your mom staying in contact with her father.

380
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you want to protect your daughter from pain and suffering.

381
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.630
Mm hmm.

382
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.970
cherrie lamparelli: I have been from her father because of fathers and hassle. He's just like my mother.

383
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:51.870
cherrie lamparelli: Oh yeah, he is just like he kicked her out. So now mind you, I'm leaving out here and my god is living with him. He can she calls me at

384
00:43:52.620 --> 00:44:06.840
cherrie lamparelli: One o'clock, my time. So it's three o'clock hearse. I'm saying a father kicked her out. She had never been walking outside the streets by herself. Because your night kicks around three o'clock in the morning. She's walking down the streets to her boyfriend's house.

385
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:18.270
cherrie lamparelli: And I, if I was there, but I would have picked her up, obviously. So I felt a little guilt on that part because call me crime but you know

386
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:31.170
cherrie lamparelli: She's got to learn to to be she's got a little less mature than I'd like her to be so you know if she's learning something, but I'm here for her. She called me 24 seven

387
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

388
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.850
cherrie lamparelli: We video chat.

389
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And you guys use zoom to

390
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.380
cherrie lamparelli: Know we just use

391
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.720
cherrie lamparelli: Facebook Messenger.

392
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's another really common one.

393
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.400
cherrie lamparelli: We do group messages to we all have a Facebook portal.

394
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:48.120
cherrie lamparelli: Uh huh.

395
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody gets together.

396
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.660
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah yeah

397
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.270
cherrie lamparelli: So my son's out there. So if anything were to happen, my son's out there.

398
00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how old your son is

399
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.540
29

400
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.590
cherrie lamparelli: He just, I just talked to him this morning.

401
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:06.210
cherrie lamparelli: So,

402
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:18.120
cherrie lamparelli: He lives three hours from he was two hours for her three hours from the airport. So, I mean, I don't really want to ask them to come pick me up six hour round trip.

403
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.570
cherrie lamparelli: But I miss my granddaughter to I want to see her.

404
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:22.200
Yeah.

405
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:28.080
cherrie lamparelli: So, I mean, that's the benefit about God's I'm trying to find some positive about God.

406
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.930
cherrie lamparelli: So what have you can't pick me up.

407
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.430
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah.

408
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a little bit of option. Maybe then there might be some safety protocol that you could use. Would you ever use something like Lyft to get you from one, would you ever pay pay for something like that.

409
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.830
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, but it's a three hour ride.

410
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoo. That's pricey.

411
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.870
cherrie lamparelli: Yeah, that would be that would be quite the price.

412
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'm thinking about a bus with that work.

413
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:07.620
cherrie lamparelli: From Logan, logan doesn't have any buses that goes, I do, is it doesn't. And my at the parking lots, but

414
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:14.970
cherrie lamparelli: Try to figure out where to go I don't think any buses go where my son lives. My son was up mean we I mean

415
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.180
cherrie lamparelli: It was in Sweden mean

416
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a combination of public transportation and he makes this last half hour trip to get you

417
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.560
cherrie lamparelli: You, you would definitely pick me up. I could also take a train. Yeah.

418
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think the biggest piece is this fear.

419
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.390
cherrie lamparelli: Of your ex is a high school and seeing my husband.

420
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.020
Yeah.

421
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you're open to it right now where you know you're starting to get to know me and kind of work on on kind of working on that rapport and trust thing.

422
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But most people they they start to feel good in here and comfortable and realize they can say whatever. And I'm not going to judge

423
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you start to feel safe enough in here. I, I could work with you around maybe doing some em Dr or round could be is the high school could be around a memory with ex husband as little or as much as you want. Do you know anything about em, Dr.

424
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.250
cherrie lamparelli: No. No idea means

425
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Already talked to you about a little bit. Okay, so I am Dr. Is the Go To sort of

426
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Evidence based treatment for

427
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: PTSD. So Vietnam vets, let's say, or vets have really any war when they come back, and they're they're having post traumatic stress symptoms. This is one of the go to treatments for it.

428
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

429
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And and if you've never heard anything about it. It can seem kind of kooky I'm

430
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:53.970
Sorry.

431
00:47:55.290 --> 00:48:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And years ago. And people still do it. There's an exposure therapy where you can picture that let's say you were afraid of spiders.

432
00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:05.190
cherrie lamparelli: I am

433
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so exposure therapy, the philosophy between for exposure therapy is, you would say, all right, let's imagine that this spider is across the room or down the street and we would start there and you we would work on you getting more and more

434
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: desensitized. That would be the way we used to do PTSD treatment is exposure therapy, you would sit with it for hours. I don't do that.

435
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What I do, because it really traumatizes I think when we are around the trauma, again, to me it doesn't desensitize it, it ends up very traumatizing individual. So what I've come to learn is using

436
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: A bilateral stimulation and I can get into the philosophy behind it another day. But just to introduce you to it. If you want to do a little investigation on your own, is I movement reprocessing and desensitization.

437
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So, em, Dr.

438
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can go look it up and kind of check it out and then maybe when we come back I can kind of go over a little bit more about it. It's eight there's eight phases to it. So it's not like one day, all of a sudden, we're going to be doing bilateral stimulation

439
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get too caught up when you read about it that it has to be a movement. It does not have to be a movement. For example, if you were here in my office, you would have to buzzers in your hand.

440
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd have one in your left and your right. You might also have headphones that we're making a sound and the left and the right ear. So don't get too caught up, they should eventually change the name from my movement because it isn't. It's bilateral stimulation

441
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But it has a great outcome which means we're normally the relationship with even like seeing the high school, for example, might bring up a rapid heart rate short breathing, maybe even nasza

442
00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like sweating like like I don't even want to think about it.

443
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Over time this desensitisation can have the effect of oh where, maybe I was feeling like 100 in distress or an 80 or 90 now I'm like at 30 and now at 10

444
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know what, I think I could do this. I could handle a 10 of distress. That's like sitting for a test or something I could do this.

445
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it does have a really positive impact is actually exposure therapy which are not actually telling me the story. You could go this whole time if you wanted to, and not tell me

446
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an interesting thing. You just have to think about it. That's enough exposure therapy to have a positive impact, which is pretty cool.

447
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because for some people, right, telling the whole story over and over and over is is just, it's too much for a lot of people

448
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, other people. It feels so good to finally have a witness to have someone sort of

449
00:50:55.290 --> 00:51:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: compassionately hold their truth. And so for them the storytelling is an important piece. And that's fine with me. This is about really whether you want to tell the story or not, but you don't have to, for this work, which is pretty exciting.

450
00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But just kind of hold that in the back of your mind, and we can pick it up again next time I can bring it up and we can kind of

451
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.760
cherrie lamparelli: Read the signs are setting.

452
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's schedule another appointment.

453
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:22.920
