Ashley Bitakis: As well as dreams and I

11
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, so

12
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just those keep it basic. Are you saying that you're because you didn't say where you're moving and whether you want to be moving. I know you don't want to live in a Hotel, motel. I get that, but I'm asking you.

13
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to be moving right now. And because where you're going is positive. Where are you moving

14
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.260
Ashley Bitakis: So his brother. Um, I think I had told you that James just like working at the restaurant. The feeling restaurant.

15
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and there. Yeah.

16
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:46.350
Ashley Bitakis: Because of the corona. The restaurant is obsolete. So his brother, who's the manager at the restaurant moved to Vegas Vegas with his mom and his sister. So while he's out there. He doesn't have a

17
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.440
Ashley Bitakis: Tiger, I guess he'll be out there for more than a month. Okay. And he wanted us to I guess kind of house it for the time being.

18
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

19
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.840
Ashley Bitakis: We're supposed to be moving

20
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.170
Ashley Bitakis: Again, I'm not just sure more details, but we're supposed to be moving to his brother's house for the time being, until we go back

21
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is your mother in your circle right now. Why is she anywhere near you. Why is that happening.

22
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.320
Ashley Bitakis: Because we're looking at like her husband's really abusive to her. And so she came like she came

23
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.090
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, this is the third time now that she's and this is why you kind of wanted to have a private conversation because they don't and her to film.

24
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.050
Ashley Bitakis: And you type away. You know what I mean, where but she told me that they've been putting a lot and you know he's he's kind of a drunk.

25
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.700
Ashley Bitakis: So they've been doing a lot of a lot of coke and all this drinking and so she came over, like at one o'clock in the morning. Last night after being released from the hospital.

26
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.880
Ashley Bitakis: So here she isn't.

27
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.220
Even

28
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.950
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, okay.

29
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this is

30
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a short term situation.

31
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But a long

32
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Term pattern. Okay. Nothing. No big thing you do or don't do, I'm going to tell you nothing you do or don't do is going to make a difference, one way or the other. For your mother.

33
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.560
Ashley Bitakis: You know that i know i mean that I know it's you know she's been she's been who she is. And I've expected accepted her since she was

34
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.300
Ashley Bitakis: There, since I was 15 years old you know she's okay. I know, I know, I know who she is and I do know that

35
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now let's focus on you for a second because it, it can get very distracting having all of this dramatic violence substance use high anger high sadness high fear, all of those big things going on around you. But let's not forget you at the center of your recovery is you

36
00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you and I began a discussion and I want to know. Was it dropped immediately. Did you give it any further thought or do you not even remember the topic.

37
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.580
Ashley Bitakis: Know about going to an inpatient facility.

38
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So just curious where that whether it continued in a thinking stage or if it was

39
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Like where did it go from there.

40
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.660
Ashley Bitakis: Um,

41
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.060
Ashley Bitakis: You know i i know that's the right thing to do in my heart. I mean, you know, I do have, I do have a conscience in

42
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.240
Ashley Bitakis: It. And I know that's the right thing to do.

43
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.740
Ashley Bitakis: Okay.

44
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so stops there so

45
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I get it. Look it. That's the read the reason why you can't articulate the reason why you're so distressed, it speaks to the very need

46
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: As to why you need that level of care anyway. You are in a serious conflict between what you believe in.

47
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I love my children. I want a family. I want stability and the reality of your behavior in your life. It's just there in deep conflict and I get it now. I'm not judging you have any judgment. Of course, of course. You love your children.

48
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I just a wish. I wish you had enough sobriety right now to be able to see some glimmer of hope that that this chaos that you're in can come to an end.

49
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But it won't, it won't be by the next, you know, 30 days you're moving over to another house.

50
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You could make it worse. It could get worse. Now there's a drug dealers your brother's house is just as likely

51
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then damage the relationship with your brother. His brother. Hey,

52
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at the people that you're hanging with this fella could track her down and up over there. It's just a it's chaos is absolute.

53
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.720
Ashley Bitakis: It good for

54
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You that way.

55
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.490
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:00.180
Okay.

57
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.880
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah.

58
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.890
Ashley Bitakis: I'm sure. Thank you.

59
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.600
Ashley Bitakis: So,

60
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We've been here before. And we were here right as you. I remember you were sitting in a car and you weren't your normal self. You were very little animation and you were, you were on your way was the last time I saw you before you you left the state.

61
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And although you didn't say it. I will tell you we're done, we were done with us. You were going to leave and there's nothing I can do.

62
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this is your life.

63
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have some self destruction going on is that what's playing out like you let it get really bad like close to death or something and then God will come and rescue you, like how close you going to let this go

64
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.500
Ashley Bitakis: I think I mean honestly a

65
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.240
Ashley Bitakis: Little basic. This is exactly what I'm used to.

66
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:12.450
Ashley Bitakis: This has been my the highs and lows and my mom dealing with she's dealing with is absolutely what I'm used to. And

67
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.810
Ashley Bitakis: I was able to break away from that.

68
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.880
Ashley Bitakis: And

69
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.630
Ashley Bitakis: You know through creating my own family.

70
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.000
Ashley Bitakis: And having my own career.

71
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:33.630
Ashley Bitakis: You know, since that's falling apart. It's just, it's very, very, very almost natural to me to be in this situation.

72
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.160
Ashley Bitakis: And

73
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.560
Ashley Bitakis: This is, this is what I know this is this chaos is exactly

74
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.270
Ashley Bitakis: Exactly what I'm comfortable with almost

75
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.480
Ashley Bitakis: Everything in me at this time.

76
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.410
Ashley Bitakis: Is is like you said, is it's a fight. It's a fight between

77
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.800
Ashley Bitakis: What I what I know is right and

78
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.740
Ashley Bitakis: I'm not doing the right thing.

79
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do you have any memory of when you were working. Do you remember some of those times where are you sober do have some recollection of that period of your

80
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:26.160
Ashley Bitakis: Life. Oh yeah, I'm up until the last like, month I'm working, you know, Presbyterian as a phlebotomist I was sober and

81
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.490
Ashley Bitakis: I didn't fall deep into matrix and until about the last month of my employment.

82
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.760
And

83
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:51.480
Ashley Bitakis: Orthopedics and that last month is when you know I had left I left robber and Lucy evicted And then the next boyfriend came back into my life and you just go save the last month.

84
00:08:52.350 --> 00:09:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It was around the object of your affection. It was around your attachment to your with the rounds. It was around your partner.

85
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't like the idea. It's really uncomfortable for you to just hang out with you and do your thing.

86
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.690
Ashley Bitakis: With someone

87
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:17.250
Ashley Bitakis: You know I that took a long time for me to get used to the idea of being in enjoying

88
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.570
Ashley Bitakis: Being alone and for a very brief period.

89
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.130
Ashley Bitakis: I did enjoy just the time with me and my kids, but then

90
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:27.930
Ashley Bitakis: You know,

91
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:43.590
Ashley Bitakis: It's like I have all these chances are he had all these chances to really strive and do things that I currently really like to be doing. And I just fell right back into

92
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.220
Ashley Bitakis: The Chaos and it all in three drugs.

93
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.880
Ashley Bitakis: And you know, that's what I had met James and, you know, a new relationship sturdy.

94
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If instead you knew and

95
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I was

96
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: In your life at that point, I wish you

97
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.160
Ashley Bitakis: Had

98
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: The support when you were going through that.

99
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Separation so that you could spend time alone developing who you are.

100
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Today right now.

101
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We could reference more history more confidence around kind of being on your own, so that you can get to know yourself.

102
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.870
Ashley Bitakis: Because right now, I'm pretty sure

103
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's happening is you

104
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we did it last time I heard a little bit of it, you

105
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.770
Ashley Bitakis: Can possibly

106
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't stand the idea of not

107
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being with James and James might not want you if you went to rehab it's it's it

108
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in

109
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: A moment you start to have like a knee jerk reaction to

110
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't lose them.

111
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.390
Ashley Bitakis: And

112
00:10:46.860 --> 00:11:00.750
Ashley Bitakis: There's consequences to that. That's my there's consequences to warning that there's going to be repercussions. It's not, they're not going to be an easy thing it's, there's going to be repercussions.

113
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.280
Ashley Bitakis: And

114
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:25.560
Ashley Bitakis: My biggest worry is is that if that were to be made those repercussions are going to happen. I think that's going to happen. Am I going to remain sober enough to fight through it and am I going to remain confident enough in my own self to just be alone with my kids as well.

115
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.630
Ashley Bitakis: So,

116
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is the weird part, you know, you identify and know what I met you. First, your

117
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your spiritual connection was, you know, you can under the words you have a great, great, great big brain and you have a grasp on really cool vocabulary. It's not the same thing as living faith.

118
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I might not even identify with Christianity or Catholicism or Judaism or something. But I should know what faith is it's the abyss of the unknown and you jump. Anyway, that's, that's how you know you've got it.

119
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And right now it's you're doing what you know.

120
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of knowing deep inside that you're worth more that your children are worth more. It's just, you can't believe it's true that there could be goodness that there could be health

121
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That the biggest thing that people are worrying about right now is the germs coming in out of the house. Many people are worried about their finances and they're worried about maybe a little argument about why didn't you walk the dog or a dish.

122
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you looked at that girl, a little funny, that's a lot of what a lot of people are worried about your type of trauma is just surrounding this substance, the rest of us.

123
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I know we're saying the same thing. You can tolerate it. But what's missing is faith.

124
00:12:50.880 --> 00:13:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't believe it's true. How could it be true. This feels so real. At least I've got this this other thing, man. It's the unknown.

125
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I had had a little bit more time that we could reel that in and use it. My guess is you're

126
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna leave us alone.

127
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right is keeping you the focus is going to be even harder for you. You may make it another month or so, but I think, you know, leaving us again.

128
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.470
Ashley Bitakis: You know, and

129
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.930
Ashley Bitakis: Thank you for the honesty, I appreciate it. Appreciate that, appreciate you being in my face like that because I

130
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:46.350
Ashley Bitakis: Really do interested in what you just said, and nobody's ever just true faith to me that way. And I like to think that I I have faith. But when you when you describe it like that. Not at all.

131
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.730
Ashley Bitakis: Now,

132
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: When you can't see the bridge. She can't see your way over, you just put your hands up and you walk anyway.

133
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You surrender.

134
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Surrender

135
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are. You just can't believe it. You can't believe you're going to be there for you that this thing, this weird thing that this this love thing this unconditional love thing you never had it.

136
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't understand it. You may know it in a textbook, you may know it reading a little fairy tale to a child.

137
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may say, oh, I want you to love me unconditionally. But it starts from loving you that way. And then you expect it from other people. And, Dan, you show it to your children.

138
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It starts with you.

139
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish, I wish there was some way to get you out of there and not having hit, hit that point where you finally surrender.

140
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But you believe you'll just keep doing your thing, I'll, I'll, I'll be good to James and I'll, I'll be a good daughter and

141
00:14:54.630 --> 00:15:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be good today and and that'll get you what you really need a hold on to this person at least I've got that.

142
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you, what do you think of James that he

143
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: He mentioned some weeks ago, maybe you could go to a mental health facility. He said, non substance use, which is kind of odd but

144
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:33.930
Yeah.

145
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.120
Ashley Bitakis: You know,

146
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's, that's some of his own stuff.

147
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:42.810
Ashley Bitakis: Um,

148
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:43.980
Ashley Bitakis: I

149
00:15:47.550 --> 00:16:00.150
Ashley Bitakis: Mean what I I truly think that was all bullshit nothing okay guys really said fuck it matters at all from one day to another, from one hour to the next. I don't think anything's very real.

150
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

151
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.620
Ashley Bitakis: But I do know the one thing

152
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.830
Ashley Bitakis: That is very real.

153
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.400
Ashley Bitakis: That is very real to him.

154
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:18.840
Ashley Bitakis: Is that he's not gonna he will not just let me leave and they're not be these repercussions to pay

155
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:27.420
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, he does come from a family that has, you know, they have money in. So he does have a lawyer and he's

156
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.220
Ashley Bitakis: You know he's me.

157
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:36.930
Ashley Bitakis: I'm certain third city is holding through is in the past, you know, when I was living with my grandma. So when he tells me

158
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.380
Ashley Bitakis: Try to leave. I'm not going to let you if you do leave. Then there's going to be repercussions to pay

159
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:57.390
Ashley Bitakis: As a mom to my children with, you know, the threat of them in taken away from me by legal standards, I do believe him. I do, I do believe that it's very

160
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.450
Ashley Bitakis: Much a real thing.

161
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.160
Ashley Bitakis: And

162
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.500
Ashley Bitakis: Um,

163
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.480
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah.

164
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're talking about domestic violence, you're talking about someone who's using power and control over you.

165
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm glad to hear you say it because you were dancing around it this year around that calling a repercussions, but he's now that's what he says. But that is to keep you around. So

166
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you said it but you, you said it. The next step would be, I don't want your equivalent of of women in distress is out there and it's it's not true. He's going to be more worried about his

167
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting his next

168
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Myth hit

169
00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not going to be putting money he really think money into taking your kids from where he

170
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All you

171
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Do is anybody would have to drug test them and the guy is going to be positive for math.

172
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.460
Ashley Bitakis: True, and he you set it up to where

173
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:34.230
Ashley Bitakis: He's told his mom that I've stolen from her bank account. He's told his nomination for Mr which is absolutely false and I've never had. I've never had access to any any funds, whether there are funds or his mom's I've never had any access to that so

174
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.620
Ashley Bitakis: What I said was going to happen is, he would use.

175
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.380
Ashley Bitakis: This kind of setup that he's made me out to be

176
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.610
Ashley Bitakis: Mm hmm. To

177
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.610
Ashley Bitakis: You know, to tell his mom that I learned in wild trumpet or something crazy and she either going to take action.

178
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:55.950
Ashley Bitakis: You know,

179
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's his story. Your story just as likely could be the following.

180
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You stuck with it. Let's say you stuck with it last time you changed you changed your environment or you tolerate and living with him until you. Maybe you went and you got another certification some education. You got yourself a job and then slowly you started saving money.

181
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.510
You move out.

182
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were getting drugs drug screened and maybe it was through validated means these little cups aren't going to cut it. You go to a lab and then you can present that

183
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.510
Ashley Bitakis: Information

184
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.010
To her if she ever wondered

185
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could you could take her to the bank and say, I'm going to try and get money. Watch me. I'm going to show my ID you stand right here.

186
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.040
Ashley Bitakis: I'm

187
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to get money from this account. I can't because I don't have a joint account. I can't

188
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There are other stories you could spend your time thinking I get what you're saying he's scaring you but that's the intention, so

189
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your life are you thinking about the next strategy, wherever you can. Are you really kind of thinking about that.

190
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.190
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, and even before calling you. I heard before getting back into the program, I

191
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.860
Ashley Bitakis: I had been in

192
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.740
Ashley Bitakis: And they had really thought that

193
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:27.030
Ashley Bitakis: Um, he wanted the same, you know, I thought that he wanted a divorce, too. But coming. I was gone for four days and coming back to the home, which are motel.

194
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:36.210
Ashley Bitakis: And realize that, no. That's never going to happen every just, you know, signed course paper papers and

195
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.670
Ashley Bitakis: Let it be that easy.

196
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.470
Ashley Bitakis: Well, it's it's caught. It's kind of constantly in my mind actually

197
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So people that are in here it's women in distress out there.

198
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.820
I don't know.

199
00:20:51.900 --> 00:21:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Help ever tell us Rio Rancho Santa Fe crisis response of Santa Fe, they might have information. Um, I don't know what you guys call the women's crisis center out there.

200
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But typically, what they do is they they kind of in your mind. They because you don't want to write anything down, obviously.

201
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: They have you have in mind what what you can start to do as far as paperwork stashing money keys, things like that so that eventually when the time is right and you know when it is we won't be able to know that you'll be able to assess risk and then you go, you don't look back.

202
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.040
But

203
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.610
No.

204
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see how much of what we're saying is spot on with his mother because his mother has your kids right

205
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.480
Ashley Bitakis: You know,

206
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So your grandmother has has them.

207
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.750
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so, so, so, so

208
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So what can accuse you of hurting the kids can't what what it, what it missing money.

209
00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys.

210
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Drug addict. You know what's worse is credibility. I mean, know if you are getting yourself straight, you're getting yourself right and even better. You show that you went to rehab and if any ever accuses you of something

211
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in a program your program and adds to your

212
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Credibility. If anything, it

213
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.240
Ashley Bitakis: Doesn't make me look worse three

214
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Not to me. No, in fact, you know what, just struck me it just, I just got it.

215
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You went into just a mental health rehab.

216
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I've just got what his agenda could be to make you look incredible

217
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.060
Ashley Bitakis: Compared to

218
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.050
Ashley Bitakis: To have different

219
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.450
Ashley Bitakis: Because they didn't make sense to me either. So why wouldn't he be pushing for

220
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That

221
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't thought about that before. I mean, it doesn't mean it's true. It's just all the sudden like I had to turn that kind of cynical.

222
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:59.940
Ashley Bitakis: Know that that actually makes a lot of sense. That's the only thing that makes sense because I thought the same thing. I was like, why, why not want rehab.

223
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.980
Ashley Bitakis: I want this, you know,

224
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:02.940
Yeah.

225
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because. So, for example,

226
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:07.800
Ashley Bitakis: When

227
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You use the way you're talking right now. Earlier when you're you're using this phrases that are kind of skirting around and such. You may have been protecting yourself in case someone would hear you and I get that.

228
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you're honest with yourself and your direct and you don't, you need to do your very logical reasonable person, including trying to protect your kids. I get all that all understandable, but

229
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're in a in a cycle right now that you may not be able to see the way out, and I don't want you to get hurt. I don't want you to get so dead that you can't come back from this decision they need a mom.

230
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:58.560
Ashley Bitakis: And I need them like I haven't even told me you know people. But, you know, like with my ex. And then, you know, G was me. My mom like everyone's telling me like I'm crazy like

231
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.180
Ashley Bitakis: You know,

232
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:07.740
Ashley Bitakis: Increasing crazy or I'm out of control, or I'm not this logical person that I. It's hard. It's hard to see that.

233
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:10.440
Ashley Bitakis: Everyone around me.

234
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.780
Ashley Bitakis: Telling me. I'm so and logical

235
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know. I don't know what you're doing now. I'm assuming what you're doing and how you're doing a line of this align to that and you're doing coke and you're doing some math, you're

236
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing opiates.

237
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I can understand all of that.

238
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes sense to me. What I don't know behind the scenes. If you're the one running the game I have that I'm trusting you I'm trusting that what you're doing with me right now is genuine and honest, I have to believe that

239
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece here is you having faith that everything's going to be okay. You just don't know how that's faith. I know it will be okay. I don't know how. And that's the rub.

240
00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to know before it's happening. None of us feel it's just one little step after the other. It's next right thing it's right thing will happen. And that might seem like why does she keep saying that.

241
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's all there is to do. You don't know neither of us know, you could have this great plan.

242
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And five different things could go sideways. Those are not things that we can control all you can control is the next right thing

243
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You went ahead and you took the call maybe from Braveheart health you showed up here. I love it. I love that you did that, but that's the sum total of all this is what would be the next right thing

244
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I could look up a couple of places did you

245
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, bring, could you kind of pull that insurance card out. Can you memorize the number

246
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.760
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah.

247
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There's little tricks that you

248
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Can start to do and it's all all possible one and you

249
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:57.150
Ashley Bitakis: Know, can I can get that for you really quickly. Sure.

Ashley Bitakis: Sorry. Um, do you want me to take off my video.

251
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever works for you.

252
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.130
Ashley Bitakis: I don't know God only knows what's happening inside so I better give me one second.

253
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.020

Gwenevere Abriel: I tried to talk with someone and

341
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: In the referral services and they were making me wait too long so I

342
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:38.730
Pulled up

343
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Not answering so

344
00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:42.960

Gwenevere Abriel: With Dr Arielle and she

346
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Mentioned this place for counseling, but it's only

347
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Counseling. I don't think we're close to what we're looking for.

348
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking, the only place that I know is in

349
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This is so tricky, right now, because the demand is so high.

350
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of all the crisis that's going on right people could be abusing the system and really using it as a mainstay so there's there's a lot of challenges right now.

351
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's a place called hoy recovery in Espanola I know that's not close by, but

352
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's delayed in New Mexico. There's a place mental health resources.

353
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In for tell us we can check them out.

354
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a place in Rio Rancho called family violence prevention.

355
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know I can't tell you the number

356
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.670
One, if there's a catchy phrase for it.

357
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.540
Yeah.

358
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I think what might work is you and I schedule another time when your phone is charged

359
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to be moving you're immediately safe as long as you're compliant, you're going to be safe right you behave the way he wants you to

360
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You get your tough it out. Okay. So if that's the case, if it's not obviously know the police, fire rainbows emergency department. But if if you want. If you decide to stay until it's the same time to leave.

361
00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The United. Okay.

362
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you and I will schedule another time. And I can be calling these places like the family violence prevention team and see if they have some resources because it sounds like what you're going to need is

363
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly a shelter, whether it's a night or two nights just to get you to get you somewhere else.

364
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:52.830
moto e5 cruise: So,

365
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll your mind and get clear on what a plan is. So why don't we schedule another time.
