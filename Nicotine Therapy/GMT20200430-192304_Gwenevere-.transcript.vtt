Matthew Montano: My breakup, because my breakup actually what felt like it felt like a dad like it was getting me that depressed. Yeah. And I don't know if that's normal, or

20
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.780
Matthew Montano: It's because I know I'll never get back with him because of the way things ended so it like affecting me like a dead like it was like I was constantly down

21
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.040
Matthew Montano: But I'm

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.690
Matthew Montano: It's what it's what

Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna listen

Matthew Montano: Okay, and also

26
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.950
Matthew Montano: I've done

27
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.940
Matthew Montano: It's kind of crazy. The person I've seen and I kind of did it on purpose, out of

28
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.570
Matthew Montano: Out of revenge, I guess.

29
00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:05.580
Matthew Montano: Or Brian hurting my feelings. The guy I'm seeing is one arrives x or the guy that I am dating.

30
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the one you did the sex video

31
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.500
Matthew Montano: Yeah. See, I told you about that.

32
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:26.070
Matthew Montano: Yeah okay so we make we we have sex, and we take something happening and and then have him. I take to give me oral sex and then I sent it to Ryan.

33
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice guy.

34
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.180
Matthew Montano: So, I know, but it's just like I never achieved on him those four years. I just started finding out slowly that he was

35
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:50.010
Matthew Montano: He was cheating on me, where every once in a while and never had to report or Brett. He never even showed a sign of these things and it's just like

36
00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:00.180
Matthew Montano: I felt in my mind, how could a person do that to another person. You don't do that to somebody, you could drive somebody crazy, you could you could get, you know,

37
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:15.510
Matthew Montano: And you could really, you could make somebody suicide or you could make somebody people kill people kill their partners for stuff like that, you know, don't do stuff like that people. And so I just. That was my like little Buck you

38
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.800
Matthew Montano: Know,

39
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.180
Matthew Montano: Up just just show him how that how feel server, you know, like

40
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.410
Matthew Montano: It was in something like it wasn't like, oh, I want to be like Kiki or up. It was like, I really wanted to, I wanted to

41
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.360
Matthew Montano: And I find that I do that sometimes.

42
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.900
Matthew Montano: In relationships. If they don't end well. I feel like I have to get

43
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.710
Matthew Montano: If I feel like the for me, I always feel like I have to get revenge.

44
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.770
Matthew Montano: Like I have to

45
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.210
Matthew Montano: somehow make them like either

46
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:07.380
Matthew Montano: Like in the relationship. I was it I'm I haven't been in I've been in three or four relationships throughout my life and I'm 31 but the one before, Ryan.

47
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:24.570
Matthew Montano: See how did that they went. It went really well. The whole time he was the one that actually got me hooked on the oxy codeine, so that's why they went well for so good. We are high. Most of the time and

48
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:47.880
Matthew Montano: But anyways, when I started noticing that things weren't going well. When I would when I tried to help him and myself get off the drugs like I noticed he started distancing himself for me and like what, like he wanted out of the relationship. So I did whatever I could to make them miserable.

49
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.240
Matthew Montano: As that mean

50
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:14.100
Matthew Montano: And I, and like, like I just met this this other guy. He's really good. He's, he's gorgeous. The guy that I made the sex video with the river is gorgeous. He's better looking, and Ronnie I he's looking at Ryan. Most people would say, and Ryan was really good looking, and

51
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.450
Matthew Montano: I'm thinking, is it something you myself like

52
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.150
Matthew Montano: Am I not happy with myself. Is that why

53
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.970
Matthew Montano: Is there something I need to work on in myself, my confidence, maybe being bully.

54
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.610
Matthew Montano: Bully very, very roughly in high school and

55
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.560
Matthew Montano: You know,

56
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.090
Matthew Montano: Just

57
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.280
Matthew Montano: But yet I still hung out with the popular kids with the bully me and

58
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.840
Matthew Montano: You know,

59
00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for now. Matthew, just keep telling your story just hear yourself. Get all all of it out, he's gorgeous. People say, give me a name to to Mr. Gorgeous. What's his name.

60
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.220
A

61
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.740
Matthew Montano: McKinsey

62
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so he's even better looking than Ryan.

63
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:34.320
Matthew Montano: Yeah, but that's that has nothing to do with it. Of course, your initial attraction is the way somebody looks that's that's the way you're initially going to attract attract somebody or see your interest in them, so it has nothing to do with that, um,

64
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.330
Matthew Montano: I do like to look good myself and stuff.

65
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:51.780
Matthew Montano: But my relationships always seem to be they start off really well that person always initiate the relationship. So I know

66
00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:12.450
Matthew Montano: I know I must be attractive. They, they always initiate the relationship. They always tell me they love me. First, they always have those puppy dog eyes on me first. And I'm always really was put the wall up always have the wall up so I know

67
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.990
Matthew Montano: People like me. But then once I start getting too close to them.

68
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:38.610
Matthew Montano: I skip this strong jealousy like once the relationship starts getting to real serious I mice this crazy jealousy comes out in me in this where I'm constantly wondering what they're doing. They're fading call answer my phone call. I'm wondering what they were doing and

69
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.410
Matthew Montano: And it got so crazy like that with Ryan likely if he wouldn't answer my phone call right away. I would freak out, or if

70
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:59.370
Matthew Montano: He gave a guy a straight guy ride home and he forgot to tell me about it. And he told me about it another time I freaked out. But I know that guy was screen. No, nothing like that happen but

71
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:17.610
Matthew Montano: It, but now that I'm finally override and I look back at that. And I was like, what if he did cheat on me. What it's I could, I would have just broke up with him. Why, why is it, why do I get this extreme jealousy and like

72
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.490
Matthew Montano: Like

73
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.710
Matthew Montano: jealousy and resentment towards these people, you know, and I. Is it, is it because

74
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.870
Matthew Montano: I've been

75
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:43.320
Matthew Montano: let down by people. I love a lot like like my mom. She is my dad and I broke up our family.

76
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.210
Matthew Montano: Um,

77
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, so at least

78
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're going to have just listened

79
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, then you're going to

80
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Go therapist to

81
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.680
Matthew Montano: Pop.

82
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be psycho therapist to you're going to answer your own questions, you're going to give me a chance.

83
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:12.480
Matthew Montano: Well, I guess I'm I guess I'm smart. So I realized these things but you know okay stop me when I'm doing that.

84
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm not going to stop you. I just did. That was my only contribution right there. But notice how you did it, you're answering your own question.

85
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we may not see it the same way, but just noticed that that's happening.

86
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all.

87
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice. Oh, I want you all. You know what, maybe it's this. You're doing the psycho analysis, but if we're going to do the I mom on the couch, if I'm on the couch, then I'm listening. Okay, I'm not judging you.

88
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And me, if you're going to do psychoanalysis, because we love doing. Of course, psychology is a cool field. We love to look at that. It's a fun thing to do.

89
00:10:54.570 --> 00:11:10.260
Matthew Montano: I don't I don't necessarily look into too much. It's just, I have a very like like smoldering mind my mind is always running and trying to figure stuff out like I'm just, I'm probably a really smart person like you know

90
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.500
Matthew Montano: Oh, I am a really smart person.

91
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:33.720
Matthew Montano: What I'm trying to, I guess, when I when I like imagine questions. What I'm trying to get at. And I don't know how this works or anything. You're the professional I'm trying to figure out how to fix those things. How, how do I fix that. How do I

92
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.510
Matthew Montano: Change those things, you know,

93
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:38.940
Matthew Montano: It's so hard.

94
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.600
Matthew Montano: How do I trust again that's

95
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.930
Matthew Montano: That's my problem. It's so hard to trust.

96
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll put the word trust off to the side. That's a heavy hitter. That's an important one.

97
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.580
Matthew Montano: Okay, it's hard for me to trust.

98
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.320
Matthew Montano: Friends.

99
00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.370
Matthew Montano: But I

100
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.950
Matthew Montano: Do I do, but I do eventually

101
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:10.890
Matthew Montano: It's not as hard for me to trust friends because we're not intimate once things become intimate because I'm very sexual and

102
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.320
Matthew Montano: That's how I express my love, so like I get

103
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:26.490
Matthew Montano: I feel like we have usually have good sex with whoever I'm with but it's like an expression of My Love. It's not just, I'm just not like a horny rabbit like

104
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:42.450
Matthew Montano: So once the relationship becomes into me, that's when my jealousy comes out because I can't like sometimes when I was with Ryan.

105
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:55.590
Matthew Montano: The way we would have sex or whatever we would do in bed him doing that with somebody else would run through my mind when I would get jealous and that would cause panic attacks.

106
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So can I can I reflect something back, he said.

107
00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.640
Hmm.

108
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just want to reflect this one piece of that is you described yourself like this. I'm having sex with a partner and everything's fine.

109
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I get close to them. And then I get jealous. Hold that I was in the first part of this this session.

110
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: He just said the opposite. Hold on.

111
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's fine for we're close. But then when we're intimate. That's when

112
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I get jealous. Did you know you said the exact opposite thing in the same span of like 10 minutes, they're exactly the opposite. Do you have an idea about why you might do that.

113
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.790
Matthew Montano: Well, it's

114
00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:00.870
Matthew Montano: The jealousy, cut the jealousy and not wanting to be abandoned her

115
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:14.040
Matthew Montano: By being cheated on or whatever codes from day. Once the intimacy becomes a big part of the relationship. And also, once I start telling them.

116
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:27.150
Matthew Montano: My personal secrets and stuff about my life because I feel like those are two things. Those are two things that can really hurt like I know I said how you said, I said.

117
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Both but

118
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So let me ask you, are there two types of sex, at least, is there. Is it possible that maybe there's this I'm hot. You're hot. Let's have sex, then

119
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.980
Yeah.

120
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's it. We're going to find out whether there's any chance. Any chance. Any chance. Oh, now I trust you and I'm going to share my secrets. Now we've got closeness.

121
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And sex is now making love. Now it's different now it's in this

122
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

123
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You think that's what that is.

124
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.110
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

125
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:24.240
Matthew Montano: What I'm doing with McKinsey, it's just, it's just sex because I know he's he's known as super around. So I have he's he's gorgeous guy but I use protection and the whole nine yards. Because I know he likes to sleep around, he's done for that. OK.

126
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so I think I got clear on on the on the sex part changes, meaning

127
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It changes me

128
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.900
Matthew Montano: Yeah, love it when I make it's making love. And that's what I used to do with Ryan if make love

129
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

130
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You sell a lot of stuff and I listening to, but you're doing your own psycho analysis of it.

131
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And

132
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're the one

133
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing the psychoanalysis and you're the one engaging in this vindictive behavior, how likely is it that you've really found the core truth.

134
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.970
Matthew Montano: I think I feel like I

135
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.170
Matthew Montano: Found what the problem is. But

136
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.970
Matthew Montano: How do I fix it.

137
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me in a word in one statement. Take your time on it. My problem is

138
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it in a phrase my problem.

139
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.810
Matthew Montano: My problem is trust and intimacy issues.

140
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we don't need to move from there. I remember I put trust off to the side. I said that's a heavy hitter. And here we are again. Right. So you're you're onto something that's a pretty pretty important one for a lot of people

141
00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's what it doesn't say it doesn't say the subject is it doesn't say the object.

142
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is my problem is trust and intimacy. My problem is this is trust and intimacy.

143
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there like that. The problem is trust and intimacy. It's right here.

144
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:28.710
Matthew Montano: No, I feel like. Okay, watch this is trust and intimacy. Once it becomes trusted intimacy. I feel like I'm doing this, trying to hold it together.

145
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What

146
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. That's perfect. That's right.

147
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, it's relationship.

148
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.530
And it's

149
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.650
Matthew Montano: Very stressful. Okay.

150
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. So that was a perfect analogy. So as soon as you identify it exists there is trust. There is intimacy, you become anxious

151
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice

152
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that it's here and you are here.

153
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are anxious as if it is this thing and you have a relationship, hold on to it.

154
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you are proximal and you are around this kind of love, because that's what intimacy and trust is that's love. So when you're around it, you get anxious

155
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this wobbly is this thinking I have to keep it.

156
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think it is. What is the relationship between you. Let's keep it this distance. It's a good metaphor.

157
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep it as if it's this thing.

158
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you're worried about. I'm going to lose it. And that will mean I'm a bad person. Or, you know what, this isn't real. I don't believe this is real. I feel it. But today, feel it. So here's that's only two examples. There are so many scenarios. So hold on.

159
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The Quiet happen.

160
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is.

161
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just look at it. Maybe take that phone again and just look at that, if that's trust and intimacy.

162
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to it.

163
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going right rain. This is imagination. This is this weird kooky stuff. And this isn't on the couch chit chat. This is a little bit of that weirder thing that I do sometimes, right. This is our so you look at it.

164
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here.

165
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The first thing you want to say.

166
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Editing

167
00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing it now you're trying to think of the right thing to say. That's not what I want. I want to know. Right.

168
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:12.120
Matthew Montano: Before before I thought of something before you did that. I thought member on when you asked me what my goals were my goals are to have

169
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.420
Matthew Montano: A BOYFRIEND, a family.

170
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.250
Matthew Montano: And that's why I hold on to like that.

171
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't ask you why I'm your therapist, I'm asking you to answer this question.

172
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If this is trust and intimacy. What do you have to say to it first response.

173
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch it fast. Fuck your fight. Now we're talking. Now we got somewhere.

174
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah. Yes.

175
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you want it. It is what brings us meaning in our life, isn't it.

176
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.090
Yeah.

177
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Fuck you.

178
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at the difference. It's like that clash of that duality.

179
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't you

180
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The very thing you want

181
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Causes you anxiety.

182
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit there without a little bit without doing your psycho analysis thing where you start to dip into family history just sit with your truth. That was beautiful, just sit there with it a second.

183
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Back and forth. This is what I want. Well, fuck you. That's

184
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, isn't it.

185
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.150
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Say it. Say it again. I hear you. What

Gwenevere Abriel: Your what I want. Look, I'm pushing it away.

189
00:21:50.400 --> 00:22:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Your what I want, push, push, push your what I want, push, push, push. I told you when it's in the goals. This is what I want. I talk about in therapy, all the time. I want this, I told you it's what I want. Well, I'm going to go completely sabotage.

190
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Any hope of getting this I'm going to treat men like this. I'm going to treat my body like this. You already told me you told me months ago. You say, Well, normally when I'm in a breakup. I will go out and I will have, you know, sex, and you're so proud of yourself. Well, that's gone.

191
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Your baseline fuck them.

Matthew Montano: Yeah.

194
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This looks

195
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.350
Like

196
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.320
Matthew Montano: It's a conflictual relationship.

197
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're at. They're at odds. That's a good way to put it.

198
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:56.790
Matthew Montano: And it's, it's kind of like tearing me apart when I'm in that relationship. It's like

199
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.510
Matthew Montano: Like, because now that I'm out of it.

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's see if that's true. Actually, maybe not sure about that. Let me, let me repeat what you said.

203
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How about what you said earlier going in there. This feels like death.

204
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you said that earlier today.

205
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.900

Gwenevere Abriel: I needed to date again.

207
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not true. It isn't this because if it was this Matt looks sexy. Yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to teach you that. Revenge is a waste of time and that hate will only beget hate that love is always the answer. I'm going to teach you and it's so hard. This lesson and I'm struggling to and I will, I will teach you

274
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard.

275
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that like this. Now, what's, what are you going through

276
00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.320
Matthew Montano: I'm just thinking

277
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.820
Matthew Montano: Well, obviously, I was really into sit back

278
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.400
Matthew Montano: And I know things like

279
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.070
Matthew Montano: Revenge or party people are being heard.

280
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.730
Matthew Montano: And if I had a cute.

281
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:20.220
Matthew Montano: I would do my best to make sure they never learned to repay.

282
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's right.

283
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You saw right through me. That was the intervention side to me.

284
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't return. There's no return. You won't get what you're looking for in hate you won't. It's empty. It's so empty.

285
00:31:43.620 --> 00:32:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There will be no return. If there is, it's this fleeting little. Gotcha. And then guess what you are searching hungry and yearning and wanting, yet again, there's no amount of revenge. That will fill that empty space you have inside, man.

286
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I can promise you.

287
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing that will fill is love.

288
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can say it easy breezy. I could print it on a t shirt and wear it around, but I know firsthand how hard what I just said, is to do but Matt, you were doing it.

289
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: For a minute when you broke up. You were proud of yourself because you were not acting out you held on to yourself, knowing that he's not the right person for you and then you deserve something else that you want something else.

290
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: worthy of love and kindness and respect and simply put someone that shares your core values that wants a home that knows basically

291
00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, we're not going to cheat on each other. We're, we're going to say we're going to talk to each other was an honest way we're going to have a great sex life. We're going to communicate. We're going to both work hard, if that's the value you have

292
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're doing, you can keep doing it to find out if what I'm saying is true. Go for it. I'll be here for the for the drama and the great stories, you're going to have all I'll sit here on the couch with you.

293
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it won't fill the void.

294
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.050
Matthew Montano: One sense

295
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.480
Matthew Montano: When I looked at it like that.

296
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did it by yourself for in that's exactly what it was, it was to say, how will I teach this thing. How can I teach

297
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

298
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter what anybody says about your does to you. You're amazing.

299
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.090
You're amazing.

300
00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's good.

301
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.270
Matthew Montano: I feel like

302
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:07.470
Matthew Montano: It's makes me sad because I know that my mom get that

303
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:11.670
Matthew Montano: You know, but

304
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:15.990
Matthew Montano: And I hate to cry about some dog.

305
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: No, this feeling is really, really, really old. This isn't just adults. This is fear of not getting it when you needed it needed it when you were little, you needed it back to back over and again over and again

306
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Again and again and again.

307
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

308
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.960
Oh, sorry.

309
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweetie.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that all

311
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm so sorry.

312
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You are making it through and you are okay, you're okay you survived that you did it all by yourself. You don't have to do it like that anymore. Okay.

313
00:35:52.620 --> 00:36:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: People can understand you. They can be there, they can hear you. They can see you. Yeah.

314
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you made it through that.

315
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.520
Matthew Montano: never really realized it was

316
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.920
Matthew Montano: Stuff like that.

317
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.200
Matthew Montano: Cause me problems.

318
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.270
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

319
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.240
Matthew Montano: Somebody wasn't there for

320
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That stays with us.

321
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing.

322
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't there for you. It could let you down again.

323
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:10.770
Matthew Montano: So,

324
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what, fuck you.

325
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:14.610
Matthew Montano: Know,

326
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A whole lot easier than what you just did, which is sit with the fear and you've named it earlier of abandonment of not being understood. It's awful. It's an awful it's, it, it feels like death. I'm not understood. I'm not known. That's, that's that childhood piece and it could happen again.

327
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.780
Matthew Montano: And that's the scariest the, you know, cuz it's like every time.

328
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:56.940
Matthew Montano: I get hurt it. It feels works no getting older and, you know,

329
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.760
Matthew Montano: It's harder every time.

330
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you just did with me, Matt. I'm guessing you've never done exactly like that before.

331
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Was new

332
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.450
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

333
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Changing so although you say these relationships. I know are the same and I'm getting older. Okay, well that you just went up sort of on that sort of lighter

334
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Level, which has to do projecting into the future. And that's what's going to get you anxious, but you just made contact with a real truth and that is

335
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to address my sense of identity, my sense of self.

336
00:38:52.740 --> 00:39:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing some inner some deep inner work around that. That's the stuff that will carry you forward. That's the stuff that when you really have this confidence in you, your core sense of self, that I am okay I can be in the presence. Right.

337
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Of love and intimacy and trust. And I won't be terrified and I won't act out

338
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't want to push it away by accident, be an asshole or something or be so jealous that it pushes them away.

339
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this that you did in here today, when you did that with the picture and you felt that it's called a dissonance. It's like, I don't know how to teach it, you felt it in real time, you don't know how to teach it, because you don't know it yet.

340
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you know philosophically and intellectually. Well, I know I'll teach my son how to do it.

341
00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What you have to know how to do it firsthand.

342
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:52.710
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

343
00:39:54.300 --> 00:40:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's work you did in here and you're going to get better at it and better at it and you're going to see more opportunities to not act out of fear.

344
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of it. Look right site insecurity pop psychology offers that so in security. Fine, we'll go with that. And you're going to hold on tight and you're going to say, I may not know how to do this. Confident thing. Yeah.

345
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna

346
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to stay still going to stay quiet.

347
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to go act out not going to go have a sex here. I'm not going to go do a drug there. I'm not going to drink there. I'm not going to overwork out and hurt my body. I'm not going to go access. I'm going to slow down.

348
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: look inward and see what do I really, really, really, really, really, really, really. I really, really, really, really need right now.

349
00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Those other things that you've been doing most recently aren't going to fill it. This stuff in here. The one where you find that answer in the quiet.

350
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But just stay with the answer that you get fits, only to be okay.

351
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's we're doing, we're doing that work. And so make sure you show up to your appointments keep meeting with me and having these kind of conversations. Let's keep doing the psychotherapy, because this inter personal thing you're doing with me.

352
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sitting with the discomfort is building new tissue and your brain and it's building that ego strength that then you can take in here when you trust me.

353
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

354
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You can trust someone else.

355
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It's uncomfortable and it's risky but it's Gives Us Meaning in our life.

356
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.760
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

357
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This last tiny bit of time we have, and just sort of go into that quiet space Matt your inner world.

358
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.860
Matthew Montano: To get some tissue really quick.

359
00:41:59.250 --> 00:41:59.820
Horse.

360
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.150
Matthew Montano: Okay.

361
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a moment to reflect on what you noticed about you, for us to sort of create this this sort of decompression of how intensely you just worked

362
00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So what the destination is is a lighter, kind of, we're going to get to that superficial chit chat before my next client gets here. So, but take a second look in

363
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And watch roll out. Watch this.

364
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Video know of what happened in here today, how you felt expectations philosophies, just walk. And then what happened. What do you think about what happened. What did you notice about how you felt

365
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: In your

366
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:38.580
Matthew Montano: Sense of

367
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.630
Matthew Montano: What's up, I was

368
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: About to say, a sense of was it relief. Is that what it is.

369
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:59.220
Matthew Montano: Like, like I lead our Sophie cuz I don't ever cry so, like when I cry like that it actually

370
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:00.960
Matthew Montano: Feels like

371
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:06.300
Matthew Montano: You know, that was a lot. Just let out

372
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.120
Yeah.

373
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I do have any idea.

374
00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Why me, why do you think me. I miss sarcastic snarky kind of bitch lady, why talk to her, Why me,

375
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.480
Matthew Montano: Um,

376
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.820
Matthew Montano: I feel I really like you have the counselor, because

377
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.700
Matthew Montano: I really

378
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:49.410
Matthew Montano: I know we I don't. We're not there yet, but I feel like we have a connection. I really understand where you are the type of person you want. Okay, you're a good person that look like

379
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.970
Yeah, really.

380
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

381
00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Even through all of my rigidity with rules and all we you work you earned today you kicked its but we have had at least two really hard sessions where you and I had this power and you push through it and you still showed up for yourself and you did this hard work today.

382
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And have a little bit of trust in here.

383
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And something you're picking up on on goodness of my intention.

384
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That intuition you happen to be right. I do.

385
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're lucky because it's true. I actually do have really good intentions for my clients. So you're right. And so whatever you picked up on in here that I was doing

386
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's the stuff when you go out into the world and you want to look for a friend to really open up to maybe it'll be a lover to don't know but you want to kind of keep your eye out for how it feels to be around me.

387
00:45:54.690 --> 00:46:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I kind of have that same I sense this goodness I sense this good intention.

388
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I know you say you've seen it in some people. But there's another thing that is in here that isn't typical of other relationships.

389
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't ask for anything.

390
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

391
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:23.820
Yeah.

392
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So take the skill of registering. This is a person who's intentions are good and just just be mindful of it you know when when it shows up and you happen to notice it. If you start to see it in other people, hey,

393
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That I recognize that and and and I'm feeling what calm excited. Maybe tearful like I want to write. I want to open my heart up maybe to this person, like, oh, that's interesting. I'm picking up on a good vibe here.

394
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.000
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

395
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.380
Matthew Montano: Yeah, definitely.

396
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Good intentions.

397
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.430
That is true.

398
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:10.350
All right.

399
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about our next appointment. That's kind of a superficial thing we can fluffy it up about that we can say, hey, what

400
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Is next week look like for you.

Matthew Montano: Oh, sorry.

410
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry. Yeah.

411
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: being silly. So let's take

412
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What, in general, to kind of know what your work life is like next week to get a sense of it.

413
00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.150
Matthew Montano: Yeah, my days awkward Thursdays or Fridays.

414
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:08.460
Matthew Montano: So I'm off today, tomorrow, and then next week. There's a break by schedule, it's, it's a set schedule.

415
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: To 10 a seven to 10

416
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:55.980
Matthew Montano: May 7

417
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.800
Matthew Montano: Okay, May seven,

418
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:09.660
Matthew Montano: To 10

419
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.490
Matthew Montano: Okay. Is that a Thursday. Let me check my phone.

420
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, I'd be curious to see how this saturates for you in the coming week and I already sent a message, just in case, just to kind of, that's what I do. I now I don't even ask. I just send a message and I say my clients here. I say who it is. And then, off we go. I just do it.

421
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

422
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:50.610
Yeah.

423
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Doc and said he's here, so I will see you on Monday.

424
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:09.750
Matthew Montano: And on the on the group, group that a group therapies do. Is there ever a point I can go to like every other week because

425
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:20.760
Matthew Montano: I, I'm not a big person about opening up with a group of people like that. I just, it makes me feel super awkward.

426
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

427
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.630
Matthew Montano: About at least about my emotions and stuff.

428
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.250
I know

429
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Matt, the very thing that you feel awkward about

430
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the very thing you need. I know that makes no sense to you and sometime in the future. You're going to break past that.

431
00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to open up and it will be exciting and nerve wracking and you will catch yourself making a decision about whether you're going to do it in a split second of a moment.

432
00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you will trust yourself and you'll do it anyway because that's where the healing is that you risk it all that other people might judge

433
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the very thing that makes you uncomfortable.

434
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not for you don't have to know that that's that's a clinician. That's why we know it's so important.

435
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not just medication check in. It's this social setting that has so many pressures to it. And this work that you just did here with me today.

436
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang on, it's gonna there's more to come, a lot more to come, where you are going to grow and evolve.

437
00:51:46.740 --> 00:52:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But there will be stretching like physical therapy, you are not going to want to do it. It's uncomfortable physical therapy is uncomfortable psychotherapy, if it's any good is frickin uncomfortable.

438
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: About it.

439
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:05.850
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

440
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: How comfortable was today.

441
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.400
Matthew Montano: Well,

442
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:18.750
Matthew Montano: I felt like today was a good session, but because I feel comfortable around you so

443
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:33.630
Matthew Montano: It was hard. It was rough. It was it was rough looking back at those motion, but it felt good to realize what you know it's it's not my bottom right, it's

444
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:46.530
Matthew Montano: Not my fault. I use substances to cover up my hurts a since it's been my path. Seems like my mother.

445
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it's probably going to be convenient actually that your therapist is a female

446
00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:55.020
Yeah.

447
00:52:59.010 --> 00:52:59.340
Matthew Montano: Like a

448
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.690
Matthew Montano: Sister mom.

449
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

450
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:03.990
Matthew Montano: Because you're young.

451
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's transference is what's going on. So, that's perfect.

452
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So my job is just, I just maintain myself and I maintain this position of unconditional regard and my good intent and it'll, it'll work itself out the the piece about so uncomfortable.

453
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time you notice how uncomfortable it is I challenge you to say.

454
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm uncomfortable.

455
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to look so good and say all these right things in there. Yeah.

456
00:53:53.520 --> 00:54:09.570
Matthew Montano: Yeah, cuz I actually was going to do that last while I kind of did that last week. But, uh, sometimes. What if I'm in there and you asked me a question and I'm just like, I really don't want to be here right now I go like this.

457
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:10.830
Matthew Montano: Am I allowed to see that.

458
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say that there's a lot of people that say, I don't want to be here, but they if you have the courage to say why. Because here's what will happen if you just leave it. I don't want to be here.

459
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen is you're not in therapy with me, you're in it with a group of people. The accountabilities different

460
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.660
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I have to say.

461
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You affect other people too.

462
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's tricky, tricky and you don't have to manage all of that, but just know that I'll probably say, well, what makes you not want to be here and then you're going to be left to say it anyway. So you might as well say

463
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever it is, I'm afraid you guys will judge me. I figure eventually you're gonna

464
00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Somebody in here is going to say something means to me. Eventually, you know, I don't know what it is, but most this week this week and last week I've been having actual psychotherapy.

465
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:11.580
Matthew Montano: What do you do

466
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:27.390
Matthew Montano: What it is, sorry, is that I'm use my work setting and stuff is all civil people. And there's some people in there that like I feel could just go off and I don't want to have to have an argument there is, you know, kind of

467
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

468
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.360
Matthew Montano: All kinds of people and

469
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say you don't know this about me. So mostly what you see me doing is I'm fun. I asked people to speak and you've seen me bring up topics and I've been sort of this firm. Here's a rule. It's all follow it, or you've seen that version of me right

470
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah version of me that you haven't seen that you keep your eye out for it. I'm a protector.

471
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

472
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I would take them out, not kill them, obviously, but

473
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.260
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

474
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say,

475
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's own it. So if you have something you want to say about what you're feeling, you can do that, but we do. We don't tell people how to live their life and we certainly don't criticize them. We don't blame them. We don't shame them.

476
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And if they can't hold it together. I'll remove them from the group.

477
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's never happened. But my parkhouse where I said I wait let's shift our way we're speaking to each other. Let's own it. What's cut. So if something right. I've never seen it. Most people pick up on.

478
00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm going to hold everyone accountable. I'm going to hold everyone accountable myself to and even a doctor, do you have Dr. Solomon, but

479
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I do with the doctors to

480
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm protecting everyone. No one's protecting me, mind you.

481
00:56:53.340 --> 00:57:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm gonna I'm gonna, I'm not perfect, and I might fail, but I don't know that I really have I protect people, it's important to you feel safe to risk.

482
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:07.080
Matthew Montano: Well,

483
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me finish that you risk didn't do socially when you were younger. It's important that you give to challenge that old belief about yourself that I can't say and be in a social setting. That's what what is so cool about group, but I'm there. So I can be

484
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Like hey

485
00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, and we have this little mute thing to just so you know, in the real life doesn't have that. So there's a lot of little pieces and I can bring people from a group straight away.

486
00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And nobody's gonna say anything.

487
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:48.960
Matthew Montano: I feel like I'd be more comfortable in a visible group setting video. It's the I'm still getting used to video you see yourself.

488
00:57:49.620 --> 00:58:02.010
Matthew Montano: And you know, that's, you know, and I have this thing in my head that I always feel like I gotta look good. It's like concern, how I look at the same time I'm worried about what you're saying.

489
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:03.600
Matthew Montano: I'm getting

490
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:04.980
Matthew Montano: I'm getting

491
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting easier. I will see you on Monday.

492
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if you're nervous.
