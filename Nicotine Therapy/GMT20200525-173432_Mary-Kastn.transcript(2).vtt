477
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:31.710
Mary Kastner: I want to see how you do all order they add around, but I really would like to see you on a mood stabilizer because this can make you manic

478
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.990
Mary Kastner: Put your microphone up to your mouth.

479
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.410

Mary Kastner: Yeah.

483
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.870
Hilaal’s iPhone: Okay, mood stabilizer. Why was that necessary.

484
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:53.700
Mary Kastner: Because I think that you had a baseline and you still are having some sort of

485
00:35:53.730 --> 00:36:04.650
Mary Kastner: What we call hypomania and the Adderall can actually throw you smack into a full manic episode where you're psychotic and

486
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.090
Mary Kastner: Last thing you want you know because you have the symptoms of some sort of

487
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:16.740
Mary Kastner: Crowded thinking some overspending some hyper sexual behavior and definitely the sleep issue so I'm

488
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.670
Mary Kastner: Sorry to cut you out around out around is an amphetamine and

489
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.170
Mary Kastner: You make

490
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:44.730
Mary Kastner: It can make all of that worse and i don't i understand it helps you. I don't, I'm not going to deny you from having it but you need to have a man mood stabilizer on board to keep you to help under this underlying mania. So you we can either

491
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:50.250
Mary Kastner: We can either order that today, or you and I can talk more about it in group tomorrow.

Yeah.

595
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:54.390

596
00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:01.050
Mary Kastner: Oh yeah, I've been asking them to get on the phone and help you out because I don't know what happened. But anyway, can you put your video on

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:05.970
Iliana: Oh, you can't see me. Sorry, I'm trying to figure out how to do this on the computer.

598
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:10.110
Mary Kastner: So why are you Ileana

600
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:14.730
Oh,

601
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.880
Mary Kastner: No. That makes sense. I have my husband's computer so that does the same thing for me. Yeah.

602
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:36.450
Mary Kastner: So anyway, my name is Mary, and I'm a nurse practitioner in psychiatry and you came here for your first time today. Is that correct, are you seeing somebody else and you're here for a psych assessment.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.080
Mary Kastner: Okay, great. In your on Suboxone I believe with him.

607
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.920
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Okay, so what can I do for you.

608
00:45:50.550 --> 00:46:11.280
Iliana: Um, well, I have had like crazy anxiety, pretty much my whole life since like high school and she prescribed me this surreal is called Hydra or something like that. But it's visceral brand name and it's it's just not not doing much. I also have real real hard time falling asleep.

609
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.950
Iliana: My anxiety. It's like even right now. Like I have sweaty hands.

610
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.050
Iliana: Just

611
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:29.340
Iliana: Pretty much anything in life. Like if if there's a crowd there I can deal with all the noise of the people I've gotta like sometimes go home, depending on the situation.

612
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:40.710
Iliana: Like in the store. Sometimes I'll be in there and I'll just get this feeling come over me, or I can't even be there and I've had to walk out and leave all my stuff there.

613
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:51.060
Iliana: before all this happened. I had my primary doctor he had me on Xanax, originally, which I didn't, I didn't like that much. It helps, but it was like a real

614
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:57.090
Iliana: Quick help and then it stopped. And then after that, he put me on cold clonazepam

615
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:04.950
Iliana: And I noticed that that actually made a way bigger difference as in like I would take it at like five or six at night and then it would actually help me sleep.

616
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:18.150
Iliana: I would get a great night's sleep and then the next day like even my fiance issue. And notice, like I could get way more done either because I'm rested are just not as panicked and worried. In my head I just, I feel better and clear when I take it.

617
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.050
Mary Kastner: Haha

618
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.960
Mary Kastner: How many hours of sleep did you get last night.

619
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.020
Iliana: Last night, probably for

620
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.260
Iliana: And then not only that but I an entire

621
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.470
Iliana: Pack of to pop tarts yesterday for the whole day.

622

Mary Kastner: To not eating well

623
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:35.190
No.

624
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.680
Mary Kastner: And are you smoking.

625
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:38.760
Iliana: No.

626
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.190
Mary Kastner: No nicotine use at all.

627
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:49.530
Iliana: Well, I have a vapor pen occasionally that I'll use most of the time it's filled with zero nicotine, though. It's more just, kind of, because I used to smoke.

628
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:53.820
Mary Kastner: For you, for you if you ever had any trauma.

629
00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.110
Iliana: Like physical or emotional

630
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:07.410
Iliana: Those yeah I gotten a bad quad accident. The last year. And that's kind of where all the back pain and stuff stem from

631
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:13.110
Iliana: All my, my whole lumbar all the discs are out of place and then spine and narrowing

632
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.840
Mary Kastner: Clyde. What does that mean,

633
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.910
Iliana: Oh, it's like a dirt bike with four tires.

634
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.290
Mary Kastner: Oh, okay. Thank you.

635
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.510
Mary Kastner: Yeah lumbar disc problems after a dirt bike with four wheels.

636
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.910
Mary Kastner: Yes. Okay.

637
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:33.900
Iliana: Yeah I blacked out when I crashed that don't fully remember but my chin was split open to where they actually took me an ambulance.

638
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:38.100
Iliana: To a hospital down the hill from where I live, because they were gonna wire my Joshua

639
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.880
Iliana: And I got out of that by like a millimeter the merge the

640
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:44.910
Iliana: Surgeon said he couldn't believe it was just one little piece.

641
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.190
Iliana: Yeah.

642
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.980
Mary Kastner: So you're in pain. What's your pain level today.

643
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:59.820
Iliana: Today, it's probably about six and a half seven last week for about three, four days straight. I was at like nine nine and it was

644
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.350
Iliana: As bad as my back. Cut ever been, how much the box on are you on

645
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.470
Iliana: Oh, like, four of them a day.

646
00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.180
Mary Kastner: Okay, so you're on 24 milligrams. Is it an eight.

647
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:22.020
Iliana: Straight either. Yeah, but whether the tabs. But yeah, she tried having me take a more often to help with the pain because the pain was so out of control. When I started

648
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:22.620
Iliana: Taking it

649
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.490
Iliana: And it kind of help, but it definitely like still like even right now like

650
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.330
Mary Kastner: When I

651
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.880
Iliana: Go to stand up. It takes me a second to stand up.

652
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.290
Iliana: Fully straight. If I've been like

653
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.240
Iliana: hunched over at all for a while.

654
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:38.430
Mary Kastner: Have you had any any surgeries to your lumbar area I

655
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:47.760
Iliana: Know they talked about it, but I've told them unless I can't live without pain medicine and I don't even want to go down that route because people in my family have had it and

656
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.570
Iliana: They had to add it read on our came out worst stuff like that.

657
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.630
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Any other trauma, besides the accident.

658
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:55.500
Iliana: I'm

659
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:56.940
Physically, no.

660
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:05.220
Iliana: I mean just broken bones of the stuff growing up like both of my wrist. At the same time, but other than that I

661
00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.690
Mary Kastner: Any emotional

662
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.360
Iliana: Trauma maybe growing up I

663
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.860
Iliana: Kind of grew up and

664
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:22.800
Iliana: Around the drug addict, my whole life. My mom. I've seen her shooting up. I've seen or passed out with the fridge open in the middle of the night passed out in the bathrooms passed out in the dog food bowl like

665
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:24.540
Iliana: Everywhere.

666
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.900
Iliana: It was a lot of arguing and stuff. I grew up around

667
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:28.860
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

668
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:30.540
Mary Kastner: Okay.

669
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.780
Mary Kastner: Um, so, uh, have you had any military service.

670
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:37.620
Iliana: No.

671
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:43.950
Mary Kastner: Okay, any legal issues. No. No. Okay. And your relationship with your fiance house.

672
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:45.510
Iliana: It's good.

673
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:53.100
Mary Kastner: And besides the two benzodiazepines, you've mentioned, have you had any other medication for the anxiety.

674
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.600
Iliana: No, they tried

675
00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.020
Iliana: When I was going to my primary he sent me to

676
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:05.370
Iliana: Another Doctor, I want to say psychiatrist or something and he wanted to put me on SS eyes or SS our eyes.

677
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:14.910
Iliana: It's been a long, long time. I tried those years and years ago and my brother and sister both currently take them and

678
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:26.970
Iliana: If they skip a day on them. They like can't even do anything they talk about it like it's the worst thing in the world to have to come off those if they forget a day or something like they can't even get out of bed.

679
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:38.670
Iliana: And also, it kind of affects like my well whatever I went when I took it, it was years ago. But, uh, I just don't want it to like affect sex drive or anything.

680
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:43.650
Mary Kastner: Okay. It did. It did it affect that when you. Okay, okay, okay.

681
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.910
Mary Kastner: So you did try them good helpings it

682
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:58.590
Iliana: I'm not, but I noticed I didn't try it for more than like a month. Because of that, and I was afraid to go too far and then have to worry about like being stuck in my brother talks about

683
00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:08.760
Iliana: Like electrical pulses like going through his brain. Yeah, that's not an SSRI. That would be an SSRI that would probably do that unless he was on Paxil packs.

684
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.320
Mary Kastner: That does that

685
00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.150
Iliana: That was one of them. A year ago.

686
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:13.920
Mary Kastner: Feel yeah

687
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.620
Mary Kastner: Do you remember the names of the ones you were on

688
00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:25.740
Iliana: No.

689
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.580
Mary Kastner: No, okay, Zoloft sertraline

690
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.710
Iliana: Low off this one. Yes.

691
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.410
Mary Kastner: lowered your sex drive.

692
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.030
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay.

693
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:44.160
Mary Kastner: We do have some newer ones. One is called Trento x or Brent deluxe

694
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:58.230
Mary Kastner: That's one, we might want to try it generic. It's called world war two oxetane I don't have a problem with giving you the benzodiazepines, but you have to know they're addicting and

695
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:03.240
Mary Kastner: As you get older. It's not something you want to be on

696
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:04.680
Mary Kastner: Because

697
00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.680
Mary Kastner: My chronic use can cause memory issues.

698
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.760
Iliana: I gotcha.

699
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:18.000
Iliana: My dad actually got diagnosed when I was born with chronic fatigue syndrome. They called it, where he got like claustrophobic couldn't even walk down the hallway, stuff like that.

700
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:28.080
Iliana: And since then, he had to see like tons of doctors but they finally found out what it was called. And he's been on kalana pin and cynical on my entire life. So

701
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:31.710
Mary Kastner: 37 o'clock is a good one.

702
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:37.260
Iliana: Yeah, he says that they've helped him. Amazingly, and like, like I was saying, the

703
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.210
Iliana: Xanax didn't help me.

704
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:48.690
Iliana: I mean, it helps when it was more of like a quick band aid the colon up and I noticed. Like, even when I couldn't feel it. I could tell that it was still like working into the next day.

705
00:53:48.840 --> 00:54:00.510
Iliana: I wouldn't have. I'm glad you like that better Xanax is more of a street drug. It's a quick fix, and it's gone. Exactly. People want more and more because of that Klonopin is

706
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:11.610
Mary Kastner: Longer acting and it's delayed. It doesn't act right away. But both of those are bandaids you want you actually want to treat the anxiety with the treatment.

707
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:19.890
Mary Kastner: And that's why we look at these other medications and then you have the band aid, you know, for when you have the panic in the grocery store or whatnot.

708
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:21.900
Mary Kastner: So,

709
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.360
Iliana: I'm afraid with those is like

710
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.410
Iliana: One sex drive and then number two would be like

711
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.430
Iliana: If I skip

712
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.110
Iliana: A day or though this isn't going to be

713
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.490
Mary Kastner: Worse than

714
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.050
Iliana: That and the colonic pen even

715
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:36.990
Mary Kastner: Yeah, no. Typically not. But

716
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:53.130
Mary Kastner: One of the things that they use that similar to the cynic. One is effects or which or Cymbalta effects or can do that. You are you if you skip a day you don't feel so hot, so

717
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:58.950
Mary Kastner: Cymbalta is used actually for people with chronic pain and

718
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:06.420
Mary Kastner: I know that it's, you know, on paper effects are is probably the

719
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.750
Mary Kastner: Winner of the sex drive problems. I haven't seen it clinically

720
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:19.020
Mary Kastner: Cymbalta is a cousin, so I'm not, I'm not telling you that it's not going to happen, but

721
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:31.920
Mary Kastner: If it does, we can we can give you things for that. But these are just things to think about, do you typically just get four hours asleep or do you do. Can you get longer

722
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:40.110
Iliana: I'm timing to worse. I can get longer, but I do like what was it called the visceral, stuff like that.

723
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.430
Iliana: Like my whole life. I've got

724
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.020
Iliana: Every single sleep at you.

725
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.340
Iliana: You can try.

726
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:53.160
Iliana: The best one I've ever found that it doesn't work. But it kind of helps would be Lunesta over the counter, but

727
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.190
Iliana: It's definitely not a fix all at all.

728
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:57.300
Okay.

729
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.300
Mary Kastner: He said, I can't, you can't

730
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.030
Mary Kastner: Can't get comfortable because you have pain or did you have this insomnia prior to the accident.

731
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:08.310
Iliana: No, I've had, insomnia, my whole life. I think

732
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:16.380
Iliana: That stems from my anxiety as soon as I hit the pillow my head. No matter how tired I am just starts thinking about today, tomorrow.

733
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:26.880
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and that's another reason to get on one of these other meds because it can help with that obsessional thinking it's sort of like a record player that keeps going. And it'll keep you awake.

734
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.860
Mary Kastner: So any other symptoms like

735
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:38.250
Mary Kastner: manic symptoms, where you're talking too fast. Your thoughts are crowded.

736
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.590
Iliana: You feel like driving me

737
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:45.480
Mary Kastner: In do anything you're on top of the world. Nothing can touch you.

738
00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.810
Mary Kastner: Don't have being hyper sexual

739
00:56:49.590 --> 00:57:05.370
Iliana: No, not like that. I just, it's I get panic attacks sometimes like that. I can't keep my train of thought and I've always had issues like even in school, my whole life. I couldn't pay attention to still for more than a short period of time.

740
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:07.680
Mary Kastner: My

741
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:09.690
Mary Kastner: Happens when you get a panic attack.

742
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:18.480
Iliana: When I get a panic attack it fills basically kind of like my heart. They're gonna collapse in on itself and I just get really

743
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.740
Iliana: Worried sweaty.

744
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:25.860
Iliana: Have a hard time like even doing anything I can't be out in public.

745
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:43.230
Iliana: Like in anywhere I go with anybody. I always drive my own car. Because of this, and I just kind of retreat at home is the only place where I feel safe completely except for like when I go to bed and stuff like that. And then it starts to kick in and make me start worrying.

746
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.250
Mary Kastner: Did any of those manic symptoms ring a bell with you.

747
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:48.570
I'm

748
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.920
Iliana: A little I don't ever feel like I'm overly

749
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.080
Iliana: Like feeling good, but

750
00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:57.360
Iliana: I definitely do have days where

751
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:58.830
Iliana: I'm

752
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.610
Mary Kastner: I

753
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:03.390
Iliana: I'm worse off than other days or even throughout the same day.

754
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:06.960
Iliana: But I wouldn't say ever feel overly good

755
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.390
Mary Kastner: Okay.

756
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:18.930
Iliana: But it does happen fast like I'll switch back from like anxiety back to normal pretty fast, but I don't really go

757
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.480
Iliana: above normal in my feelings, if that makes sense.

758
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:27.810
Mary Kastner: Okay, and never having these pressured thoughts or or fast speech or

759
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.250
Mary Kastner: Grandiose filters.

760
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:37.800
Iliana: Fast beach, yes I do talk really, really fast and I don't listen to everything. People say, I pick and choose words out of it. And then I

761
00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:45.030
Mary Kastner: Kind of, it's more of an attention issue. Yeah, never spend money, you don't have or become hyper sexual

762
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:46.890
Mary Kastner: Okay.

763
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:47.640
Um,

764
00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.580
Iliana: I feel like I kind of just am

765
00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:54.960
Mary Kastner: I lost. I lost your video.

766
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.870
Mary Kastner: You're back on no video. I don't know what happened.

767
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:11.790
Iliana: Oh, there it is.

768
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.760
Mary Kastner: Okay. Have you ever felt

769
00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:20.400
Mary Kastner: Like you've lost weight without trying

770
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:24.660
Iliana: Right now even yeah I've been down

771
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:30.780
Iliana: To 152 pounds. I'm five foot 10 my normal weight would be about 175

772
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.300
Iliana: But yeah, I've been 152

773
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:36.390
Iliana: Just looking sick before. How much do you weigh now.

774
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.500
Iliana: Right now.

775
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:50.670
Iliana: I'm about 170 right now. That was like as bad as it's been, but, um, no I'm not well at all. I have zero appetite today. I haven't had breakfast and I'm not even hungry.

776
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:57.150
Iliana: Yesterday, I just had a pop tart. I know I need these. So I'm going to try to force myself soon.

777
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:59.460
Iliana: But yeah, it's just

778
00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:00.450
Okay, it's hard.

779
01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:07.920
Mary Kastner: That's the other issue is that we have no chemicals that

780
01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:13.680
Mary Kastner: maintainer mood focusing on

781
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:29.040
Mary Kastner: So if you're not getting enough protein not getting a good diet, then you don't have these neural chemicals in your brain that helps regulate all this so diet is important, but you have never lost weight intentionally

782
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.850
Mary Kastner: Like purging or vomiting or anything like that.

783
01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:34.770
Iliana: No, I never yeah

784
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:35.850
Yeah.

785
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.690
Mary Kastner: Okay, or or overeating.

786
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.740
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay. In any history of any kind of psychosis.

787
01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.120
Mary Kastner: We

788
01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.140
Mary Kastner: Think yours.

789
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:55.170
Mary Kastner: You're paranoid, or you have special powers or people can read you.

790
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.450
Iliana: Know, see things or

791
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.790
Iliana: Things like that. I do my whole

792
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:08.580
Iliana: Family. So with weight gain and I was heavier in high school and I'm afraid to get heavy again. So I think I tried to limit myself from

793
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:21.870
Iliana: overeating. When I am eating well, because I do go through spells of where I'll eat better than I am right now. Right now has been particularly bad. And I think it's because of the whole maybe Suboxone even or that whole thing happening on me.

794
01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:31.650
Iliana: But yeah, I've been heavy before I've just since I lost all the weight. I'm like, super afraid to get back there, but I don't make myself throw up or anything. I just

795
01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.510
Iliana: Okay, yeah.

796
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:43.980
Mary Kastner: Okay do. Okay, so I'm gonna, I'm in the same bind as I was before. So if you could just hang tight them until this next person to just wait a little bit. Okay.

797
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:45.060
Iliana: Yeah, no problem.

798
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:46.350
Mary Kastner: And I'll come right back to

799
01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:47.250
Iliana: Like you

Mary Kastner: Um, so

Mary Kastner: As far as your where you were born and raised. Where was that

809
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:52.050
Iliana: That was all in California. I was born in upwind and then since I was three. I was raised in the same house in Victorville

810
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:54.960
Mary Kastner: In Vicar Victorville

Mary Kastner: Victorville, California. Yeah.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.040
Mary Kastner: To finish high school there.

814
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:00.930
Iliana: Oh yeah, actually.

815
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:01.800
Mary Kastner: Okay.

816
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:07.560
Iliana: Well, I had attention issues. So after 10th grade I ended up having to get homeschooled but

817
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.800
Iliana: Yeah, I ended up graduating up here.

818
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:12.630
Mary Kastner: Okay, and

819
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.320
Iliana: Then I moved over to APPLE VALLEY, which is where I live now with my fiance.

820
01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:19.560
Mary Kastner: Okay. And then what kind of work have you done

821
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.860
Iliana: I do heating and air conditioning work. I have a career in that

822
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.910
Mary Kastner: Okay, do you have, are you in a Union there.

823
01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:34.350
Iliana: Oh no, actually, I'm starting my own business right now and I've worked for my dad, buddy. Since I was 17

824
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:38.970
Iliana: And he's actually moving out the Tennessee. So I'm gonna take over his business and add

825
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.180
That

826
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:44.190
Mary Kastner: For. So do you have a certificate in each factor. Yeah.

827
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.020
Iliana: I've got my 20 contractor.

828
01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.310
Mary Kastner: That's fantastic. Um, any medical issues right now.

829
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.980
Iliana: But five from the back pain.

830
01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:55.440
Iliana: And anxiety know

831
01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.680
Mary Kastner: Hey, are you allergic to any medicines or

832
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.520
Mary Kastner: No allergies of the environment or food. Okay.

833
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.220
Iliana: I do have an Environmental Allergies

834
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.450
Mary Kastner: Okay, what

835
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:17.130
Iliana: Cat pollen like whole spring season. My nose is pretty much plug in anytime I go into a customer's house and they have kept like he is easy stuff like that.

836
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.680
Mary Kastner: Oh my God, yeah, I'm right now today. Are you feeling depressed or anxious

837
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:24.960
Iliana: Anxious. Yes.

838
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:29.910
Mary Kastner: 2010 being the most anxious you been, where would you put it

839
01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.420
Iliana: I'm right now, I'd say about a

840
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.020
Iliana: Year. Okay. Okay.

841
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:47.130
Mary Kastner: And so as far as mental status. Everything is normal and mood is anxious and Africa is congruent.

842
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:55.590
Mary Kastner: And any thoughts of hurting yourself in your history or or actually made an attempt

843
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.610
Iliana: No.

844
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:05.040
Mary Kastner: Okay suicide risk assessment is low. So I'm diagnoses. Um, I would put you as panic disorder.

845
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:13.800
Mary Kastner: And chronic pain syndrome and

846
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.230
Mary Kastner: Probably a generalized anxiety disorder.

847
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:24.690
Mary Kastner: I want you to think about some options. If you want to look them up.

848
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:31.320
Mary Kastner: We could put you on something like your dad's on like the syrup center Kwan get you sleeping.

849
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.720
Mary Kastner: And then I'll give you some Klonopin

850
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.870
Iliana: I've never

851
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:51.930
Iliana: Been a Quan I definitely do have issues with sleep, that's an option. Definitely worth maybe exploring because I don't know how it would work for me since it's worked for him might be worth a shot.

852
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.110
Mary Kastner: Okay, I'll

853
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:56.760
Mary Kastner: Give you

854
01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.230
Mary Kastner: A prescription for that. And then the Klonopin and then what I would like to

855
01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.780
Mary Kastner: Suggest is something like blue sparks and anti anxiety.

856
01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:18.660
Mary Kastner: Medicine that you take three times a day, it is working on the same neurochemical so Klonopin I'm

857
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.260
Iliana: Not injecting a boost bar key.

858
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.690
Iliana: Who spark. Do I can do eat it.

859
01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:25.470
Iliana: Yeah.

860
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.340
And people

861
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:38.700
Mary Kastner: Know it's a tablet three times a day boosts Barone, and it's it's really weird because people don't know it's doing anything and then they stop it and they go, oh my god, I

862
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.530
Iliana: Was doing something, how cool it.

863
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.740
Iliana: Was for me when I was on it last time.

864
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:51.870
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and you just so you know when you take a benzodiazepine with respect or with the Suboxone

865
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:55.290
Mary Kastner: You just, um,

866
01:06:56.670 --> 01:07:00.180
Mary Kastner: You take a risk. The known deaths that we have from

867
01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:05.610
Mary Kastner: Suboxone or people that are taking a benzodiazepine with it.

868
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.930
Iliana: I probably will slow down the Suboxone once I'm on the

869
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:15.480
Iliana: colonic, then I think the reason I'm probably still taking a little as much as I am is

870
01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:17.730
Iliana: Because of

871
01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.560
Iliana: Sleep and hoping that it'll help me with anxiety and stuff like that, because I don't really have anything else right now.

872
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:24.150
Iliana: Yeah.

873
01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:27.120
Mary Kastner: And you're going to Queens pharmacy on Highway 18

874
01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:36.330
Mary Kastner: Yeah. OK. OK. And I'm going to order the cynic one, but I want to see you in group Monday night.

875
01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.270
Mary Kastner: She Monday afternoons at four, four

876
01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:55.080
Mary Kastner: If you call in about 345 they will put you tell you what room to get in and then in about two weeks and then we can decide if we want to add the boost bar.

877
01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.810
Iliana: Okay, so just like fill in on a random Monday night still keep going to my normal group.

878
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:08.580
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I'm, I'm not always in this group, but I'm gonna be there on the eighth. So make sure you come back.

879
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:09.420
Mary Kastner: To

880
01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.350
Iliana: That for okay

881
01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:14.160
Iliana: The other thing I've always had high tolerance is that

882
01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.680
Iliana: Every you can tell me how you like these two enough

883
01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.530
Iliana: Okay, yeah, I'll try that. I was what I was saying is, I've always had a high tolerance to

884
01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:26.400
Iliana: Everything anybody's ever given me. It's, it's weird.

885
01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:34.140
Mary Kastner: I'll get this sent a question for you. Now, too. But at that point, maybe we can add the spark.

886
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:35.550
Iliana: Okay.

887
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.130
Iliana: Emily Graham is the colonic

888
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.560
Mary Kastner: A half milligrams

889
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:43.140
Iliana: I have

890
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.680
Mary Kastner: I was on

891
01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:53.820
Mary Kastner: One, you can take up to two a day. Only if you're having panic. Some, yeah. Only if you're having panic. Yeah, well,

892
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.940
Iliana: If, if it doesn't work, take, take another one. I gotcha. That was on one and a half before

893
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:03.120
Iliana: Up to two, but they had me on one and a half a day.

894
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:07.230
Iliana: Working. But yeah, I'll, I'll give it a shot.

895
01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:08.910
For sure.

896
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.410
Mary Kastner: Wow.

897
01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.100
Mary Kastner: Yeah, we can always fix it.

898
01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:18.030
Iliana: Okay, okay.

899
01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:21.660
Mary Kastner: With the doc center the center Kwan maybe you're not going to need it.

900
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:23.370
Iliana: Because you'll get your sleep.

901
01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.220
Iliana: That's what I'm hoping. So I'll try it like this. First

902
01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:29.700
Mary Kastner: Okay, and

903
01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.390

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.420
Iliana: Yeah, okay.

906
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.950
Mary Kastner: Don't take the Klonopin for sleep, you have this

907
01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:48.030
Iliana: Yeah, no.

908
01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:51.870

933
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:54.480
Sara Floyd: And a low dose of value as needed and Adderall and the value made me I don't value was fine. I do have a panic attacks that will be featured. Maybe suicidal. It was horrible. And I always forgot to take natural so

934
01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:01.110
Sara Floyd: I'm not sure. I don't know if I need to start an SSRI if I'm just like situationally depressed, but

935
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:07.440
Sara Floyd: I know I always do that too. Like I always start arguing that I don't need medication and I probably do because it's been

936
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:18.570
Sara Floyd: Almost 40 years at this insanity. So I'm in these patterns and like ups and downs like i don't know i i do have a lot of situational things going on in my life that are depressing.

937
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:22.650
Sara Floyd: But yeah, my

938
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:34.980
Sara Floyd: My anxiety is crippling and holding me back from things and I do have ADHD, for sure. And I'm depressed, but I'm depressed. My, my mom took my daughter by parental rights at severed

939
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:42.270
Sara Floyd: About eight months ago I got the ruling for that I had a really traumatic horrific court date.

940
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:43.710
Sara Floyd: A year ago.

941
01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.890
Sara Floyd: I ran away as 15 i mean

942
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:59.760
Sara Floyd: My entire life, which is insane traumatic experience and it just keeps going. I can't seem to break out of the patterns and figure out what to do. And I've never really tried medication, except for like last November.

943
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.600
Sara Floyd: And I guess I started the medication and it was only honor for about

944
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:11.760
Sara Floyd: Two or three months or something and then I moved back here to California and that was in Baltimore. So I saw Dr. Christopher Welsh there.

945
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:18.480
Sara Floyd: Yeah, I don't know, I'm not sure I guess just wanted me to call you and try to hash this out.

946
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:20.700
Sara Floyd: So I don't

947
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.750
Sara Floyd: I'm not sure what to tell you, or what's not.

948
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:33.990
Mary Kastner: Okay, so we'll just open a record for psychiatric purposes, and we'll get your history and no problem.

949
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:35.100
Mary Kastner: We'll figure this out.

950
01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:36.540
Sara Floyd: Great.

951
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:47.580
Mary Kastner: I think it's interesting that you got suicide on the Wellbutrin

952
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:49.800
Mary Kastner: It was awful. I got like

953
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:57.720
Mary Kastner: an antidepressant. Yeah, yeah. So let's put that down as an adverse

954
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:02.460
Mary Kastner: Reaction in your record. So we don't do that again.

955
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.710
Sara Floyd: Right. Yeah. It was awful.

956
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:06.540
Sara Floyd: I think that we have

957
01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:09.570
Sara Floyd: Several days to get to. And that's my bad.

958
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.520

960
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.860
Sara Floyd: I mean, I was already suicidal. To begin with, and I

961
01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.140
Mary Kastner: Just got a core, you have a history of teen

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:23.880

1041
01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:15.030
Sara Floyd: Um, no, I realized

1042
01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:22.200
Sara Floyd: I think I took a bunch of pills that weren't any like they might have been as a surprise to

1043
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.220
Sara Floyd: You. I don't remember what it was.

Mary Kastner: Okay, and what is your typical night's sleep.

1050
01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:48.960

1051
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:52.800
Sara Floyd: sleep for four to six hours.

1052
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:57.360
Mary Kastner: Okay, how long does it take you to get to sleep. Once you're in bed trying to sleep.

1053
01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:01.560
Sara Floyd: Usually a while because I have such bad anxiety. I can't stop.

1054
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:06.150
Mary Kastner: Moving or thinking what you're talking about hours or what

1055
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.550
Sara Floyd: Yeah that's it could be hours. It really varies. Sometimes my body gets the point across.

1056
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:13.350
Sara Floyd: But

1057
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:17.130
Mary Kastner: Okay. Do you ever have thoughts, you know, that are just kind of

1058
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.550
Mary Kastner: Racing and so and so pressured, you know, you just have too many thoughts.

1059
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:26.760
Sara Floyd: Yes, and I started out of

1060
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:34.860
Sara Floyd: The things that I think they're called intrusive thoughts, but I don't know because I'd never heard anybody describe it, but it like looks like a movie and it would be

1061
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:44.730
Sara Floyd: Like my suicide or something. But I would see myself dead wherever I was like what the scenery of wherever I was in the world. It's really scary. Like, it was a Baltimore, I saw myself.

1062
01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:52.770
Sara Floyd: throw myself in front of a train. I was in Joshua tree in the desert. I saw my bleeding body in the in the desert say it was, it's really crazy

1063
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:59.610
Sara Floyd: Beat It looks like a movie and I'm not like thinking anything about happened and just flashes in my head. And I'm like holy shit, then they get really depressed about it.

1064
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:06.300
Sara Floyd: And it's really, um, it's interesting to me. So that's why I thought those were intrusive thoughts. I don't know.

1065
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:15.030
Mary Kastner: They certainly are. They certainly are. Have you ever been on a mood stabilizer like lithium diving Pro X or Lamictal.

1066
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.460
Sara Floyd: Know, my friend.

1067
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.410
Sara Floyd: My friend recommended to me.

1068
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:25.140
Sara Floyd: And of course I'm not depressed, but I have heard about what for sure.

1069
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:33.510
Mary Kastner: Yeah, why wouldn't recommend that as a first one because it can cause some skin issues, until we get your skin kind of straighten out

1070
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:44.250
Mary Kastner: Lithium is an age old mood stabilizers. We started using in the 50s, so that what would be an idea. The other one is the two de you ever heard of that.

1071
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:47.190
Mary Kastner: The two de

1072

1109
01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.490
Mary Kastner: You know Valium is a minor tranquilizer.

1110
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:50.430
Sara Floyd: All right here.

1111
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.640
Mary Kastner: So you think it's your

1112
01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.310

1119
01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:22.950
Mary Kastner: Gallium is very long acting. I wouldn't recommend you continue with that. Are you on any medicine right now.

1120
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.140
Sara Floyd: It's good. So

01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:00.600
Mary Kastner: Okay, here we go.

01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:12.600
Mary Kastner: Okay. Is that better.

1129
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:14.610

Mary Kastner: Yes, I can hear you. Yes.

1134
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.780
Sara Floyd: Finally, sorry. Yeah. What's going on the Internet.

1135
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.610
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Can you hear me.

1136
01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:30.990
Sara Floyd: I can't, you're not

1137
01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.060
Mary Kastner: You were taught. Okay. Okay.

1138
01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:40.080
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so I would you know I wouldn't recommend value is too long acting in it.

1139
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:48.000
Mary Kastner: Kind of gets stored in your body and pops out when we don't know about it and I just don't like using it.

1140
01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:56.910
Mary Kastner: I would recommend instead of a minor tranquilizer like Valium that we would use a major tranquilizer. They are not addicting.

1141
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:09.960
Mary Kastner: And it would help you sleep. It would help this pressure thinking that you can get with these crowded thoughts and some of your fast speech and your intrusive.

1142
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:18.930
Mary Kastner: intrusive thoughts. So let's start some lead to de I think you probably have a bipolar disorder.

1143
01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:21.150
Mary Kastner: Has anybody ever told you that

1144
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:22.980
Mary Kastner: No. Okay.

1145
01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:24.840
Mary Kastner: With

1146
01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.150
Mary Kastner: You know, depression,

1147
01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:32.100
Mary Kastner: And oftentimes, of course, people treat the depression and they don't treat

1148
01:26:32.130 --> 01:26:35.520
Mary Kastner: They don't see it as a part of a bipolar disorder and then

1149
01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:35.850
Sara Floyd: Right.

1150
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.650
Mary Kastner: It doesn't work, you know,

1151
01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.310
Mary Kastner: Are you eating well

1152
01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:45.360
Sara Floyd: I am now. Yeah, I get the periods where I'm not, but I every no

1153
01:26:45.810 --> 01:26:49.590
Mary Kastner: Okay so well I mean three three meals a day.

1154
01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:54.300
Sara Floyd: And no, I don't do that easily. I mean, sometimes, but

1155
01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:56.280
Sara Floyd: No, I

1156
01:26:56.730 --> 01:27:00.270
Sara Floyd: For twice a day. Usually, but it's been about twice a day for the last week.

1157
01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:01.710
Okay.

1158
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.380
Mary Kastner: And are you eating proteins.

1159
01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.120
Sara Floyd: Yes.

1160
01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:18.630
Mary Kastner: Okay. The reason why I'm asking is, we want to watch your lipid level or your, you know, the fat and you food and we

1161
01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:24.120
Mary Kastner: Want to make sure you're getting enough protein because protein, of course, breaks down to

1162
01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:30.510
Mary Kastner: Amino acids which break down to the neural chemicals needed to keep your mood stable and help you sleep.

1163
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:44.010
Mary Kastner: Okay, so we can give you all the medicine in the world. But if you're not eating right and you don't make attempts to structure your day so that you, you know, get to sleep, get in bed.

1164
01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:53.700
Mary Kastner: And have a dark room, not a lot of noise, you know, in kind of structure and help your sleep hygiene. We can't help medicine.

1165
01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.200
Mary Kastner: And help those things.

1166
01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:56.550
Okay.

1167
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.680
Mary Kastner: So we're going to start you at 20 mil

1168
01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:09.840
