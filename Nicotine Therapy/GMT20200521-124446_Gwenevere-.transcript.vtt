00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Gabriel, Laura.

2
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.420
Gabriel L.: Good morning.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.290
And

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we got you in the car and

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. It's been a month about. So I want to review your goals, a little bit with you. But is there anything kind of going on like right now in your life, but

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.150
Gabriel L.: Um, I have the in laws and so it's kind of

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Creating

9
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's annoying.

10
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.550
Annoying

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.880
Gabriel L.: I'm so used to just being just my immediate family, you know,

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.960
Gabriel L.: Anything around

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I was, I was just updating notes and I saw a little notation about your aunt Teresa. Is she okay

14
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.510
Gabriel L.: Oh yeah, she she recovered.

15
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's great.

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.480
Um,

17
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.400
Gabriel L.: Luckily, nobody else had gotten a virus.

18
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.410
Gabriel L.: That her household

19
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.470
Gabriel L.: So they didn't even know

20
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.840
Gabriel L.: Yeah, even though we were all congregating at the funeral. We didn't nobody else got it so it worked out.

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe she she may have gotten its kind of somewhere else, maybe

22
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, maybe not. Yeah, that's a real possibility. I'm in, plus it has to, it has to have enough of of a viral load. You know what I mean it's not

23
00:01:47.550 --> 00:02:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Brush across something we're going to get it. It's got to sort of meet that threshold and I don't know what it is, but I mean I'm sure we bumped into it and we may just not have had enough for it to really take a hold

24
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I figure. Everybody's going to get it eventually

25
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.040
Gabriel L.: Yeah, I agree. Like, man, I hear one thing and then another and then

26
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I don't see how we don't all get it eventually. I just want all hospitals to have everything before I get it.

27
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.090
Gabriel L.: You know,

28
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I want there to be just a ton of respirators available.

29
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.700
Gabriel L.: Then people are saying that the respirators that killing people and

30
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute.

31
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.090
Yeah.

32
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.660
I heard

33
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.460
Gabriel L.: Somewhere that

34
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Seriously, that's just, that's why.

35
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm going to just assume that intro, because that's just terrifying.

36
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So, all right. So you got some irritation, how long your in laws going to be staying with you.

37
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.080
Until

38
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, oh next Thursday.

39
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.200
Gabriel L.: Or I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Tuesday. Tuesday. Tuesday. Okay. Okay.

40
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because today's Thursday, you still have another week to go

41
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.210
Gabriel L.: I know

42
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We haven't really had a chance to continue that that a couple of things. One, I want to review the goals with us we'll run through that first. Just a real quick statement, how you assess how you're doing.

43
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Also want to revisit we had started to develop this anchor room. I want to come all the way through that, if we can, if not that's okay and then check and see how you and Ashley are doing. And then, of course, if we have time.

44
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, going back to nursing school is on your mind a lot. Sure, wondering if it's starting to come to the forefront there.

45
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.910
Gabriel L.: Yeah, go ahead. A reminder. I'm saying that I started nursing school around this time last year.

46
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

47
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, nice to Facebook or something had to get a reminder

48
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.900
Gabriel L.: My well I got a picture my cell phone or my, like, like, oh, remember this memory like Apple photos of that.

49
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.010
Gabriel L.: Yeah, there was a

50
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.910
Gabriel L.: picture of me in Dallas. And that was Texas.

51
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.800
Gabriel L.: And that was the last

52
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.480
Gabriel L.: That was the last account I worked with a company I worked for

53
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.460
Gabriel L.: Before going into nursing school

54
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To make you think about

55
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.790
Gabriel L.: The mistakes I've made and how to overcome them, and

56
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.770
Gabriel L.: A number of things.

57
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright doesn't sound like it made you think I want to go back to school.

58
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.380
Gabriel L.: Oh yeah, well that too. But I don't know how they're handling it because all summer classes are done online. And then last time and six classes.

59
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.680
Gabriel L.: None of the student got credit for

60
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.960
Gabriel L.: Because there was no issue with a short semester so

61
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.230
Gabriel L.: It was a short semester so

62
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.880
Gabriel L.: What guys to get the email and they got them the students got their money refunded and

63
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.980
Gabriel L.: It was just cancelled.

64
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.910
Yeah.

65
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.150
Gabriel L.: Because it's a lot of work.

66
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.240
Gabriel L.: To be at the hospital and

67
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I know, I know people that are in

68
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what level you are at. But, um, I know people that are in a nursing program in this program. So they're talking to me and they're doing it all online.

69
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.730
Gabriel L.: Okay.

70
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just happens to be a coincidence. I happen to know that. But obviously, any more details than that.

71
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so. But what I'm hearing is, I didn't hear you say you know what, I'm it may be think I'm going to make a call and get my information. So it sounds like it's still way in the background. It's still not quite up here doesn't sound like you're like, I'm gonna go back

72
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.460
Gabriel L.: Yeah yeah

73
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.870
Gabriel L.: I do

74
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's just touch base on some other things I want to learn. This is your role, I want to eliminate my addiction to drugs and alcohol. So I didn't know I saw

75
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me if this is true, I saw in the medication area that as of about 515 may 15 you are prescribed 11 milligrams, are you taking 11 milligrams of Suboxone these days.

76
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.060
Gabriel L.: Yeah, yeah, I just took it a little while ago.

77
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh cool, and any drinking, which means any alcohol sips of beers count.

78
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.520
Gabriel L.: I've been having like

79
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.960
Gabriel L.: I haven't drinking like once a week.

80
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.790
Gabriel L.: Doing it

81
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.910
Gabriel L.: Like a few beers two or three

82
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So most people they minimize when they say a few when they say three, it's more like a six pack. Are you drinking a whole six pack when you're drinking

83
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.220
Whoa.

84
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.400
Gabriel L.: Whoa, whoa. Six Pack, it's like three but they're pints. They like the big

85
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.390
Gabriel L.: Like they come in a pack of four. So it's a

86
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.780
Gabriel L.: It's a 16 ounce instead of a 12 ounce can

87
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

88
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.170
Gabriel L.: I guess the local it's a local brewery that

89
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.220
Produces a

90
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.340
Gabriel L.: Good beer and I'll have a little Tito's vodka shot sometimes. Okay.

91
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.970
So,

92
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're in a you're in a in a relapse right now.

93
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.600
Gabriel L.: And

94
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.960
Gabriel L.: I used to like last weekend.

95
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay, would you end up doing.

96
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:51.780
Gabriel L.: I went for some reason, when I tried something I did something I'm excited about the last time I left before this, but I did some

97
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.210
Gabriel L.: Some prescription pills.

98
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.870
Gabriel L.: And

99
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.140
Gabriel L.: I went fishing with my family and I bought a few

100
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.870
Gabriel L.: I bought five, to be exact. I know that you like exact numbers about

101
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.370
Gabriel L.: Five 520 milligrams 20 milligrams to little, little gray ones because that's all that was available.

102
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.630
Gabriel L.: Which ends up being 2466 800 milligrams

103
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.420
Gabriel L.: And the wall that day.

104
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That day

105
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.230
Gabriel L.: Yeah yeah

106
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.060
Gabriel L.: Definitely

107
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That was let me see. Was that on 16th like this last Saturday.

108
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.740
Gabriel L.: Last Saturday.

109
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what I heard you say is when I get excited about something and then you kind of didn't finish that thought trailed off to I went fishing with my family.

110
00:08:53.790 --> 00:09:05.820
Gabriel L.: Well, because the last, the last time I use wasn't Chris during Christmas, Christmas tree Christmas was there was the last time I use which last Christmas almost a year.

111
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.140
Gabriel L.: Yeah. This past this past Christmas.

112
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you're saying is I

113
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I start to think about. I'm going to have fun. And then what's the next thought after that.

114
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.400
Gabriel L.: I don't know, but not

115
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:44.400
Gabriel L.: The what happened that actually has an uncle that sells them. And every time it gets time he calls me or lets me know that he has them.

116
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:48.240
Gabriel L.: And

117
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.550
Gabriel L.: Even though I tell them no. You still calls me

118
00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:05.340
Gabriel L.: And this time, he called it was like, I'm going fishing, there might as well just grab some up and it's on the way that I'm trying passes out when we, when we got them because it was all the way to the fishing area.

119
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you feel after you turn to the five

120
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.700
Gabriel L.: Well, I thought great at first, but, you know, the next day I had a headache.

121
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:31.080
Gabriel L.: I took my medication as prescribed. But I still went to look for more

122
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.660
Gabriel L.: But there wasn't any more.

123
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.640
Gabriel L.: Do gone

124
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: He went to lunch.

125
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.890
Gabriel L.: With her uncle's house, get some more.

126
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you went to

127
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Us and

128
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:51.570
Gabriel L.: That's how it happened like edge, it gets you the world for me, it gets me right away and then I start using again.

129
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

130
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If your uncle hadn't run out.

131
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.710
Gabriel L.: Probably got some

132
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm just want to understand one more piece of this, I'm on Saturday morning.

133
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Had you taken the strip

134
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.580
Gabriel L.: I can't remember if I want to say yes.

135
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.460
Gabriel L.: But I don't remember if it was before. After

136
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:36.210
Gabriel L.: Because I remember telling myself or if I give more and I take my bed, then it's not going to do anything.

137
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.450
Gabriel L.: Before and advisors, the box and on the street. Everyone that uses them know that

138
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.720
Gabriel L.: You can't do a pill because it won't do anything because

139
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. But you told me that you felt great. So I'm wondering if

140
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.250
Gabriel L.: That's not the case when I

141
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.230
Gabriel L.: When I did it.

142
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you said, I felt great. At first, then had a headache.

143
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.430
Gabriel L.: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I saw great apres but then I felt remorse guild.

144
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.130
Gabriel L.: You know months of sobriety that

145
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.470
Gabriel L.: My family was

146
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You told Ashley.

147
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.210
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

148
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so, just notice how it took me bringing it up. Was there a chance you were going to sort of skip that today and not share if I hadn't been kind of direct about it.

149
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.320
Gabriel L.: No, I felt like someone

150
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.600
Gabriel L.: I wanted to tell someone

151
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.280
Gabriel L.: I felt like I needed to get it off my chest.

152
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, wonder, would it have what would have happened if I hadn't asked you directly. I wonder if time would it past

153
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Curious, we'll never know.

154
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

155
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.310
Gabriel L.: Then my brother's here like

156
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.880
Gabriel L.: Like he's asking me, and I'm like,

157
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

158
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

159
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, this is your first treatment. And so these things that sometimes I take for granted. People already know these pieces but very first thing right out the gate is changing people, places and things and what hasn't quite changed is the people part. Notice how

160
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Ashley's

161
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncle

162
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Still has your cell number

163
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Now believe it or not, what many people elect to do and they only know this because they hear me talking. And they're like, Yeah, yeah, whatever. I got enough willpower is how you typically describe it. I don't think it's willpower, but

164
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically that's how people describe it on that and I'll just say no, that's fine. It's fine. I don't want to upset anybody either want to remove anybody's number

165
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is when people really finally get to the point that they need to protect their recovery. I'm going to give you an example of some things that people do.

166
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What they do is they call said on called and they say, I'm taking my recovery. Seriously, I don't want the temptation. I went for it the other day and I feel remorse and guilt.

167
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you delete my number just just maybe for the next six months or so maybe we'll touch base will kind of go through go through Ashley, you know, let's take my number out of there. I don't want to be texted and and and please don't offer it to me.

168
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now do you see the difference between leaving the door open, where he keeps texting and

169
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That leaves the door open and look what happened. He ran the statistics. If I just end it best, the way everybody is. He just, he's doing a blast. He's, he's texting all his customers or whatever.

170
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And there you go. You went for it. You just, it's just a numbers game, which is kind of like tell you, you know, feeling like what you said I was excited about something and he went for it.

171
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.130
Gabriel L.: Yeah. The last time it happened, it happened that same way that but I deleted that guy's number

172
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.450
Gabriel L.: He would just every time you say, I got this. Just letting you know I got this.

173
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So just notice how this one is a little bit more difficult because it's family.

174
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.680
Gabriel L.: Yeah yeah

175
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But your recovery is at the center of everything.

176
00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: There's going to be no I want to, you have a goal. I want to be a better husband, there's no i want to be this father that you're you're proud of all of that stuff. I want to maybe go back to nursing school

177
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I want to maybe I want to relocate, or I want to buy this or do this your recovery is central.

178
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I know all the talking. And you, you'll probably be like a. Yeah, but you won't know it until you really get. And for some people, their, their life starts to kind of fall apart a little bit before they really get what I'm saying is

179
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of think about it like spirituality. Think about how central it is it sort of represents the body, the mind, the spirit. It's like if I'm not taking care of that.

180
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And other things start to compensate

181
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you.

182
00:16:51.600 --> 00:17:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Another piece. So I just talked about an example of people there might be more people like that where you're actually assertive not passive, which means you ignore a text from uncle.

183
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Assertive is you actually call you say can you remove my number I'm working a recovery program. It's just too hard on me. These days, sorry about that man and you did you say cool you say it nice. I'm sure he'd be respectful and

184
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he's family right. Why would. Why would he be nasty.

185
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then that's EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE TAKING YOURSELF SERIOUSLY. The same way you put that interlock on the car. You did that for a reason.

186
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.760
Gabriel L.: But you didn't

187
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't remove his number and you didn't call him and say, please stop putting temptation front of me.

188
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just too hard on me. I'm in early recovery. Right now it's just, it's too much. I need to remove that temptation.

189
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So the places.

190
00:17:51.330 --> 00:18:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't want to go down the same road if there was someone we used always score on a particular corner, you know, it may seem inconvenient. But believe it or not, for a while. We don't want to go down that same

191
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be in that same location. We don't want to be in a bar, we don't want to go to the same all steps that we pick up the beer. Now these are real fundamental things that

192
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I discussed already. Maybe I didn't. Maybe they're going in one ear and out the other. But they do make a big difference. And you'll feel it in real time you'll feel I'm guessing. Yeah, I'm taking myself. Seriously, I actually spoke to these people. And I said, Listen.

193
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I need, I need to take this seriously and this is how just don't don't offer them to me anymore. And you can even say to your uncle. It's killing me to tell you this because a part of me the attic right in me is like, shit, I'm going to cut myself off.

194
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But the part that does it, the authentic self. You

195
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That one, you get to be really proud instead of remorse and guilt. You get to say I'm taking myself. Seriously, this is serious.

196
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right now, you have what's called a reservation. You know how you let's say there's a big fancy restaurant or you're going to go to a seminar and you book it three months in advance.

197
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:12.330
Gabriel L.: Mm.

198
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.050
Hmm.

199
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Relapse relapse is like that too.

200
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's a year in advance, two years.

201
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why that word exists in this field, it's slow. Ah, yeah. A few beers, you started with. And I know because that's how all you guys talk. We had a couple. And then when I press a little harder. No is

202
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: 16 ounces. It was, and then a shot and then and then oh, I also had a slip, you see that is addictive thinking that's the addict inside rationalizing and justifying and saying it's not that big a deal. But, you know, you just told me it's a slippery slope. If there's no one to stop me.

203
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's no constraint, I would have kept going.

204
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If my uncle had had more

205
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Be real. I think that there are things going on in your life.

206
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That are unsettled. I'm guessing that are upsetting you, that are distressing that are getting unaddressed. And that might be why that seems so tempting.

207
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what those things are.

208
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Why why why we

209
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Why we

210
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Why we sleeping in the car, the other day.

211
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.400
Gabriel L.: Oh, cuz I got an argument, and I don't want to continue arguments.

212
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You just separated right going to argue. Yeah.

213
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So the content, not too big a deal just same old maybe her controlling behavior, possibly or

214
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:16.890
Gabriel L.: But now when she says I remember we talked about how she said she changed the lease and we talked about how it's a

215
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:28.020
Gabriel L.: legal document if you can do that. So now whenever she does that, in my face. I thought I look, it's a legal document, you can change because he tried to tell me out because before that would work. She would say, oh, but truthfully.

216
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.320
Gabriel L.: Believe it and

217
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.940
Gabriel L.: Now I tell her that she just doesn't say anything.

218
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.820
Gabriel L.: She's a great woman show by so do whatever

219
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice, Gabriel higher saying everything's fine about 20 seconds ago.

220
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't really fine.

221
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But you had a relapse.

222
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But not that part. I get that part I'm concerned more about the peace.

223
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Lead to it. Is there a forgetting to use mindfulness practices is there. Are you exercising. Are you thinking positive thoughts are you being a spiritual being, what are you doing, or are you just coping.

224
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: With what you just said I i

225
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: She lies and deserted. And I if we don't address these if you don't address what's going on in here.

226
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The potential high risk for another slip is there.

227
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what cert psychotherapy does is we try to see what's really going on underneath that using is the solution.

228
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just think for a second. Let's will pull away from from from the negative piece, but just just for a moment what would be wrong with you going fishing.

229
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just as you

230
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you without any substance.

231
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.060
Gabriel L.: Nothing.

232
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.120
Gabriel L.: Just

233
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:52.380
Gabriel L.: kept bugging me and keeps telling me, and then in the back of my mind because I mean granted I've thought about it, but I haven't really acted on my thoughts just cuz I know I shouldn't. But, you know,

234
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.210
Gabriel L.: Like we talked about before, you know those feelings. I was going to be there.

235
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, they will be a lot less and there'll be a lot less intense

236
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What

237
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just so confused.

238
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you standing up for yourself, are you protecting your recovery with your uncle.

239
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.330
Gabriel L.: I don't even seem that much.

240
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.890
Gabriel L.: I don't see him at all. I haven't seen him in like a year until yesterday.

241
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of that question I just asked

242
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.250
Gabriel L.: I don't know, I can't make sense of it did not really that important to me.

243
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.140
Gabriel L.: Of course,

244
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.560
Gabriel L.: I mean, I don't think

245
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:56.190
Gabriel L.: I don't think he has anything to do with them. I think it was just a circumstance that I did finally gave in to that.

246
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.970
Gabriel L.: To that little voice in my head, but you know

247
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.100
Gabriel L.: They're

248
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.670
Gabriel L.: Passing his house yesterday, just owns the place and this one for

249
00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.210
Gabriel L.: There wasn't really anything leading up

250
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.720
Gabriel L.: One morning I was like, Fuck it, I'm just gonna go

251
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.930
Gabriel L.: My way.

252
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If that were the case, if everyone had that which is the common one.

253
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're helpless. Then there's nothing to do

254
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.570
Gabriel L.: Hmm.

255
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And the rest of your life, you're just sort of the victim of this helpless to circumstance.

256
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay that I don't see you. That way I don't see it quite the same.

257
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see you as helpless.

258
00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I see was very frustrated

259
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: With dynamics, both with

260
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Choices right that you've made, and this relationship that you're in is a challenge for you and I think you're kind of compartmentalizing it. You don't want to talk about it. Don't want to address it, you've already made up your mind you're going to stay

261
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to deal, but there is a consequence Gabriel, it hurts. It hurts.

262
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to pretend like it doesn't. But this is how it shows up.

263
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to just feel good for once.

264
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why changing people

265
00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Helps in other words not having uncle. I have access to you. Let's play this through if uncle hadn't sent that message. We don't know that 20 seconds.

266
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 minutes might have passed and you might have had a different thought you might have had a thought, you know what I want to see if I can enjoy fishing.

267
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to go

268
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But the fact that there was a text there was opportunity.

269
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are already in the thought I could use a. Wouldn't it be nice, or something like that.

270
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And as far as I think you may already be drinking. So you've already sort of said, I'm using anyway. And so that rationale that addictive rationale as well. Fuck it.

271
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Says complicated stuff. Want to remove as many variables as you can.

272
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the worst thing that could happen if you did decide to tell this uncle. Hey, listen, I'm working a recovery. Could you not text me anymore. And if I do ask you, could you say no to me just, just in here just to play with it. Just see

273
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.610
Gabriel L.: I mean, nothing would happen wouldn't be a problem.

274
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think it hasn't already happened.

275
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.580
Gabriel L.: In the past,

276
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And why do you think you haven't already told them.

277
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.340
Gabriel L.: I have I told them. But now, now he messages me through email.

278
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.670
Gabriel L.: Why don't tell them I'm in recovery. I did some Hey man, I've been done in a long time. So,

279
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

280
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think the differences

281
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.130
Gabriel L.: Well, I guess one is more powerful statement.

282
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

283
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This one close the door a little tighter.

284
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.320
Gabriel L.: When locks it

285
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it doesn't lock it because he could still disrespect your request.

286
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:16.080
Gabriel L.: Now he's an older guy I got I got literally just waiting for him to die. I'm gonna die. Not too long ago. But guess

287
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.870
Gabriel L.: What he died.

288
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It will be there'll be another what you're calling is circumstance right you're giving in to serve there'll be another one.

289
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't wait for the outside to make it convenient for us to stop using we have to be intentional about it. And that's what that conversation is is it that hey, well, let's look at it again. Why do you think you haven't told him, Hey, I'm in a recovery program or I'm working my recovery.

290
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:48.750
Gabriel L.: Secrets.

291
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's certainly your choice. But there is a price.

292
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is one of them, because they don't know the door is locked

293
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't know the conviction, you have, and he's gonna die anyway.

294
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You put it

295
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.640
Gabriel L.: doesn't have much time left like

296
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:25.710
Gabriel L.: He got a hip replacement of any kind of get a separate place because he's on dialysis and no one wanted to operate on it because it's so fragile is on an electric wheelchair now and it's a man

297
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you feel about sharing this in in group would you want to do that. Well, you can hear.

298
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.120
Gabriel L.: Other

299
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:48.300
Gabriel L.: I just get so emotional not on the other side of me and when it's cooler here because just, you know, just you and I are here like coming to the car, because I feel like

300
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.060
Gabriel L.: No one ease dropping on me.

301
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.820
Gabriel L.: And I can be a little more honest.

302
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.190
Gabriel L.: You know, maybe up there. I wouldn't have said that I

303
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:57.990
Gabriel L.: Know,

304
00:30:59.370 --> 00:30:59.550
Gabriel L.: I'm

305
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.050
Gabriel L.: Safe ago

306
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good, good.

307
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

308
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I could transport you to a sense of feeling safe, no matter where you are and that you you are in this program, but it's not enough.

309
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To just show up right to an appointment. We've got to actually do the work and the work is changing people, places and things and it's fundamental, we've got to tell people I gotta protect this this is important to me.

310
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm important.

311
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.960
Gabriel L.: Know that the barbershop and

312
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.100
Gabriel L.: Well, this is obviously months ago. The barber shops and close

313
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.000
Yeah.

314
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.840
Gabriel L.: Definitely need a you get to on but the

315
00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:00.120
Gabriel L.: The guy that I used to get from because I I used to sell some of the people there and the guy that I used to get from

316
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:08.250
Gabriel L.: I gave one of the guys there is a number. And he's been trying to stay off of them up for not doing not using

317
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:18.090
Gabriel L.: Any of the got the barber told me that he thinks the other guys things that he's getting from me that I'm selling so so he doesn't even know that I'm in recovery just examine call them.

318
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.650
Gabriel L.: I just thought it'd be nice to run into them and say, Look, man, I just haven't been using. That's why I haven't called

319
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.360
The

320
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really.

321
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's like you said, you want a secret. You do. I think

322
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.120
Gabriel L.: I think I need to explain it a little different.

323
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really simple. If you're not hiding. You say, I'm in recovery. There's no dancing, but you are

324
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.640
Gabriel L.: I mean, I just deleted his number

325
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.500
Gabriel L.: And I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say.

326
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.580
No.

327
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.260
Gabriel L.: Yeah, it doesn't make any. It has nothing to do with what we're talking about it just

328
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:10.800
Gabriel L.: Just a thought that I had that um you know the guy that I used to get from that I completely deleted his number and cut them out of my life. Thanks, that another guy that's getting from him.

329
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:19.650
Gabriel L.: If getting from me. So he doesn't know that I'm finished that I haven't used them he just thinks that I'm not kidding from him.

330
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:20.520
Okay.

331
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay that

332
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This may happen again that this very similar thing may happen again. If you don't make any change because this is typically what this is is all you'll hear me say, oh, this is a great opportunity to see what didn't work so that we can put in place corrective action.

333
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that you really want this sobriety as much as I want it for you.

334
00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:02.790
Gabriel L.: Well, I can tell you with certainty that I've been sober for a long time.

335
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

336
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.500
Gabriel L.: I mean, if I didn't want it. I wouldn't be using them.

337
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.590
Gabriel L.: My health is better my bank account, my savings. Everything is improved by doing that.

338
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're asking me, I have no idea what I'm

339
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.120
Gabriel L.: Saying that you that you know

340
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.780
That

341
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.860
Gabriel L.: You are. You think you know that I don't want this.

342
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.930
Gabriel L.: This

343
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: will shift gears.

344
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

345
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know who you don't sound the same.

346
00:34:50.640 --> 00:35:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound yeah the the kind of justification. It sounds familiar. It sounds like

347
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.110
Gabriel L.: This is what, what am I justify

348
00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your, your use.

349
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.850
Gabriel L.: You what my real life.

350
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:25.140
Gabriel L.: Well, I mean, I'm explaining to you that I feel guilt remorse. I feel like I do a lot of sobriety today. It's not just a fun and acceptance. That's what I would call it.

351
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you willing to do things differently. So it doesn't happen again.

352
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.450
Gabriel L.: I've done things differently.

353
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.040
Gabriel L.: Like, well, you asked me to do is to call him and tell him to stop calling me

354
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just an idea. Yeah.

355
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.810
Gabriel L.: I can do that. Yeah, I could do that. I plan on doing it. I haven't said yes to. It doesn't mean

356
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.690
Gabriel L.: I can just text him and tell him know.

357
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling right now. What's the emotion. I'm

358
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.970
Gabriel L.: Feeling a little irritated because I hear you. And it's like you're saying

359
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want me here. Say it plain and simple. So I can't

360
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.500
Gabriel L.: I said at the beginning, I was, you know, I feel

361
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:13.230
Gabriel L.: That bothers word I used to describe man he laughs I feel that I feel guilty you in just asking me to delete this guy's number

362
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I

363
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.500
Gabriel L.: Know you're asking. You're asking me to call him and tell him.

364
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.140
Gabriel L.: That I'm going to recovery program and

365
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.780
Gabriel L.: I'm embarrassed.

366
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. That's the one. And you just you just got real honest there for a second and and I get that. I really do. I'm

367
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That wasn't an easy thing to get through. I'm proud of you.

368
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And honestly, Gabriel

369
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what the right move is for you you you call someone tell someone texts and when I can't leave your life. I actually don't know what the

370
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Road. I don't know.

371
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to protect you. I want you to protect you.

372
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's just an idea. I'm just giving a philosophy that has worked for many, many, many people

373
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not an easy road, having to actually face the difficult feelings that you're facing on a day to day

374
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard.

375
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So the upside.

376
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Any alcohol today. Any, any

377
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the upside. So back on track right you've had a couple days back on track back on track. Right.

378
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that's it. That was a slip back on track.

379
00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. That's why I prefer to call those slips versus a relapse would be days and days and days and days. In fact, kind of

380
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Pushing me making you know pushing program away. I'll have time for you. This is noisier to push, push, push, push, push, and then you dropped out of the program.

381
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's a pretty predictable pattern, then I'm so irritating because what I do right program pulls out the truth, it pulls out all his honesty.

382
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That most people feel very embarrassing uncomfortable about and they don't want to hear it. Well, the addict part doesn't want to hear it. Right. It's like it's pissing me off, but

383
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The honest man, the one that's meeting this this raw truth. The one that just said right well shit this. I'm just, I'm embarrassed for crying out loud. This is embarrassing. You know that's that's you.

384
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that I have real tenderness for just

385
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

386
00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And at the very same time what the nifty convenient thing about guilt is it gets us back in line. That's all.

387
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Shane won't change is going to knock out and it's going to say, you might as well just continue doing what you're doing you already screwed up shame and mess with you so guilt gets you back in line. It just says, all right, all right, all right, ready. Get it together.

388
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I went off track. I'm back on track. That's it still a good man good person just missed up

389
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And she saw on the front end of today was

390
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to see what steps. And if you decide to take those steps, you don't. I'm definitely not saying go do this. I'm a little bit more passive than that. I was just giving you an example of what changing people in places.

391
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: might look like in your world, but I can't tell you what to do that. That's your life, you're going to do what you're going to do. I don't know what's best for you.

392
00:39:54.630 --> 00:40:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I have ideas that's up to you. Hey, by no means am I saying, Go call or text your own that's not my right. Do you know what I'm trying to say there's a difference. It's

393
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.350
Gabriel L.: It's a mood.

394
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's definitely your, your choice to do that, um,

395
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you spoke with Ashley. Did she present with some compassion. Did you feel supported you feel like okay she gets it. I'm back on track. Are you feeling supported through this

396
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.320
Gabriel L.: A little bit.

397
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.520
Gabriel L.: Green screen scream in your budget, as far as being ruined.

398
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.060
Gabriel L.: I don't really like it.

399
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.830
Gabriel L.: And the next day she says

400
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.630
Gabriel L.: Okay, we're gonna go score killing his words for

401
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.310
Gabriel L.: Me, My uncle.

402
00:40:53.550 --> 00:41:06.330
Gabriel L.: You say you're going to give him money, you have to give me money to like as a determined. She said, I have to give her $100 if I cope. So I just gave it $100 a month and then he wasn't there. And I was like game $100 back and it's like, no.

403
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.670
Gabriel L.: It's kind of funny.

404
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually

405
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.650
Gabriel L.: Yeah, exactly.

406
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.150
Gabriel L.: Yeah.

407
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.760
Gabriel L.: But it's funny because her brother using another

408
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.460
Gabriel L.: Wife gets upset.

409
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.280
Gabriel L.: Same tried eccentric and so he's

410
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:58.410
Gabriel L.: He's wanting to use and you know yesterday wanted to. And he asked me and I've been telling him. No, but she doesn't tell him anything she doesn't need something. Well, maybe she cares about me more than I don't know.

411
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.640
Gabriel L.: But I like I feel good.

412
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

413
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's it's hard for me, right, because I don't want all that temptation around you if you had house, I'd be saying let's flush them.

414
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's walk over to the toilet and flush him I've done that with clients, you know, they

415
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they had been stockpiling stuff and we walk over and it's scary. It's difficult, but I'm there with and we go do it and the commitment that that feels like the conviction of doing that. It can be a pretty powerful thing just to kind of flush it down the toilet.

416
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, strong invitation.

417
00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Protecting you that you are worth it. That what that says to your commitment. If you tell the people listen, I don't want to be around people that are using uncles brothers.

418
00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You are recoveries that important, and only in time, will you kind of figure out whether I'm full of it or not. You know what I mean like only you'll, you'll go through it.

419
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that temptation is going to be there and then you'll have a thought those two things will happen at the same time. And then, whoops, I won't be works because we could have eliminated one of those

420
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.660
Gabriel L.: Yeah, no, it's funny because

421
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:27.060
Gabriel L.: I think I really do need to tell him because you're right. If I, if he hadn't

422
00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:42.900
Gabriel L.: I blocked it number I'm if I blocked it stopped answering him to text and then he starts. He like he's been given to me to get through to me via email. Now, so now he emailed me a song so like a cell phone number to the beginning, like I have to stay out of town.

423
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:48.780
Gabriel L.: Because you know maybe right if I hadn't if you hadn't sent me that text message. And then before it just kept driving

424
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.340
Gabriel L.: To go fishing.

425
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's very similar, in a sense, to what you'll hear some. I don't know if you've heard us in group talk about some people are

426
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Working on quitting smoking and we'll use this like sick this 92nd

427
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing where we'll say, Okay, you can do anything for 90 seconds, right. So, just tell your you're just about to reach for a cigarette and you say okay, give yourself 90 seconds, not going to do it. I'm gonna

428
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Go make the bed. I'm going to go wash the dishes. I'm going to go scramble some eggs, whatever, right, to get through those 90 seconds. So what ends up happening.

429
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is more time has passed, and just 90 seconds to get a whole half hour that passive didn't smoke that cigarette. That's cool. But watch if that cigarette was already on the counter with a lighter

430
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's circumstance is already there. How likely are you to say, fuck it.

431
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it was in the trunk of your car if you left them at work is what I know you're I'm just giving examples about

432
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.400
Putting

433
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Your neighbor you hold them.

434
00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, when we, when we put time in between our initial impulse. It gives us time to remember why we don't want to smoke. We get to remember this last weekend all the guilt or remorse stuck on it. Oh.

435
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can give ourselves those 90 seconds or more. So you see now if that text wasn't there. If access wasn't so proximal so close. Now we have

436
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Time to remember why we're bothering to do it to begin with. I'll go, I'll go look at my my recovery journal and I got this list of things that I can do.

437
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's real quick. I'm just going to go for a walk. You just don't even think about it. Splash cold water on your face. Sometimes we literally just have to get through those 90 seconds. And we've made it through the difficult period that that initial craving because here's the thing.

438
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is an interesting piece that not everybody really really gets

439
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain is it sets up a spray of reinforcement, which is a dope. I mean, that's what makes you want to eat sex.

440
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What other things pretty sunset.

441
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we get a spray of the opening the body reinforces survival needs. It's going to make sure that you like to eat because you can't survive without it. So what it does is it gives you a spray, but not only does it do that. This is the cool part.

442
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you have it in your head.

443
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to use

444
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It wants you to finish that

445
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's like, yeah.

446
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.410
Okay.

447
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So then guess what your mind is set it and then you. Don't second guess it and you've already headed to that destination, you're already going to do it so

448
00:46:51.570 --> 00:47:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The quicker that you can, as soon as the thought comes go whole depresses unacceptable thought I can't entertain it

449
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: My brain chemistry is going to be reinforcing that I finish that thought that I get to that feel good feeling it's going to want me to get all the way to the end of that and it's already starting to spray this reinforcement hormone, which is the dope mean

450
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like your brain like is like not on your side.

451
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not other side of recovery, sometimes, but the less time we do it, the less that's going to happen. So if we can turn it towards okay this is just my brain. This is not a fact. I don't actually have to use right now. Okay. What can I do have a glass of water.

452
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Make a pot of tea, make some pancakes for everybody, every have breakfast, you're going to need to have things. That's why their relapse prevention plan, you got to have a list of things for distraction. Do some deep breathing do some mindfulness practices.

453
00:47:51.300 --> 00:48:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point has to do with time. We need time because watch if my brain is already reinforcing it with dope and you finish that. Yeah. It's gonna be great. Go, go, go, go, go. Don't I need time to interrupt that

454
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And if that if that is that pill is right here available. There's not enough time for me to think it through. There's not enough time for me to remember why am I bothering to not drink and use

455
00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I need it.

456
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.310
Gabriel L.: It's funny you say that because once had committed

457
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:25.800
Gabriel L.: Like it like it was done.

458
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.980
Gabriel L.: I got, I just committed and I was like I said, I'm gonna go

459
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know that you are. That's how everybody works rare that once you've already said.

460
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is going to create a new all and you feel you're already feeling how good it's going to feel that's that's exactly what's happening because it's the steps along the way. Let me explain. One more piece and this might do the trick.

461
00:48:51.930 --> 00:49:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: When we were hunter gatherers right you man. Hunter, you know, a woman gather or whatever, wherever the berries worse. So what the brain did is it wanted you and me to remember how we got there.

462
00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch this.

463
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's hitting this reinforcement of there's this tree that looks like a phone, there's this huge boulder and it's spraying me with

464
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: With a with a dope me to help me remember how I got there.

465
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.280
Um,

466
00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So you guys look what it's doing a when I see that tree when I see that boulder. I'm going to be thinking about getting high.

467
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only that,

468
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's reinforcing the steps. So watch that thought. I'm already going to use you've already made up your mind.

469
00:49:45.900 --> 00:50:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You have so much against you to be able to interrupt that because your brain is reinforcing that you get to that euphoric effect. Now here's the truth. On top of all of this is naturally the opiate

470
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: opiate receptors, the opiate the natural occurring opiate that happens in your own body.

471
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this right, pretty sunset.

472
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheesecake whatever is this, this is right. What you did when you loaded it with all of that.

473
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Was this

474
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's inhuman. But that's not how we don't create that that much natural occurring.

475
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So you mess with the with the with the needle on that.

476
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But over time, if you keep putting months, months, months, months, years, distance, the frequency of you thinking in those thoughts that you currently are will go down.

477
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.990
Gabriel L.: There, it's funny that you know right the next morning when I woke up right there again.

478
00:50:58.650 --> 00:50:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that something

479
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.110
Gabriel L.: And now, like I told Ashley, like, thank God. He didn't have any with them.

480
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:11.040
Gabriel L.: I know. Like, imagine what it's like to leave like and I told myself, this would be the only time

481
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:18.420
Gabriel L.: That Friday and it wasn't. And then I think about it and they're so expensive.

482
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:31.050
Gabriel L.: Movie. Okay. Maggie said I happen to have to accept it.

483
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:39.360
Gabriel L.: It's not like I wish I hadn't done this, you say I did do this I accepted for. I think that was last week.

484
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.470
Yeah.

485
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

486
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:51.240
Gabriel L.: Yeah yeah yeah my works, and I do these things and they do help me, you know, the breathing. We talked about. I was thinking about my, my little mushroom house with a dirt floor.

487
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:55.320
Gabriel L.: And it's funny, you brought it up this morning, I was thinking about it.

488
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So you

489
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Know when we have those thoughts you go there into that imagery, you get the sense of

490
00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I have everything I need. I have my adult self I'm needing an unmet need, I'm meeting it now. I'm not an eight year old i'm not i can get what I need. If I need reassurance. I'll go talk to someone, if I need a hug. I can, I can get a hook.

491
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to go for a walk.

492
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do this. It's just that we think in our, in our unconscious mind that we're little again. But we're not if you go into that that safe space do that breath work.

493
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Get back to feeling okay just the way you are that urgency of needing to have that euphoria, whether it's alcohol or a pill. I think it'll go down, it's probably got to actually use these new skills, we've got to do them.

494
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I

495
00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.690
Just

496
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't review all my goals with you. Um, I want to let me know I want to be a better husband.

497
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you give me one statement.

498
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: About

499
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How you see yourself with your goal of I want to be a better husband, what's something a quick statement on that and I'll write it down.

500
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.200
Gabriel L.: Um, I feel

501
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.610
Gabriel L.: That I have been

502
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.340
Gabriel L.: I mean, maybe not as well as

503
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.500
Gabriel L.: Relapse that I had

504
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:41.910
Gabriel L.: But, you know, because that it's like it made me feel like like an idiot. And that myself, but I feel like I've been a been a better. I'm definitely a better husband now than I was before.

505
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.950
Gabriel L.: When I gave this amen

506
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.030
Yes.

507
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Um,

508
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It for now let's schedule another time to me.

509
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: weeks from now, like in the morning.

510
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.640
Gabriel L.: We can do next week. If you want to go next week also

511
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.270
Okay.

512
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes I can, I can actually do seven it'll feel just like this may 28 at seven.

513
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.120
Gabriel L.: Just the Thursday. Good.

514
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.890
Gabriel L.: Yeah, okay.

515
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:38.190
Gabriel L.: Excellent. That'll work perfectly for me.

516
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then I can, I can kind of do that other piece that we had started. Um, and it's a good, it's good. Since he also had this slip kind of beef up the service. Just a little bit.

517
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:56.430
Gabriel L.: Yeah, I don't feel like it's beneficial because I haven't really like feeling real down on myself. Yeah.

518
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm really you I'm proud of you for sharing. And there was a little moment there who just about to turn into something like her.

519
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you pressure. I'm really but I'm proud of you really am because you could have just made it about when and Gwen's a bitch. And she's on my ass and you could have made it about that. Right. You could have

520
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But she didn't. And that was, it was really impressive. A lot of people don't do that they'll, they'll just make it about like I'm getting in their business, you know, and

521
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm impressed.

522
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:35.160
Gabriel L.: What I like about our meetings, you know, keep digging and digging and digging and I'm just like, placing it

523
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.990
Gabriel L.: I know I said it before, but you know I every time I have these meetings with you. I'm like, here we go again.

524
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.960
Gabriel L.: But whenever I leave, I feel so much better.

525
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The part of you that's honest and true to you that ends up feeling the relief. It's the addict part that finds me a bitch right

526
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, but I see it. I know.

527
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Things. I'm like, I'm, I'm right. I'm a nightmare. Because I, I kind of asked so much honesty and the attics, like, no, we have to lie to her, don't tell the truth.

528
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I look forward to seeing you soon. Then, and even in group.

529
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:25.470
Gabriel L.: Yeah, I'll see you then.

530
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see you then.

531
00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.330
Gabriel L.: Have a good day.
