8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.340
Richelle Direny: Not really.

9
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.430
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.440
Richelle Direny: Being

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.750
Richelle Direny: In

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.360
Richelle Direny: Isolation, yes.

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.430
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yes, that

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.000
Donita McClintic: Yes.

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.470
Richelle Direny: I am. I want to be rejoined with the outside world.

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.750
Richelle Direny: I mean granted it is nice.

17
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.820
Donita McClintic: There are some benefits to

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.200
Donita McClintic: It. Yeah.

19
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.900
Richelle Direny: What I have to say it is like, oh,

20
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

21
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.130
Richelle Direny: I want to be reintegrated

22
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.490
Richelle Direny: Yeah, not just to the grocery store.

23
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.980
Donita McClintic: I know, it's crazy. I don't really go anywhere anyway so it's

24
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.570
Donita McClintic: All right.

25
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.070
Richelle Direny: I have to say, are you, are you still extra box.

26
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:31.050
Donita McClintic: Yes, but as get ready, say, normally I don't go anywhere. But I have been going to the grocery store for my parents. So they're not out and we selected one person and I got to be the person that gets to go do all the running so

27
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.960
Richelle Direny: You kind of some kind of

28
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.840
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Door excitement, but then outdoor excitement. Do you, um,

29
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.760
Richelle Direny: Would you say that, do you have to wear a mask because yesterday I was out and I had to wear the mask and I swear I thought I was suffocating

30
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.220
Donita McClintic: I know you can't. They're horrible. They're horrible and they say they don't even

31
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.660
Richelle Direny: Really work.

32
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.010
Donita McClintic: Right, and then you got it on your sheet. My dad said, we're gonna start stripping on the porch. I was like, no.

33
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.110
Richelle Direny: I mean like I had it where I had it on because every time like so when you breathe out when you exhale, it goes out when you

34
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.030
Richelle Direny: Inhale, it goes. Yep.

35
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.320
Richelle Direny: And it's just like, oh my god, I can't do this. So every minute. I kept taking you off.

36
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.540
Donita McClintic: Like which defeats the purpose, right.

37
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.650
Donita McClintic: Yeah. And look, you're touching. If you got a gloves.

38
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.480
Donita McClintic: You got a cell phone in your hand or you know what I mean. So

39
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.650
Richelle Direny: What's the purpose

40
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.570
Donita McClintic: Yeah, then you like you know you're touching the phone. And then you take your mask off and you got it to your face it. I don't understand it either, but

41
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.250
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

42
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.100
Richelle Direny: Yeah, we

43
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.510
Richelle Direny: Yes, a mere person with somewhat of common sense, I guess.

44
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.290
Donita McClintic: Yeah, see, I've been helping take care of

45
00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:01.350
Donita McClintic: One of our used to be my old landlord, but he's 82 and he actually he got tested for the wires, but it came back negative. But he actually had a call squat on him earlier.

46
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.710
Donita McClintic: And he's an emergency right now waiting for a call to see if they're going to keep him. He's got bronchitis real bad and it cannot breathe. It's horrible, like he was shaking like

47
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:30.030
Donita McClintic: A little breather. It's, um, whose name was Arnold. He's just a friend that I've been yeah he lives like a half a mile away from my parents. So I've been going back and forth to helping my mom with Caleb with with my autistic cousin. And yeah, it's been it's been crazy

48
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.560
Donita McClintic: Dead.

49
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.520
Donita McClintic: So I'm waiting on the phone call from the emergency room to see if they're going to keep him or but he did come back negative. He doesn't have the virus. So that's good.

50
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.230
Richelle Direny: That's good, that's good.

51
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:52.860
Donita McClintic: Yeah, but it was scary. I've never seen anybody do that where he's coughing so hard, like he was shaking, where he like he could not breathe. I was like, Oh my gosh, so

52
00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.050
Donita McClintic: I was, um, yeah. I thought I might have to cancel and I was like, No, I'll do it. And if they call then I'll just have to cut it short. So

53
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.780
Richelle Direny: There you go. I like it. I like it.

54
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.640
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So listen, you're just looking so great. You're so chirpy. You're so full of life.

55
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.630
Donita McClintic: I know let

56
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.780
Richelle Direny: Me. Tell me what tell me what's No, tell me what's going on.

57
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:32.040
Donita McClintic: I just been to help. I've been focusing on myself and my helping my mom and them out and helping Arnold and my husband. I'm not even I'm not talked to him in a couple weeks I blocked him all my stuff. Yeah. So I've been great, awesome better

58
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.970
Richelle Direny: Than

59
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.330
Richelle Direny: A Film Festival. The. How did it. How did it feel in the beginning I know after we spoke like when you made this transition

60
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:49.050
Richelle Direny: Like how did they feel when you had to like block him and start somewhat. I mean, it's a bad word, but like start kind of like the be the detoxing process.

61
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.390
Richelle Direny: Of your husband and whatever came with that.

62
00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:01.890
Donita McClintic: Yeah. At first I was overwhelmed. Like I just, I didn't know if I'd be able to go through it because everybody goes back to what you're used to. I mean, but

63
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:14.850
Donita McClintic: Yeah, but I stopped and I think I do my pros and cons, which is my my pros definitely outweigh that I mean, yeah, you know what I mean.

64
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah

65
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.320
Donita McClintic: He's bad he's toxic and I can't do that.

66
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.140
Donita McClintic: Yeah, and I tried to tell him he needs to fix themselves, not for me before him, so

67
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.720
Donita McClintic: Then yeah, but he's not

68
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.130
Donita McClintic: No.

69
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.530
Donita McClintic: Drugs, definitely.

70
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.820
Donita McClintic: And

71
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.060
Richelle Direny: And and I like what you started off you chose yourself.

72
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.920
Richelle Direny: And when you choose yourself.

73
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.560
Richelle Direny: And you're choosing to learn you to fall in love with you.

74
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And when you fall in love with you, your self will tell you what it desires.

75
00:05:48.900 --> 00:06:04.260
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and I think that's the thing. Sometimes we we look for the answers of how those emotions, those things that we feel inside of us. It's like, I need someone to validate that I need someone to acknowledge that. But how about like starting with acknowledging it yourself.

76
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.210
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and working and just. The question is, like, you know, so you love yourself, and that's that's a, that's a loaded question.

77
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.420
Richelle Direny: Yes. If you don't, then you're going to very find it very hard. So then you're going to go back to what you think.

78
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.890
Richelle Direny: Right, like and what she

79
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.420
Richelle Direny: What what what you were comfortable with, or you became comfortable with yourself to be comfortable with.

80
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and so yeah that's good because you're looking. I'm like, look at her. She can

81
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.520
Richelle Direny: Be in our life and everything.

82
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.110
Donita McClintic: And I didn't cancel.

83
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.030
Richelle Direny: Yes, yeah.

84
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.440
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I like, I mean, when I done the methadone treatment stuff. I got to the point where I take homes at all we had to do.

85
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:58.950
Donita McClintic: Like my treatment plan like once a month with accounts or whatever. And I my groups. I didn't know how to do that once a month, but I i think that they help. I know at first I was like shy and didn't want to tell my story and all

86
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.640
Donita McClintic: That but

87
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:08.250
Donita McClintic: When I seen that everybody is, you know, they're just like I am. It's. It made me feel a whole lot better. But I really do think that the. This helps you got it.

88
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:18.030
Donita McClintic: Because my parents doesn't understand what I'm saying they don't you know they don't. So, I mean, I tried to talk to them about stuff. I mean, I still say it, but they

89
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.080
Richelle Direny: Don't know what. Think about it. Think of this, think about this analogy.

90
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.520
Richelle Direny: You have a soda bottle. Shake it up. Shake it Off. Shake it Off. Shake it Off. Shake out

91
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.560
Richelle Direny: What happens. What about how does the battlefield.

92
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.740
Donita McClintic: A tight for are going to explode.

93
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:41.640
Richelle Direny: Exactly. So you should you're you're shaking it up and it spits this this of stuff that's how we are we have so much that's in us.

94
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:59.040
Richelle Direny: It's like life just says you need to release it and it's shaking you up and shaking you up and how does it shake you, how do you know what shaking, you become super anxious become depressed you them. You have a panic attack and your attack is really your release from that anxiety.

95
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:11.220
Richelle Direny: Right. But what so in counseling. What happens is that I'm going to help you to release the pressure. How can you think about it, take the image of the soda water you shake it up.

96
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, if you don't want it to go exploding. How do you release it.

97
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.610
Donita McClintic: You solve what you do. Easy.

98
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.640
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

99
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.800
Donita McClintic: That one right here.

100
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.930
Donita McClintic: Guys soda bottle right there. Yeah.

101
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.300
Richelle Direny: But if I think about life like that.

102
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.220
Donita McClintic: It's never thought about. That's good.

103
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.320
Donita McClintic: Use you slide down

104
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.640
Richelle Direny: You slowly really you just have to slowly release it and how you release it is speaking about it a little at a time.

105
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:52.110
Richelle Direny: Now reality of what the sort of our wants to do it wants to just release everything all at once. But then when you release everything all at once. All you're doing is spewing information and everything cannot be addressed.

106
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:58.650
Richelle Direny: Well, we have to slowly do it through every session that you go to, through every

107
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:15.570
Richelle Direny: Group that you go to. And so eventually your release that pressure the bottle comes back to its normal it feels soft, it's pliable and now the bubbles are slowly going, everything is returning back to pull me a space. It's too.

108
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.170
Richelle Direny: Small we you have to think about. You like that.

109
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:27.210
Richelle Direny: LG, you know, and so how can I, how do I know when I'm building up the pressure. Are you feeling more anxious

110
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.350
Donita McClintic: Anxious. Yep.

111
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.380
Richelle Direny: Do you feel that you're going into a deeper depression.

112
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:31.920
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

113
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.070
Richelle Direny: Do you feel that you're just now you're with trying to

114
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.240
Donita McClintic: Draw. Yes, that's what I do. I do. I would draw myself. Yes.

115
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:58.050
Richelle Direny: That's how you know that the pressures of life is. And because the reality of it is, it wants to come out because the cap is on top. It's refusing from allowing it to come out. But we, it's, it's like I have to release it because so

116
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:06.300
Richelle Direny: The way the pressure is is that the pressure comes up and it wants to be released, but over time through life.

117
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:18.570
Richelle Direny: Through maybe your family members through everyone around you. What is onwards behavior is that you keep it all to yourself. Don't tell me about your business. Why are you telling them your business.

118
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.470
Richelle Direny: Because they go to. And so all kind of negativity gets poured into

119
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:32.070
Richelle Direny: And that's a learned behavior that learns behavior is to keep it inside. And what happens when you keep the toxins inside

120
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.320
Donita McClintic: It's loud. It's not good.

121
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:35.790
Donita McClintic: Enough.

122
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.630
Donita McClintic: Everything.

123
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.200
Richelle Direny: Out of you because you're you're keeping the toxins inside

124
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.000
Richelle Direny: I have to release it release it and this is how you release it.

125
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.470
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that's

126
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.230
Donita McClintic: Just, you know, all yeah and i like i said what like our gratitude. I am so grateful.

127
00:10:52.710 --> 00:11:00.540
Donita McClintic: For this program because if I didn't find you guys when I did. I don't know where I would be, honestly, because I don't go

128
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:11.280
Donita McClintic: I mean I'm slowly getting out there and then when I started getting out there you know the current virus. So I had to stay put, other than the grocery store, but if it wasn't for you guys. I don't

129
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:22.500
Donita McClintic: I mean, cuz I just don't know like I do. I appreciate you guys being here. I honestly do like you guys are you guys are on the frontline even though you're not think for

130
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.460
Donita McClintic: For us.

131
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:24.750
Home.

132
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.980
Richelle Direny: When the frontline in isolation. So we asked for my so let's be an isolation together and release the soda bottle. That's what it is.

133
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.350
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

134
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:49.410
Richelle Direny: So it's it's it's it's so I'm happy for you in the sense that you have come to that place where even though you're in isolation. It's not something that you're choosing because of your problems because this is

135
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:57.360
Richelle Direny: Your isolation, not because of your problems. It's because there are other circumstances beyond your control none that

136
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:10.110
Richelle Direny: You created none that momentarily jumped to be a part of that's put you in isolation. So in this time that I'm put in isolation, with a free and clear mind because remember before when you were in isolation.

137
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.950
Richelle Direny: You were depressed, you're anxious, we're thinking about everything in life.

138
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:35.760
Richelle Direny: So you were not in a place to think and process. Clearly, now you're in it and you're thinking, and you're saying, hey, so now is that time while you're in isolation to become proactive cognitively proactive and when I say cognitively proactive is that now you're thinking

139
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.190
Richelle Direny: Don't need a watch. What can you do to improve your own

140
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:49.320
Richelle Direny: Life in the sense of your own home on quality of life. How can I improve this quality of life.

141
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.960
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like in group. What I've been using

142
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:59.310
Richelle Direny: Is this term call it the song, which I'm sure a lot of people saying, because the old song. I could see clearly. Now the rain.

143
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.760
Donita McClintic: Yes.

144
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:00.570
I got

145
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.350
Donita McClintic: That song was on earlier in the car.

146
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.170
Donita McClintic: That is so weird.

147
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.580
Richelle Direny: Yes.

148
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.250
Richelle Direny: Thank God I gosh I can

149
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.500
Richelle Direny: Clearly, now the rain is gone. I could see all obstacles in my way. Yeah.

150
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:29.430
Richelle Direny: You're in love. Now you're in isolation, but the storm is over the rain is gone. Now you can see all the sun is shining and it's going to be a bright sunshiny day

151
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.930
Donita McClintic: Yeah, you're here.

152
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:40.740
Richelle Direny: It is a bright sunshiny day because now, in your mind, you have removed whatever top or you're slowly removing anything that's toxic in your life.

153
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:53.190
Richelle Direny: That's keeping you tracked that's keeping you in this bad place you're slowly removing it. So even though it's not the bright, bright sunshiny day, but it is bright.

154
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.890
Donita McClintic: It is brighter. Yes, it's brighter than

155
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.200
Richelle Direny: It was yes.

156
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:07.800
Richelle Direny: So it's just thinking about it. It's a bright. Okay. It's a bright, bright sunshiny day. Think about the sunshiny day is when the sun is at its peak.

157
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.820
Richelle Direny: Right, yeah. Right now it's you see the sun coming up.

158
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:20.880
Richelle Direny: It's like kind of like mid on early, mid morning it's a bright and the more you continue add this cognitive restructuring.

159
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.610
Richelle Direny: I'm at the state that the season that you're in right now. It's like you're saying all right now.

160
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.700
Richelle Direny: I want it to be a bright, I want to be able to get through these obstacles, because you know what before

161
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:44.850
Richelle Direny: I was whether it was intoxicated or wasn't in my right mind because I was so hurt and I was whole bottle down and everything the obstacles that were in my way. I didn't really do anything with them or

162
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.960
Richelle Direny: I would get or

163
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.460
Richelle Direny: In order for me to get through these obstacles. I had to be under the influence of something

164
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.810
Richelle Direny: Right now.

165
00:14:52.110 --> 00:15:07.740
Richelle Direny: I'm doing this holistically with some assistance, I'm doing this holistically, so I can see all of the obstacles with a clear mind with a clear view um you field of view.

166
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.010
Richelle Direny: Well, now I can learn how to go through each of it healthy

167
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.850
Richelle Direny: War without any kind of toxins in me.

168
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:18.630
Donita McClintic: Wow.

169
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.090
Richelle Direny: I know and I'm slowly released

170
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:36.570
Donita McClintic: Before like when I okay when I cuz I quit methadone cold turkey and I was on it for 18 months and there's probably like this 30 day after being off of that I had all of these

171
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:49.050
Donita McClintic: Thoughts, like, it's like marquis signs going every direction. And it, it was overwhelming and I had to teach myself how to like try to slow my brain down

172
00:15:50.280 --> 00:16:05.670
Donita McClintic: And concentrate on one thing at a time like I still have problems with it. Sometimes, but when I when that happens. That's usually what I'll go off by myself and I color. I will color because I have to concentrate on not gotten out of the lines.

173
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:18.120
Donita McClintic: While I'm thinking about whatever it is that's going on in my mind. Like that's that kind of stuff is gets overwhelming a lot, but here lately. Since I've been

174
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:38.550
Donita McClintic: Up active doing things for my pair or helping my mom. It's like I feel like I have a purpose because she needs help. So instead of her doing it. I'll get up and do it. No, no one else doesn't think for so I get up and I help her. And at the end of the day, I feel like I've accomplished something.

175
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.630
Donita McClintic: And it's great.

176
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:40.920
Donita McClintic: I love it.

177
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.120
Richelle Direny: And scary. And I know one of the things that you what you talked about

178
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.070
Richelle Direny: What you talked about in our last session was that you

179
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:58.830
Richelle Direny: Being able to get out and go to the store and not be so especially like with one of the things you struggle with your self image with your

180
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:08.790
Richelle Direny: Teeth and everything. Yeah, not so be so concerned and so overwhelmed and bottle down with your self image, you know, because remember we talked about, like, no, that's

181
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.370
Richelle Direny: How you look at yourself. That's sees you.

182
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:19.260
Richelle Direny: It's right how you so your insecurities is kind of on blast and because you're insecurity, you think everybody is looking at you through your

183
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:19.650
Donita McClintic: Right.

184
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.850
Richelle Direny: Your own insecurities.

185
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.660
Donita McClintic: Right, but where I have to wear masks cat. The cat. No one see it.

186
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.380
See what

187
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.910
Richelle Direny: It was yesterday I was going out of the house. And then I thought, oh, let me put on some lipstick. Then I picked up.

188
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:51.120
Donita McClintic: Again, that's funny. Dr. Jamison out now. She told was centered in the group. I'm with you guys, but she's talking about someone on Facebook. So we need to stop wearing masks at home because they're busy. And that's a good one too.

189
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.320
Yeah.

190
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.880
Richelle Direny: So,

191
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:08.610
Donita McClintic: Yeah, and she switched my groups to I'll be in your Tennessee group on Wednesdays. Now, at noon, because I was in a group with somebody with Alan Johnson someone I knew so to

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.520
Donita McClintic: See group. So that will be

193
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.990
Richelle Direny: Day you, um, you're in Tennessee.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:25.230
Donita McClintic: I'm in Ohio, but where I know Odessa, AND I KNOW, ANGELA amber like I know Bethany, Oxfordshire. I know all of them. So

195
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.280
Richelle Direny: You know,

196
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.220
Donita McClintic: Swick yeah she had to switch us

197
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.260
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

198
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.240
Richelle Direny: For you thank you know Alvin.

199
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:39.840
Donita McClintic: Yeah he is our wins. Mom, I would Johnson. He is his mother. Yeah.

200
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.180
Donita McClintic: He is who he is the one that

201
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:52.560
Donita McClintic: Started from you guys first and then I was the second one to do it. And then now I told her this is my cousin. So I yeah so it's a

202
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.600
Richelle Direny: Family, it's a family.

203
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.510
Donita McClintic: Yeah, and you know what Angie's

204
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.300
Donita McClintic: Her husband just overdosed last night. He didn't pass away, but he did over there not together. I don't think but

205
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.630
Donita McClintic: I saw a film for her yesterday. Like, I can't

206
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:13.860
Donita McClintic: I'm so glad I'm not. That's, that's just a horrible. I don't even know how

207
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.910
Richelle Direny: So that's about it. That's, um, that's about it. But

208
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.460
Richelle Direny: So this is so this is the other thing.

209
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.260
Richelle Direny: Um,

210
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:29.310
Richelle Direny: That's good, that being able to be in a place where you're becoming aware of everything around you in your surroundings and

211
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.180
Donita McClintic: Everything.

212
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:40.590
Richelle Direny: And being able to put it out there. Um, I would definitely say that knowing yourself and knowing where you are in your own recovery is very, very, very, very important.

213
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:57.270
Richelle Direny: And the reason why it's so important because you all of this work that you've done to actually start the journey. It took a lot out of you to start the journey. It took that much more to get through the first 30 days of that journey.

214
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.920
Richelle Direny: The first 30 days.

215
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.000
Donita McClintic: I know

216
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.380
Richelle Direny: It now when you think about, like, where, how, how long have you been on this journey.

217
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.990
Donita McClintic: Of all together three years trying to get clean three years.

218
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.540
Richelle Direny: So consistently without anything without any slip ups. When I anything. How long is that man.

219
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:30.540
Donita McClintic: Okay, without any slip ups, just like a month because I i was 18 almost I started this program this one in 2018 November 2018 and I don't good until I'd love my husband, which was

220
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.530
Donita McClintic: Not this past drug test, but the drug test before

221
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:48.750
Donita McClintic: I had, I hadn't had medicine for three days because the internet out here is so well now it's not because I'm at our old house what she's got the high speed. My mom and dad have satellite internet and it's horrible. So I couldn't do my drug thing that

222
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:59.880
Donita McClintic: But so I had to wait for three days before I got medicine and it's at the time I was leaving my husband and I tried to do some math and they did not even get me high, it just made me feel

223
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:17.490
Donita McClintic: Like a starting all over again, it's all done. But in that I that's when I realized my husband is is toxic for me. He's not he should be supporting me, you know, tell me I'm doing good. Not trying to pay me drugs. Right.

224
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.650
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so it's been like a month since I've been

225
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.390
Donita McClintic: Thinking about

226
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.530
Richelle Direny: So overall, you've been at this for three years.

227
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.600
Richelle Direny: Consistently

228
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.690
Richelle Direny: For the last three months because something kind of

229
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.470
Richelle Direny: You know, got where life just kind of gotten there where you just kind of

230
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:46.800
Richelle Direny: Did you slept. Right. But until so think about where you are for yourself. So

231
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.860
Richelle Direny: And you know what, that's very important, even that you brought that up because

232
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:56.340
Richelle Direny: The reality of it is you have been on this like you have been on this journey for three years.

233
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.770
Richelle Direny: But then something occurred.

234
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.450
Richelle Direny: 30 days ago.

235
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.400
Richelle Direny: That made you reach

236
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:16.170
Richelle Direny: And you got and you'll even and maybe not having enough willpower to really truly walk away. So it's now, like you said, choosing you is to learn, you

237
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.000
Richelle Direny: To learn your triggers.

238
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:25.110
Richelle Direny: Understand your triggers and to know where you are that am I in a place to really help somebody else.

239
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.730
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like we're both learning how to swim. Your had been

240
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.830
Richelle Direny: A stronger, smarter than I am.

241
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.090
Richelle Direny: But you're not in the place to

242
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.590
Richelle Direny: Save me if I'm going under.

243
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.730
Donita McClintic: Right, right.

244
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.130
Richelle Direny: You feel bad because I don't want you don't want me to go under. So you're going to try your best to reach for me.

245
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.310
Richelle Direny: But what ends up happening when you read because you've been we

246
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.380
Donita McClintic: Both we're both gonna

247
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:53.070
Richelle Direny: We're both going under. And that's a hard pill to swallow. Think about that. That's a hard pill to swallow.

248
00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:02.970
Richelle Direny: Because now, your emotions now takes over and this is this false sense of, oh my god, I can't allow her to sing like I, you know, I'm a tad bit like I went to

249
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:10.260
Richelle Direny: I started tweeting school. Two weeks before she did. So I know a little bit of thing but you're still not in a place to try to save someone else.

250
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:24.150
Richelle Direny: Right. So now what ends up happening that emotion of I feel sorry for her. I want to help her is coming from a genuine place, but at the same time, you're not in the place to try to help me.

251
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:37.380
Richelle Direny: Because now we're both going to sink and in your situation you it's coming from a genuine place because you're with your husband you love your husband. You don't think this and whatever. But then what ends up happening is that now you just

252
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.010
Richelle Direny: baxley

253
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.930
Richelle Direny: Simply on cars. Yes.

254
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.440
Richelle Direny: What your emotion deceived you to think that you were

255
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:52.080
Donita McClintic: Trying and I journey with me. It makes me hate him even more. Honestly, I mean, I really saw. Yeah.

256
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.060
Donita McClintic: Obviously I mean so

257
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.860
Richelle Direny: So choosing yourself. It's really saying, I need to learn me or anything.

258
00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.790
Richelle Direny: In me

259
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:04.770
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so while Angie and her ex husband or

260
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.980
Donita McClintic: Whatever. Yeah, they're they're married but they're not together but yeah

261
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.900
Richelle Direny: But while you know you

262
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.370
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

263
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.240
Richelle Direny: But you have to, you have to ask yourself, and I'm going to say not to do it. I'm just

264
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.900
Donita McClintic: Saying, right.

265
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:24.960
Richelle Direny: Whatever you whatever lifeline. You want to throw or whatever you think you want to do stop with it with logical thinking and say,

266
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:40.260
Richelle Direny: I need to prepare myself mentally and emotionally if I reach out to them, are they in that place where she is feeling so low or she's in a bad place that then she started speaking to you, which now becomes a trigger for you.

267
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:49.860
Donita McClintic: Right. You're right, you're right, you're right. I never thought of that. So that's good that because you are right. Yeah. So I probably should just pray for them.

268
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.970
Richelle Direny: Somebody ain't gonna get you to

269
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:05.280
Donita McClintic: But you're what you're right, because she definitely would be a trigger because we used to do stuff together. So, you, you're right. Yeah.

270
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.060
Richelle Direny: I mean, again, I'm not telling you what I'm just saying.

271
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.970
Donita McClintic: You know me. Yeah, I know.

272
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:17.670
Donita McClintic: Yeah, you just described, everything just doesn't mean that you're right. So thank you for that.

273
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:19.800
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

274
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.090
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I need to focus on me and not worry about them. They made their own choice.

275
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.050
So,

276
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.900
Richelle Direny: And it's a hard thing to say.

277
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.630
Donita McClintic: It's a hard thing to get to

278
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:36.870
Richelle Direny: But it is a place where you have to say um

279
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.990
Richelle Direny: I need to. I need to know

280
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:52.200
Richelle Direny: Am I in that place that if I get on the phone and I'm offering you know some sense of, I'm trying to console or whatever the situation is or support emotional support whatever it is.

281
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.200
Richelle Direny: Is it going to put me in a bad

282
00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:02.640
Donita McClintic: Place. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And honestly, I've not really talked to her for a while anyway so

283
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.890
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how she's doing in her recovery and what and, you know, I don't know. So I

284
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.800
Donita McClintic: I'll just, I mean, he's still and I don't even think they're together but

285
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:27.060
Donita McClintic: I don't know, I just thought I just was thinking about it, whatever. But yeah, you're right. I need to just worried about myself because I would probably, I don't know what kind of state of mind. She's in and

286
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.880
Donita McClintic: Yeah, she used to be like one of my best friends. So yeah, I'll just

287
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:41.190
Donita McClintic: Pray for her, like you said, Yes, that's what yeah I will pray for somebody ain't going to do nothing, no.

288
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:52.560
Donita McClintic: I think she's been doing good. I mean, last time I saw her she looks. She looks so much better. She didn't add look I was shocked. Like she loved green

289
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.350
Donita McClintic: CC used to. I used to be her counselor back like two, three years ago, and I would tell her.

290
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:08.010
Donita McClintic: If you like she started she she can't do it on their own and whatever she's always been with someone, I said, Angie, you can do it. And she's done and then

291
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.800
Donita McClintic: She goes back with them and whatever, which I can't say nothing, because we are. I mean, I've done it, too, but

292
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:19.140
Donita McClintic: This time I'm he marks, not my husband isn't going to change. I know I already know this. So,

293
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:34.320
Donita McClintic: It's sad because it will be will be would have been married or we are married, it will be four years. On May 12 but I need to start looking for like disillusion or something. But there's a disillusion to they have to agree to it because he probably won't agree.

294
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.570
Donita McClintic: I don't know.

295
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.910
Richelle Direny: I mean, regardless if he wants to

296
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.090
Richelle Direny: Agree. He has to come, I would think he would have to contest to see

297
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.850
Richelle Direny: Why he disagree. I mean don't want to be want to be with them.

298
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.250
Richelle Direny: I just can't force up with somebody

299
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:56.220
Donita McClintic: I also maybe you should put a note something because he said he was going to call my doctor tried to get me in trouble, which I don't know what for, I have no idea.

300
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.900
Richelle Direny: What you want to hear Dr. Jamison

301
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:06.240
Donita McClintic: Yes. Yeah, yeah. I don't know what he was saying he threatened me with all kind of stuff that's when I blocked him I block them from all of my

302
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:13.530
Donita McClintic: My mom stuff. Yeah, I gave him the phone number. I gave him your guys's number like awesome

303
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.030
Call it. There you go, you go.

304
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.260
Donita McClintic: Like

305
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.510
Richelle Direny: Whatever.

306
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because he because what you're doing is that

307
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.430
Richelle Direny: So for so long for you. It's like he's had the power and control.

308
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:35.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So basically what you're doing in choosing yourself. You're saying basically what you're saying to him is that I'm not allowing it

309
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.540
Richelle Direny: I'm not allowing you

310
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.070
Richelle Direny: To manipulate

311
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.140
Richelle Direny: I'm not allowed you to

312
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.760
Richelle Direny: play games with me.

313
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.770
Richelle Direny: I'm not allowing you

314
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.680
Richelle Direny: To think it is okay to talk to me or do whatever it is that you like, I'm not allowing that

315
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.440
Richelle Direny: And so by you blocking him.

316
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.800
Richelle Direny: You're shutting him down and and that's

317
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.310
Richelle Direny: That you know that's a little because when it's all said and done, it's a mind game.

318
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.100
Richelle Direny: And if I think I can get to you with

319
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.900
Richelle Direny: These mind games. This one I'm going to do.

320
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.990
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yep. It's a mind game.

321
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.080
Donita McClintic: So what for you, I would say. Good for you.

322
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.210
Donita McClintic: I mean, you're on this journey and i and i

323
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.440
Richelle Direny: For you, you know, what does it mean for

324
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.090
Donita McClintic: You to maintain your sobriety like

325
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.220
Richelle Direny: Think of it. I want you to think about it for you.

326
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.420
Richelle Direny: What does it mean

327
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.300
Donita McClintic: For you to maintain your summer, it means everything

328
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.860
Donita McClintic: To me like I am.

329
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:37.020
Donita McClintic: Like I said before, I feel ashamed of myself for things that I've done, and I cannot. I used to. I used to judge people I had cousins that done things. I'm like, How in the world, you get to that point.

330
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:48.120
Donita McClintic: And then one day there. I was so I you know do that no more. But I know what I've lost in this in my 10 whole 10 years of being on drugs.

331
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.080
Donita McClintic: And I

332
00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:59.790
Donita McClintic: It means. It means my life really. I mean, that's what it means. It means my sanity. It means everything to me. Really does

333
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.470
Richelle Direny: So in in picking that apart and saying,

334
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.960
Richelle Direny: That it means your life and it means

335
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.190
Richelle Direny: Everything to you.

336
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:22.440
Richelle Direny: It's still getting to not being a more of a blanket statement, but more of the I'm like the depth of it. It means a life to you.

337
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.710
Richelle Direny: Like what do you stand to lose, like when you think about

338
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.450
Richelle Direny: Your sobriety right now. I could see clearly. Now the rain is gone.

339
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.390
Richelle Direny: You're looking back at the storm that's behind you.

340
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.280
Richelle Direny: Because there's a storm behind you.

341
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:40.560
Richelle Direny: You're ever driving and I'm you're seeing the storm in front of you and

342
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.570
Donita McClintic: You have no choice but to go through it. Yep.

343
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.800
Richelle Direny: And then you drive through it.

344
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.470
Richelle Direny: And you look behind you and you're like, Whoa.

345
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:47.250
Donita McClintic: Yep.

346
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:53.010
Richelle Direny: Your storm is behind you. When you turn around and you look at that store. What do you see

347
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.700
Donita McClintic: A big mess, a big mess.

348
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.410
Richelle Direny: And I need you to identify at least two things. What that meant was, when you look back, it was my it was

349
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:14.820
Donita McClintic: My kids losing my i mean i will say, using the bond with my kids, but it definitely changed my relationship with my kids.

350
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.980
Donita McClintic: With my parents.

351
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.790
Donita McClintic: With my I mean with myself like I look at myself sometimes. And I just like

352
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:32.910
Donita McClintic: It's like the road, you know, you take the road you go left. It's this you're going to just have this outcome if you go right you got totally you know different

353
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:43.650
Donita McClintic: And now I got on that wrong road, but that's the right with the storm. The road is to my left, was the storm was at the right. Yeah.

354
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.770
Donita McClintic: But yeah, like my kids and my

355
00:31:46.920 --> 00:32:06.060
Donita McClintic: Mom, my parents like my mom is my mother's my best friend. And if I was to go back down the left road, I would, that would be gone. Probably. I mean, she's still going to love me, I'm a daughter, but what we have right now. So what we're getting back right now.

356
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:17.190
Donita McClintic: It would just break her heart. And then that would really i'm not ever going to see that again, ever. I will see disappointment on the faces. I don't want to disappoint went Oh MY KIDS FACES

357
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:18.780
Donita McClintic: So,

358
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:21.810
Donita McClintic: I have two

359
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:32.610
Donita McClintic: Two Boys office 23 and Jaden 95 grand baby, but I'm not, I'm not allowed to see here because the mother doesn't want nothing to do with us so

360
00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.990
Richelle Direny: Um, so, and that was because of the storm that you went in.

361
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.840
Donita McClintic: That was because of my her my son. DING are together. So she just blocked all of us out.

362
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.540
Donita McClintic: Okay, oh god yeah but but the what the, what the storm that you went into

363
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.710
Richelle Direny: Was that affected the relationship with your son.

364
00:32:53.370 --> 00:33:01.110
Donita McClintic: It did. And here's what I mean, here's what it done after I overdosed. See, I didn't realize this at the time but Austin would have been my next of kin.

365
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:08.460
Donita McClintic: He would have been the one to make the decision if they couldn't got me back, whatever, you know, just whatever with the medical stuff.

366
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.110
Donita McClintic: And after that happened you know he was in high school at the time.

367
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:26.220
Donita McClintic: He was a senior, he didn't graduate and he started to be a homebody now he has the social and he doesn't go nowhere and I mean absolutely nowhere does. I could go. He doesn't and

368
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.050
Richelle Direny: Social Phobia

369
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:46.860
Donita McClintic: And that all happened after I overdosed and he won't. I've tried to talk to him about it, but he tells me that that's not why I mean he tells me that that doesn't bother him, but I know that her so. But yeah, that that changed our relationship. He

370
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:48.510
Richelle Direny: Live in

371
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.550
Richelle Direny: Front of you have that guilt.

372
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.020
Richelle Direny: There hanging over. Yeah.

373
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:58.140
Donita McClintic: Yes, definitely. Yeah. I wish I could do that all over again. I really do. I mean, everybody does.

374
00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.730
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I

375
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:10.380
Donita McClintic: I hate myself for that. But, um, I like you've told me before. That's in the past, and I've, you know, I've talked about it. And that's where I'm, you know, I try to leave it, but

376
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:17.730
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I like day to day. Honestly, I don't know how tomorrow's want to be, but today I want to

377
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.090
Donita McClintic: Get is it solely so when you think about your story.

378
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.260
Richelle Direny: When you look back, you've identified two things that was very important to you there.

379
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:32.310
Richelle Direny: Until, to this day, you think about your relationship with your parents and ideally

380
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.030
Richelle Direny: Your mom.

381
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.890
Richelle Direny: You think about the

382
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.840
Richelle Direny: Relationship he did with your son.

383
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.670
Richelle Direny: And what the the

384
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.050
Richelle Direny: Continuous impact.

385
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.930
Richelle Direny: That it's had on that and the guilt that

386
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.590
Richelle Direny: You feel

387
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:45.780
Donita McClintic: And

388
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.370
Donita McClintic: Even though it's in the past.

389
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:49.050
Richelle Direny: You cannot do it.

390
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:50.490
Richelle Direny: Right have to live.

391
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.440
Richelle Direny: Through it, and live with it.

392
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.840
Richelle Direny: Yeah, what you can do.

393
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.400
Richelle Direny: Is while choosing

394
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.060
Richelle Direny: Yourself.

395
00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.790
Richelle Direny: And working on yourself, they can

396
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.260
Richelle Direny: Only see the change

397
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.010
Richelle Direny: And it's

398
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.720
Donita McClintic: Their choice right

399
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.100
Richelle Direny: Whether or not.

400
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.290
Donita McClintic: They want to forgive

401
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.020
Richelle Direny: And now start a new page.

402
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.100
Donita McClintic: Right, it's

403
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.060
Richelle Direny: Their choice.

404
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.140
Richelle Direny: Your choice.

405
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:20.760
Richelle Direny: Is that you're choosing self and in choosing yourself it's rebuilding the relationship with your mom rebuilding the relationship with your son.

406
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.800
Richelle Direny: And rebuilding everything

407
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.020
Richelle Direny: That maybe like you have lost

408
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.650
Donita McClintic: What

409
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.770
Richelle Direny: You understand, and you can only learn

410
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:29.430
Donita McClintic: From it

411
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.600
Um,

412
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:32.850
Richelle Direny: Is it

413
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.940
Richelle Direny: A guilt that you feel. Yes, hands down.

414
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.270
Richelle Direny: Are you going to allow it.

415
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:40.230
Richelle Direny: To keep you

416
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:40.890
Donita McClintic: Down.

417
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.570
Donita McClintic: That's what choice.

418
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.160
Richelle Direny: USA. So if you're not

419
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.120
Richelle Direny: Going to allow it.

420
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.520
Richelle Direny: You have to accept and acknowledge it was a storm.

421
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.160
Donita McClintic: That I shouldn't have went through, but I did.

422
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.000
Richelle Direny: This

423
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.740
Richelle Direny: Is the repercussions of it.

424
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.280
Richelle Direny: But I can't allow it to keep me stagnant.

425
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.080
Richelle Direny: I have to move on.

426
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:01.800
Donita McClintic: I the

427
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.820
Richelle Direny: Only one thing that

428
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.440
Richelle Direny: You do in moving on.

429
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.440
Richelle Direny: For myself, not for everybody else.

430
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.850
Richelle Direny: But for myself.

431
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.190
Richelle Direny: I need to maintain

432
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.820
Richelle Direny: My sobriety. And what does that mean

433
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.110
Donita McClintic: In maintaining your sobriety.

434
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.720
Donita McClintic: I gotta keep doing what I'm doing.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.790
Donita McClintic: Looking yeah

Richelle Direny: In the

439
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.870
End

440
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.330
Richelle Direny: In the

441
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:30.720
Donita McClintic: End

Richelle Direny: What's for you. What is your motivator.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.680
Donita McClintic: Because I want to be happy. I

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:17.100
Donita McClintic: I mean, and of course my family that I mean their motive. That's no I'm and first like just I guess my husband saying I can't do it. I can't do it. Well, yes, I can prove to people, you know, I mean, am I mean weird to say, but that I'm going to show my can do it.

454
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.600
Richelle Direny: No, it is what it is. Yeah. I'm not doing it for you. You

455
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.520
Richelle Direny: You don't want it.

456
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.910
To show

457
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.500
Donita McClintic: You

458
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.580
Donita McClintic: This is my life, this is what

459
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.060
Donita McClintic: That's about. I love you enough

460
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:37.350
Richelle Direny: To walk away.

461
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.410
Donita McClintic: Right, that's good.

462
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.590
Donita McClintic: Yeah all right let down to

463
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.150
Donita McClintic: Yeah. God, I love talking to you.

464
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.830
Donita McClintic: You so

465
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.990
Donita McClintic: It's like you're in my head.

466
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.280
Richelle Direny: But when you understand what I need to hear

467
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.140
Richelle Direny: You, but you have to

468
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.150
Donita McClintic: You have to say that to yourself like

469
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.790
Richelle Direny: I love you enough because you're not saying to him, I

470
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.360
Donita McClintic: Don't you

471
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.980
Richelle Direny: What I'm saying to you.

472
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.420
Richelle Direny: Is that I love you in

473
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.670
Richelle Direny: To walk away. Yes.

474
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.810
Donita McClintic: I need to do better.

475
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.990
Richelle Direny: Right. If you love me, then you walk away and

476
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.100
Richelle Direny: Come here with me.

477
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.570
Richelle Direny: But I love you enough to

478
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.840
Richelle Direny: Say, I cannot stay on that. I don't want to stay in that

479
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.980
Richelle Direny: Store, because the longer I stay in it, the more

480
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.260
Donita McClintic: I could lose my mother.

481
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.670
Donita McClintic: My father

482
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:32.160
Richelle Direny: Not just lose them physically I they could die and then I'm not there now.

483
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:38.370
Donita McClintic: You talk about depression. Now give me a tranquilizer because

484
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.220
Donita McClintic: You understand. So yes, I do. Yeah, I've thought about that before.

485
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:51.630
Donita McClintic: And I would I would really if that was that happened, I would really hate him and that definitely would be toxic for both of us because

486
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.910
Donita McClintic: Because then you're gonna blame him.

487
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:54.540
Donita McClintic: For the

488
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.470
Richelle Direny: choices you made because he didn't make you make those choices.

489
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:59.250
Donita McClintic: You make them.

490
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.320
Richelle Direny: But you're going to blame him.

491
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.270
Richelle Direny: Because you're going to look at the fact that

492
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.520
Richelle Direny: Because you love him so much.

493
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.020
Donita McClintic: Do chose him.

494
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:07.830
Richelle Direny: And you did.

495
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.110
Donita McClintic: Your family, you don't have your family or your mom or your son or anybody with you.

496
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.970
Richelle Direny: And so now you're going to, you're going to

497
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.360
Richelle Direny: You're going to you're going to be so blinded by the fact that you

498
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.280
Richelle Direny: made that choice and you're just going to stay focused.

499
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.540
Richelle Direny: On hand, like you said,

500
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.770
Donita McClintic: And so

501
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:27.480
Donita McClintic: For you, you said I love you would not walk away. I love you enough to choose.

502
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.650
Richelle Direny: If you can write down

503
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.520
All of the things

504
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.200
Richelle Direny: That

505
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:38.820
Donita McClintic: You

506
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:39.690
Richelle Direny: could lose

507
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.250
Donita McClintic: If you relax.

508
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.540
Richelle Direny: Because remember, I told you.

509
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.640
Donita McClintic: The first 30 days.

510
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:46.680
Richelle Direny: Of a detox.

511
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.790
Donita McClintic: Is very hard.

512
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:52.560
Richelle Direny: Because, like, your body is constantly craving and your body is constantly craving it

513
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.720
Richelle Direny: To pass the first 30 days.

514
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.520
Richelle Direny: I am not going to say it's a whole lot

515
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.270
Richelle Direny: Easier.

516
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.960
Richelle Direny: But it gets

517
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.040
Richelle Direny: A little bit.

518
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.790
Donita McClintic: It does, it does. And I know a lot of it. Like what's the methadone. I didn't do counseling or nothing after I quit.

519
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.110
Donita McClintic: I don't know, a lot of it was like

520
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.770
Donita McClintic: I didn't really have the physical withdrawal. But I had to trick myself. I had to tell myself.

521
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:27.390
Donita McClintic: Okay, just example if I didn't have nothing. I'd say, Well, I'm one day closer to getting it. I didn't look at, okay, I don't have nothing today like drug wise.

522
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.030
Donita McClintic: I would just one day closer to getting it.

523
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.470
Donita McClintic: So I tried to look at the positive instead of the negative

524
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.680
Donita McClintic: Like I I know a lot of it is it

525
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.730
Donita McClintic: Is what we

526
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.360
Donita McClintic: Are mine. I mean a lot. So

527
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:52.740
Donita McClintic: Yeah, with methadone, I would just think stuff like that and it does get easier. I know until you have them triggered till something triggers it

528
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.850
But

529
00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:01.950
Donita McClintic: Like watching intervention may my sister I we both were going to method and at the same time and

530
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:13.050
Donita McClintic: When I quit she quit right after I did, I, I quit. By choice, she quit because she because I was paying for her to go. Also, and I moved away. So she didn't

531
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:28.950
Donita McClintic: Get to go anymore. But anyway, I can watch intervention and that helped me I guess we're watching how they help them on the counselors or whatever the interventionist and it would bother her like she couldn't watch it, but I could watch it like

532
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.240
Donita McClintic: I don't just

533
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.050
Donita McClintic: That what

534
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.860
Donita McClintic: Was what was, what was it, then, Father, her mother, you

535
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:39.810
Donita McClintic: I think because she's still craved she still wanted

536
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.210
Donita McClintic: Stuff and I didn't

537
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:51.030
Donita McClintic: I did not. I mean I I gained so much weight on methadone my boobs were so big. I mean, my kid and I

538
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.500
Donita McClintic: Was like in a triple f

539
00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

540
00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:02.490
Donita McClintic: They were goaded I couldn't sleep. It was horrible, like one brought lane Bryant was $70 like who can afford that.

541
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.950
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I lost almost 100 pounds after I was to 48 when I

542
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:16.080
Donita McClintic: Start what I quit methadone. I could not breathe as like it's killing me.

543
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.070
Richelle Direny: So for her. It's not like

544
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.110
Donita McClintic: Ya know, she knows

545
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.570
Donita McClintic: She's better now. She's not sure I've done proud of her. She's done great since

546
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.760
Donita McClintic: Almost four years ago.

547
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:42.660
Donita McClintic: Yeah, cuz I've been married almost four years. So yeah, she's done great and it's because we don't hang out like we used to, because she's a trigger to me. You mean we're triggers for each other because we used to do things together.

548
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.190
Donita McClintic: Like functions and whatever and talk about other things, they're not. We don't

549
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:53.070
Donita McClintic: I don't believe we've ever talked about like we used to do stuff together. Honestly, since then.

550
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.340
Donita McClintic: So she doesn't do some boxes, she does.

551
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:01.710
Donita McClintic: She doesn't do anything. Like, I'm proud over. I really am like oh jealous.

552
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.190
Donita McClintic: You know, I mean,

553
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.980
Richelle Direny: So being being aware

554
00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.780
Donita McClintic: She, she heard

555
00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:19.920
Donita McClintic: I said, Actually, when she quit methadone, she started drinking alcohol. So she's kind of she drinks alcohol. Now, instead

556
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:24.000
Richelle Direny: So she switched to what it is such a production. Yep.

557
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.020

Richelle Direny: You can't be my ride or die.

682
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:48.480

683
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.150
Richelle Direny: On with her and I would love to. So

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.740
Richelle Direny: Now that you can see

685
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.850
Richelle Direny: All the obstacles.

686
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.770
Richelle Direny: One of your possible. There's a little bit of additional road. And if I go in that

687
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.360

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.860
Donita McClintic: It sounds simple, to think about how I'm saving

699
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:33.780
Richelle Direny: I mean, I

700
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.470
Richelle Direny: Just think about

701
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:40.800
Donita McClintic: You

702
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.980

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.430
Richelle Direny: I'm a pray for you. You're not being rude.

706
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.750
Richelle Direny: You're not being this

707
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.400
Richelle Direny: What I'm saying is

708
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:57.960
Richelle Direny: I would rather pray

709
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.470
Richelle Direny: For you.

710
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.750
Donita McClintic: Because if I join you.

Richelle Direny: I may pull you

712
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.080
Donita McClintic: Or you may pull

713
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:05.820
Donita McClintic: And so

714
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.980

715
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.990

787
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.020
Richelle Direny: Alright. Have a good one.

788
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.470
Richelle Direny: I'm good, I'm good.

789
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.070
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I'm really, really tired, actually.

790
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:15.870
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Care has been like, all day and all night like I have an IV bag in the refrigerator right now. I told you about what happened right

791
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.780
Richelle Direny: What about the accident.

792
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:39.300
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: He gotten a really bad ATV accident he broke his pelvis and the front and the back and they wanted him to stay in the hospital for two weeks minimum like on morphine or whatever, like not moving. Basically, because the doctor told him that

793
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:52.140
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I guess after you break those two parts of your pelvis, your pelvis is like an egg and like it should just if it shatters it will easily shatter. And if it

794
00:55:52.950 --> 00:56:12.840
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Is then you die, you know. And so I've been so careful with everything with him like to have him not move around or get out or do anything because I don't. I even like Baden in bed, literally, because I don't want him to get up and shatter his pelvis and die, you know,

795
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:24.060
Richelle Direny: And I know that I know I remember you told us told me about it. That's a lot. I mean, I've gone. Did you grow up, what happened on group.

796
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:42.960
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That was the thing. So I called like an hour earlier today, um, because I wanted to know if I could get into a different time. Like if I if I missed that group if there's another one that I could go to like get a different time because

797
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.900
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It 630 that's like when I feed him you know and like

798
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:59.670
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It's like right in the middle of everything I have eight animals here and he can't take care of anything. So I have to take care of all these damn animals feed them all take care of them all.

799
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:09.360
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And they have to feed him and myself, take care of the dishes and anyways. All this goes on, you know, and I called at about 715

800
00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:18.870
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: On group night and it was like to lay. I was in the meeting room for like 1015 minutes and by then they're like, OH groups just ending. And it's like, Oh, great. That's nice.

801
00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:29.640
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And so I called today, like I said, an hour earlier and I was like, are there any other groups like there has to be like during the week that I can make up for, you know, if I miss my

802
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:39.780
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Fine, you know, because it's like right now, instead of normally it would be no problem, but with him like this. It's like a really bad time because I don't have help with anything, you know,

803
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:49.080
Richelle Direny: Let me send an email for for Michigan there typically is no other

804
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:54.240
Richelle Direny: Time. I'm the only thing maybe

805
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.100
Richelle Direny: Is that I run groups and you can

806
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:02.610
Richelle Direny: That's Tuesday at 630

807
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:07.560
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I can see. Okay.

808
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:12.000
Richelle Direny: Maybe. Let me confirm because I, there is a group that goes

809
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.230
Richelle Direny: on Thursdays at 12. I mean, but it's a fairly big group.

810
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:22.170
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That would be awesome. That'd be a lot easier for me to make I wake up really early in the morning.

811
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.800
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I go to bed early. I go to bed like he bought

812
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.030
Richelle Direny: Me confirm because there. I think there is a group that goes on and

813
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.270
Richelle Direny: I want to say 12 o'clock on Monday.

814
00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:37.020
Richelle Direny: I have to find out what they, the group is

815
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:46.230
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And I'll let you know whatever it is honestly the timing is better, even if it's on Friday or Saturday. I don't care. I'd rather have it be at like a time I can make it.

816
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:58.590
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And do you know what I'm going to get my Pika. I don't mean to say that no weird way, but I'm just waiting in the mail. I guess for a peek up and like I don't know when I'm going to get it. So I'm like, Okay, I'm just

817
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:05.010
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: sit here and wait even pee on the phone with, I guess, whoever answers today, get my up

818
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.200
Richelle Direny: Let me find. Now, hold on.

819
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:15.060
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: They said, it's not really a big deal. I don't want to pee. With Dr Fargo anybody who's anybody else.

820
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:19.350
Richelle Direny: Well, I know they send you this, they send you everything and then you send out

821
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:23.850
Richelle Direny: Something

822
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.550
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It was they said it was going to be a test that could read on demonic because they aren't

823
00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:40.980
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: So they said, They're not like sending anything out right now because of the virus, you know, so they said it would read everything right there, like in the bathroom, I guess, which is good. I mean, that's

824
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:43.890
Richelle Direny: I think they, I think you go to the line.

825
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:54.600
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Oh, well, no. Oh, no. I talked to the doctor about this last week. And because the labs are so it's such like a

826
00:59:55.410 --> 01:00:06.870
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Like a D priority to like everybody because of the stupid virus that it would take like literally almost a month for me to get in and so last week when I talked on the phone.

827
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:22.650
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And it was just like, we're just going to mail you the pika, and it's going to have every single thing on it and you're going to do it over the phone like you know like pee and show the cup and everything you know you in the bathroom alone, you have to show

828
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.460
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That I'm

829
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.020
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: God

830
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:36.240
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I don't know if it was Dr Fargo, or if it was that woman in the breakout room. You know that I go into when I admit

831
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:47.700
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: You know, to my meetings or whatever. But it was one of those to I mean they had my address correct and everything. It was really weird. And I was like, okay, that's fine too. I mean, whatever, I would just like to know.

832
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:59.490
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: What I need to do. You know, I want to be like 100% cooperative. But then again, like I don't know what the hell to do because like I said, you're like, Oh, no, you need to get labs and when I talked to Dr. Dr Fargo last week.

833
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:06.630
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: They were mailing me my things so that I can do it like virtually, I guess.

834
01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.760
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And if you don't see that. Then I'll I can get them done. It's just going to take

835
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:45.690
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: A little bit because like I said, they're not prioritizing it at all. Like when I called the hospital. It's literally like life or death or giving birth, you know, type of thing now with COPD and we only have one hospital and Manistee, and one walk in clinic.

836
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.740
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Which sucks.

837
01:01:54.090 --> 01:02:02.040
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And I don't drive and my husband, like a said can't even get out of bed so

838
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:17.850
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That's why they said they were going to mail me the test. And I was just going to do it virtually and I'm totally okay with that. I would just like to know when to expect it. Because like I live with his mother, you know me and like I mean there's other people you know I

839
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:20.100
Richelle Direny: Know you guys know what his mommy said

840
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:33.570
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Well, I mean, like we have like our own little area, but we're on like his mom's property, you know, like, I mean this is technically his mom's house like his mom's little trailer that we're in, you know, so like

841
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.430
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: The thing is, is that

842
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:43.770
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: All of the mail goes to just one main mailbox. It's not like you know any mean like here for your trailer and your treat you know to mean like

843
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:57.300
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: You know, it doesn't have like one for every five trail, you know, for the five trailers, or whatever the heck, it's just one mailbox, you know. So like I said, I just don't want somebody getting it and like throwing it away or doing something stupid, not knowing what it is you know

844
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:11.580
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It'd be better if I knew what to expect it, or at least around what day to expect it so that I can tell them hey can you watch for us in the mail. I know it's really weird, but like, you know, I mean, people aren't really going into the offices now and then.

845
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.110
Richelle Direny: Okay, hold on.

846
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.330
Richelle Direny: I'm getting she's responding to me.

847
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.510
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Not trying to sound like weirdo. But I promise you, these were things that were told to me. I wouldn't just say that, you know,

848
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:15.210
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And I don't mind getting everything weekly if I have to until my labs are done. I mean, it doesn't matter to me. It's all I take, you know, so it's not like a really care if I have to get it a week, get a time until my labs are done. You know, it's just the fact that

849
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:29.100
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It's not like a priority. You know, I've called the hospital and the walking clinic and like as soon as I can get in as a little bit over three weeks. It's like 17 days or something, you know, they're like, we just don't have priority for that right now. And they asked

850
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.940
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Us connect gloves. And if I've been out of the country and all this crap. And if I have a cough and it's like

851
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:47.880
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I don't want to go through that when I go in there, especially if they've seen people like that you know that have had a call for been out of the country like no I don't want to get sick with that crap.

852
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:54.150

903
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:44.490
Richelle Direny: Okay, no reason why I have to ask because they have you scared. That's what they have you scheduled past that. That's what we're doing. But if we did that. We don't need to do that again. And so

904
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:55.920
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Yeah, I wouldn't be su even asked me if there was a history of cancer in my family.

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.540
Richelle Direny: Okay.

906
01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.030
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: But like I said, if you don't have it saved and I can say that I'm an egg.

907
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.480
No.

908
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:19.260
Richelle Direny: No, it's not me that that doesn't have it saved because I just the only time I see us meeting is I'm only time I actually have a meeting is

909
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.860
Richelle Direny: When we met for group.

910
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:36.330
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: weird, that's weird. Ya know, we met. We met before group. We met the same exact day. Like I said that I met that I was on the phone doctor for our go and he sent me up with you but

911
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:47.580
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: We talked about everything. And like I said, we did the whole thing about my siblings. My family history, like all that homicidal suicide, all that stuff, but I don't care, I can answer it again if you want me to

912
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:56.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I'm gonna have to do. I don't think yeah because I'm trying to think that it's

913
01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:09.180
Richelle Direny: I'm trying to see if you met with somebody else and they went through that if you did your intake, because usually your first appointment in all of everything that I'm looking at here. Um, I do see that you

914
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.750
Richelle Direny: met me quite a few people.

915
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.320
Richelle Direny: Rice.

916
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:23.790
Richelle Direny: And a lot of those questions. I think you would have done with Dr farago as well, which is

917
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.890
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Oh yeah, probably. Mm hmm.

918
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:41.790
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And like I said, I call if I miss group like I don't like ever like call like Miss group and not call, you know, like, usually I call either when it's like in the middle of it, or in the end of it or

919
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:51.150
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Because I missed it. And I was trying to find out if there was another group, I could get into. Do you know, and honestly, the guy like was like

920
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:59.820
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Just one moment, bear with me here for like 20 minutes on the phone. And then he was finally like looks like that's the only group, you can get into.

921
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:08.460
Richelle Direny: And then place it for right now it is honestly. So you're in Michigan. I'm the only therapist that, well, I'm the only there's another

922
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:22.470
Richelle Direny: There is another therapist that is in Michigan. But the thing is, she only I think she has her groups on my Monday and she only has like a small number of patients and she see because so I'm the one that you would do grew up with.

923
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.270
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And for right now, so he told

924
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:35.430
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Was like Monday nitro and maybe. And I was like, you know, the timing would be better, but at the same point in time, like I would. I wouldn't want to meet with anybody else really except for you, you know,

925
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:43.710
Richelle Direny: She is, she would. It would just be that you would go to her group alone. That's all you would do, you would just go to her group alone.

926
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.590
Richelle Direny: But the thing is, she would have to approve you coming to her group.

927
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.820
Richelle Direny: She would have to approve you coming to her group. And she said,

928
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:59.160
Richelle Direny: Hey, I have to ask her, because she only sees

929
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:08.910
Richelle Direny: A certain number of people in her group. And I don't know if these people that come to her group. I think they've been in the program for a long time. And that's the reason why

930
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:23.700
Richelle Direny: She hasn't set that way. So I sent her a message to see because I do understand, like you said, you have your husband that you are taking care of your caregiver for him right now. So, you know, I understand the difficulty in

931
01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:24.750
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Having to if it

932
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:38.280
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Was just him. It wouldn't be that bad. But it's him plus three, three turtles a cat and five dogs and one of the dogs, a puppy with a cleft palate. So like it's harder than I make it sound, you know,

933
01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:42.000
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And yeah and that's and that's

934
01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.170
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: An alignment Maltese. Sorry. Right.

935
01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.260
Richelle Direny: Yeah, the one that you showed me the on the last time.

936
01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:50.280
Yeah.

937
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:54.900
Richelle Direny: Everybody thinks that she

938
01:14:55.290 --> 01:15:06.180
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Everybody thinks that she won ACM like ways then like, you know, like outside one party they think he's a sheep because he has so much for like he looks like a sheep dog. It's funny.

939
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:18.750
Richelle Direny: They just said she just responded and said that for the nothing was sent out as yeah so they haven't sent out the call. So she said that when they send it out, you will get a tracking number

940
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:26.250
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Awesome. Just like I said I can get the cup myself. You know what I mean, I don't want to have any issues with this.

941
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:36.660
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. So unfortunately I don't know who you spoke to, and I don't see because I'm looking through I'm going all the way back to

942
01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.530
Richelle Direny: Okay, so they just require they just requested for them to send

943
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:52.950
Richelle Direny: Yes, they just requested for them to send it out. They have not sent it out here. So they just she just put in a request to have it sent down

944
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:54.780
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Okay, cool, cool.

945
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.470
Awesome.

946
01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.900
Richelle Direny: Alright so much. No problem. So once I find out about the arm.

947
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:02.940
Richelle Direny: Once I find out

948
01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.820
Richelle Direny: About the, the group, I will let you know.

949
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:12.750
Richelle Direny: If you because I think that's what I think that's the time that she does her group, she does her groups on Mondays at

950
01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:22.080
Richelle Direny: She does it on Mondays at noon, but I don't know if it's every week or every other week, whereas I do my every um

951
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

952
01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:24.840
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I know Amy and

953
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so she she would have to submit termination.

954
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:47.310
Richelle Direny: So okay, so now. Yeah. In looking at everything here. Um, I don't know if like some of those questions, or whatever the situation is was because I remember looking at it here to see all of the times that we've met. And I remember you come into group that one time.

955
01:16:48.600 --> 01:17:01.770
Richelle Direny: So in terms of your bio. Your I haven't seen you outside of I'm looking at the calendar, all the way back. So, and your I haven't seen you for your bio. So basically,

956
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:10.890
Richelle Direny: It's just, let's just run through it because I don't know if somebody that you spoke to you know what there is someone that you did speak to that may have asked for a lot of those questions.

957
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:18.180
Richelle Direny: I think her name is RJ and she's the one that does the intake. So there's somebody that does a different type of admission.

958
01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:22.830
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably. I know I just I just know I've answered the questions twice.

959
01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.910
Richelle Direny: One for the darker and then

960
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:24.450
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: One for some

961
01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.190
Richelle Direny: Yeah, when you did the admission, because I'm looking in. I said,

962
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:43.440
Richelle Direny: I can't remember ever meeting, but I do remember you in group. And when we made the appointment with Dr farago but uh, you know, so just to quickly run through how did you. So tell me, how did you hear about bright heart. Who told you a proper heart.

963
01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.700
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I found it online, actually.

964
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.940
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you were just looking for a program

965
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:56.970
Richelle Direny: That would be benefiting from home.

966
01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:06.000
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm sure the quarantine thing to, you know, and, um, I had a previous doctor

967
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.800
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That I was seeing as like a primary care doctor and

968
01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:23.970
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: He had tried to get me to take oxycodone 7.5 and I told him that I had been seeing a special doctor and getting some detox from that doctor

969
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:29.190
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And his response was, Well, I'm not a special doctor and I don't prescribe some detox.

970
01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:37.080
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And I said, Okay, well, I can't take that and he said, well, this is what I'm prescribing you and this is what you should be taking and need to be taking

971
01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:47.100
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: For your pain because I have a disc demoing disease in my back. I was in a really bad car accident 2016 and my spine is slowly going away.

972
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:50.370
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And so anyways I never took these pills.

973
01:18:50.820 --> 01:19:03.510
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I filled them and then I went to the hospital I dispose of them. And I kept taking my be morphine, because I had like a week and a half left. You know, I was just trying to see if my doctor would prescribe it

974
01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:12.120
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: So that I didn't have to freak out. Basically, you know, and he wouldn't you know he's not very nice about it. So I made an appointment for five days later.

975
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:20.790
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: To go in there and say my kidneys her from taking medication, you know, just to see if you would give me some you text, then you know because it's like

976
01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:34.440
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: No, this doesn't work for me. I don't know how many times. I'm gonna have to tell you it but I take ibuprofen during the day, all day because I'm in pain, and I can't combo this and it profaned and I don't want it. I don't want opiates. I just want some new tax you know

977
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:37.140
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And he said that he couldn't help me.

978
01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:52.260
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That was it. And so I said, Fine. Screw it. I'll find help myself. Then you know like if you're not going to help me as my primary care doctor than I have to find out myself. Obviously, you know, like, and so that's basically how I found you guys

979
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.150
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Because I was in

980
01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:08.430
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: dire need to find a doctor because no doctor that I was seeing, you know, like I had a savvy tech doctor before I had a primary doctor and he lost his license and

981
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:22.290
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Didn't give me a reason why just get gave me a text message that was one of like 172 all of his patients saying I can't, no longer see you anymore because my license is suspended.

982
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:35.610
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: You know, they're doing this to a lot of doctors that are prescribing Suboxone and sub you text to people because they don't want people, you know, getting healthy. And that was all I heard from him.

983
01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.110
Richelle Direny: So why would you

984
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.300
Richelle Direny: When was your first the first time, like when you give your history. When was your first time.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:49.980
Richelle Direny: Just starting on the dependency. How old were you

986
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:52.380
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I

987
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:04.980
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Probably in my early, early, mid 20s.

988
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.650
Richelle Direny: Okay, and that's what and that was after or before the accident.

989
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:25.980
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Um, before I was in X. Before I was in a drastic car accident. I had already been on substances, but when I was when I got in the accident. I was clean. I had been clean for a while.

990
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:29.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what was the drug of choice, prior to the accident.

991
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:36.660
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And it was heroin. But then I moved to my with my husband and

992
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:49.800
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I had no choice but to detox, because everybody knows. Did you go to Hawaii. Like you go to Maui. You're not going to find that kind of a substance on that kind of an island. You know, like it's just it

993
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:51.480
Richelle Direny: Doesn't exist there.

994
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.950
Richelle Direny: You went to Maui.

995
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:55.260
Richelle Direny: Just a vacation.

996
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.340
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I went to mount

997
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.250

998
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:01.590
Richelle Direny: Years. Okay, okay, okay, so why am

999
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:17.250
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I know I'm I'm Korean I'm the weird one. I have. I'm like, I'm mixed. I'm like, very mixed. That's why I have high cheekbones and little eyes and I naturally have white hair but my whole entire family as black hair.

1000
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:31.140
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I was just born without pigment in my hair. That's why you saw me like washing out black hair color because my hair is almost always black or else it looks weird. You know, like people. I was like, What are you, you know,

1002
01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:47.340
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Anyways, yeah. So he moved me out there because he knew that if he moved me out there that I would not be able to get heroin. That's why he moved me out there.

1003
01:22:47.550 --> 01:23:01.290
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: You know me out there because he knew that it was the one safe place for me on this earth that nobody could get drugs across that across three months 3000 miles of ocean. You know, so that's why he moved me there.

1004
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.590
Richelle Direny: And I went to detox there and I got

1078
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:56.130
Richelle Direny: Have you had any history of

1079
01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:06.750

1080
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:07.080
Ever

1081
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:14.280
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Oh, eating disorder. Yeah, but it wasn't because I wanted to kill myself. It was just, I want to be pretty that's all I wanted to be skinny.

1082
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:27.180
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: You know, like I me on it. So I never liked wanted to die from not eating. I just want to be pretty and really skinny. I felt like when I was really tiny. A good flow, you know, and when I was young.

1083
01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.540
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I was in a really bad situation, growing up.

1084
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:43.380
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: So like by the age of five. I learned that like my dad could beat the crap out of me and do what everybody couldn't make me. You know, I could sleep at a dinner table, I could throw my food up you know I could

1085
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:53.100
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Do whatever I had to do when I was, you know, and I mean, when I was a little girl because that was the one thing that I could control, you know, was my eating behaviors and so

1086
01:30:53.700 --> 01:31:02.130
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I think I carry that into my adulthood, you know, um, and even though I've been to treatments for it, you know.

1087
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:13.410
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I think in the past. I mean, not now. I'm 120 pounds and I'm healthy. You know, and I have. I love food. Don't get me wrong, but in the past, um,

1088
01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:23.040
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: You know, doctors could tell me anything they could say that. I mean I got down to 67 pounds and they said that my organs were eating themselves away and I still wouldn't stop.

1089
01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:28.410
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Not eating at, you know what I mean, like, it's just that when you're

1090
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:42.510
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: When you're in a negative behavior like that. And I even got told that treatment that like after I had first gone and clean to be really, really careful because since I am anorexic.

1091
01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:50.160
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And it's just like addiction that will always be in the back of my head. And because I'm anorexic.

1092
01:31:50.730 --> 01:32:07.710
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Right after I get clean my anorexia my pop up like the ghosts in the backyard that I never knew was that you know that I had, you know, that I had basically hidden in the backyard. You know, so that my addiction could take, you know, front stool.

1093
01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:20.100
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And so I learned a lot about that. And so I learned you know that even when I wasn't hungry when I was getting sober that I had to eat, you know,

1094
01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:33.600
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I learned that even if, if I had to live off pizza that I would, you know, I mean, I learned that I needed to eat again and then after learning to eat again. I learned to be healthy again, you know,

1095
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.560
Richelle Direny: Um,

1096
01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:48.990
Richelle Direny: Now you said that when you were in in Hawaii, you were seeing a therapist. Now, now you're not seeing a therapist patient right now, you're not seeing anyone know are you

1097
01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:54.060
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: I have an appointment on the night team. I really see a woman.

1098
01:32:55.410 --> 01:32:58.800
Richelle Direny: Is that for psychiatry or just for Earth individual therapy.

1099
01:33:00.150 --> 01:33:02.220
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It's supposed to be for psychiatry.

1100
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:07.950
Richelle Direny: Okay that's different psychiatry is that they're prescribing medication therapy is like psychotherapy talk therapy.

1101

1103
01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:16.470

1127
01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:23.940
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: She's like one of those moments like balls of steel like she'll just say whatever is on her mind to whoever walks by, like, I mean, I was at my mother's ones in Seattle, and she got really depressed and she said she was going for a walk. She came back five minutes later and said that

1128
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:39.240
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: That she was going to walk in front of a bus, and so my dad called the police and the police showed up at her apartment and asked her, Are you suicidal and she said that she would have walked in front of their car.

1129
01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:42.240
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Right then, so

1130
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.520

1134
01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:19.500
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: She called me, and she was talking about the people that were next to her. She said she was next to an elderly gentleman named Carl

1135

Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And all he was doing was saying I want my orange juice. I want my own shoes. Where's my effing our shared me eight hours for our chairs, she was telling me these people. And she's like, I thought I was really bad. And then I came in here and I realized

Richelle Direny: The group is scheduled, the better. So I just said I needed what I needed to see was the consistency in the evenings.

1235
01:45:55.650 --> 01:46:02.460
Richelle Direny: And so, and get like a consensus to see who wants to meet in the morning. And then what I would do is just schedule it for the morning

1236
01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:15.000
Richelle Direny: But for right now, we're going to keep it in the evening, but I know that I could do a group in the morning at 11 with Dr Fraga when he does his medication checking, just to do the group together. But I told him to me.

1237
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:15.390
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: It.

1238
01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:23.460
Richelle Direny: To me, yeah. I wonder if I do do that live. I'll let everyone know so whoever is able to meet in the morning, they could just go ahead and meet in the morning for group. Okay.

1239
01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.260
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Okay, cool.

1240
01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:26.100
Richelle Direny: But you haven't you

1241
01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:35.220
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Know you just listen to me. And thank you for listening to me. But anyway, so he said, right.

1242
01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:40.170
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: And you got all my health care stuff down. Good to go.

1243
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.120
Richelle Direny: You are good to go. Go on. Yo, yo, yo, what is it the ski.

1244
01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:56.820
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Snow. Oh yeah, I've been down my snowball right over here. Yeah, I will see you for May 6 ensure and we'll see you on Tuesday. So have a great rest of your evening.

1245
01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.800
Hannah Mitchell-Matter: Nice to meet you.
