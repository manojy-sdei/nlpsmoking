00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The last

13
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Few days been for you on an emotional level.

14
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.910
Bethany Shadid: Um,

15
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.590
Bethany Shadid: I just realized this is it.

16
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I still have to open up a note. So we're doing good.

17
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.550
Bethany Shadid: I'm

18
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.820
Bethany Shadid: Mixed mixed feelings. I'm passing a kidney stone.

19
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.010
Bethany Shadid: I'm

20
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.910
Bethany Shadid: Wasn't sure

21
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.660
Bethany Shadid: What to do medicine wise really tried to avoid taking extra

22
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.890
Bethany Shadid: Because they don't want to go up anymore.

23
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.180
Right.

24
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.250
Bethany Shadid: Um,

25
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.800
Bethany Shadid: So, um,

26
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.940
Bethany Shadid: I I'm

27
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.690
Bethany Shadid: Down. Well, I was down to six, which is good. And now after taking

28
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.190
Bethany Shadid: Three days of a little bit more admits and back down to 6.5

29
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

30
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.420
Bethany Shadid: So,

31
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.220
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

32
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.140
Bethany Shadid: Um, I kind of went

33
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.550
Bethany Shadid: And made this weekend.

34
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.970
Bethany Shadid: I'm all about

35
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.080
Bethany Shadid: Doing stuff. I enjoy

36
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Me what you did.

37
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.740
Bethany Shadid: Lots of arts, crafts pulled it all on the tools outs.

38
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.750
Bethany Shadid: And weights.

39
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.300
Bethany Shadid: And

40
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.560
Bethany Shadid: I really enjoyed that got some fun stuff done.

41
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.580
Bethany Shadid: But

42
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.790
Bethany Shadid: In addition to my own stuff going on some other stuff came up like

43
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.660
Bethany Shadid: My sister lives in Seattle.

44
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.350
Bethany Shadid: And she went to join in the protests out there.

45
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.310
Okay.

46
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.390
Bethany Shadid: And told me that I was the only one that was telling

47
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:54.600
Bethany Shadid: Because she don't want you know anybody else in the family to worry your have to deal like my pens don't understand. So I was really nervous. After watching the news and seeing, you know, everything on fire and

48
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.210
Bethany Shadid: But she's okay um and she wasn't there for that part of it. No, I think.

49
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.050
Bethany Shadid: She went, you know, to

50
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.470
Bethany Shadid: Support

51
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:22.680
Bethany Shadid: But not pillage as what's going on right now so that that's really sad talking to her about that too. Um,

52
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.670
Bethany Shadid: And then a friend to friends that I work worked with

53
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.740
Bethany Shadid: Had a

54
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:38.340
Bethany Shadid: Crazy falling out. And, um,

55
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.180
Bethany Shadid: It was something that I was able to give

56
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:58.290
Bethany Shadid: A lot of perspective on. I have a friend that's very similar to me in giving all the trust and everything right up front and

57
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.080
Bethany Shadid: Not some

58
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:09.150
Bethany Shadid: You know, waiting to you know make sure the person is, you know, worthy of

59
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.290
Bethany Shadid: Having that trust.

60
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.100
Bethany Shadid: And

61
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.880
Bethany Shadid: So that was interesting being on the other side of it, you know.

62
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: How you advised her because when we teach something in reinforces that deep knowing you know

63
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.310
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, yeah. Well, and I told her to. I say, you know,

64
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.890
Bethany Shadid: You're I told her, I said, You're, you're a lot like rule I see it. You're a lot like me you have very big hearts.

65
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.520
Bethany Shadid: And you are eager to help and

66
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.490
Bethany Shadid: Be there for people and you put yourself out there right away.

67
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.750
Bethany Shadid: Even when that person hasn't demonstrated that they are

68
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.520
Bethany Shadid: Not worthy. What was the word that he

69
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.230
Bethany Shadid: Deserved that or

70
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.610
Bethany Shadid: Can be trusted with that. Yeah, and

71
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.740
Bethany Shadid: She

72
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:39.030
Bethany Shadid: She said, Yes, it takes me a minute but now I see her true colors.

73
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.950
Bethany Shadid: And I'm done.

74
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.050
Bethany Shadid: But the other girl because I know both of them, she's in a much

75
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.080
Bethany Shadid: Different place she's

76
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.450
Bethany Shadid: Four kids single mom.

77
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:22.260
Bethany Shadid: Teenage parent. Yeah, and came from a really rough background and she's used to the drama and chaos and lies and everything. And so when you get somebody like myself or my friend.

78
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.280
Bethany Shadid: In a situation with somebody like that.

79
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.240
Bethany Shadid: I mean, I've been in that situation, many times.

80
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.850
Bethany Shadid: It's

81
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.050
Bethany Shadid: Can be disorienting when the person completely flips or

82
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.930
Bethany Shadid: They're upset about something that you're, you know, you don't understand, like,

83
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.070
Bethany Shadid: This girl slipped out because

84
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:58.170
Bethany Shadid: She's, she's jealous. She's afraid that her friendship is

85
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:10.980
Bethany Shadid: She's not the priority friend like she's losing another one. So instead of saying something like that she flips out the other way and gets angry at her and

86
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.400
Bethany Shadid: Tries to make it like you, you're doing this wrong.

87
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.440
Bethany Shadid: So anyway, so that was that was interesting.

88
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.870
Bethany Shadid: But I

89
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.290
Bethany Shadid: As far as like myself and

90
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:44.580
Bethany Shadid: I'm that that was distracting. All that was very distracting and I I knew I needed to be good to myself.

91
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.450
Bethany Shadid: I did all the crafting stuff and try to

92
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:59.580
Bethany Shadid: You know, stick with some of the new habits that I've been putting in place and stuff.

93
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.280
Bethany Shadid: But I did catch myself.

94
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.320
Bethany Shadid: I'm

95
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.390
Bethany Shadid: Kind of

96
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:22.230
Bethany Shadid: Going back to that thought pattern like one day I didn't go on my walk, but I have seen kidney stone right but I caught myself going to that.

97
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.830
Bethany Shadid: Negative place of see

98
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.520
Bethany Shadid: You know you can't do this or you can't maintain this kind of thing.

99
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.770
Bethany Shadid: And I caught myself, almost like it's a like I am passing a kidney stone.

100
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.050
Bethany Shadid: Chill out

101
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.360
Bethany Shadid: It.

102
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't work. Did that not stopping work.

103
00:12:50.100 --> 00:13:01.500
Bethany Shadid: It did. It did. Actually, I was like, This is ridiculous. I can miss a date of walking without throwing all the progress. I've made out the window, you know,

104
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.690
Bethany Shadid: And so

105
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:12.720
Bethany Shadid: I went the other way, with all of my taking care of myself and yeah

106
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes so cool.

107
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, had you not done that.

108
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Remember how that day could have gone

109
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Some days were in pain Sundays we gotta cut ourselves slack other days we got really high energy and boy we ambitious other days at something else.

110
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicely done really sounds like it was a graceful meeting of just your human nature just. There it is.

111
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.340
Bethany Shadid: And I've

112
00:13:50.820 --> 00:14:00.780
Bethany Shadid: Had to learn to be okay catching myself going back to that you know what i mean i in the past.

113
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.860
Bethany Shadid: If I even catch myself going there.

114
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.770
Bethany Shadid: I'm upset, like, oh, next time I can't even go there.

115
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

116
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.360
Bethany Shadid: So yeah, I'm trying

117
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.900
Bethany Shadid: To know kinder to myself.

118
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.130
Yeah.

119
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that that label that you did that it. That's the troublemaker. So, yo. See you, you had to use a tool.

120
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: No, silly.

121
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.620
Bethany Shadid: I will go ahead

122
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd rather hear from you.

123
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.470
Bethany Shadid: I will say that

124
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.870
Bethany Shadid: The other thing that came up for me was my parents.

125
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.860
Bethany Shadid: Okay, my mom texted me

126
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.930
Bethany Shadid: A picture of the cake that she did.

127
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:15.900
Bethany Shadid: For a wedding, which I was kind of like how is anybody doing a wedding right now, whatever. Um,

128
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:33.210
Bethany Shadid: And it and it said, you know, she she was like, I, I miss you, you know, hope we can see you sometime and my parents had asked me last Sunday. If I would come over

129
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:48.690
Bethany Shadid: And you know I told them. It wasn't a good time. Right. And I said, but I'll let you know when I can come over and I hadn't gotten back to them about it. And so my mom.

130
00:15:49.890 --> 00:16:04.500
Bethany Shadid: You know texted me that message and I immediately kind of went to that guilt place and later my, my dad texted me and was just like, love you.

131
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and I

132
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:17.610
Bethany Shadid: Was feeling so guilty. Right. And I read, you know, I was like, I'm going over the stuff in my head like

133
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.950
Bethany Shadid: I realize how something that little

134
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.950
Bethany Shadid: That manipulation.

135
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.900
Bethany Shadid: Is so ingrained right where you can just say,

136
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.200
Bethany Shadid: You know,

137
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:46.020
Bethany Shadid: For anybody else it would just be like hope we can see you sometime, that would be great. You know, like nothing else but i i read so much into it because I've been trained

138
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.850
Bethany Shadid: And I know this is hard.

139
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.350
Bethany Shadid: I started going down this path in my mind.

140
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.110
Bethany Shadid: And I was just kind of trying to observe

141
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.130
Bethany Shadid: You know where it was going. And I realized

142
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.250
Bethany Shadid: That I was

143
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.520
Bethany Shadid: Having like an argument in my head with them.

144
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.910
Bethany Shadid: Going over

145
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.450
Bethany Shadid: Like blaming them for my

146
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.000
Bethany Shadid: Issues.

147
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:42.990
Bethany Shadid: And why and justifying and if you only knew how this affected me and

148
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:50.790
Bethany Shadid: Over. Over. Over. Like all of the dirt and all of that hurt and all of the

149
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.980
Bethany Shadid: And

150
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.230
Bethany Shadid: It will it

151
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.800
Bethany Shadid: Hi, then stopped and

152
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.810
Bethany Shadid: I was like, this isn't helpful. Okay, um,

153
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.510
Bethany Shadid: I was like, I

154
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.560
Bethany Shadid: I know I so desperately wants

155
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:35.820
Bethany Shadid: To like have them sit down and me be able to say everything and be understood and believed, but that's not reality and

156
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.200
Bethany Shadid: There's, I realized that that's

157
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.870
Bethany Shadid: A very slippery slope for me to go to that.

158
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.550
Bethany Shadid: Place where I want to help and change them.

159
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.770
Bethany Shadid: And

160
00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:02.310
Bethany Shadid: So it's like one step to another as I'm like making this connection in my head like, okay, that's why.

161
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:12.780
Bethany Shadid: I want to help and fix and have them understand and grow because I want this kind of relationship with them.

162
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.300
Bethany Shadid: Okay, but that's not

163
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.490
Bethany Shadid: That's not going to happen. I can only, you know,

164
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.650
Bethany Shadid: Work on me.

165
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:30.720
Bethany Shadid: And accepting what they're able to give me his parents.

166
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a high pitch. You just want real high. What does that mean,

167
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What they have to give parents

168
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:39.810
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

169
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.720
Bethany Shadid: It feels like when I get there. When I'm telling myself, you know,

170
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.050
Bethany Shadid: I need to appreciate

171
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.160
Bethany Shadid: What they're able to give me

172
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.770
Bethany Shadid: It feels so little.

173
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. That's right. That's right. That's your you're registering the BS part. Let's do inner personal and I know this is hard.

174
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:09.660
Bethany Shadid: But

175
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to represent either your mom or your dad right now and let's do that hard stuff where you intermittently make eye contact and you tell me how I have screwed up your life.

176
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: As much as you can.

177
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.660
Bethany Shadid: Like you're my mom or my dad.

178
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can move and change as you needed to

179
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But tell me,

180
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Understood and believed. That's what you want.

181
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.460
Yeah.

182
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: As much as you can, intermittently make eye contact with me while you're doing it, all the better for you. Okay.

183
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And paying attention to how it feels.

184
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.170
Okay.

185
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So get your breath away from right up high, bring you down here. There we go. Let those shoulders drop

186
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.560
Bethany Shadid: I find myself wanting to explain

187
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you instead be a little brat be the hands on the hips.

188
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you get to be loud. You're rational

189
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to be angry.

190
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go too sad. I don't have a right to be angry. Yeah, there you go.

191
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be logical, just let me have it.

192
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.220
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

193
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.950
Bethany Shadid: Like, I can't even put into words.

194
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so put your hands out here. That's right. So put the hands out like this.

195
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.810
Bethany Shadid: How

196
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.330
Bethany Shadid: Yesterday frustrated. I am

197
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.190
Bethany Shadid: That you could

198
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.360
Bethany Shadid: Be upset with me.

199
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.210
Bethany Shadid: For not

200
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.420
Bethany Shadid: calling or texting often enough when

201
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.210
Bethany Shadid: I have

202
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:32.160
Bethany Shadid: To mentally prepare myself to be around you guys and then deal with the fallout afterwards.

203
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.440
Bethany Shadid: You guys have no willingness

204
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.360
Bethany Shadid: To understand me or

205
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.840
Bethany Shadid: Put yourself in my shoes.

206
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.110
Bethany Shadid: And it's devastating to me.

207
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:08.940
Bethany Shadid: I can't fix you. I can't change you. I can't make you love me the way that I want to be.

208
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.870
Bethany Shadid: Or believed or trusted

209
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.140
Bethany Shadid: And so I'm left

210
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.620
Bethany Shadid: With the very little.

211
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.710
Bethany Shadid: You're willing to give

212
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.550
Bethany Shadid: And as a 35 year old woman.

213
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.030
Bethany Shadid: The parenting needs to change. I'm not a child.

214
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling right now.

215
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.090
Bethany Shadid: That's all good.

216
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion to parenting needs to change them a 35 year old woman.

217
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what's that emotion. What are we getting close to

218
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.140
Bethany Shadid: Anger.

219
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: With that, see if you can find more where you resent me

220
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're right. You've reached a limit.

221
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting to that limit.

222
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

223
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.880
Bethany Shadid: I'm so tired of

224
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.990
Bethany Shadid: Emotional

225
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.280
Bethany Shadid: By you got

226
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.550
Bethany Shadid: When

227
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.720
Bethany Shadid: It should be obvious that I'm really struggling

228
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.340
Bethany Shadid: And all you

229
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:54.330
Bethany Shadid: Is comfort consideration support. I don't need you to do my finances for me. I don't really do you to tell me how to live.

230
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.320
Bethany Shadid: But I would like

231
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.300
Bethany Shadid: Like

232
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.400
Bethany Shadid: Some genuine no strings attached.

233
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.570
Bethany Shadid: comfort and support.

234
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.210
Bethany Shadid: I can't

235
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:32.070
Bethany Shadid: Ask you to change some things about yourself and how you deal with me.

236
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.860
Bethany Shadid: Then please understand

237
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.410
Bethany Shadid: That is going to limit my ability

238
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.510
Bethany Shadid: To be

239
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.550
Bethany Shadid: With you.

240
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Can tell me that again.

241
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.480
Bethany Shadid: If you can't change.

242
00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.030
Bethany Shadid: Anything about yourself to have a relationship with me.

243
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.430
Bethany Shadid: Please understand,

244
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.440
Bethany Shadid: That I have to limit my time with you.

245
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.950
Bethany Shadid: Because of how traumatic, it can be for me.

246
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.950
Bethany Shadid: The disregard for my well being.

247
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.720
Bethany Shadid: I need to put myself.

248
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.520
Bethany Shadid: First

249
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.200
A brief, brief.

250
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just feel that all the way through top of your head all the way. Wash just this perfect temperature of truth washing through you around you.

251
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: saturating every part of you.

252
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I will take care of myself.

253
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I see you will not change. I will take care of myself and keep myself safe.

254
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And strings are attached

255
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I

256
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I accept your generosity, as is. I will not accept

257
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: This names.

258
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: you text me a text as a text as a text. Okay.

259
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the string for strings attached, you sever the strings.

260
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't see you. They don't see them, you do, and you go

261
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To Texas Texas a text.

262
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You did that you made this beautiful little thing right here. Right.

263
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And if this is about boundaries. If this is about

264
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I have healthy detachment and I'm responsible for cutting

265
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The

266
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Message strings.

267
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The way they hook you and get you and pull you like a puppet.

268
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.960
Bethany Shadid: You have meaning to me how quickly.

269
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do. Yeah.

270
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:31.380
Bethany Shadid: And then you know what I realized is that the same thing. I was doing with that argument in my head that going over everything.

271
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:43.290
Bethany Shadid: I did that with my coworkers, my boss, you know, every time like something would come up i i'd be

272
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.000
Bethany Shadid: In my head, trying to argue my point.

273
00:28:50.010 --> 00:29:01.530
Bethany Shadid: Because it's like, I don't know. Is it that I I don't do that in real life. I don't just say it, you know, in the moment. So I do it in my head.

274
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's, you don't want to make a mistake. I think you you don't want to be wrong. You don't want to

275
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean that the habit of it is is obviously that's in your relationship with your family.

276
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that preparation that you busy doing, making sure there's no way I hurt anybody's feelings. Is there any way I could possibly be off wrong mistaken, you run it through the systems check over and over and over that. That's the way it looks to me.

277
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:37.800
Bethany Shadid: That's a, that's a really good point, yeah, I just thought it was just so you know making that connection of it's exactly the same. That's exactly

278
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.920
Bethany Shadid: I'm doing the same thing, you know.

279
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.240
Bethany Shadid: Trying to learn from it.

280
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all boils down to you.

281
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Not believing you

282
00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This is this is that right, I don't believe in what I'm saying what I'm feeling this is happening. I don't need to explain it. I don't need to justify it. This is, this is real for me.

283
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And

284
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And by the way, you know, with that texts that you did to your family about I'm not really ready to come over. I'm going to, I'll let you know a little bit. What was that like we didn't even talk about that. That's a real clear limit setting.

285
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.690
Bethany Shadid: Um,

286
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:39.870
Bethany Shadid: I guess I didn't see it that way because I made it more like

287
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.810
Bethany Shadid: I don't know what my schedule.

288
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.600
Bethany Shadid: I'm used to the lie.

289
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:47.310
Bethany Shadid: To them.

290
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So just felt like a lie. Kinda because you're you have less to do you actually have more time.

291
00:30:54.690 --> 00:31:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. I got you. Okay, so it didn't feel like limit setting you did the lower calling alive. Okay.

292
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.200
Bethany Shadid: Right.

293
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:20.430
Bethany Shadid: Because that's in terms of like worrying about how I dealt with things like the overeating was my rebellion. So as the line I could lie. I knew exactly what they wanted to hear. So I could

294
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.060
Bethany Shadid: Do what I wanted. If I lied.

295
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.310
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so

296
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: which reinforces the problematic. I'm not good enough. So that's a real problem, not because, you know, whatever, but it just doesn't reinforce the thing that I'm wanting for you, which is this inner core of I'm just

297
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine. Right. Right. You know that there's no need to lie.

298
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.050
Yeah.

299
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:44.790
Bethany Shadid: Yeah think

300
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.530
Bethany Shadid: About it. Honestly, I'm not a dishonest person in general.

301
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just not

302
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:58.050
Bethany Shadid: very open and honest, except when it comes to them and that just became a coping mechanism.

303
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:05.550
Bethany Shadid: It was much easier. Like, oh you know all the questioning from my dad much easier to just lie.

304
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.150
Bethany Shadid: Oh yeah yeah I did that.

305
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And so since it's not, you know, pervasive and and you are

306
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Quite genuine maybe we won't call it lying. Maybe it's a matter of

307
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Making it easy for them to accept.

308
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To palette boundary setting because what you're doing is you're making it easy easier for them to accept the the raw which they can't hear.

309
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're making it easier for them to accept your limit setting. So I don't necessarily, you know, again, there it is. It's adaptive and I don't think I'm using rationalization I indeed think that they can't hear your raw. Some people can take that they are nowhere near ready to to hear

310
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.410
Bethany Shadid: It.

311
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't even say it out loud. They're not gonna they're just not ready. So you're making. It's actually a kindness, that's a more palatable thing for them to hear. Oh, she's busy.

312
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:12.840
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

313
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that I'm sitting here just curled in a bowl for hours, you know, questioning whether I have the right to be angry and tear around your failed parenting, you know, I mean, they're not trying to hear that.

314
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.490
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, if anything they want to avoid it.

315
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you're you're helping

316
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just making it easy for them. That's all.

317
00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.430
Yeah.

318
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am sorry it is it's necessary sound like it is.

319
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't eating away at you.

320
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that way you have to cloak things in kind of fibbing

321
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it eating away at you.

322
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.130
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

323
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.910
Bethany Shadid: Like not recent Lee.

324
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.110
Okay.

325
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.960
Bethany Shadid: But I think

326
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.310
Bethany Shadid: My parents view, they don't

327
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.130
Bethany Shadid: So,

328
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:47.970
Bethany Shadid: There are already trust issues with my parents right from everything that happened, but because lying became a coping mechanism. It also

329
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:54.570
Bethany Shadid: Reinforced them not being able to believe me under percent

330
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Not ironic.

331
00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:04.380
Bethany Shadid: Right, right. So it didn't get me what I wanted at all, which is for them to believe

332
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.520
Bethany Shadid: And trust me, and so

333
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.560
Bethany Shadid: I mean, I think.

334
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.630
Bethany Shadid: A lot of times the feeling is when I'm around them.

335
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:29.760
Bethany Shadid: Is that they just don't know who I am like this person that they're the way they're treating me

336
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:37.590
Bethany Shadid: I also want to look you know behind me, like who are you talking to, like, if you really knew me

337
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:50.370
Bethany Shadid: Like this is so outrageous what you're saying. And I realized they just really don't know who I am. And that's the part that

338
00:35:51.930 --> 00:36:00.660
Bethany Shadid: Is frustrating and hard to deal with. Right. Because like with my close friends and everything.

339
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:18.390
Bethany Shadid: There's a certain amount of understanding where, you know, you just go, oh, that's just Paula, you know, she does that you, you know, don't worry about it, but I don't have that with because they don't know

340
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:25.650
Bethany Shadid: I honestly at one point really like had to like ask myself like

341
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.380
Bethany Shadid: Who do they think that I am you know like I

342
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:35.610
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

343
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet you could do that behavioral experiment in a light hearted way.

344
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey mom. Just curious. Um, when you're describing me to to your girlfriends. How do you describe me

345
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.230
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, like

346
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Do you think that you'd be interested in knowing

347
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:05.010
Bethany Shadid: Um, I don't know if they would be open about it.

348
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Into that that light hearted kind of thing.

349
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You just happened to be around them. Oh, you were, you were always talking about you to baba friends at church, and I mentioned, you know,

350
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: They had never met you before. And I was talking about you. Oh really. I always wondered how do people you know how we see ourselves differently than other people do. Mom, how do you describe me and you notice happy voice.

351
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.610
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

352
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you

353
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.580
Bethany Shadid: Don't know I

354
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.000
Bethany Shadid: Can think of no no I think she'd be open for it.

355
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.690
Bethany Shadid: The only thing I've ever

356
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.780
Bethany Shadid: What came up, I guess what came up for me when you said that was

357
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.410
Bethany Shadid: My mom.

358
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:10.230
Bethany Shadid: In describing meet other people, the family friends that we grew up with the people that she knows that know me.

359
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.430
Bethany Shadid: She loves to gossip about me and my brother and sister.

360
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.020
Bethany Shadid: And so

361
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:42.420
Bethany Shadid: Because, well I don't know exactly why, but I assume it's because of all the attention she gets from different things. So she tends to talk about the really awful stuff like my health stuff. Okay. Like if she she doesn't

362
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:54.600
Bethany Shadid: Think about, oh, maybe she wouldn't want everybody to know that thought. Never cursed her. So I've actually had people

363
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.600
Bethany Shadid: Like approach me

364
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.100
Bethany Shadid: And tell me they're praying for me because of

365
00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:07.320
Bethany Shadid: You know X, Y, and Z or whatever. And you're like, Wait, what

366
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.910
Bethany Shadid: How did you know about that so

367
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.750
Bethany Shadid: Um, but yeah.

368
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.630
Bethany Shadid: I don't know.

369
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.220
Bethany Shadid: How it would go, it would be interesting to ask them and see what they said.

370
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: She knows she knows you're in therapy right

371
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:33.000
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, oh yeah, and they question every once in a while.

372
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's talk about that in a second.

373
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But it could be something like, Hey, you know,

374
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a little, little thing, you know.

375
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How I describe myself.

376
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just curious when you're talking to your friends. How do you describe me

377
00:39:46.650 --> 00:40:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, pulling light hearted and if they don't dip into defensiveness, like, well, why are you asking, you know, if it gets uncomfortable. You just back off. But if it's playful and it's received it might be an interesting thing, because maybe she'll take a moment and pause

378
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.040
Bethany Shadid: Think about it.

379
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about it.

380
00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.380
Bethany Shadid: That would be

381
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're the you're the audience. So she's got it.

382
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.790
Bethany Shadid: She's

383
00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.780
Bethany Shadid: That's what I'm worried about is that she would. What I would get out of her wouldn't be

384
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.900
Bethany Shadid: Real like she'd be saying lovely things just to

385
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That. But we have to write this is where you cut

386
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.760
Bethany Shadid: Cut the ties. I know I'm so good at it.

387
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And you accept it.

388
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So nice to be seen that way. I didn't know you thought of me that way.

389
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If you stop questioning what she's saying if you accept things just the way they are.

390
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well gosh it's nice to be thought of that way. I didn't know that. That's nice. I like that. Cool. And off you go. Right.

391
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:55.830
Bethany Shadid: That would be so different. Yeah, you see.

392
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.370
Okay.

393
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were rejecting it earlier, what you did. She'll. She'll be but you know second tier analysis, just take it and say thank you. I like that image that you have me. I didn't

394
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I don't know if it's going to be, oh, that's kind of what I thought, or I didn't know that. I don't know what it'll be but you accept it and then she stuck thinking

395
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But

396
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't know what she'll be stuck maybe good

397
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's an experiment, do it. Don't do it. It's just a thought.

398
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.670
Bethany Shadid: Same with dad. Yeah, yeah.

399
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.740
Bethany Shadid: It's very

400
00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:40.440
Bethany Shadid: Well experiment.

401
00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:59.070
Bethany Shadid: For so many reasons, not just to hear it. But would I be able to accept it without putting a spin on it. Yeah, putting that string on it. Oh, she's just saying this because blah, blah, blah. Because that's right where I go.

402
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.060
Bethany Shadid: Right. Yeah. That would be interesting.

403
00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Be prepared that she might ask you the same question.

404
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.110
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

405
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:25.050
Bethany Shadid: Actually, I've had to describe her multiple hurt. Yeah, I kind of have my

406
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.650
Bethany Shadid: I immediately thought of what I would say.

407
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:32.970
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

408
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: She's got so many outward positive things on the super on the surface that it's you can come up with.

409
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.300
Bethany Shadid: That's why it's messy. Yeah.

410
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Matheson helpful. You see, you know, you can come up with those and and you know charismatic and you can come up with all kinds of stuff.

411
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.970
Right.

412
00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.970
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I know. She looks like an angel.

413
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.430
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, yeah, that that part is easy. So

414
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.900
Bethany Shadid: But yeah, no. My parents have questioned.

415
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.670
Bethany Shadid: It kept going.

416
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.540
Bethany Shadid: To like after

417
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:25.380
Bethany Shadid: Like will be, you know, in an argument or whatever my data pipe and will be like, Are you sure this is this. What's your counselors telling you to do or

418
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:39.000
Bethany Shadid: Is this really help. Are you sure are you really getting anything out of it. What is she, or my mom if she doesn't like something that you know she's doing she, I don't know.

419
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:46.920
Bethany Shadid: Oh, it's if this is what you're getting out of counseling.

420
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is not helpful.

421
00:43:53.370 --> 00:44:00.960
Bethany Shadid: Right, exactly. How dare your counselor make you believe that we are not

422
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.810
Bethany Shadid: Just wonderful

423
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that like

424
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That you care. I think you like the work that you and I are doing. So you have your own opinion. We have someone kind of sneer at it a bit. What's that like

425
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.840
Bethany Shadid: I got pretty defensive

426
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.090
Bethany Shadid: Right away. Oh.

427
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it

428
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:32.700
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

429
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.070
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it was anger, because it's like

430
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:43.200
Bethany Shadid: How dare you, like, try to poo poo, or like

431
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.590
Bethany Shadid: Negatively

432
00:44:47.790 --> 00:45:03.570
Bethany Shadid: Impact me when I'm trying to get help. Like, don't you see like you rather me just continue on as you know what i mean i think i took it more that way when they question he like

433
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:08.580
Bethany Shadid: Oh, how dare I not be under your influence anymore.

434
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.840
Bethany Shadid: Or not be under your complete control.

435
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.930
Bethany Shadid: But

436
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:21.240
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, almost like a

437
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.310
Bethany Shadid: Like a fear from them is what I took like a

438
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.220
Bethany Shadid: Not liking.

439
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Us how

440
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.250
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, the change is not something they like

441
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to praise that for just a second. You know what that says. You just got in real time without any coaxing any prompting your parents see you changing

442
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a compliment, although it's a threat to them, but in here.

443
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a compliment, because

444
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.990
Bethany Shadid: It's true. Yeah.

445
00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not this little you know chess piece I'm moving around like usual. Usually I can make her cry. I can usually get her related to fall apart than I know I'm in control, but it when the more you stay vertical right they're seeing it.

446
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.040
Bethany Shadid: That's very interesting because

447
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.550
Bethany Shadid: What came up for me is

448
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.160
Bethany Shadid: During high school

449
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.750
Bethany Shadid: When I went to public school for the two years when

450
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:40.830
Bethany Shadid: I was home schooled and then I did public school for the junior, senior year and

451
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:57.270
Bethany Shadid: That was an especially rough time. And I think a big part of it was that I was influencing me was changing. I was more defiance and

452
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.190
Bethany Shadid: My mom.

453
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:05.820
Bethany Shadid: Would

454
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.720
Bethany Shadid: lay in bed into me for hours.

455
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:23.850
Bethany Shadid: But one of the things that really like that she would bring up was that she she would say, I don't know who you are anymore. I don't know.

456
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:41.550
Bethany Shadid: This person, but this is not my daughter, you know, anytime I would change or grow this, this would come out. I don't know who you are anymore. If I don't like this person. You're not my daughter.

457
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.860
Bethany Shadid: She would pull out all the stops to try and keep me

458
00:47:55.170 --> 00:48:03.720
Bethany Shadid: Still be in control. Like, take my car away like every, you know, anything that she could it threatened for that much.

459
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:10.410
Bethany Shadid: I didn't see it that way back then. Right. But definitely now so

460
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.380
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, very, very interesting.

461
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Last bit. Notice that it was

462
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: easier for you to come to your therapist events, don't, don't put down this person I care about and I like how I feel. I feel known heard understood with her. Notice how is easy to defend me

463
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:35.760
Bethany Shadid: But

464
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When you track it back really my analysis of that is

465
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you.

466
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's your truth. What happens in here is your truth.

467
00:48:49.350 --> 00:49:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And so in a way and I know you were out really kind of coming to my defense, but really what you're doing is for a moment you were able to get angry in defense of your truth. This is who I am. Don't Pooh, pooh it this is I'm getting real I'm really honest I'm this is this is who I am.

468
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Why I'm me when I'm in there. Don't

469
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: don't minimize it. So although is easier to do it in protection of me really underneath that it's you standing up for yourself. It's just we can cloak it with defending someone else because it it versus you saying, Hey, Mom.

470
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:28.380
Bethany Shadid: Right.

471
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really cared for in there and you know because it won't go in. Well, she won't hear it. She'll hear all of it as a threat, so

472
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You did muster some anger.

473
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:40.560
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

474
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.700
Bethany Shadid: Honestly, I will known

475
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:56.670
Bethany Shadid: That the the tiles I able to be assertive is in defense of somebody else like especially my patients.

476
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.430
Bethany Shadid: And I think it's like, I don't know, it's

477
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:06.360
Bethany Shadid: I think just learning in school. You know, as a nurse. That's our job we advocate for our patient

478
00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:16.650
Bethany Shadid: Exactly. That was how I was able to detach it once it became like I was a puddle of tears, but

479
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.950
Bethany Shadid: I was able to do that. I, I just never thought of it is

480
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:26.850
Bethany Shadid: But yeah, you're right.

481
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:30.000
Bethany Shadid: It's in defense of

482
00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:36.660
Bethany Shadid: Myself, in a way, you're going to just haven't thought of it that way, and

483
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The imagery. You've had of of your adult self taking care of the little girl defending the inner child.

484
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That where she has been misunderstood not known not believed the healing comes in making sure you you stand up for her.

485
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.340
Bethany Shadid: Right.

486
00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know, I'm, I'm getting a lot of therapy. I no one cares about me or whatever your true because really anything you say that's content, they'll just drive right over that, but you just have that deep knowing you know what you know and that's the advocacy is just led by

487
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, there they go, doing what they do but aren't I fortunate to have found someone that I can connect with

488
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

489
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: When do we want to meet again. And what's what's uh, what's your plan, what, how can I help with medication and what's coming next, what do I need to do.

490
00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:42.090
Bethany Shadid: Well I, I asked last week about going to group.
