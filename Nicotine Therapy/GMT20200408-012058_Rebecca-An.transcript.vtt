15
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.720

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:39.030
Sandra's iPhone: And they quit. They shut. They closed all the liquor stores in New Mexico as of this morning at 8am or something.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

41
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:17.760
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, it's too much. I knew a girl at Canyon Lake that was drinking like that and she she died promptly, you know, within a few years.

42
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a lot alcohol.

43
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:37.140
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, so I just don't know how to, you know, because I've been so wrong in my life. I haven't wanted to say anything about anybody else's problem.

44
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.380
Yeah.

45
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

46
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.460
Sandra's iPhone: I love him. And I don't want him to kill himself. And that's what he's doing.

47
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.230
Sandra's iPhone: But try to tell me that when I was using meth and heroin.

48
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

49
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, no, that's not happen. What are you talking about

50
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.110
Me.

51
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not gonna happen to me.

52
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right now that the liquor stores are closed.

53
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.360
Sandra's iPhone: Oh, they went and bought $600 worth of Crown Royal. Last night, so my two older boys.

54
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.790
Sandra's iPhone: But

55
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.350
Sandra's iPhone: Preston said it was only 10 handles that'll asked him 10 days.

56
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.120
Sandra's iPhone: But I'm scared after those 10 days.

57
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

58
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.760
Sandra's iPhone: I'd be in the hospital.

59
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.690
Yeah.

60
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah detoxing from alcohol. It definitely you know can cause so many problems.

61
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.750
Sandra's iPhone: Problems.

62
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.860
Sandra's iPhone: You know I'm didn't I really didn't

63
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.280
Sandra's iPhone: I mean, when they throw people in jail and you're in jail and their details from alcohol. They'll take him to the hospital. Yeah.

64
00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:03.510
Sandra's iPhone: And when you're detained from heroin. My roommate was was a heroin addict. The when I was in jail, and she was, she went through the more details from heroin. Oh my god.

65
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.020
Sandra's iPhone: But they didn't ever take her anywhere you know

66
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because, you know, the idea is, is that you won't die from detoxing from Berlin, but you could from detoxing from alcohol.

67
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so you know that's why that's the mindset, even though. However, it could cause a plethora of issues you know definitely a beauty got pre existing medical conditions for sure, you know,

68
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what's been happening. How's

69
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.600
Sandra's iPhone: This working, doing I'm doing good.

70
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

71
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:53.130
Sandra's iPhone: Good really tired afterwards, after I get off and I don't ever go see my oldest son, you know, very much. I go about once a weekend I guess because

72
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.270
Sandra's iPhone: I don't want to be around his drinking really

73
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.410
You know,

74
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.830
Sandra's iPhone: And I work with them all day so

75
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

76
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.210
Sandra's iPhone: Offer ready to come home, you know, but

77
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.870
Sandra's iPhone: I just, I don't know what I can do to help him. It's just really tough for me.

78
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.140
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, and then anything

79
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a piece of it though that says because of your history and because of your past experience you know you are definitely a good person to be able to approach him with a concern and base it off of your experience and just leave it at that. You know what I mean.

80
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you definitely don't have to go into any in depth, you know, conversation but

81
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

82
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can definitely bring it up to him with what you know some of the things that you learned in that

83
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.150
Sandra's iPhone: In

84
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:04.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That amount of alcohol. It could definitely be detrimental to his liver and you would sure hate to have anything have been, you know, to him.

85
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.880
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah.

86
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.960
You know,

87
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.910
Sandra's iPhone: I you know I asked him about his liver and he goes, oh my, you know, it's fine. My doctor, Sam. Fine.

88
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:23.280
Sandra's iPhone: And I mean, I want to go marching over there and go, Okay, let me see your, your blood work.

89
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Let me look and you know the question is

90
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much is actually came because what happens is that, you know, generally, people with alcoholism minimize their, their you

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.700
Sandra's iPhone: Know,

92
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To professional. So, you know,

93
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.910
Sandra's iPhone: So I, I know all about it, you know, but

94
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:54.180
Sandra's iPhone: Because my Preston was over here and Sean called Preston up and

95

97
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We all only bought

98
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.670

Sandra's iPhone: Yeah.

102
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:35.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a, that's a heavy weight for you to carry especially, you know, knowing be different if you didn't know you know what the outcome can be. But you do

103
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have the experience and the knowledge and the know how you know yeah and

104
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's just a just a

105
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:55.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to think about. If you make the decision to approach him. But you know, it's just about out of concern because you do know you know

106
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.920
Yeah.

107
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.050
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah.

108
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.680

Sandra's iPhone: I kindly. I kind of already have, like, last week I went in his office and I sat down and I started saying, Well, you know, we sure need you around.

110
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.210
Sandra's iPhone: And then somebody came in and he kicks me out, but

111
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.140
Sandra's iPhone: I just, I don't know what to do.

112
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

113
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a definitely a pickle, you know,

114
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.370
Yeah.

115
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Please. What about what about your husband, being able to have a conversation with them.

116
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.640
Sandra's iPhone: Know,

117
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you like, no, no.

118
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:53.640
Sandra's iPhone: No, that wouldn't work. You know he he just pretty much tells us. I'm a grown man. And that's what I like to do and I have money now and that's what I'm gonna do.

119
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

120
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:57.930
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah.

121
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.310
All right.

122
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that that that's, you know, yes you know definitely is option, you know, there's nothing we can do.

123
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:19.770
Sandra's iPhone: But yeah, he says he wants to quit and see he's on Suboxone and he used to be on to eight a day and then he started getting

124
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.710
Sandra's iPhone: Off Suboxone and then that's when he started drinking more

125
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:31.680
Sandra's iPhone: And so I've told him already. I said, Well, you know, probably the reason you're drinking more is because you went down on your Suboxone

126
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:39.540
Sandra's iPhone: You know, I just don't want to be on that data. You know, I don't want to be on anything and

127
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.780
Sandra's iPhone: I want to quit alcohol and

128
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:51.810
Sandra's iPhone: I told him, I said, you know, it might be wise, just to go back on more Suboxone so you don't drink as much

129
00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:09.690
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, and it wouldn't be near as bad if it didn't involve my six year old grandson, and then today. There's a one of his coworker. See, he is part owner of a bank to. And so one of his co workers is going to donate her for eggs to them.

130
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:20.040
Sandra's iPhone: So they can have more kids and having more kids. I don't know why he's drinking like that, you know, cuz I don't

131
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.250
Sandra's iPhone: Drink is when they everything gets really good. That's one of the drink.

132
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.400
Sandra's iPhone: John's had more experience with alcoholics than me, I guess.

133
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.380
Sandra's iPhone: He was

134
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.630
That was an alcoholic.

135
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.780
Sandra's iPhone: And now in a dad.

136
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so, yeah. He does. He has good experience.

137
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

138
00:11:51.870 --> 00:12:03.900
Sandra's iPhone: Alcohol is the worst drug ever. And then after they said that last night I went over here to Walgreens. And I stand in line. And there is this guy in front of me with these three big candles of vodka.

139
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.450
Sandra's iPhone: And I looked at him and I go, Well, I'm sure glad I ain't no alcoholic.

140
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.480
Sandra's iPhone: I probably

141
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.230
Sandra's iPhone: Thought at that moment.

142
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I couldn't. What do you say,

143
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.420
Sandra's iPhone: Like releasing this said that

144
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:31.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, well, how long are the liquor store is going to be closed in definitely or

145
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.720
Sandra's iPhone: Till the end of the month.

146
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.230
Sandra's iPhone: At this point, Lord.

147
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:53.730
Sandra's iPhone: I know that we live it hundred miles from El Paso. So, I mean, if you're if I I used to go down to El Paso to get method that at and I would go every morning before work and I had to be at work at nine.

148
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I

149
00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.690

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:23.100
Sandra's iPhone: Maybe I'll be able to do it this time. Really try, but it's really hard because I work with two people that are chain smokers and I'm the only one on there with them, you know, it's me. And then, though, and what are the only ones that smoke because we're there all

Sandra's iPhone: And she comes in when she feels like it. She don't have any kind of set schedule.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.190
Sandra's iPhone: So,

375
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy.

376
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:29.700
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, I've had a little chip on my shoulder about it. So she's supposed to be my boss but i i send her or, you know, pictures of the work at work.

377
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.030
Sandra's iPhone: And then she tells me I'm on my way and

378
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:44.730
Sandra's iPhone: But if I don't tell her, like, can you be here by 1030 or 11 or whenever you know I don't ask her to come before 1030

379
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.010
Sandra's iPhone: And

380
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.440
Sandra's iPhone: It's, I don't know.

381
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.510
Sandra's iPhone: I guess I have to put up with it right now because of the corona IRS, but

382
00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:03.870
Sandra's iPhone: I don't know. I think that people shouldn't take advantage of other people. If she's only working halftime she should only be getting paid halftime

383
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's true.

384
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.160

386
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:15.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did she bring to the table that's more exceptional you know than what anybody else does.

387
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.320
No, no.

388
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.000
Sandra's iPhone: It's nothing that I couldn't do somebody showed me, you know,

389
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:22.260
Yeah.

390
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.880
Sandra's iPhone: So I basically take all these

391
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.100
Sandra's iPhone: Except

392
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:41.430
Sandra's iPhone: I've taken over all of her duties, because she's not not over there, you know. So I do that a lot of the paperwork and all of the marketing and all of that. So,

393
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.160
Sandra's iPhone: But

394
00:30:45.570 --> 00:31:02.760
Sandra's iPhone: I can't let it bother me because I only get a resentment and I don't have one right now so I you know I'm trying to stay on top of that, by, like, and today I took a picture of the work and send it to her and she goes, oh, I'm on my way and that was like 1115

395
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, and you're aware of

396
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.890
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, he's aware of it, he got there before she did today.

397
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:24.930
Sandra's iPhone: And then he was there before she got there. And then he was there when she left. So, you know, she was there probably from I don't know 1130 or so to 320

398
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.040
Sandra's iPhone: And he was there in her

399
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.870
Sandra's iPhone: And that's usually she's there longer than him are supposed to be anyway.

400
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

401
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:44.760
Sandra's iPhone: Roman season yes coronavirus everybody's got an excuse to rip somebody off.

405
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:04.560
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, I know a lot of people are saying it painful, if I wanted to stay home. I could stay home and he wouldn't pay me though.

406
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, see,

407
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.740
Sandra's iPhone: The thing I know

408
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.680
Sandra's iPhone: If it was me doing it, he could, he wouldn't pay me. But since it's very unfair huh

409
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:17.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

410
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, and you know, there's also, I don't know if you've checked into

Sandra's iPhone: Because yeah, it's not smart. I, I always have to

475
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.270
Sandra's iPhone: Try to prove something to myself. I don't know what

476

Sandra's iPhone: That I'm stupid.

477
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or, you know, we have, we've got to try something just to see that it doesn't work before we're willing

478
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be open.

479
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:26.220

Sandra's iPhone: Line firsthand what it means when it says to recoil from a hot stove.

485
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about that you again, use that as the the

486
00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The ground and the basis for, you know, your tapering you know with Suboxone right now and you know Chris is more than willing to work with you as far as that goes, and do it in a manner that you're going to feel the least detox symptoms.

487
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:10.860
Sandra's iPhone: But
