Bethany Shadid: Today, the 12

24
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.600
Yes.

25
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright. So formally, hi.

26
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.580
Bethany Shadid: I know

27
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just really, really wanting to

28
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Really be here for you. Not sure if you're in a high stress moment or kind of chill or kind of where yeah

29
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.690
Bethany Shadid: I will. I like to tell you

30
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.550
Bethany Shadid: I

31
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:24.300
Bethany Shadid: You know, I've been feeling a little guilty because I'm a nurse and I'm not working right now, but it's been a real blessing.

32
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.520
Bethany Shadid: Um,

33
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.810
Bethany Shadid: And I've needed the time. So I've been able to, you know, let go of that.

34
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.190
Bethany Shadid: It was Mother's Day.

35
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.050
Bethany Shadid: Happy Mother's Day, by the way.

36
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

37
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.110
Bethany Shadid: And

38
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:56.760
Bethany Shadid: I had recommended that my mom and us go to my church on Sunday, they were putting on a

39
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:14.760
Bethany Shadid: A drive in service and they have my church is big, so they can do all this stuff. A smaller church can't but they have a radio station and

40
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:26.040
Bethany Shadid: So what we what the thing was is a big drive in and they had big screens up so you could see

41
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.020
Bethany Shadid: And

42
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.050
Bethany Shadid: I recommended to them that we go to that for Mother's Day.

43
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.570
Bethany Shadid: And everybody would stay in their cars, you know, for the precautions.

44
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:49.320
Bethany Shadid: And it at first they were like, no, come out to the house, you know, and I was like, anxious about that.

45
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.250
Bethany Shadid: But they ended up a green. So I think it went a lot better than it could have gone

46
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:07.560
Bethany Shadid: Got her flowers and and AWFUL BIG PART OF THE WHOLE driving thing was decorating your car.

47
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:20.970
Bethany Shadid: Oh, and whoever had like they had a contest. So if you had if you won your mom would get like a spa package or something like that. So it was, well, how to fun and

48
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:35.310
Bethany Shadid: And they even had if you put your hazard lights on somebody would come around to your car and they were selling donuts and coffee. So yeah, it made it a lot less

49
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:43.590
Bethany Shadid: Tense than it could have been, and I knew that I wasn't in a good place to just be cooped up alone with them.

50
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.340
Mm hmm.

51
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:54.630
Bethany Shadid: So, so that so it went well. And there were no issues there. Which is good and

52
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.090
Bethany Shadid: But I

53
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.270
Bethany Shadid: Have been having a lot of

54
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:16.890
Bethany Shadid: emotional ups and downs, I'm kinda like we talked about. And so I told I disclosed kind of what I'm going through with my friend Stacy.

55
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:25.590
Bethany Shadid: And told her that I felt like I needed to tell somebody because I am isolated. What is going on with me.

56
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:33.840
Bethany Shadid: And told her how I had not made the connection of the

57
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:52.290
Bethany Shadid: zoning out like falling asleep as being, you know, connected to the abuse and what my brain does or did to protect myself at that age and

58
00:12:54.150 --> 00:13:00.150
Bethany Shadid: It's just really ringing really true with me. The more I think about

59
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.710
Bethany Shadid: Just situations in the past and how I've dealt with them or things that happened.

60
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.260
Bethany Shadid: And I, I almost, you know,

61
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:24.300
Bethany Shadid: I almost feel like the avoidance is so tied into it to like

62
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.240
Bethany Shadid: The mental

63
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:40.800
Bethany Shadid: Checking out either physically avoiding emotionally avoiding you know existence of what all of that is very, very true for me and

64
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:47.430
Bethany Shadid: How I do think this is an area that needs to

65
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.320
Bethany Shadid: Need to go through it.

66
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.220
Because

67
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.490
Bethany Shadid: Definitely

68
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.920
Bethany Shadid: Coming up in a big way for me.

69
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have our notes up from the previous week and

70
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: One, there's a, there's a lot of content to it, but the piece that I my eyes just caught just now we're right at the latter.

71
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: latter half of the meeting. And can I read a little bit to you to bring us back to where we left off.

72
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good. And, and then we'll take it from there. Both what you just said like there's some really big important things going on. And let's see if it's the same as what we were starting to dip into

73
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So this isn't verbatim. This is through the transcription. But they, they do a fair job or she does.

74
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It is scary.

75
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of the memories.

76
00:14:49.950 --> 00:15:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Was not the physical act of what he was doing. He was waking up in places and feeling very unsettled when it comes up, but it stays for a while.

77
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It is linked to everything.

78
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Last week I did not plan on going that route just it just came out.

79
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been told I have PTSD. I think it's triggered when it is at the forefront of what's going on. It affects me now. My sister is old enough to remember and family, no longer denying it.

80
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we might note says psycho education on attachment focus and Dr.

81
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then I probably remember what kind of said hey you're bringing this up in a sense. I'm wondering if there's still work to be done around it.

82
00:15:46.530 --> 00:16:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think you basically said, Yeah, I'm open and. Is that what I'm hearing again like you're seeing some immobilization zoning out checking out and avoidance might be associated with a very old coping mechanism of survival. It was established a long time ago.

83
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

84
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.060
Bethany Shadid: And. And to be honest, I've done a lot of thinking about how that

85
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.690
Bethany Shadid: Is present in my current life and

86
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.910
Bethany Shadid: Sleep has been such a

87
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.010
Bethany Shadid: Weird

88
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.670
Bethany Shadid: Weird relationship for me. Um,

89
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about

90
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:36.870
It.

91
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.720
Bethany Shadid: I almost like resist.

92
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.360
Bethany Shadid: Getting too much sleep. It almost feels like I'm

93
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:58.020
Bethany Shadid: Like, I feel very unproductive I come down on myself negatively. If I oversleep or

94
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.540
Bethany Shadid: Spend

95
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.580
Bethany Shadid: A lot of time sleeping. It's this shame thing.

96
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.230
Bethany Shadid: I

97
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.260
Bethany Shadid: It for as long as I can remember.

98
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:34.590
Bethany Shadid: Whenever somebody has caught me like dozing off or if I fall asleep during the movie or something. If I'm with somebody else and and they're like, Hey, you know, they wake me up. The first thing I do is lie.

99
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.680
Bethany Shadid: And I've been told. I've talked to past

100
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:49.650
Bethany Shadid: People that I've been in relationships with almost as a warning and I've told them in the past that.

101
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:58.050
Bethany Shadid: Don't take it personally, but my first reaction when I wake up.

102
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.850
Bethany Shadid: Is to deny that I was sleeping.

103
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:03.570
Hmm.

104
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.730
Bethany Shadid: Um,

105
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.860
Bethany Shadid: And

106
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.340
Bethany Shadid: I

107
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.970
Bethany Shadid: If I with some somebody like in a relationship or something. Um,

108
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:37.740
Bethany Shadid: And I, I do wake up or they wake me up that way. And I'm like, denying it. No, I was just, I just had my eyes closed, or you know whatever it was, I kind of am angry. That anger. There's anger, frustration, I'm

109
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:52.680
Bethany Shadid: And depending on you know how that situation is dealt with, I can be like really emotionally charged that day because of it.

110
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.600
Bethany Shadid: I'm

111
00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad your voice has been trembling, since you got in here. Can you tell me what what's what's happening in there, what's what's happening in your body right there.

112
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.840
Bethany Shadid: I think it's apprehension.

113
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.190
Bethany Shadid: This is stuff that I

114
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.470
Bethany Shadid: Haven't

115
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.630
Bethany Shadid: dealt with in a while and

116
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:45.450
Bethany Shadid: I guess there's some fear and anxiety. And so, as much as I'm willing to get into it. You know, I know that there's so much

117
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.510
Bethany Shadid: To it and yeah

118
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me offer some reassurance.

119
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The work I want to do with you, does not ask you to get into it.

120
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It asks you don't have to tell me the stories. That's what's so unique about the CMDR is you'll hear me invite you to remember the hard work is on you. It's true.

121
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you don't want to retell it, you don't have to. That's what's different about this, you can hold it there and your awareness.

122
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You decide the level of comfort you are with which piece of it. My Invitations are very much the same. What's the worst part of that image and then you hold it there. But you don't have to actually tell me

123
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:46.980
Bethany Shadid: And that honestly isn't a problem for me, I guess, if that makes sense.

124
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me

125
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.390
Bethany Shadid: About the specifics

126
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:57.210
Bethany Shadid: isn't necessarily the issue. Um, it's

127
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:12.000
Bethany Shadid: A level of Enos, that I feel that and distress, which I've never done the distress, you know,

128
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:19.620
Bethany Shadid: Rating stuff before while I'm doing this, it's just kind of a

129
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.770
Bethany Shadid: Okay, this is so big.

130
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.490
Bethany Shadid: I don't know what to do, right, check out

131
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.870
Bethany Shadid: Right, yeah.

132
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:34.890
Bethany Shadid: So it's knowing that it's, it, it's a trigger. Not so much going

133
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.180
Bethany Shadid: Into details.

134
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:36.960
Bethany Shadid: That is

135
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

136
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's talk a little bit about what you have that you didn't have before. Okay, so let's remind the mind.

137
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What you have that you didn't have okay so

138
00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go over some just so we can approach this with the fact that when you were doing this work before. Did you have a sense of your anchor room. Did you have a sense of an anchor room in a safe place before

139
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.370
Know,

140
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What we will make sure to do is we've anchor. I'm sorry, install this safe place more and more and more will make sure that you're weaving in as much as you need your holy trinity.

141
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, having this imagery. I'm assuming. Anyway, that this precision and having this imagery of protection nurturing and wisdom.

142
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Was not as solidified when you did this work before

143
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.580
No.

144
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.460
Bethany Shadid: Actually

145
00:22:50.730 --> 00:23:02.040
Bethany Shadid: It was primarily the opposite. It was the work that I did was talking about the specifics and ins and outs and not

146
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.170
Bethany Shadid: The what what we're what we've done.

147
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:08.940
Bethany Shadid: Five elite on

148
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.320
Bethany Shadid: Their side. Yeah.

149
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And that works. That works also they there's no one set way for some people, that is the

150
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: retelling is there's an approach. It's an exposure therapy. This is a kind of exposure therapy, but it's less intense because you're not telling it and we're including these images. And as you know, working with me.

151
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's let's keep let's keep mentioning this when you were working with this other clinician. Was she or he continuously saying check in with your body and see what level of distress, are you at, because right

152
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.150
That was

153
00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:02.160
Bethany Shadid: One of the big things I learned at that time is that I hold my breath.

154
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.050
Bethany Shadid: Without knowing it. We're not. Yeah.

155
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But we see it a little bit when we're doing iterations, you'll hear me say things like, don't forget to breathe. Keep breathing right so that's already kind of in there.

156
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But the part that I wanted. I wanted

157
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece I want to mention to you is, and you can push back. If it's not true, then say, No, that's still not there for me. Don't let

158
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Me bulldoze. Make sure your it's your, your truth. So this somatic awareness of this red core right this heat

159
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounded like it was new. This new awareness that it is a sign that something that there's a threat response going on something important is happening right now.

160
00:24:52.380 --> 00:25:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have that awareness before we okay so notice another one. Okay, so there's body awareness. We know about the HOLDING BREATH. But we have more where you have more skills.

161
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to what you do. And there's more to it. But let's let's tether back to your original concern which is

162
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I heard you say that any I'm concerned that this is so big. I'm afraid I'll check out

163
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.980
Bethany Shadid: Or yeah, just being afraid of the

164
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.690
Bethany Shadid: emotional toll. I don't like

165
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.130
Bethany Shadid: Feeling yeah

166
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:42.780
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

167
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel most of the time.

168
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.850
Bethany Shadid: Honestly, most of the time, I will distract it

169
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.370
Bethany Shadid: Okay. Um, but, you know,

170
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:12.240
Bethany Shadid: I know I have done a lot of work consciously and unconsciously to avoid

171
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.880
Bethany Shadid: You know having to

172
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.390
Bethany Shadid: Think about that stuff. But now I

173
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.310
Bethany Shadid: I know in order

174
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.380
Bethany Shadid: To work through this

175
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.250
Bethany Shadid: That's part of their

176
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But Bethany, do you know that you're still, you're still the lead, you're the lead, which means this came into conversation because your mind brought it up.

177
00:26:48.360 --> 00:27:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because I said I want you to think about, blah, blah, blah. I didn't do that. You brought it here. So you get to continue to do that if it turns out when I say something like, well, let's Bridget back to the earliest experience of that feeling.

178
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say a feeling bad or whatever the thing is. And you Bridget back to some dynamic with your mom or your dad or your sister. I'm not going to reject it and say, Don't go there. You can you still get to decide what

179
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: To content is that you want to pull into your awareness and you want to have some reprocessing around you still get to take the lead here.

180
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean you know what you and I have started a new therapy and the only thing we're going to talk about is this thing. We're going to hack away at it. That is definitely not what I want for us.

181
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way we were doing.

182
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if we were flowing with what came up

183
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.940
Bethany Shadid: Which is why you know this has to be on the table because it comes up.

184
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.420
Bethany Shadid: No.

185
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just a little feedback.

186
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, more times than not how, what's the emotion that is predominantly present in therapy when you're showing up with me. What's the predominant motion.

187
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.110
Bethany Shadid: Probably anxiety.

188
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.000
Think so.

189
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.200
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I would say it first.

190
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:39.030
Bethany Shadid: Okay, that's usually, you know, I don't feel like I leave that way. But yeah.

191
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:46.770
Bethany Shadid: It's knowing you know i'm not avoiding this or I'm not avoiding you know this is

192
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.690
Bethany Shadid: Dedicated to working on this stuff, you know,

193
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's let's take that bit of information and add it

194
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's also say that much like scheduled worry time which is a specific intervention which means you literally schedule a time to completely like obsess over all of the words she don't

195
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to leak and do it any other time throughout the day when it's intrusive and a nightmare wants to wake you up, but wants to get your ruminating you write it down.

196
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's very precise intervention. I don't know that we, you and I have ever done it together, but have with some people. So, but notice that it's dedicated

197
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's kind of neat about this is you can use that same philosophy which is we'll put

198
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you don't want to work on in the container.

199
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Lock it up. We'll put it in there. Will compartmentalize will say, not now. Now for some people. Right. The not now is not today. Satan

200
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.190
Bethany Shadid: Right.

201
00:29:53.400 --> 00:30:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It's cute. It's funny, I don't wanna I'll do it in a dedicated safe environment with one of your I'll do with them.

202
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I don't have to be hacking away at this all day, every day I can use my regular distraction techniques and I can live my life. I don't have to be processing it all the time. I can do it in a dedicated sort of contained Safeway.

203
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:25.440
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, that might. I think that's part of the apprehension, is that a lot of

204
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:35.400
Bethany Shadid: I do reflect so much during my, you know, regular day to day

205
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.810
Bethany Shadid: Life and

206
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:57.090
Bethany Shadid: It does overflow in ways where I mean I know that I'm in control, but for so much of my life. I felt out of control when it comes to my emotional

207
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.510
Bethany Shadid: States my

208
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.010
Bethany Shadid: Thoughts and feelings and

209
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.100
Bethany Shadid: Like you've been brought up like the nightmares. Like, I started having eight years ago and

210
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.560
Bethany Shadid: About stuff. And so it's that that

211
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:27.870
Bethany Shadid: I think getting into this is that feeling of being out of control, which is very hard for me that's not easy.

212
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.070
Bethany Shadid: Like I'm either in control, or I'm avoiding

213
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, those that's useful. I mean, they're in control or I've got to avoid

214
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so how can you do where you feel comfortable where you're in control.

215
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Of our dedicated time. See if we can put those two things together.

216
00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Control and and really started just dedicated in here, so I won't be asking you to process it. Your, your unconscious mind will probably do it, it'll want to settle in to a narrative.

217
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But this isn't going to last forever. This is it can be intense and you and I can back away from this, you know, I could just do dream analysis for a while. I'm not. I am really flexible.

218
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.970
Bethany Shadid: No, I appreciate it.

219
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.660
Bethany Shadid: I you know that made me think of something

220
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.110
Bethany Shadid: On the tip of my tongue.

221
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Control.

222
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.730
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I'm the

223
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.020
Bethany Shadid: Constants suffer mentality.

224
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:52.800
Bethany Shadid: Is tied into it, Rumi said this is not going to last forever.

225
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.160
Bethany Shadid: I don't think I

226
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.340
Bethany Shadid: You like naturally. Oh, this is temporary.

227
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:12.150
Bethany Shadid: I think when I go into something I'm preparing myself or

228
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:13.650
Bethany Shadid: Ever

229
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

230
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

231
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.180
Bethany Shadid: Part of that is like my chronic

232
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.850
Bethany Shadid: Pain issues.

233
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.950
Bethany Shadid: Like a

234
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.610
Bethany Shadid: I think

235
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.130
Bethany Shadid: For a while now in my life, it's kind of been like one big crisis after another.

236
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.120
Bethany Shadid: And so it's like

237
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.820
Bethany Shadid: This resolution to

238
00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.170
Bethany Shadid: Be in a constant state of

239
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.770
Bethany Shadid: self sacrifice and suffering.

240
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.350
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so I think that's tied to it as well.

241
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's an expectancy piece which is if I have been to this history of that feeling those feelings and it'll last forever. And even though you can know that rational there it is done, the less

242
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.450
Bethany Shadid: You know, I don't think I've ever been able to

243
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:40.560
Bethany Shadid: verbalize that but, you know, as we talked about, I'm like, yeah, like you said, this is only temporary. You know, like

244
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:56.730
Bethany Shadid: I never like logically thought about it that way or other struggles, and I think that that plays into the whole anxiety thing to to how I go from zero to 10

245
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.560
Bethany Shadid: And

246
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.490
Bethany Shadid: How do you say

247
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:19.350
Bethany Shadid: Not only do I go from zero to 10 but I you know I have this feeling of it was just gonna stay there.

248
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.120
Bethany Shadid: I don't know.

249
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:27.930
Bethany Shadid: Well, I'm talking to. I'm working it out in my head. I haven't really bad. Sure. I see.

250
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You. Let's do some somatic transformation part Bethany wants you to really, this might be uncomfortable and you can break with eye contact when when you want to, but I want you to actually do

251
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Have an attunement with how you're feeling right now.

252
00:35:52.050 --> 00:36:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: By also sitting with me. Now, if you were in the same space. This would come a lot more naturally because when you're sitting with someone, most of the time.

253
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We make eye contact and we maybe we'll look out the window or look at some piece of furniture that will come back here and I would have a better read of your comfort level, but I want you to see what happens.

254
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: With

255
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That trembling voice with how you're feeling right now when you are just hold on to your gaze with me. Just a little bit just sort of lets you and I connect

256
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You can look at me and I'm going to create this opportunity for eye contact for us. And I just want you to sort of be there with it, just see what comes up. Okay.

257
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just find the breath.

258
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.470
Bethany Shadid: It's very hard to look at somebody.

259
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So you noticing that it's difficult and your. Are you noticing you're wanting to find kind of

260
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of digit a little bit

261
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:12.090
Bethany Shadid: I actually did something similar with a counselor.

262
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.040
Bethany Shadid: And it was so uncomfortable.

263
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.260
Bethany Shadid: That

264
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:29.100
Bethany Shadid: I didn't understand why it was so uncomfortable, you know, like silence is hard, you know,

265
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.190
Bethany Shadid: I know that it

266
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.230
Bethany Shadid: At the time, played into like

267
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:44.220
Bethany Shadid: Just being okay with myself in the moment and

268
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.050
Bethany Shadid: Not feeling like I had to fill the space.

269
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this motion.

270
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: With me

271
00:37:52.800 --> 00:38:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this really slowly. We're going to do it together. It's this now, it's hard to see me, but you just did this thing like this, I want you to find your own, nice and slow down motion of its

272
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Being

273
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. OK. Now the way you're saying it isn't as important as this hand motion.

274
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

275
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And get get in touch with being okay

276
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: With taking it. That was a really sort of we weren't even doing. He didn't even know you did it probably

277
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Which he did being OK.

278
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice if you want to bring the hand closer to the body. Notice if you want to make any adjustments to it. You want to bring it in a little bit. Being. Okay, a little bit closer and being okay

279
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being okay

280
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring bring gaze back to me intermittently where you want to just experiment with whether you can be okay okay right hand to the chest. Here we go.

281
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on in there.

282
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A slow, you could start are not another word, and it would be just fine.

283
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be

284
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This longing to want to pat

285
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Pat and and i want I'm wanting to rock a little bit. And that's what's happening for me.

286
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.420
Bethany Shadid: It's

287
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.420
Bethany Shadid: I think

288
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.090
Bethany Shadid: It's unsettling to how

289
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.170
Bethany Shadid: Difficult it is to just be okay.

290
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.490
Yeah.

291
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have what it takes, with the presence of the Holy Trinity.

292
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To be unsettled a little longer, and to watch the unsettled together and all we're going to do is just watch

293
00:40:44.580 --> 00:41:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe settled as a number, right, and we'll use that have a number and we'll just watch it and see what happens when you when you move into contact with me intermittently just sort of swing by and see if I'm here, yeah.

294
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to the unsettled. I'm okay isn't quite settled completely

295
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're we're holding on to it, not running away.

296
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's what's happening right now. So we're we're paying attention to.

297
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Not gonna move away. We're just gonna stay here with it.

298
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.910
Bethany Shadid: Better

299
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.250
Yeah.

300
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did you notice this happen.

301
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.220
Bethany Shadid: I'm sorry.

302
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice that feeling better happened where how do you know for sure in the body, you're feeling better.

303
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.580
Bethany Shadid: With every big deep breath.

304
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:42.690
Bethany Shadid: Breathing and how

305
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice in here between us, did you have anything, any thoughts, the past by any awareness.

306
00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.670
Bethany Shadid: How difficult it was to feel it, let alone be with somebody else and feel it.

307
00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: By the song, let's just work with that piece. See if you can actually communicate that first person to me it's risky.

308
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But it'll be not talking about but she'll tell me directly. What is it like for you.

309
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: With the just telling me when it's this or just try that on

310
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:36.330
Bethany Shadid: You know, it's a real hearing of vulnerability and insecurity.

311
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.120
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

312
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me what you think. And don't don't worry about the rational irrational. Just let that first thing come up

313
00:43:50.010 --> 00:44:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the fear trying to tell you that will that I will do, or a promise I will break or something. Something's going to happen in here that vulnerability is at risk of what, tell me what you think might happen when you might or something like that.

314
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.900
Bethany Shadid: I think it's

315
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.290
Bethany Shadid: How you view.

316
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so do that again when I'm afraid you will

317
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.180
Bethany Shadid: Remember, free to you will see me the same way.

318
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.950
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

319
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.190
Bethany Shadid: The trust and the belief is hard.

320
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can tell me what you're talking about. Explain that trust and belief to me. I know it's uncomfortable. So just rock and take care of yourself.

321
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.520
Bethany Shadid: Right, don't fully understand

322
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.680
Bethany Shadid: Connection.

323
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.090
Bethany Shadid: Right.

324
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.270
Bethany Shadid: The vulnerability

325
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.770
Bethany Shadid: Is tied to not be believed.

326
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes.

327
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.730
Bethany Shadid: Sense of like

328
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:21.630
Editing

329
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.500
Bethany Shadid: Wanting to edit.

330
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.390
Bethany Shadid: Yourself.

331
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can make a little bit more contact with that and to see if you can look at me.

332
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And feel that truth. Let's see if you can hold on and nurture and keep safe protect the self that vulnerability. Just make sure it's in that that imagery. You did that beautiful drawing and just have it there being held by Jesus just held that vulnerability just

333
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect love

334
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.370
Bethany Shadid: I

335
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.650
Bethany Shadid: Have a hard time being overwhelmed with myself, let alone. Somebody else

336
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And the fear is that I

337
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe you

338
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.450
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I don't think conscious thought that, but

339
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.060
Bethany Shadid: I think

340
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.160
Bethany Shadid: I'm seeing how

341
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.220
Bethany Shadid: I

342
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.630
Bethany Shadid: edit myself to be

343
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:07.050
Bethany Shadid: palatable to others that mean I can

344
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.310
Bethany Shadid: I can even handle

345
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:14.670
Bethany Shadid: My own

346
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:21.990
Bethany Shadid: Emotions, let alone being present with somebody else and

347
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:26.220
Bethany Shadid: being vulnerable.

348
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:28.410
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

349
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So take that and see, see if you can say that directly

350
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To me not talking about it, but in the moment, if I do this with you when and see what comes out as much as you can find I can scoot back a little bit. So the contacts, not quite as intense

351
00:47:49.800 --> 00:48:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find a first person conversation directly to me not philosophizing but staying in the moment. And you can always eat slowly you can stop yourself but something transformative might happen.

352
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To do all the care get first get in touch with with the beautiful imagery of perfect safety wisdom.

353
00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And nurturing and its perfection.

354
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with its existence.

355
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.700
Bethany Shadid: I am

356
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:40.080
Bethany Shadid: So afraid that being vulnerable with you.

357
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.570
Bethany Shadid: Well,

358
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.170
Bethany Shadid: That it's too much that it

359
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.660
Bethany Shadid: will overwhelm somebody else it overwhelms me

360
00:48:59.490 --> 00:48:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

361
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You said somebody else. What about me.

362
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.380
You

363
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.430
Bethany Shadid: I was thinking of a friend.

364
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.150
Bethany Shadid: Gordon. I'm

365
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:25.950
Bethany Shadid: It's very difficult for me to be vulnerable like this with anybody else.

366
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.810
Bethany Shadid: And I'm afraid of what that

367
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.250
Bethany Shadid: Or the feeling

368
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.150
Bethany Shadid: I felt is being that way.

369
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:41.550
Bethany Shadid: Where somebody else will.

370
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.630
Bethany Shadid: Change their view of me.

371
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What about me stay here with me. We'll go into everybody else, but we've got us to try

372
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It with me.

373
00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know our language wants to go outside where it's comfortable but hang in there for

374
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.490
Bethany Shadid: Me. I didn't even realize I was doing

375
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Great.

376
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.770
Bethany Shadid: I'm afraid it will take your view that

377
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.000
Bethany Shadid: Will

378
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:21.150
Bethany Shadid: negatively impact you.

379
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It will taint my opinion of you and it will negatively impact me if you are completely vulnerable and all of that is present all of the emotion.

380
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It will negatively impact me

381
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.040
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

382
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a sense that you're protecting you. And you're protecting me and you're protecting me from you.

383
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that like

384
00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And in therapy, you're protecting me

385
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that like even now.

386
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.180
Bethany Shadid: It's saying

387
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:31.920
Bethany Shadid: It's the feeling of just being too much.

388
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.290
Bethany Shadid: Too much

389
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The sense that you believe you're too much for you and they you'll be too much for me.

390
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.480
Bethany Shadid: Like, honestly.

391
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.670
Bethany Shadid: Know you know that God is real, we want

392
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:21.840
Bethany Shadid: I can put all that in

393
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:24.720
Bethany Shadid: Can really handle it.

394
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:25.860
Okay.

395
00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So, stay, stay with this piece. Notice what your hands just did. Let's do that together, nice and slow. I want to feel what it feels like to do that. Nice and slow. And I'm thinking to myself,

396
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That God is the only entity that I can put all of that and what's what's in the arms of what's in here.

397
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:48.900
Bethany Shadid: To bring it over.

398
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you giving over what do you give

399
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.440
Bethany Shadid: Myself my

400
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.320
Bethany Shadid: Worry stress.

401
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.850
Bethany Shadid: already knows everything, you know, I don't have to

402
00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:14.400
Bethany Shadid: Explain.

403
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:17.970
Yes.

404
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, you are a human, you're on this planet.

405
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're wired.

406
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To heal into personally it's the way were made.

407
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And so just imagine, am I a part of God's plan, am I here. Can I hold is there checking out you could you could ask me something or test me and see if I could hold more than what you expected because you test me and find out and see if I'm worthy.

408
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.070
Bethany Shadid: You know, until today. I don't think I

409
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.610
Bethany Shadid: Consciously

410
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.940
Bethany Shadid: Saw any of this.

411
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:11.310
Bethany Shadid: Like

412
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.970
Bethany Shadid: I've always

413
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.390
Bethany Shadid: Been afraid to share things

414
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:25.470
Bethany Shadid: Now, so I don't know that I

415
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:32.520
Bethany Shadid: Know what I would do to test me that

416
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:35.700
Bethany Shadid: You

417
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.970
Bethany Shadid: Kind of represent not just yourself.

418
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:44.490
Bethany Shadid: But you know anybody in general and you understand more.

419
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:46.410
Bethany Shadid: But

420
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:53.310
Bethany Shadid: More so I see it relating to a friend or a relative or somebody like

421
00:54:54.390 --> 00:55:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm closer to another flesh person. I'm not like God. So I might do.

422
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: With all of your emotions. What might I do

423
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Try telling me. See if you can do it. See if you can tell me, and you could check it out. You could turn it into a question or a statement, whatever feels feels right for you.

424
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:34.860
Bethany Shadid: I'm so afraid I don't know what you would do.

425
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.510
Bethany Shadid: Okay. But in my mind.

426
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:44.160
Bethany Shadid: I was afraid to even trusting you

427
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I might

428
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:48.030
Bethany Shadid: I

429
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the worst thing I could do to you if you were to be vulnerable with me. What's the worst scariest thing.

430
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.120
Bethany Shadid: We've

431
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me that

432
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:09.720
Bethany Shadid: I'm afraid that beam right like complete true vulnerable with you.

433
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.660
Bethany Shadid: With lead to

434
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:14.370
Bethany Shadid: Less

435
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.320
Bethany Shadid: Partying.

436
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:17.670
Oh,

437
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your body doing turn

438
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing I noticed for both sort of rocking and we're doing some self soothing right so you're making contact with an actual person you're talking to me. We're not philosophizing and it can feel a lot more intense.

439
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:40.860
Bethany Shadid: Just saying that last part was just hard to say.

440
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That I might if you if you tell me the truth. If you are the truth. If you come at a full tilt, I might abandon you.

441
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.000
Yeah.

442
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:57.300
Bethany Shadid: Really

443
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:08.580
Bethany Shadid: What is the most dramatic emotional times in my life was after

444
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.510
Bethany Shadid: Doing traveling or seen with a friend.

445
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.230
Bethany Shadid: I had been

446
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:19.560
Bethany Shadid: Really open her

447
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:26.220
Bethany Shadid: We had been on the road for a year to have and I was really struggling

448
00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:34.440
Bethany Shadid: Because at the time I didn't know about my dyslexia. My add something was wrong with me.

449
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:44.550
Bethany Shadid: And my grandfather just died. Anyway, all that I really put a lot longer.

450
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.300
Bethany Shadid: And she ended up

451
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:53.070
Bethany Shadid: inviting me to lunch.

452
00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.730
Bethany Shadid: He told me that it was too much.

453
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.990
Bethany Shadid: And that she needed to

454
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:09.840
Bethany Shadid: Do her own thing.

455
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:16.680
Bethany Shadid: And so she left it moved away to Virginia

456
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.320
Bethany Shadid: And I would do a really, really.

457
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.010
Bethany Shadid: dark place.

458
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.110
Bethany Shadid: I don't get got out of it for me.

459
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you took it that you were too much, even though

460
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It was about the cheat found the job too much.

461
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.100
Bethany Shadid: Though she felt need to

462
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear anything. I didn't hear words with that's the case. So I want to watch

463
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:50.220
Yeah.

464
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.210
Bethany Shadid: I was

465
00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:00.720
Bethany Shadid: In it, we've since then talked really

466
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:11.040
Bethany Shadid: Gotten through this, but it was it was a lot easier for me to focus on her issues that it was like old at the time.

467
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.940
Bethany Shadid: And so I would

468
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.330
Bethany Shadid: Point things out to her a lot

469
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.330
Bethany Shadid: That's how it was dealing with it.

470
00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:30.150
Bethany Shadid: But at the end, she told me that her. She had talked to her sisters and stuff and

471
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:37.950
Bethany Shadid: You know, they told her that beat around to be was really toxic and that

472
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.220
Bethany Shadid: She could it

473
00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.510
Bethany Shadid: could continue that way.

474
00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:53.520
Bethany Shadid: If honestly i i get your day and you know the way that I was but

475
00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.060
Bethany Shadid: These insecurities, you know, somebody leaving it

476
01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:05.490
Bethany Shadid: I did that really

477
01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.090
Bethany Shadid: Looking back at that moment in my life. It makes a lot worse. It's why

478
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.290
Bethany Shadid: It was so difficult for me.

479
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: This is we don't have enough time in this session to go into what you just said about

480
01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That part

481
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Because here's what I've just heard you were behaving as if you were your dad telling other people how to live their life.

482
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And someone else could call it toxic and you're coming away with this thinking that was you

483
01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That wasn't you.

484
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That was you. Dealing that was you hustling. It was not authentic.

485
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Rejected the very thing that you find toxic you do to your mother and father happened just they just haven't found their way

486
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It is it's toxic to you to be around someone who only is looking at the deficit in whatever your plan is or action or anything. It is toxic.

487
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.060
Bethany Shadid: Remember, yeah.

488
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: She picked up on that that wasn't you. Anyway, that was a game, you were running an old it's your dad that once your dad's game and it is too much. Some of it. If someone else you want to know my advice. You're gonna go for it because I'm not going to dish it out.

489
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't like it.

490
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.760
Bethany Shadid: He didn't

491
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it, but that wasn't you is that you are you this first. Are you a know it all. You really know the best advice for everyone is that you

492
01:01:59.010 --> 01:01:59.460
Know,

493
01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What it felt good.

494
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To be in control. You know how her life is going to go. Meanwhile inside

495
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Chaos Harding and sorrow.

496
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You can avoid that while controlling her whatever lots of different pop psychology ways to come at this, but that wasn't you.

497
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't reject you.

498
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:51.600
Bethany Shadid: But I think, yeah, no, I do because we're still good friends to this day. And I'm like, she knows. And I know that that was a very difficult time in my life. But I don't think I ever

499
01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:57.630
Bethany Shadid: connected it to be like my dad before

500
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:15.150
Bethany Shadid: But yeah, I think the fear of losing or being rejected because of being yourself or believing that that's what was happening was so difficult.

501
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And

502
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

503
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life. It's the theme of our discussion which has to do with you won't be believed, you need to be understood you you want this validation and you have had

504
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: A terribly invalidating environment and not only developmentally but when you told that you had this happen. You weren't believed

505
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now it's this constant. Now it's just going to be the emotional part which is I might saw them cry inside and cry and and it'll be too much, maybe for going to be or something. It won't be and

506
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to know that it won't be too much for you either

507
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the bigger piece I can hold it. I can hold it.

508
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to say to you, oh you is just, it's too much. It's it won't happen.

509
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:17.370
I

510
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Knew the piece about you being able to know that you can dip in

511
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it won't last forever, that you can dip into the sorrow and you can come out, because in here. We can have those reminders of do we want to use the container. Let's do some work in in in the anchor room. Let's weave in some positive imagery

512
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got each other's back here and I'm going to say Hat Hey, what's that number. If you tell me you're at 90 we're going to stop.

513
01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to just spend time reconnecting

514
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't an all or nothing. It's not just control avoidance. It's not just your the client and I'm the therapist, and I know better. Nope. You do know you know when it's too much and you're going to tell me, I'll say

515
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm starting to space out I didn't hear the last couple works. You said when

516
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I just missed out

517
01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you'll tell me

518
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I might catch it. I might say you just because your face does do this you'll drift off a little bit, and then maybe maybe that'll more sign, you'll say, you know what, when you do that, I noticed

519
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm starting to space out I'm leaving a little bit that could be our sign and then I'm informed and then I can be more helpful.

520
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:47.430
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, yeah. Okay, girls like a baby does

521
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:48.960
Yeah.

522
01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:51.900
Bethany Shadid: To

523
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.610
Bethany Shadid: Stop the stimulus, they turn real quick and

524
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take these last couple minutes. My next point isn't here yet. But I want to just take whatever is left over that you don't want to process this week. Don't want to, let's put it in the container and whatever you want some distance from

525
01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's put it on that.

526
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But distancing metaphor and lets you and I stay stay on the shoreline stay grounded with the Holy Trinity. Let's say they're

527
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.470
Bethany Shadid: Willing to turn

528
01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A lantern. That's it. I felt manner.

529
01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To get in touch with that imagery of being there, being cradled right in that, that felt sense

530
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Of unconditional love safety nurturing and wisdom being held in

531
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That perfect

532
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Experience of love nurturing safety wisdom.

533
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling it on your skin, even those rays of light coming through.

534
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want some distance from what you want to put in that lantern and having it sort of float away.

535
01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:30.900
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

536
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.200
Bethany Shadid: Put this piece of my frame.

537
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

538
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:41.490
Bethany Shadid: That's it wasn't exactly what I thought it was

539
01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's name that let's put even more concrete.

540
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like I'm going to say some words and you give it a better label like

541
01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm putting in the fraud, the phony

542
01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The projection

543
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The compensation, the insecurity, the control freak right people pleaser. The six or the rescue or the hero. I'm going to put that in the Lancers, so those are one of yours words. What do you want to put on your let's give it a name and say goodbye.

544
01:08:18.150 --> 01:08:19.260
Bethany Shadid: Where to put the

545
01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.850
Bethany Shadid: Miss interpretation.

546
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

547
01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:27.540
So,

548
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:31.500
Bethany Shadid: Torture.

549
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:37.170
Just

550
01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving away my client just got here. So, but I but don't go anywhere.

551
01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be gentle. Be gentle

552
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: We humans are not quite like that we're not an on and off switch.

553
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of get into

554
01:08:54.330 --> 01:09:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How you want to leave this session and still have it be a gentle closure, even though

555
01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't in there, isn't this extra time. You did, you did so much today.

556
01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We did so much so honor that. Just get in touch with that imagery and just sort of right

557
01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpretation.

558
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the other word you used,

559
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:24.420
Bethany Shadid: torture myself so
